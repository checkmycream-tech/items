            <li>It does smell good.</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>anyway it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>This is really good in that</li>
            <li>Hair looks MATTE and with good texture.</li>
            <li>the hold lasts for comfortably 12 hours and it&#x27;s the perfect amount of shine</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not shiny at all and lets you move your hair around yet still maintains a good hold.</li>
            <li>Good hold for medium-length hair without being greasy or shiny.  </li>
            <li>and this stuff is still looking good after sleeping.</li>
            <li>I got this because it had a lot of good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All in all, a good product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>you can find a good price on it shipped.</li>
            <li>to: good hold, matte finish, almost a &amp;#34;beach hair&amp;#34; feel.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>I really loved this hair wax except that if you put a lot on it looks like you have lotion in your hair</li>
            <li>Good texture and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling grimy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly picky about my hair stuff</li>
            <li>Good job TIGI.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>but i stopped using it when my hair got longer because it just didn&#x27;t result in a good look in my opinion.</li>
            <li>, it is not at all wise to leave the wax remaining on your head while sleeping</li>
            <li>Have i mentioned it smells really good?</li>
            <li>This wax works good for shorter that needs control.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Great hold, makes yor hair look shiny/glossy in a good way</li>
            <li>Holds my relaxed hair well even in fairly windy conditions.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>This is wax is good, it doesnt have a smell, its kinda sticky but when you put it in your hair you don&#x27;t feel it, unless you put a ton.</li>
            <li>This is good stuff for almost holding any hair type.</li>
            <li>Although, not as good as this Matte Separation wax by TIGI Bed Head .  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good matte wax that holds just about any type of hair, this is it.</li>
            <li>Just buy it, save yourself the time and money of looking for a good one like I did.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>but the quality is so good.</li>
            <li>This workable wax is a fair price and does the job as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Still a good buy</li>
            <li>and I am good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not to mention the product smells good as well.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>By the end of the day you still look good.</li>
            <li>Smell is not as good as TIGI Bed Head.</li>
            <li>The Smell is great, the price is great, texture is good, and the hold is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Great hair product, works great on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>It may take a bit to figure out what the perfect amount is for you personally, but after you figure it out, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do anything incredible to my hair and has a really strong bro sorta smell to it.</li>
            <li>So my hair is very important to me lol.</li>
            <li>Hair product is great and cheaper on amazon which I love.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product after reading great reviews and seeing it was a Amazon top seller.  </li>
            <li>it does add great texture and control that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m also happy to report that I STILL love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m also happy to report that I STILL love it.</li>
            <li>This was very interesting for me.&lt;br /&gt;- Texture is between a wax, a glue, and a fiber.</li>
            <li>Its much more affordable, and works great.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with everything besides the price for its size</li>
            <li>Very satisfied to of purchased this..</li>

            <li>nice quality good smell</li>
            <li>It took a fee days to perfect, but with almost dry hair this product works best for me.  </li>
            <li>Nice to be able to get it via Amazon Prime for a great price.</li>
            <li>I tried many but this is still number 1!</li>
            <li>In all, I love this wax!</li>

            <li>If you want to have matte finish for your hair without the greasy shine that many products leave you with - BUY THIS!</li>
            <li>First week I used it every day, hoping to get used to the best way around it.</li>
            <li>holds great, and washes out easy, with no scent to speak of.  </li>
            <li>As with all Bed Head products, this one is amazing.</li>
            <li>it just looks simply amazing, without looking like a guido.</li>
            <li>It works amazingly.</li>
            <li>Product is amazing.</li>
            <li>and this stuff worked amazingly.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Stuff is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>As a college student, I was looking for something that&#x27;s great and also cheap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will be recommending this amazing product to all of my close friends and family.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It also has a great, fantastic scent.</li>
            <li>Amazing, I buy one a month.</li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice smell to it.</li>
            <li>&quot; kind of style, ironically this product has Bed Head in the name.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li>In the beginning, this had a nice, malleable texture.</li>
            <li>But if your not pulling a 24 hour shift doing God knows what, this product will work really well, and provide excellent grip with a matte finish.</li>
            <li>They just care how nice their hair looks.</li>
            <li>Its not the kind of stuff that you can run your hands through your hair with after it sets.  </li>
            <li>It is really nice to not have to worry about my hair wilting as the day progresses.  </li>
            <li>It gives your hair a nice sheen.</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t too crunchy and looks nice without being too shiny.</li>
            <li>So I read the reviews for this and liked what I seen.</li>
            <li>Also, it smells nice.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend really liked it</li>
            <li>I work it through and leave it kind of messy/</li>
            <li>Also, the smell is really nice.</li>
            <li>- but really gives an awesome hold and look.</li>
            <li>FYI, this is kind of too sticky.</li>
            <li>I still use this, in moderation, nearly every day, good product, best wax i&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li>but I would honestly recommend just using a bit of hair gel instead of this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always struggled finding any kind of hair product that A) worked and B)</li>
            <li>All of my reviews are written by me, and are my own opinions.</li>
            <li>Removing the residue from one&#x27;s hands requires anywhere between 2 to 5 minutes of work under warm water and</li>
            <li>It looks nice but no stylist dares to touch it until it the wax is washed off.</li>
            <li>It looks nice but no stylist dares to touch it until it the wax is washed off.</li>
            <li>This product is kind of misleading.</li>
            <li>My kind of wax.</li>
            <li>being said, it&#x27;s definitely a nice matte look.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll want your hair fairly damp, or you&#x27;ll never be able to work it through your hair.</li>
            <li>I use it on semi-wet hair and it holds nicely.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving it so</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>It has a nice aroma, and does well of keeping your hair up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of fro-y and frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d imagine this works best if you have straight medium length</li>
            <li>It does smell nice but literally feels like you applied glue to your hair.</li>
            <li>So it looked nice</li>
            <li>When anyone touches your hair, is the kind of feeling where their hand will get stucked inside.</li>
            <li>Easy to work with and nice finishing touches!</li>
            <li>great hold, very light texture, rinses out easily and has a nice not to girly smell to it.</li>
            <li>It holds great, has a clean matte look, and has no scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Tigi is the best to be honest, this wax is really great, and the amount lasts for so long!!</li>
            <li>Excellent quality, highly recommended</li>
            <li>Smells nice, holds hair pretty well for styling, and there is a good amount to use!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried nearly every top-rated brand of wax, and I&#x27;m convinced this stuff is the best of its kind on the market.</li>
            <li>Good strong fibrous wax</li>
            <li>Works for quick, last-minute hairstyles and ones that command more time and work.&lt;br /&gt;Weaknesses are basically nonexistent, easily the best hair product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This one just smells great, manly but mild.  </li>
            <li>Very strong hold.</li>
            <li>This is a very strong wax that will hold all day.</li>
            <li>Very easy to work with</li>
            <li>it is very easy compared to others that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>Very strong hold.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong smell....</li>
            <li>For sure my favorite hair wax!</li>
            <li>I have tried many many types and brands of wax and gels to get my hair to look the way it did with Gillette and none have worked until now!  </li>
            <li>Great Seller, product was exactly as described!</li>
            <li>awesome- looks totally natural.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a medium hold that provides a natural flow and matte texture, this is a great product!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of hair waxes and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>The hold factor is just perfect, holds all day, but still allows hair to feel soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Most popular hair care products are in the 8-9 range...</li>
            <li>Best hair product I have found so far.</li>
            <li>Three days of use and so far very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Although the metal packaging, like in the photo, would have been nice the product itself is fantastic!</li>
            <li>The smell is good - light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>By far the best I&#x27;ve used during for my shorter hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of products for my hair and this is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>This is the best paste/ wax I have used so far</li>
            <li>just good ,use comfortable</li>
            <li>By far the best &amp;#34;dirt&amp;#34; paste product I have used.</li>
            <li>This is by far THE best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used, period.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and had really good ratings.  </li>
            <li>Of course, this won&#x27;t be some kind of Cinderella magic paste that&#x27;ll fix your nappy hair or out-dated styles, but it will do well to give your hair a matte shine with a look that won&#x27;t look like you came out of an audition for Grease or The Outsiders.</li>
            <li>Quite good, pretty good smell</li>
            <li>This works wells keeps my hair where I want it and is easy to work with!</li>
            <li>WASHES EASILY off hands!</li>
            <li>The hold is great, and for $10 it&#x27;s worth a shot for most</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many pomades and gels and this wax has by far the best hold and look.</li>
            <li>I use this for work and save the good stuff for special occassions.</li>
            <li>Great product, very workable throughout the day!</li>
            <li>works great, this is not the first time I ordered</li>
            <li>First off this smells great</li>
            <li>just great really!</li>
            <li>I have very fine and longish hair, though, so the hold is probably better for guys with thicker and more wiry hair.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing because my hair is so fine</li>
            <li>and you get better results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there is a medium</li>
            <li>and I think its better for me</li>
            <li>Gets way more crusty than I thought it would.</li>
            <li>Probably my favorite hair styling product ever.</li>
            <li>better cause it doesn&#x27;t give your hair that oily or greasy look.</li>
            <li>I love the matte finish.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite texture products but wish it had a bit more shine</li>
            <li>great stuff if you dont use too much of it.</li>
            <li>Its consistency is more like clay than wax.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t seem to find anything better.</li>
            <li>As with most amazon products, I found this cheaper here than it is in retail stores.</li>
            <li>well ill try one more time, wax is great best out there, good price and style.</li>
            <li>thing I really love about this product is the smell, or rather, the lack thereof.</li>
            <li>So many hair products have an overpowering and nauseating smell.</li>
            <li>Sometimes if I want a bit more hold, I&#x27;ll add some axe paste to my hair in conjunction with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this wax.</li>
            <li>I have used many hair products including AXE.  </li>
            <li>more than wearing socks with shorts....</li>
            <li>CHEAP!  </li>
            <li>STILL have yet to find anything better.  </li>
            <li>STILL have yet to find anything better.  </li>
            <li>Love the matte finish...</li>
            <li>I was having to use twice as much (or more) product when using Mitch creams/waxes.</li>
            <li>Better price, and</li>
            <li>This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for keeping my hair back out of my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth a shot if you&#x27;re looking for a good hair product.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you my top 3 choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>sure to rub into your hair thoroughly-</li>
            <li>The price is so much better than comparable products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for a bit more texture in my hair and for it to stand up a bit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Redken Maneuver: Definitely the best one besides BedHead.</li>
            <li>One more benefit...</li>
            <li>intrinsically worthwhile pursuits&amp;#34;--Aristotle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though there are better products out there.</li>
            <li>Finally tried this stuff out and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I love this wax.</li>
            <li>This is probably best if you combine it with a hairspray because if you use enough of this to hold your hair in place, it makes your hair feel like it has glue in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to literally shampoo my hair 3 times to feel satisfied.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair up (nothing else will) and it comes in the most convenient case ever.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it.</li>
            <li>and i just ordered 3 more bottles because i am going traveling</li>
            <li>and this is my favorite wax now.</li>
            <li>If you buy it make sure it Ships from and sold by Amazon.com and not Hair Beauty Beautique.</li>
            <li>so people can&#x27;t really tell that you have product in your hair, which is great.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is one of the best hair products that I have ever used</li>
            <li>It smells like cheap cologne!</li>
            <li>Most hair products I have tried (and</li>
            <li>I love the matte finish.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d presume using more would help, but the more you use the more it tends to flake.</li>
            <li>i love this product since it looks like my hair has nothing in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>one of the best hair products I&#x27;ve ever used for that spiky look, never going back to anything else !!!!!</li>
            <li>$ will be buying more when i run out</li>
            <li>This is definitely the one of the best hair products out there.</li>
            <li>Supreme hold but still able to run my hands through my hair.  </li>
            <li>I do sometimes miss the smell of the Aveda, but otherwise this is a better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been trying many different hair waxes, but I think this is the best among the ones I have tried.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>I love this wax.</li>
            <li>one is my favorite along with Bumble and Bumble Sumotech (which is almost $30 for</li>
            <li>We both love the way it makes the hair look.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I often look for more than strictly performance.</li>
            <li>I used to love this product.</li>
            <li>I have used many different glues and waxes before, but this is the best on the market, period.</li>
            <li>you can get the style you love no problem.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I am ordering a couple more soon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many waxes throughout my years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best wax and the only product that can manage my hair.</li>
            <li>Just ok, very sticky without great hold</li>
            <li>Great product that really delivers what it should.</li>
            <li>It also makes my wave more curly.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to rub in or will leave a greyish color.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for years and my container just ran out (it lasted more than a year) .</li>
            <li>But I think that TIGI Bed Head Separation Wax works better for what I use it for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it throughout my hair to just give it some more volume and hold.</li>
            <li>TIGI made this with a pop top that also can screw off.</li>
            <li>TIGI made this with a pop top that also can screw off.</li>
            <li>His hair can be styled when dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to get more out of him, but that&#x27;s all hr would tell me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>better he said because it is more moldable.</li>
            <li>I can find better quality even at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>This is the definitely the best wax I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Strong hold, lasts forever, Matte Finish, Appropriately priced.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used many.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this Matte Separation Wax.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the feel of this wax.</li>
            <li>Works great, don&#x27;t use to much water and you won&#x27;t get the shiny glossy finish.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Better</li>
            <li>Then most of matte hair wax  ...  you can figure out what ever you want  to your  Hair</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>: I just ordered 2 more from Amazon.</li>
            <li>For years, my family and I have been looking for hair product that didn&#x27;t leave flaky residue and to be able to withstand the elements that the world can throw at us.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off buying a can of Carnauba car wax and use it instead.</li>
            <li>better than the stuff my hair stylist uses</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m highly satisfied with the look I get after putting this on in the mornings.  </li>
            <li>Possibly one of the best hair products available.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I do not need to use more than a pea size each morning.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>If anyone has any questions for me feel free to ask!</li>
            <li>this is not only the best but also some of the cheapest product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>My husband has tried lots of different hair products and thinks this is the best.</li>
            <li>Let me preface this by saying I LOVE this product (as do many others).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d relegated myself to the fact that I would never be able to find something that would work for me.&lt;br /&gt;...</li>
            <li>Granted, the wax smells better than Elmer&#x27;s glue but the adhesive properties are still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, this product is more drama than I could ever want.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, this product is more drama than I could ever want.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Good fresh scent</li>
            <li>I use more to get it under control.</li>
            <li>I guess you could counter that with more product in your hair</li>
            <li>Better then crew.</li>
            <li>your hair can be restyled throughout the day without adding more, which is amazing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>It does make it so my hair has more volume, and it doesn&#x27;t feel waxy or shiny.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure to rub the product between your hands before applying it to your hair - this will help make sure it&#x27;s evenly applied.</li>
            <li>The stubbornness, coupled with the humidity of a tropical climate means that most products don&#x27;t work in my hair to do what I want with all day.</li>
            <li>a user of Sumotech, this is a more affordable subsitute.</li>
            <li>My favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>Love the smell</li>
            <li>Love the matte finish on my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>But I believe it is still a very well-made product and would work great otherwise, so that&#x27;s why I gave it three stars.</li>
            <li>This works better than any of the others for us.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just an okay product.</li>
            <li>It is okay-</li>
            <li>3rd can of this wax, great stuff!</li>
            <li>Absolutely Fantastic!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite.</li>
            <li>the feeling was so much better that this one.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this one.</li>
            <li>Love this hair wax.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- Smells OK</li>
            <li>This stuff is the best for that I have come across, definitely give it a try!</li>
            <li>The product is very easy to apply and just as easily washed out.</li>
            <li>Washes off easy, very easy</li>
            <li>Strong, washes off easily when shampooing, nice scent.</li>
            <li>It spreads easy, smells nice, washes out easily, and holds all day.</li>
            <li>It holds very well and wetting your hair first makes it work wonderfully.</li>
            <li>If you want to have a nice clean look, you can do that.</li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;d recommend finding that perfect amount of hair moisture before applying, otherwise it feels very thick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great matte look with decent hold.</li>
            <li>Bottom line is, this is a great product for the high hold, matte look.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>My hair looks great even in high humidity</li>
            <li>My hair looks great even in high humidity</li>
            <li>/&gt;Creates a great dry texture look and smells good.</li>
            <li>You can shape your hair very easily and you will very rarely have to worry about your hairstyle</li>
            <li>So I am used to a wax that is very smooth and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This is pretty good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s matte, but not too matte and it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty good too.</li>
            <li>Pretty good product.</li>
            <li>This product worked pretty good at maintaining the look on my hair.</li>
            <li>Just an overall amazing product!!</li>
            <li>Love it when it is this easy</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t been able to easily achieve it.  </li>
            <li>Tigis wax also smells decent too, not the best in that catagory, but good enough.</li>
            <li>Best to use after your hair is washed and completely dry.</li>
            <li>I do need to adjust my hair every so often with this product, as it is not a &amp;#34;apply-and-done&amp;#34; product like a lot of strong hold pomades are, but as the name suggest more &amp;#34;workable&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li>I found the best application was when my hair was dry.</li>
            <li>Best to put this on once the hair is relatively dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite good, but not as good as American Crew Fibre.</li>
            <li>Hold is very good for short hair.  </li>
            <li>Overall a very good product.</li>
            <li>This has to be the most important.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried most of them available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks great, but she mentions ... &amp;#34;do not go anywhere near it&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair looks great, but she mentions ... &amp;#34;do not go anywhere near it&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product that lets you have that natural look without looking like a grease head.</li>
            <li>It is good Wax to keep my  hair hold whole day.</li>
            <li>very well looking good..</li>
            <li>To be fair, though, this product is still much easier to wash out than the clay-ish products like Grunge Mat or Molding Clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use very much, and it will hold all day, provide some good texture and separation, and washes out clean.</li>
            <li>I have tried about 5 other products and this one works the best.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still trying to get use to this Bed Head stuff though by using a little more water and hoping for the best.  </li>
            <li>I hugged my female friend and she smelled my hair a good 3 times!</li>
            <li>And it washes out easy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The consistency is kind of like a pomade, but it is very sticky and softer than most wax I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It does come out rather easily in the shower with or without shampoo.</li>
            <li>Washes out easily.</li>
            <li>Not greasy, easy to wash out.</li>
            <li>The gel is easy to apply, easy to wash out and easy to wash off your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul</li>
            <li>This wax is lightweight and easily pliable after working it a bit in your hands.</li>
            <li>Washes off easily.</li>
            <li>It holds well and is easy to restyle.</li>
            <li>Works for my hair type, I think its easy to work with</li>
            <li>Matte finish and allows you to clump and twist easily.</li>
            <li>comes off easily in the shower with shampoo</li>
            <li>It allowed me to get the style I wanted, easily, without looking &amp;#34;overdone&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Holds it in place, and I can easily readjust throughout the day if it starts to fall, and does it all with the matte finish</li>
            <li>Washes fairly easily.  </li>
            <li>Holds well and washes out easily.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t flake up, and holds all day easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to put in and easy to wash out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it a 4.5 because it worked absolutely amazing giving a strong hold with a matt&amp;eacute; finish however it wasn&#x27;t able to hold longer hair very well.</li>
            <li>The product also comes out easily.</li>
            <li>easy is it to work into the hair?  </li>
            <li>it wash out easily?</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to work into the hair.  </li>
            <li>Works well, easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t smell foofie.  </li>
            <li>It also rinses out easily.  </li>
            <li>Washes out easy and is easy to mold once applied.</li>
            <li>Washes out easily.  </li>
            <li>Allows you to easily manage hair</li>
            <li>It holds strong, and has the matte finish that I want.</li>
            <li>I need something with strong hold and pliability.</li>
            <li>Which has a strong hold like that</li>
            <li>Strong hold but did not wash out with just water..</li>
            <li>Switched to Got 2 Be and was too strong.</li>
            <li>It smells like a calogne smell but not too strong.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>but the scent is not too strong.</li>
            <li>The stuff is like cement and even with my strong fingers, it was a workout just to get this stuff to break apart</li>
            <li>and well about the hold, its strong as rock...</li>
            <li>So strong, it will pull your hair out.  </li>
            <li>doesnt style too well, not too strong</li>
            <li>, the hold is strong and doesn&#x27;t sweat out, and it is matte, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li>So I need something that is strong to keep it in pace.</li>
            <li>Has really strong hold for longer hair.</li>
            <li>But smells quite strong</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering or too strong</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good matte style product with high hold.</li>
            <li>The Matte Separation Wax has great hold, once it dries your hair will stay there all day, and it has barely any shine to it at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly more pliable and &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; from what I would expect from a true wax.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is not bad, but I&#x27;ve smelled better.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not bad, considering what women spend on their hair :)rrible to wash off.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not bad, considering what women spend on their hair :)</li>
            <li>Hands down best wax I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>This is the best hair product I have ever used hands down.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best product out there.</li>
            <li>a hair stylist suggested this, and it&#x27;s hands down the best one I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>It provides all day hold and has a nice clean, fresh smell.</li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t intend on people touching your hair, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>This product works fine.</li>
            <li>and it was still fine</li>
            <li>&quot; it if it messes up throughout the day and it still holds just fine.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this helps make it thicker and holds it in place without a shine.</li>
            <li>I think the masculine scent is really pleasant, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>This has quickly become my favorite hair styling product do to</li>
            <li>Thank you to amazon for getting this out to me so quick!</li>
            <li>excellent gel that provides strong hold with little or no shine.</li>
            <li>best wax i ever had, gives me the look that i really want, doesnt leave your hear greasy or dry, feels very natural and looks great</li>
            <li>wax is great, is easy to use, lasts all day, and only costs $5.</li>
            <li>This wax works well, holds tight, texture is good all day.&lt;br /&gt;Smells good as well.</li>
            <li>but it has a very strong hold and smells pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hold isn&#x27;t very good but the texture is just what I expected.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that bothers me is that it&#x27;s riddled with chemicals, but it certainly is the best holding wax I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Good workable wax, smells great and lasts without the flakes or hard feeling.</li>
            <li>and it was a huge difference</li>
            <li>Enjoy TIGI products but was sent Bed Head B</li>
            <li>Great hold through the entire day.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great product, would buy again.</li>
            <li>This is something I really enjoy about this product.</li>
            <li>Tigi Matte Seperation Wax is almost fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Very happy with how my hair looks everyday-</li>
            <li>Low shine, great smell, not sticky.</li>
            <li>Also, it is easy to clean up in the shower or bath.</li>
            <li>This hair wax works fantastic.</li>
            <li>Lastly, this products works great when applying it to damp hair just after showering.  </li>
            <li>This wax is absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>bought this stuff thinking it would be like the cheap hair products i used to buy</li>
            <li>Overall a great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s some cheap expired muck they put together</li>
            <li>It definitely has a Matta finish, and a great smell to it.  </li>
            <li>Best to spread it on your fingertips and apply to towel dried hair.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this will have your hair looking albeit shine free, like you put gel in it.</li>
            <li>Great value for hair product relative to the Bumble and Bumble sumotech I used to purchase.</li>
            <li>, just didn&#x27;t fit how I style my hair</li>
            <li>Yeah, great product, I&#x27;ve used Layrite, Suavecito, various drugstore brands, Paul Mitchell, etc.</li>
            <li>Great for short to medium hair.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.  </li>
            <li>Great for medium to short hair lengths.</li>
            <li>Fantastic hold and</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, important note</li>
            <li>Holds okay, but again, I think it would be good for short, spiky hair.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best stuff for men with short hair.  </li>
            <li>The reason I don&#x27;t go back to this one is that it doesn&#x27;t give as must texture and hold as BedHead.&lt;br /&gt;Kendra Taffy: Smells like candy, very sticky and goupy, not the best hold</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good wax if you can stand the unbearable scent, if not, skip this completely.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work as good as Bumble &amp; Bumble&#x27;s Sumotech but definitely more affordable for daily use.</li>
            <li>It works, smells good, and looks natural in use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good stuff, it makes your hair look natural.</li>
            <li>So far, this is a good contender to replace it.</li>
            <li>I tried many products, from Paul Mitchell, to American Crew and nothing was as good as this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great product and VERY worth it.</li>
            <li>First of all, I have tried many a hair gel in an attempt to find a gel that didn&#x27;t make me look like a grease ball, washed out easily and was affordable.</li>
            <li>This is much better than what I had experienced with other products.  </li>
            <li>Matt effect, good and flexible hold for many hours, suggested for medium short hair, clean finishing.</li>
            <li>When I first applied the wax it was very light and smooth.</li>
            <li>The hold is not that great, my hair moves too easily and portions look like there&#x27;s product and portions look completely dry and move.</li>
            <li>mainly because they&#x27;re paraben-free, though I would lean more toward Star Wax since it has a nicer fragrance and holds better</li>
            <li>Most other products give decent hold, but Tigi&#x27;s Matte Separation Wax has superb hold.</li>
            <li>Makes the styling of gravity defying hairdos easy and quick, without all of the additives that can make your hair greasy or clumpy.</li>
            <li>Maybe need a little more than I used to, but it still smells great, holds great, and is definitely still matte.</li>
            <li>Maybe need a little more than I used to, but it still smells great, holds great, and is definitely still matte.</li>
            <li>very strong hold, much stronger than i was expecting.</li>
            <li>First of all, it&#x27;s not a wax, more like a pomade.</li>
            <li>This stuff works pretty well, however I wish it stayed better because I have to use a lot</li>
            <li>At first, i wasnt sure if i should order it</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m not that excited.</li>
            <li>I love this product.helping me a lot to make my hair that how l exactly want..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for about a year now and love it; does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to with no shine or grease.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually more of a bumble &amp; bumble sumotech fan, but this product works pretty well also.  </li>
            <li>at first I wasn&#x27;t really sure weather to order it or not.</li>
            <li>This is exactly how this listing works - it&#x27;s more of a lottery.</li>
            <li>but each have a unique set of pros and cons.  </li>
            <li>The best hair wax for my fine but thick hair, and I&#x27;ve literally tried them all.</li>
            <li>As for the real bed head product it is amazing if you get the real deal!!</li>
            <li>I have very fine, straight hair and this stuff</li>
            <li>I have curly and somewhat dry hair and this works great.</li>
            <li>The best thing about this product is it is the only product that offers a matte finish.  </li>
            <li>Smells clean too.</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous men&#x27;s hair products over the years and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo gets rid of it very easily, clean up is no problem.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not very knowledgeable about the whole process and difference between them all, but this has been the best thing I&#x27;ve had so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When compared to bottom-of-the-line AXE fiber, which goes on smoothly (and rubs out just as quickly), TIGI immediately works in the hair to give it volume and hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its good at what it does for the price just got more than I expected</li>
            <li>The best thing about what this product does is that, when the wind blows your hair down/left or right, with just a little help from your hand, it retains its desired styling.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your hair in a nice matte finish and it looks very natural looking.</li>
            <li>but right now I would say its not what I thought it would be!</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold is great and it harder than normal wax sold in stores for a better hold of hair, but easy to style.</li>
            <li>With this product, I get the same great control, but with a dryer more natural look, and it lasts all day!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too particular about my hair products, but this is much better than cheap grocery store stuff I was using before.  </li>
            <li>The product has a great overall texture once applied -- exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Just might not be the best if your hair is like a thick scrub brush / chia pet like mine.</li>
            <li>Be sure to spread it evenly throughout as much of your hair as you want control over and let the product do its work.</li>
            <li>Creates a nice texture and hold with a natural look.</li>
            <li>Has a good and lasting hold all throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I use about a finger full for my medium-short length hair.</li>
            <li>Good standard matte wax.</li>
            <li>Smells good but leaves the white wax look</li>
            <li>If anything, the separation wax has a mild, clean smell that was not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Depending on the amount of product you use you can achieve different look, but it always looked good for me.</li>
            <li>I can definitely see it being a good choice for others, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on thick, works best if you work it between your hands.</li>
            <li>If I accidentally use too much in my hair you can feel it, but most of the time that&#x27;s not a problem.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest this product to anyone that wants to be stylish and not look like a member of the Jersey Shore.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate this, so I don&#x27;t have to apply more.</li>
            <li>Lastly, the hold and look it gives is superior even to Crew-Fiber.</li>
            <li>and I really have to say I like this better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching and searching for a product that would leave my hair with a true matte finish with no avail for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anything longer than an inch or so, and I&#x27;d look at some of the American Crew products (Fiber would be a good place to start).</li>
            <li>Good for short to medium hair.</li>
            <li>All day hold, nice smell, soft matte finish.</li>
            <li>It did a good job holding my short to medium length hair in place.</li>
            <li>If this works for you then I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to get it because everything else it states is true.</li>
            <li>Smell is a little strong but it works great.</li>
            <li>My hair stays up for most of the day and doesn&#x27;t get messed up by wind or rain, which is important since I live in Vancouver, Canada.</li>
            <li>Finding the right hair product has taken years of trial and error, and I can finally say that I&#x27;ve settled on this remarkable product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s less waxy and more sticky, but does a good job.</li>
            <li>later).&lt;br /&gt;- decent smell, very light or non-existent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS</li>
            <li>, it is still strong as when I first applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also, it washes out pretty easily since it&#x27;s water soluble.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These hair gels are all fairly pricey with the paul Mitchell being the most of the three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tigi bed head provides a gel that really keeps your hair looking dry and clean.</li>
            <li>The price is great for such a large size--this is my go-to from now on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many hair products in the past, and this wax is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Works great and doesn&#x27;t smell like some other products.</li>
            <li>I went with this due to the great reviews and Iam not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I will use the rest of it, and once it&#x27;s in it looks great and stays amazingly, but the application is something I&#x27;m finding a tough time getting used to.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is more than strong enough to style your hair, and it does not leave your hand filled with your hair that has fallen out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice soft looking hold, but very durable, except if you ride motorcycles, cause it can&#x27;t handle that, but it&#x27;s easy to fix post-ride.</li>
            <li>Starting at the top of my head, I apply the product in circular motions making sure to spread it across my roots to the tips of my hairs.&lt;br /&gt;7)</li>
            <li>super hold for inexpensive product</li>
            <li>adds tremendous volume to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He only buys this wax because he says the others look and feel sticky or simply don&#x27;t work as best.</li>
            <li>Luckily I found &amp;#34;bed head&amp;#34; and it works like a charm for my wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>This product gives me great hold, it&#x27;s easy to apply, you don&#x27;t need much to get the job done, and it washes out with minimal effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>came quickly and as advertised</li>
            <li>I also love the top which snaps open instead of having to unscrew each time.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and does not produce any flakes.  </li>
            <li>I never review any product, but in this particular case I wish someone would have advice me better on my decision.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m trying to make my most sincere objective way of rating this product.</li>
            <li>Once you can figure out the right ratio of how much you need this product will make your hair have an awesome matte finish with some serious hold that legit lasts me all day and all night!&lt;br /&gt;I can now say that I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it, last for as long as you want to leave it, washes out super easy, hold with a great dry look, not the kind you can run your fingers through but gives you a natural dry look for appearance and durability is great!</li>
            <li>guess I can&#x27;t fault this particular product too much because I wasn&#x27;t sure what to look for with this type of product, and now I&#x27;ve learned this is not as pliable and easy to apply as I&#x27;d hoped hair wax would be.</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair which generally has a mind of its own.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products for my thick wavy hair and this one is the best so far that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;Bed Head&#x27; brand is fast becoming my favourite choice for hair care and styling products.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon, all or most of the &#x27;Bed Head&#x27; products are available much cheaper at the click of a button.&lt;br /&gt;Regarding</li>
            <li>Has good hold on my ~2.5 in hair, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>To start off, the container of this product is superb, high quality, and not too heavy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made it a habit to buy my boyfriend a new hair wax to try every time he runs out so that he can decide which is his favorite.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my new favorite styling product, for $12</li>
            <li>I apply a finger full and rub in hands, then apply to my short-length coarse hair and the pliability is amazing when I work it</li>
            <li>This product really holds well, and it is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take much to style your hair.  </li>
            <li>So it makes your hair look more natural and full.  </li>
            <li>It looses it&#x27;s hold very quick and does not have the Matte finish the REAL version</li>
            <li>really like how easy it comes off my hands when I wash them after each use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Gives a great hold, smells good on the head, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>do almost any possible hairdo, last for hours nice touch nice smell , totally matte , simple a perfect product if you like matte waxes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too hard to wash off your hands, easy to apply, smells great  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make a mess, smells great and holds the hair in place.</li>
            <li>But overall, I love this product!</li>
            <li>Not even the real product!!</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>The best part about this product is that it will last you a very long time.</li>
            <li>Its definitely better than most gels and can be used with damp or dry hair.</li>
            <li>so before using your favorite shampoo run some regular bar soap through your hair and it will remove it easily before you shampoo.</li>
            <li>I personally like this slightly more than Fiber - as the hold strong</li>
            <li>A great wax, holds tight.</li>
            <li>Turns out though, that can&#x27;t break free from his usual nice, neat style too much, so I tried the wax on my bangs &amp; I liked it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 years now with plenty compliments on my hair from guys to girls, straight to gay and of all ages.</li>
            <li>Great product of you&#x27;re looking for a strong hold, minimal shine and natural finish.</li>
            <li>I bought this wax years ago, and it worked great -- all day hold, little shine.</li>
            <li>This has great hold and little shine.</li>
            <li>I personally place more priority on the matte look, so the weaker hold compared to some greasier waxes was fine for me.</li>
            <li>You also have to get your hair the way you like it pretty quickly, because it dries quick</li>
            <li>It has a very nice texture, almost like a thick cream, and easily distributes consistantly through my hair without clumping.</li>
            <li>Light and not too &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; smelling (since I&#x27;m a woman and don&#x27;t particularly want to smell like a man!).  </li>
            <li>This stuff is more of a dry cream that has no shine and everything I was looking for, I put it on right after a shower with toweled dried hair, I use about the size of a pea and it works great!</li>
            <li>Definitely buy this product if you want something that has amazing hold and a non-greasy look.</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t as nice as it used to be, its more heavy and cream-ish than it used to be.</li>
            <li>Great one, even not as firm as I thought</li>
            <li>Works amazing on short to medium</li>
            <li>My only experience with this kind of product was Garnier Fructis Pliable Clay.  </li>
            <li>I end up with nicely defined curls that stay put for the entire day.</li>
            <li>But if you use it with wet hair you lose volume and it doesn&#x27;t look good.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite hair product to use.  </li>
            <li>It has a strong hold, but didn&#x27;t work too well for my particular style.</li>
            <li>I bet the old formulation was more in the 4-5 range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Try a final swipe over your eyebrows to give them texture/hold, as well, brushing up/away from the nose to set the direction; they&#x27;ll look nice and stay that way.</li>
            <li>I take 2 fingertips worth of product, and rub generously between my hands to heat it up and evenly distribute it.&lt;br /&gt;6)</li>
            <li>I declare it a manscaping success.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve many of these so far, and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li>and it was so worth the 20</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t too strong and it gives a clean, masculine smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also similar to the others in terms of smelling nice, packaging, quantity, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s relatively affordable, gives my hair a &amp;#34;bedhead&amp;#34; look, doesn&#x27;t look greasy and has a nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thing that set TIGI&#x27;s wax ahead of the Fiber was the softer, more natural feel that my hair head compared to Fiber.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks now and this matte wax really is worth every penny in my opinion.</li>
            <li>imagine if you have straight hair or maybe even just not having thick hair this would be absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li>If I ever have to travel to Mars or another distant location, I will be sure to take as many as the spaceship will let me carry.</li>
            <li>So far this is one of the better hair products I&#x27;ve used, and its definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>can* smell it, which is rare.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more of a malleable natural hair look-making wax.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect hair product for guys with thin hair.  </li>
            <li>then tidy up the back and run a comb through the front to keep it up.</li>
            <li>so it looks the most natural my hair has ever looked with a hair product...</li>
            <li>Worth the price</li>
            <li>They are professional and always love to help!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>hold is good and no real shine to it.</li>
            <li>is i need to use more of this than my old hair product(crew fiber) to get the hold i want.</li>
            <li>It worked nicely when my hair was short (1-3 inches)</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>this workable wax is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>This has got to be my favorite hair wax by far.</li>
            <li>Wow, so glad I took a chance on this wax.  </li>
            <li>when put through the hair (I use a finger or so&#x27;s worth after blow drying).</li>
            <li>It holds my hair up, giving it lasting volume and a soft natural texture while still providing excellent control.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This TIGI product is a nice blend of shiny and matte look, right in the middle in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It does take a bit of work to get the wax to go in all the right places, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>i use it on my hair when i put it up in a pony tail for work to tame all the fly aways and it holds for my 12hr shifts.</li>
            <li>I like my hair slicked pretty tight and this is great</li>
            <li>so i need something strong but at the same time not so strong that it&#x27;ll leave gunky crunchy residue on my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve smelled other stuff that smells REALLY good, but those kinds of hair products are made with a lot of carcinogenic ingredients.</li>
            <li>As other reviews have said this has good hold, and is truly a matte finish.</li>
            <li>Very Fast Shipping, would highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>Gives it just the right amount of shape and hold.  </li>
            <li>So my advice: find the right amount of wetness your hair needs to be at before applying this product.</li>
            <li>This one is just the right balance of pliability without shine.</li>
            <li>The girl that cuts my hair rightly chided me for using this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>then you&#x27;ve found the right product.</li>
            <li>right now.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my go to right now.</li>
            <li>I found this works well, and the price is right.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, however this product is hands down the best product I have used with my fine fine hair.</li>
            <li>yes with abit of moisture on the head it turns out to be easy to style..but lets see im gonna try out new techniques of applying it like</li>
            <li>First, I wet my hair and get a good amount of water in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>wax makes controls your hair very well, and it does an especially good job at not making your hair rock hard (even if built up in certain areas).</li>
            <li>I love this product because I use a small amount and lightly coat my hair and beard and look great all day long.  </li>
            <li>This new product is nowhere near as sticky as the original, it is more like a paste.</li>
            <li>The thing that separates this from Gatsby the most is that you need significantly less to achieve significantly more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However on my second order the product wasn&#x27;t as smooth or easy to handle as before.  </li>
            <li>While it isn&#x27;t super potent, when anyone does actually smell it, compliments follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The more you put, the more dry and down it will feel, you have to apply just the right amount to get it looking nice without killing the volume of your hair.</li>
            <li>This had a short stint in &#x27;09 and is no longer available, but man this stuff was just as good as PM&#x27;s and was only like $4.</li>
            <li>This had a short stint in &#x27;09 and is no longer available, but man this stuff was just as good as PM&#x27;s and was only like $4.</li>
            <li>The thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it feels kind of strange in your hair.</li>
            <li>This product is simply the best, it leaves your hair looking great all day and does not leave a shiny or wet look, I&#x27;ve also used it on long and short hair</li>
            <li>I have fine, light blonde hair</li>
            <li>Proper all-day hold and superior humidity resistance for this hot New York City summer.</li>
            <li>This stuff, though it feels super sticky at first, actually comes off without having to wipe most of it off with a drying towel.</li>
            <li>This stuff, though it feels super sticky at first, actually comes off without having to wipe most of it off with a drying towel.</li>
            <li>It clumps together really easily and even wet was kind of hard to work in and make it look good.</li>
            <li>It offers hold and gives some shine, but isn&#x27;t greasy and is easy to wash out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>its good, not great, but better than everything else i had tried until bed head.  </li>
            <li>This one costs less and does just as good of a job.  </li>
            <li>It does have a slight scent to it, but I&#x27;m fairly indifferent to it when I *</li>
            <li>Smells great - like its a more expensive product.</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well to give a good hold to hair, without any glossy or wet look.  </li>
            <li>- thanks very much mum!)</li>
            <li>You also don&#x27;t have to use very much.</li>
            <li>Decent price and and great hold a little waxy though</li>
            <li>I would say I have better control with the dry wax, but the Bed Head makes my hair look more natural and dryer looking.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this makes your hair look natural and feels fine running your fingers through it.&lt;br /&gt;i can adjust my hair through out</li>
            <li>The new formulation uses synthetic beeswax, and I believe there&#x27;s more &amp;#34;paraben&amp;#34; type chemicals in the new formulation.</li>
            <li>It has good hold with little grease.</li>
            <li>Other wise it takes way to long to receive and cost more.</li>
            <li>It most certainly is a great buy, especially when comparing it with others in-store, and it will last you quite a long time (I had mine for a good three and a half months).</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great product and is cheaper on amazon as Target and K mart have it for close to $20, and that is when they have it in stock because it&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li>I style it into a Nick Wooster-esque quiff, which is basically extremely short on the sides with a lot of length and disconnection on top.</li>
            <li>Great all day hold, leaves a matte finish, and my natural waves don&#x27;t reappear as soon as I step outside in the summer like they did with my old product.</li>
            <li>Before that I was using a combination of Garnier Play Style Reshapable Putty and a coat of Big Sexy Hair.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Before I used American Crew Fiber but always wanted something better.</li>
            <li>It definitely doesn&#x27;t give the hold that the TIGI gives, and looks a bit more greasy.</li>
            <li>It actually holds much much better than the strongest store bought gel.  </li>
            <li>My first wax product</li>
            <li>I did EXACTLY that</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than the Gatsby or American Crew wax products.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, you can style and restyle as needed.</li>
            <li>Mitchell is very similar but it costs about 50% more.</li>
            <li>Probably better for short hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a clay than a wax as it&#x27;s not as shiny or sliming as traditional waxes.  </li>
            <li>This container will probably last me 2 more years</li>
            <li>in the morning, after you put this onto wet hair, it looks and holds pretty well, but it still looks like there&#x27;s some kind of gel in your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to products more similar to cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has the least greasy feel, but still has great hold.</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Sumotech is a better product because it is not as sticky, but Sumotech is $30 dollars a jar, versus Bedhead which is only $10.</li>
            <li>Seems to be better mixed formula than what I buy in stores.</li>
            <li>is performing EXACTLY as advertised.</li>
            <li>Today was the first day I went to work with the wax in my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>everything held in place pretty well and only the wind in the evening was able to distort my hair temporarily, which wasn&#x27;t anything to complain about.&lt;br</li>
            <li>is the first wax I&#x27;ve tried, based on Amazon reviews, and it seems to be going well.</li>
            <li>After switching from American Crew Fiber, which I was pretty satisfied with, the first thing that I noticed was the smell--unlike AC, this doesn&#x27;t smell like glue</li>
            <li>only flaw I found was that if too much water and wax is applied, flaking may occur; however for the most part flaking was rare.</li>
            <li>Compared to American Crew Fiber, this is a bit better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very likely that it works better on guys with shorter hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, like almost all hair products, hot weather is a hair ruiner.</li>
            <li>be definitely be buying more when we run out.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;e exactly what they did with this wax.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll get nice spiked up hair without the flaky or overly wet spiky look.  </li>
            <li>A lot of the products he&#x27;s tried have been way to shinny, and this wax is exactly as described</li>
            <li>(thanks Grandpa!)  </li>
            <li>Would most likely buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- maintains the hairstyle even on hot &amp; sweaty days without creating run off from the sweat&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I am by no means a hair expert, but this is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is so much better than Crew or similar products and it lasts me about 3-4 months.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described, matte finish.</li>
            <li>I am pretty picky about getting my hair</li>
            <li>product works pretty well holding my hair in place.</li>
            <li>With the pop top I can just close it with the back of my hand.</li>
            <li>With the pop top I can just close it with the back of my hand.</li>
            <li>Pretty sticky, my grandson likes Gatsby (purple)</li>
            <li>This was one of the first products I tried when looking for a light-hold, disheveled/messy-look product, and it&#x27;s served me quite well.</li>
            <li>Distribute at&lt;br /&gt;roots first and work your way throughout your hair.</li>
            <li>I really recommend!</li>
            <li>I am almost out of my first jar and I will be ordering again soon.</li>
            <li>It lasts pretty well, and I can always re-style</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a more solid wax this is not for you.</li>
            <li>this is the first one I&#x27;ve used-</li>
            <li>When I first bought this product I thought it wasn&#x27;t what i was looking for after I tried it.</li>
            <li>;) ....</li>
            <li>I even used a competitor brand after i ran out of the first one</li>
            <li>Definitely on my list of &amp;#34;Will be buying more of.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I am a side-sleeper and it is evident as I woke up with a lob-sided mohawk after I accidentally forgot to wash out the wax from my hair.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t look like I have any product at all which is exactly what I want.</li>
            <li>Although I personally use the equivalent of a Tablespoon when styling my hair (my hair is extremely thick), I have been able to get great results with just a dime sized piece of the wax.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order more next week.</li>
            <li>The part I like the best is that my hair doesn&#x27;t look fake with the product in.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the natural look.</li>
            <li>More chances of having white spots on your hair while using fiber than while using TIGI - this happens when you do not spread the product evenly on your palm/fingers while applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>HAHA!</li>
            <li>Pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the hold consistent?</li>
            <li>If you want more of a shine/wet-look, then go back to the 80s.</li>
            <li>Be aware.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even seen smaller containers of this wax selling for more than $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Highly highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>and this was the first product his stylist recommended.</li>
            <li>, it does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>This is really good hair product for a dried look - not shiny which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It works on damp or dry hair, but i think it looks best styled when hair is towel-dried, a little damp.</li>
            <li>I loved that it showed the true color of my hair dye (super dark blue &amp;#34;Blue Muse&amp;#34; by Vidal Sessions).</li>
            <li>Clearly, I need a very powerful hair product to keep my hair up.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s a good thing), and I think for the price they are both good products, comparable to AC fiber, and they both blow AXE away (impossible to wash away.. feel like they are on my hand</li>
            <li>Have tried American Crew Fiber and a number of other products, and for all-in-one, this is the best so far.</li>
            <li>, sometimes I use a bit of fine mist hairspray to hold it into place a little more.</li>
            <li>Good wax that isn&#x27;t too greasy and stiff.</li>
            <li>Super strong hold, lasts all day, and much stronger than American Crew Fiber.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for a good matte wax that will make hair appear natural.</li>
            <li>This wax gave me a nice hold with out the greasiness of other waxes.</li>
            <li>I chose this product based on other reviews, I can say I really liked it.</li>
            <li>Works great on my long, thin hair, giving me the ability to pull of a nice comb over look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, well as easy as any other wax, and doesn&#x27;t require much.</li>
            <li>It actually works pretty well, has pretty strong hold, and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>This hair wax has been my favorite so far, it makes my hair look natural and still provides an all day hold for work.</li>
            <li>The reviews helped so much to make this a success-- don&#x27;t use too much, hair shld be damp.</li>
            <li>The American Crew Fiber is good, but it is so greasy it takes multiple washes to get out of your hair.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m going for a straight more slicked back look</li>
            <li>The hold is mediocre, can&#x27;t understand how this has so many good reviews.</li>
            <li>When i got this i was kind of skeptical about it, but after only my first day using it, it was great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strong hold that lasts all day without being stiff and you just have to make sure you don&#x27;t use too much so your hair won&#x27;t be too sticky.  </li>
            <li>The hold is pretty strong for short to short/medium hair.  </li>
            <li>I love how it makes my hair look, and how long the hold lasts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to control my hair all day long, all without a grease look to it.</li>
            <li>I put it in my hair in the morning and it pretty much holds all day, even in wind</li>
            <li>First off i will say it was much cheaper to buy here.</li>
            <li>Since I bought my first container they have changed the scent (which I don&#x27;t like as much now) and also the texture.</li>
            <li>Exactly the one I bought from the hair salon but so much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>No matter how much you rubbed it in your palms first, it always stayed rubbery.</li>
            <li>I have the gentleman&#x27;s cut with really long bangs and it was able to hold it all day</li>
            <li>Nice smooth, subtle scent.</li>
            <li>It is pretty hard washing it off your hair and hands since it sticks so good.</li>
            <li>Make sure that you work this product into dry hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff holds pretty much the whole day.</li>
            <li>When dry you can run your fingers through your&lt;br /&gt;hair and shape it even more.</li>
            <li>No flaky residue, easy to wash out, and revived with just simply wetting the fingers.</li>
            <li>Both times, I am handed off to an assistant who washes off the wax completely before even touching my hair with bare hands.</li>
            <li>Both times, I am handed off to an assistant who washes off the wax completely before even touching my hair with bare hands.</li>
            <li>Washes off your hands easily too, which is a big one for me.</li>
            <li>Used to use axe hair products, but they weren&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still searching for a perfect product for my thick, medium long hair.</li>
            <li>The Matte wax is the only product that I can find that provides a strong hold and is truly a Matte finish.  </li>
            <li>However, be careful when touching your hair in hot weather because it&#x27;s much easier to rub</li>
            <li>good texture, low shine, interesting (not good) smell, doesn&#x27;t hold well.</li>
            <li>He has shorter hair that is styled in a kind of mess look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very workable and easy to wash out later.</li>
            <li>I have thick dry hair, and this is the best hair wax I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>As I suspected, it works best in dry hair... at least to achieve the look I&#x27;m going for.</li>
            <li>As I suspected, it works best in dry hair... at least to achieve the look I&#x27;m going for.</li>
            <li>In fact, I would say that it works in much the same way as texturising paste, and is easily washed/rinsed</li>
            <li>you have fine hair, you definitely would NOT want to use this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through a lot and this one is one of my personal favorites.nd it was still fine</li>
            <li>My fine hair finally has some texture</li>
            <li>Demographically, I&#x27;m 20, male, with medium length fine blond hair, but a lot of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought two of these so far and have just finished my first tub (after about 6 months!)</li>
            <li>Pretty much since High School I&#x27;ve kept my head buzzed with a #1 length on clippers.</li>
            <li>Most Punjabi people have very thick hair, and mine is even thicker than most.</li>
            <li>on the hair, it is ok, but it shines a little more than American Crew Fiber and this is NOT the look I&#x27;m going for.  </li>
            <li>It smells very clean, and fresh, not sweet, fruity, or like perfume at all.</li>
            <li>Once the wax is applied there also isn&#x27;t much I can do to sculpt or style it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just hope the prices stay reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really like tgr seductive smell.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I really like this wax.</li>
            <li>The hold is really intense -</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find a straight review comparing the two products anywhere in my cursory search so, here&#x27;s a tip.</li>
            <li>Really like the product.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that it:&lt;br /&gt;* smells good&lt;br</li>
            <li>* doesn&#x27;t get really hard&lt;</li>
            <li>and knows what he wants in a hair product.  </li>
            <li>We found there weren&#x27;t many products that would hold his hair up all day without looking spikey or wet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After much research, we landed with this workable wax.</li>
            <li>Leaves glops in my hair and doesn&#x27;t style very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really torn with this hair wax.</li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t get quite as much hold</li>
            <li>I much prefer By Vilain&#x27;s wax.</li>
            <li>You need to really work the wax in your hand before applying.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really stay pliable through the day.</li>
            <li>I can really fault this product for</li>
            <li>The wax also seems to be drying out my hands a bit, not quite as much as the alcohol-containing hair gel</li>
            <li>Holds very well, without the shine.  </li>
            <li>This has replaced that product, and I&#x27;m so much happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the whole</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very matte finish, so if you want shine it may not be for you.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for shipping</li>
            <li>But it does not require a whole lot to get the hair to stand up.</li>
            <li>Really awsome product.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really like the feel on my hair</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>but it works really well.</li>
            <li>I have used a variety of waxes and pomades, but this stuff really tops them all.</li>
            <li>The wife can still run her fingers through it, but it&#x27;s much easier to shape.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s instantly ready after applying.</li>
            <li>Too much and your hair will look greasy.</li>
            <li>an wants a straight controlled look that lasts all day and night</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m not using as much wax for my hair anymore...</li>
            <li>this stuff really trains your hair.. wish it was cheaper</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t straight up spike the whole thing--</li>
            <li>Very Tacky.</li>
            <li>it seems to hold much longer than AC Fiber.</li>
            <li>but it DOES adhere better even with wet hair than AC</li>
            <li>but it DOES adhere better even with wet hair than AC</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to flake much.</li>
            <li>so it didn&#x27;t really hold much.</li>
            <li>I expected it to be better, it says matte , but in reality , it&#x27;s still a bit greasy .</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>wax is very hard.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t really the products&#x27; fault; if you want separation with a matte finish I would recommend this.</li>
            <li>Its very dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is the only hair product that my husband says works for him, it is light, not greasy, and gives his hair the hold and lift.</li>
            <li>but I really like this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still works very well and use it every day without issues</li>
            <li>The difference is the TIGI wax is a lot stickier, and stays sticky throughout the whole day, whereas the sumotech dries out and becomes soft/smooth.  </li>
            <li>thanks ..</li>
            <li>I really like this a lot.</li>
            <li>And he&#x27;s very picky.</li>
            <li>Keeps my style on hold even after hours and even after much movements.</li>
            <li>/regrowth  because it will make the hairloss look that much</li>
            <li>it is very workable once in your hair and has an all day hold&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t put product in my hair, it is bone straight, however with this product it adds volume and texture.</li>
            <li>On that note, it&#x27;s very affordable compared to others in</li>
            <li>so, I really like it</li>
            <li>Imagine you order a gallon of whole milk in a glass bottle, but you receive 3/4 of a gallon of fat-free milk in a plastic container.</li>
            <li>With this wax, you really don&#x27;t need much, and it maintains your hairs matte finish, while still keeping it in place.</li>
            <li>Product is matte if you dont use too much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t really evenly distributes into your hair.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this product.  </li>
            <li>this (and a bit of hair spray) helps him style it the way he wants.</li>
            <li>It works your hair really well.</li>
            <li>for the record, this product(along with TONS of others) is far better than American Crew Fiber.</li>
            <li>This product works incredibly well on my thick Asian hair.</li>
            <li>your natural hair suddenly just became more behaved.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different brands with the old Tigi beating out all of them in hold while not causing shine.</li>
            <li>So far he&#x27;s gone through about 8 different brands and among his favorites were J. Crew Fiber and Go247, but the BedHead is his favorite.</li>
            <li>It is subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li>It is subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li>When the wetness of your hair disappears sometime later, the last thing you may want to touch is your own scalp.</li>
            <li>This is my backup when I have trouble finding Kevin Murphy&#x27;s Night Rider (or just don&#x27;t feel like spending that kind of money at the time).</li>
            <li>I combined with pomade a few times and liked the look.</li>
            <li>it is thick but seems to wash out good.</li>
            <li>Hands down, the best product I have used over the past 20 years.</li>
            <li>There are many that claim to have a matte finish, but very few are true matte.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He has fine hair that tends to fall flat and</li>
            <li>Stick to professional barbershops or drugstores to buy this product or an authorized dealer because this stuff will do harm to your hair!!!</li>
            <li>I have short hair and this works great at holding your hair in place but not making it too stiff.  </li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s fine if you are looking for something with a little more hold and maybe a little thicker than Fiber (this also doesn&#x27;t wash out as easily as Fiber).</li>
            <li>Very natural look, good price, and long lasting hold.</li>
            <li>I also just received my first new brown container</li>
            <li>I also just received my first new brown container</li>
            <li>It allows me to create any style for my hair easily, and it lasts for all day long.</li>
            <li>Overall, I use this if I run out of my other products and have nothing else that provided as good of a hold without making my head feel like a sticky greased sculpture.</li>
            <li>Most of the other comparable products, which I didn&#x27;t like quite as much, cost me $25+.</li>
            <li>You only need to use a little bit at a time so its a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>Also, when you wash your hair, the product actually comes off very easily unlike many of the other products I mentioned above.</li>
            <li>This hair product works much better than any other product I have used.</li>
            <li>and I even tried some of their other satisfying products.</li>
            <li>I have noticed I need a bit more then other creams I have used before</li>
            <li>The texture is more matte than the other brands and doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy.</li>
            <li>It has the staple &#x27;Bed Head&#x27; scent and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue like so many other waxes on the market.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They recently changed the container design (it used to be black) but the product itself is the best I have used so far (and the first I can remember purchasing as a repeat customer in a very long time).</li>
            <li>I sometimes let my hair grow to 4+ inches, and this product still has the strength to give me consistent, matte, messy look that gets me more compliments than I probably need.</li>
            <li>much do you need to get a decent hold?  </li>
            <li>This particular product is very smelly.</li>
            <li>this re-workable wax product from the &#x27;For Men&#x27; range, I would most certainly recommend to guys who have slightly finer hair than others.</li>
            <li>This product is thicker and denser than most other products; however, unlike Fiber (with the wet sand feel), this product is still very creamy - thus it&#x27;s still easy to spread into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t very responsive to most products and tended to either become very oily when I applied enough product to actually control it.</li>
            <li>This product offers the strong hold on my stubborn Asian hair.</li>
            <li>I really like that I can use it as more of a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; if I don&#x27;t mess with my hair after its dry but can also style after it drys for a more natural look.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty long on the top (maybe 6\\&quot;) and extremely short on the sides (buzzed)</li>
            <li>so my hair normally shoots straight like a porcupine.</li>
            <li>- there&#x27;s a little plastic seal in there that you&#x27;ll be tempted to take out and throw away, because it gets in the way of the ease of access of the pop-up cap - my recommendation is to leave it in and just unscrew the whole top every time you want to use it.</li>
            <li>Think I found my new hair product!</li>
            <li>A tiny bit goes a LONG way (about the very tip of one finger will hold a full head of hear for a full day).</li>
            <li>This wax still leaves a bit of shine, but it is less greasy than most products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I bought this stuff to replace my Enjoy Dry Wax, and I like the difference.</li>
            <li>hold is much better than my previous wax, and the matte finish is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Feels a bit unnatural, but that&#x27;s a given when using wax</li>
            <li>I use this or Enjoy Dry Hair Wax depending on the style I am trying to achieve on a given day.</li>
            <li>My hair is about an inch and a half on top</li>
            <li>Less is more, you guys.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s the real stuff, except it&#x27;s nowhere near as much as they charge at salons for it.</li>
            <li>Ive been trying to post a decent review of this product and amazon doesn&#x27;t let me me post it for some reason,</li>
            <li>Decent functionality, but it smells like</li>
            <li>I have coarse hair cut short that used to do whatever the heck it pleased.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many different men&#x27;s hair waxes (comparisons below) and I always come back to this one.</li>
            <li>I found this wax to provide a decent hold.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, especially if you have thick hair like me.</li>
            <li>I can smell it on my head for a couple of hours before it starts to dissipate, which is the only redeeming part since it doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
            <li>Lastly, when you compare this to my second favorite product which is Sumotech, the pricing of the TIGI Bead Head Men Matte Separation Wax cannot be beat.</li>
            <li>Decent strength and decent price.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t shine at all, and washes out relatively easily, mainly with water and perhaps a bit of shampoo/soap.</li>
            <li>I loved Sebastian crude clay and used that product for many years until the discontinued it.</li>
            <li>Ive used tea tree and american crew products and always found i had to keep getting more out to finally get it to stay.</li>
            <li>I have never had such ease working it quickly into my hair and going.</li>
            <li>We particularly like this for our boys because they play and play but their hair will keep its style.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more &#x27;sticky&#x27; if that makes any sense as it is much more difficult to rub on your hands before applying to your hair.  </li>
            <li>I wear my hair in the classic side part now with about 4&amp;#34; of length.</li>
            <li>This does a decent job.</li>
            <li>This stuff was decent.</li>
            <li>Overall it is okay product for the price, but I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily</li>
            <li>The American Crew is much less sticky right off the bat, it comes out feeling more like a modern day wax/pomade than a hardcore clay.</li>
            <li>(Thanks to an aunt that worked at Sally&#x27;s Beauty and a sister who&#x27;s a professional stylist/esthetician!)</li>
            <li>Strong hold, adds volume, washes out easily and doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp like hair spray and other gels can!</li>
            <li>I have tight fade on the sides of my hair and about ~3in on top.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It is highly moldable throughout the day and does not smell at all.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>high quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this because I ran out of some really high quality hair sculting gel/wax from Brazil I had been using for a while.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>all the time I highly wreak amend this to anyone that has curly hair</li>
            <li>Highly recommend buying from Amazon because this will cost about $17 at a target/walmart.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Why all the high ratings?  </li>
            <li>i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This wax is great - doesn&#x27;t leave my hair too greasy, and I really only need a VERY small amount to get my hair in a workable shape.</li>
            <li>it flat, always shine free and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>I have short hair, so l use about half a fingertip&#x27;s amount of product for my hair, but l don&#x27;t think anyone would need more than one fingertip&#x27;s worth per session.</li>
            <li>It is very firm, dry wax, but works great, holds all day and doesn&#x27;t flake off.</li>
            <li>Love how it holds, and I can change my hair throughout the day with just a little water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason for 4 stars and not 5, is that I feel this wax could and should have a little bit more hold.</li>
            <li>a little water in hands to make more playable.</li>
            <li>The first day using this was fine and after a few days of using it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to easily style my hair with the amount of hold i want without being stiff or wet looking.  </li>
            <li>Best to work in when hair is a little wet, or to wet hands a bit to work in.</li>
            <li>, it is very thick at first, so you have to rub it in your hands first before putting it in your hair, the more you rub it</li>
            <li>I have yet to notice a huge difference in the two products, and I don&#x27;t think my usage is as sophisticated or specific enough to justify buying the TIGI versus the Joico (especially since I&#x27;m low on cash!)</li>
            <li>I pulled out an old container of this stuff and noticed -- this company once used REAL beeswax, and it has now been replaced with SYNTHETIC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, this great product is now completely mediocre.</li>
            <li>My hair is very shiny naturally and this does not give me the matte look.</li>
            <li>A great product for men who don&#x27;t like American Crew or Axe and want to look great without any hassle or terrible scent.</li>
            <li>Great quality product that isn&#x27;t overly expensive.</li>
            <li>Probably because most people using this stuff don&#x27;t know and don&#x27;t care about lathering your head everyday with carcinogenic and endocrine disrupting chemicals.</li>
            <li>I also feel this wax works better on short to medium length hair as opposed to long.</li>
            <li>Taking price into consideration and overall quality, Bedhead wins.</li>
            <li>Better hold than the Crew Pomades and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hold---8/10--- I last the whole day and your able to just wet it and reshape it.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because I used it everyday, but AC Fiber had a plastic smell to it that I didn&#x27;t love.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because I used it everyday, but AC Fiber had a plastic smell to it that I didn&#x27;t love.</li>
            <li>He is Asian, and his hair is about 3 inches long on top.</li>
            <li>After using this and a few hair products, this item seems to give better results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything from American Crew, and for my hair this product beats all those.</li>
            <li>Still, both of these commercial brands have chemicals and I&#x27;ll personally be looking to move onto a more natural product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also worth noting that I only use the product (as I&#x27;ve done with others); meaning I don&#x27;t use hair spray, or a blow drier, or whatever,</li>
            <li>As for my style, I normally have a Zayn Malik type haircut or a combover type-thing; I dont know what to call it.</li>
            <li>I think this is good for short hair but not too long spkies like muhawk or long fuhawk</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell that&#x27;s very subtle.  </li>
            <li>It is too thick and just isn&#x27;t effective at all.</li>
            <li>Easy to work with, though it can clump together a little if it&#x27;s not warm enough; I always make sure to get it warm enough before applying.</li>
            <li>half the size).&lt;br /&gt;The smell on this is very mild but it works very well in my hair and holds it all day in a very natural looking way.</li>
            <li>Is not hard to blend..</li>
            <li>Not at all greasy and not hard</li>
            <li>I have smooth straight black hair.</li>
            <li>I use this probably 6 days out of the week, and if it&#x27;s anything like the AC Fiber which I used the same amount of, then it will last me about 3-4 months easily.</li>
            <li>I use this probably 6 days out of the week, and if it&#x27;s anything like the AC Fiber which I used the same amount of, then it will last me about 3-4 months easily.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s sort of beach-y, works much better in dry hair, I put it in last thing before going out the door</li>
            <li>It has a nice neutral smell that doesn&#x27;t smell too artificial and not too strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different products, but this one is just the right mixture of hold and texture for me.</li>
            <li>It holds all day and when used right it doesn&#x27;t leave a white, greasy residue!</li>
            <li>Too tacky for my very straight &amp; fine hair, even in small quantities.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much, didn&#x27;t keep the hair straight and white globs would show up if a decent amount is used.</li>
            <li>My first experience with the company was when I got my hair cut professionally for the first time as a 16 year old teenage lad.</li>
            <li>Nothing but good stuff to say:  a little goes a long way, almost no smell, not greasy, strong enough to last all day without making your hair overly stiff/hard, can be easily reworked with your fingers if needed, washes out easily, never flakes, etc.  </li>
            <li>Holds my difficult fine hair in place waaayyy better than Regis styling mud or whatever.</li>
            <li>Ive been looking everywhere for this particular product for a couple months and finally found it here for a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>If you go too light, it doesn&#x27;t do anything or the hold is not consistent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s matte but it gives my hair a nice little shine (I think that&#x27;s specific to my hair color not the product).</li>
            <li>This is my new goto.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to using hair products, but it works for me.  </li>
            <li>My new hair product from this point on</li>
            <li>And maybe because this stuff is new to my routine...</li>
            <li>And maybe because this stuff is new to my routine...</li>
            <li>I think I found my new go to hair product.  </li>
            <li>I have been searching for a new hair product after my standby product was discontinued.</li>
            <li>When I ordered this item, the image on the listing was of the new formula (twisting metal lid with brown label)</li>
            <li>Not a 6 stars because the picture shows the new container design in aluminum</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very nice (not overwhelming) and unlike other waxes, this one does not leave you looking like a greaser.</li>
            <li>But if you cool it down again, it goes right back to normal!</li>
            <li>The barber jacked up my hair, so I bought this to style it more effectively and now my hair doesn&#x27;t look too bad.</li>
            <li>I have medium length, heavier hair and wanted a product light enough to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>What I particularly like is that it looks natural with no oily shine.  </li>
            <li>The cream is more sticky and thicker, which makes it harder to apply than the Tea Tree Shaping Cream, but this is not a big issue once you get used to it.</li>
            <li>This is the only hair product I have ever been able to find that doesn&#x27;t make your hair look wet and greasy and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I have pretty thick hair, and of the products I have this works the best, but you really have to water it down as the texture is extremely firm.</li>
            <li>Other products often look very shiny in your hair and it is evident that there is gel/product in your hair, but this is very discreet.</li>
            <li>To have a more direct feel on the texture difference, imagine you leaving the new version one open exposed in air for a long time, with some moisture gone, the dryer remainder feel like the old formula, tougher to apply but hold</li>
            <li>In three different occasions me and my buddies order from this link since May 2015 this year, with the first one arrived being the original formula in black can (75g), the second one being the new silver version (85g, as seen in pictures) and the most recent one being the black original version again.</li>
            <li>Very natural look.</li>
            <li>And the delivery was very fast, only that it was a restricted product and it took me a lot of time and money to get it out from the customs, no one told me about that.</li>
            <li>very little product.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts most of the day unless you&#x27;ve been scratching your head at work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Matte finish, strong hold, long lasting.</li>
            <li>Strong and long lasting hold.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good but sometimes makes hair too hard!!!</li>
            <li>It has an odd smell, but once you get used to it its fine.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t keep your hair exactly how you style it, but you hair will resiliently keep to that basic shape.  </li>
            <li>This TIGI one actually smells pretty darn</li>
            <li>It washes out 100 times better than other similar products that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>It is easier to apply, but that is a small gain compared to the many negatives.</li>
            <li>This will be the first I will purchase a second time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A dimes worth on a finger will go a long way with application.</li>
            <li>Normally, American Crew&#x27;s product left my hair a bit harder than I liked, but eventually softened up.</li>
            <li>Just need to get some water in the hair before applying this stuff or you&#x27;ll look funny with white wax in the hair.</li>
            <li>My favorite as I&#x27;ve tried countless other brands as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy with pretty short hair</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted, and I plan to keep using it in the future.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny, I actually put it on at night when I got it and went to sleep with it on.</li>
            <li>It definitely holds up for many hours when applied correctly, and works well with other hair products or sprays.</li>
            <li>and if i blow hot air to melt the wax, it gives it a different look.</li>
            <li>I constantly used Fiber by American Crew but this was significantly cheaper but works twice as well.  </li>
            <li>Bought 2 of these, I have pretty regular hair</li>
            <li>So far I like the Alterna Hemp Hair Concrete</li>
            <li>This Wax is ok but can not compare with the other products mentioned above.</li>
            <li>It is the exact same wax that I&#x27;ve seen for $15+ elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I am able to use it to pull my hair back from sitting in front of my eyes to a swept back look similar to this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[</li>
            <li>The best way to use this product is to, using your index finger, pull out a small amount (the material is very thick) and spread it into both of your hands.</li>
            <li>I know this because I compared the old and new ingredient lists.</li>
            <li>I enjoy all of those products, but wanted something with a less greasy and shiny feel and look.</li>
            <li>Usually have trouble keeping my hair to stand, but this stuff works great.  </li>
            <li>I can easily achieve a messy or a neater look depending on my mood.</li>
            <li>It gives hold while still making your hair feel fresh and dry.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally shampoo much, maybe only once or twice a week, but even with shampoo</li>
            <li>I have been using almost all of the usual suspects and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>This wax certainly does that and only a small amount is needed, in most cases, to get the job done.</li>
            <li>just a little in your SLIGHTLY damp hair, and youre good to go.  </li>
            <li>I was previously using Mitchell Tea Tree gel, which i loved the smell but that gel was a little too &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; for my preferences.</li>
            <li>A big mistake I made when I first used this product was using too much and not spreading it enough.</li>
            <li>I used a much more expensive product for a long time, but I&#x27;m glad I discovered this.</li>
            <li>it gives you dry look if you applied a little and little oily look if you applied more just like Daniel Day-Lewis, love this product.</li>
            <li>Holds up my hair the whole day, and it really gives you that dry matte look.</li>
            <li>It is typically 50% more if purchased at your local retailer.</li>
            <li>It simply means less hold, and more shine.</li>
            <li>My hair is very light and soft so its hard to get it to shape and look the way I want it too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best if you keep your hair a little wet as this stuff is really dry but not too wet.</li>
            <li>The consistency will feel very sticky, but once put into your damp to dry hair (depending on how much shine you want), it comes out completely matte.</li>
            <li>When I wore it messy and kept it around 2&amp;#34; it worked fine.</li>
            <li>A little hard to manipulate but results are great and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>that I have tried Tigi&#x27;s re-workable wax, I will certainly be adding it to my top ten list of hair-care products, probably alternating it between the firm-hold gel and the &#x27;Hard To Get&#x27; texturising paste.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s definitely better products out there, but for the price I paid it&#x27;s hard to beat.</li>
            <li>but you really have to be careful how much you use.  </li>
            <li>This product is like a waxy cream rather than a clear gel.  </li>
            <li>This wax is clear and workable.</li>
            <li>I love it but is getting harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li>As well as a Redkin wax, Crew Fiber, and Paul Mitchell Clean Cut which was my previous wax.  </li>
            <li>it is not messy at all.</li>
            <li>but this stuff works just plenty well for me in giving a natural look</li>
            <li>Its very similar to crew fiber but is easier to work in and doesn&#x27;t clump as much.  </li>
            <li>This product gives you control and hold,  but feels natural.  </li>
            <li>This stuff&#x27;s reasonably priced and nothing else short of glue will do what this wax does--</li>
            <li>16 year old girls want 18 year old boys to smell.</li>
            <li>Also sometimes if you use too much it will leave your hair looking white at the ends where you applied it.</li>
            <li>In addition, it does make your hair styling look so natural.</li>
            <li>Beware not to use too much on your hair or the residue is not going to spread evenly, therefore leaving some white wax on your hair.</li>
            <li>So far its been a year</li>
            <li>hair has a natural look and holds the style even on a windy day.</li>
            <li>I would use this after blow drying my hair and it would keep it soft and natural looking all day.</li>
            <li>so far-</li>
            <li>However, after about 2 hours, if you run your hands through your hair and restyle, you can achieve a really natural look.</li>
            <li>My scalp is quite sensitive to products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>not like a soft gelly application.</li>
            <li>natural looking &amp;#34;bedhead&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The consistency of the product is now very close to the American Crew Fiber paste but with a weaker hold.</li>
            <li>Comfortable, not too messy, not too shiny.</li>
            <li>This does provide a natural look unlike a lot of those pomades, though.</li>
            <li>#34;synthetic bees wax&amp;#34; instead of the natural Bees wax it used to contain.</li>
            <li>I go to the gym early in the morning</li>
            <li>/&gt;After applying this to my hair, my hair still has volume and the natural look.  </li>
            <li>I also use it on my 8 year old boys hair.</li>
            <li>but it holds for a lot longer and still gives off a natural look.</li>
            <li>This will obviously vary depending on how much oil your head produces throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Kept it neat and professional.</li>
            <li>It does not flake and keeps my hair looking natural and in place all day.</li>
            <li>I comb the front over after and it looks as natural as you can get after using something.</li>
            <li>This stuff holds very well with just a tiny amount!</li>
            <li>works really well, though the only thing i dont like is that sometimes it makes my hair/scalp smell funky (like mildew)  </li>
            <li>Product work as advertised and it holds well and last the whole day.</li>
            <li>If at any time, you touch your hair to perhaps alter the style, or fix a mistake you did not catch earlier, your hands once again have a sticky residue that is very troublesome to get rid</li>
            <li>However, I now frequently use it for my beard (when I let it grow out).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only product out there that does the job he wants.  </li>
            <li>so I was fairly surprised.  </li>
            <li>If I use too much it will be flaky and have white specs.</li>
            <li>and it gives you that natural bed hair look where you can fix it up at your liking.</li>
            <li>natural does the hair feel throughout the day?  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like the chemical/soapy smell, but I&#x27;m scent sensitive.</li>
            <li>Buy this wax if you want something that smells absolutely fricken terrific.  </li>
            <li>Been using it for a year so far</li>
            <li>you are chemically sensitive and want a pomade for your hair, buy the TIGI Bed Head stick: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NRXYM/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o09_s00_i00</li>
            <li>About a year ago my boyfriend started getting his hair professionally cut and styled</li>
            <li>So overall, this ends up being a good product, just not a great one.</li>
            <li>After a quick two minute blow dry and mousse, I simply add this in by hand (don&#x27;t use too much), and I can tame my wild locks with a quick flick of the wrist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wax, but the texture acts very much like dry clay</li>
            <li>Ok so this product doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars for price, but it&#x27;s not as expensive as others I&#x27;ve tried and as of right now (06/28/12) on Amazon its under $15.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely thick hair, and the product is still relatively easy to apply after a little getting used to, plus it washes out in the shower extremely easily.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes your hair look dry and natural, but really holds it in place!</li>
            <li>If you want some shine, you can put more into your hair and it will start to look very slick</li>
            <li>+) but on amazon I save a significant amount and purchase a few to stock up.</li>
            <li>With other products sometimes it seems to have absorbed or something and by the end of the day</li>
            <li>It is completely matte without any gloss, has high hold that will last all day.</li>
            <li>Once you do, it provides decent hold and a matte finish, but I would say after using this product, I only like the way my hair looks maybe</li>
            <li>I used to have trouble with the bed head stick not holding very well in the heat of summer, but this wax must have a higher melting point.</li>
            <li>would only need a small quarter size to run through your hair and it stays stylish throughout the day....</li>
            <li>At first it is more &amp;#34;solid&amp;#34; or denser than other products, and it&#x27;s hard to work into your hands, but once you have it worked in your hands</li>
            <li>However, as of now, this will be my first and last attempt at switching away from American Crew Fiber.</li>
            <li>Does the same thing as the older product.</li>
            <li>Smells a lot different when compared to the older mixture.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a replacement for American Crew: Classic Fiber.</li>
            <li>Currently being sold at the Fort Bragg, NC North PX (Main Gate).</li>
            <li>This was a tough decision for me to try a new hair product, but I didn&#x27;t want to use gels any more.</li>
            <li>and then you&#x27;re left in a bigger mess trying to fix it if you still have more styling to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My pomade of choice is American Crew Pomade, with Medium Hold and High Shine.  </li>
            <li>As someone who moved from So Cal to Atlanta, I had to find a new product because my old hair product just didn&#x27;t stand up to the Southern humidity.</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase and that is saying something as I am not very brand loyal.  </li>
            <li>I tried other products similar to this, but I keep coming back to this as it is easy to work with and does not produce a shiny look, which is what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It washes out easy and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down as long as you don&#x27;t use too much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the wax is applied onto your hair (post towel-drying) and it is styled to your preferences (so long as it does not try to defy gravity too much), the hold remains for the duration of the day.</li>
            <li>And last, but not least...</li>
            <li>I have tried a few different brands of hair wax, and this is definitely may favorite.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably go back to what I normally use after i finish this.</li>
            <li>Gives your hair a shiny, wet look, but not a greasy look - although it does leave it feeling a bit crisp.</li>
            <li>The hold of the new paste is also nowhere near the hold of the old black container which lasted a whole day.</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely thick and pretty difficult to manage so if you have fine hair it may work much better for you.</li>
            <li>Smell---10/10, its very clean and subtle smelling that lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;While some people like the older version for it containing real bee wax (yes, the new silver version use synthetic bee wax), I found myself like the newer formula better, part of the reason that I&#x27;m very unhappy for receiving the black one again on my most recent order.</li>
            <li>The only downside for this is that I feel like it makes my hair just a bit too stiff ( I have fine hair)</li>
            <li>If you wanted that straight up glued look, I suppose you could use it on dry</li>
            <li>This has made using the product very convenient when I do not have time to completely dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>It is a dry wax so it does not leave a shine or hardness on his hair but keeps it in place how he wants it.</li>
            <li>It also works very well when you towel dry.</li>
            <li>At least with the Joico, you get more bang for your buck, at the same quality.</li>
            <li>If you have longer hair and use too much, you will be sorry.  :)</li>
            <li>The opinions expressed here should not be taken as any legal or medical advise these are just my personal experiences/opinions. </li>
            <li>In one instance of an intimate encounter I was cuddling next to someone and my hair brushed against her skin.</li>
            <li>In one instance of an intimate encounter I was cuddling next to someone and my hair brushed against her skin.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;ve found that if i don&#x27;t thin out the wax a bit, even after rubbing it to warm it up, it can leave white on his hair.</li>
            <li>The hold was also strong as advertised - a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>As long as you let your hair dry JUST enough, but not TOO dry, you can use this to work some magic.</li>
            <li>other than that, i just rub in my palm/fingers and put it on my hair first than start adjusting how i like it.</li>
            <li>and it seems like I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in it!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any weird odors and washes off my hands pretty easily.  </li>
            <li>I have a medium military fade, short on top but enough to spike in the front (a military haircut).</li>
            <li>It does hold my flat asian hair for a whole day without greasy look.</li>
            <li>I have flat, straight Asian hair</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey, and you have to order it online, but it is well worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I wish it was a little cheaper, but I guess it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Use way less than you think you will need when applying it, and make sure your hair is towel-dry (toweled off but still SLIGHTLY damp).</li>
            <li>My hands only get slightly greasy when touching, but it holds enough weight where it doesn&#x27;t stick straight up after working in the heat for a few hours.</li>
            <li>time I shop for a product like this, I think I will go for something that is a little more workable for thick, stubborn, straight hair like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was using Aveda&#x27;s Grooming Clay for a bit, but I find this has better hold and less mess.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, TIGI&#x27;s product felt more aqueous and less glue-like, plus it was easier to wash off without that gross feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can make a jar last months where I am lucky if the other last a month or 2.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to use too much or your hair will turn into a rock.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like it when you start to get near the bottom of the tub it hardens and makes it unusable.</li>
            <li>It holds your hair really well and unlike others it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or wet look.</li>
            <li>I could barely run my fingers through it and made me look like I stepped out of an 80&#x27;s movie.</li>
            <li>Holds very well, but be careful to apply evenly or you&#x27;ll have chunks in your hair.</li>
            <li>I have tried several brands of hair &amp;#34;goop&amp;#34; and so far this one is my favorite.&lt;br</li>
            <li>only complaint is that, in terms of texture, it seems to have the same hold as cheaper products, notably Joico Ice Erratic Molding Clay.</li>
            <li>With bed head not only does it keep my hair in place but it leaves it soft and i can even run my fingers through it without compromising the hold.</li>
            <li>It has a medium hold that will last all day and gives a natural look.</li>
            <li>and in the heat just barely sticky?</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;You get what you pay for&amp;#34; does not apply, because I&#x27;m surprised they&#x27;re not charging double.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m never going back to the old products because this works the way I want it to work.&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
            <li>The strength is considerable and can even last me over night if I decide to not wash my hair.</li>
            <li>People are always surprised that I actually do have some form of hair product in my hair, and if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for, this is the product you want.</li>
            <li>Since then, they have stopped carrying this product at the salon and he&#x27;s tried several others, but this is by far my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all, this product works really well for my thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will not be buying this again and sadly will have to go back to the far superior Sumotech, which I hate paying for, but it makes my hair look great.</li>
            <li>This wax is crazy good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do not put this on to wet hair, as it will not style well, must be dry hair in order for it to do it&#x27;s magic, also use a thick large comb to comb your hair or you can just use your fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I, personally, have very fine and thin hair (which I get from my mother</li>
            <li>All 3 I received in an order from a seller (who I bought from for the first time) were watered down and thinner.</li>
            <li>Two star for their arbitrarily mixing the new and old versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it actually lasted me a total of 88 days before I had to order a new</li>
            <li>it offers a dry natural look</li>
            <li>no particular order of concern it is important to note that once the item has been sitting around for the duration of a month (despite regular use), the wax begins to harden along the outside and soften on the inside within its closed container.</li>
            <li>After a few trials of getting the right amount to prevent a glossy appearance on my hair</li>
            <li>It just takes a few times using it to figure out the right amount for the look and feel you are going for.  </li>
            <li>those with curly, frizzy or messy hair: I would definitely avoid this wax and spend a little more money to get something like J Beverly Clear Wax.</li>
            <li>It only gets better, you only need to use a subtle amount.</li>
            <li>I want my hair to look natural, but maybe even give it that flat iron look without having to straighten it.  </li>
            <li>Really sticky, but if other stuff doesn&#x27;t do the job this will.</li>
            <li>I have thick, straight asian hair by the way, and I must say, this wax works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy, 17 years old with a full head of thick, darker blonde hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For a long time I was searching high and low for a product that would hold my super-thick hair, and not leave it looking like I dipped my head in Crisco.</li>
            <li>But I guess the inconsistency might cause other people trouble and it is so easily avoidable, but they haven&#x27;t done so.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know how you can go wrong buying this product for how cheap it</li>
            <li>There is a ton of product available as well, I expect this to last me at least 6 months from date of purchase.</li>
            <li>I have really thick coarse hair and was looking for a light hold product.  </li>
            <li>use it everyday, about a fingernail&#x27;s worth (or two, depending on how my hair is acting).</li>
            <li>I found a few good ones,  but was never completely happy with them.  </li>
            <li>first I thought the price was a bit steep, but then I realized how little of it you need each day</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t sleep with this, because it will probably make your hair look like a mess that&#x27;s much harder to clean</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works great in the heat and the cold!</li>
            <li>The actual wax itself is legit,  it&#x27;s not a rip-off like other reviews state.</li>
            <li>I ordered it along with 2 similar products (both from American Crew), all at the same time, to compare them, and this was the clear winner.  </li>
            <li>I really like the fact that I can put this stuff in my hair and wet it the next day to get the same look.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what its name suggests: It is a quality wax that you can work through your hair in order to give a messy separation while giving a matte shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, this is a lot more difficult to use than American Crew Fiber - which is what I have used for years.  </li>
            <li>I had used the AC Fiber for a few years now and it does exactly what I want it</li>
            <li>It does give hair a natural look, it does not get as hard as gel and is definitely better than the stiff I used before.</li>
            <li>On the performance part, this product definitely delivers as promised: it really does hold well - even in difficult weather, like hot temperatures, high humidity etc. -</li>
            <li>Pretty basic, a little too oily for my taste and makes my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li>Anything longer, and it&#x27;s super hard to work through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is less greasy than Garnier and doesn&#x27;t darken my hair as much.  </li>
            <li>If I want a lot of hold, I let my hair dry almost completely.</li>
            <li>Just a natural dry.</li>
            <li>I usually dry until my hair is at the &amp;#34;almost completely dry&amp;#34</li>
            <li>If you want to the dry Pompadour professional look.....</li>
            <li>Fiber gave me the ability to add volume to my hair and make it look less... combed and straight</li>
            <li>I have straight black hair and it works in well.</li>
            <li>less than $20, expectations are already pretty low; there&#x27;s a lot more expensive products out there that didn&#x27;t even help, but I gave this one a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a heavy user myself (I get through a jar in three weeks, Ok it is a small jar but still)</li>
            <li>SUPER thick</li>
            <li>Hair quickly develops a thick, slightly-sticky and sandy texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it used real beeswax and overall less toxic ingredients than what&#x27;s in the formula now.</li>
            <li>My only complaint about BedHead Matte Separation Wax is that it is a bit difficult to wash out; I definitely find myself using more shampoo and spending more time massaging my hair in the shower to get all of it out, as compared to other products.</li>
            <li>I have heavy, coarse, Asian hair that when long will defeat this stuff but with a fresh cut it will hold up.</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine hair, and a lot of it.</li>
            <li>I have gone through nearly 4 containers of this product and have found that it provides a matte finish and good, but not great, hold, and it can be hard to work through hair when it is dry.</li>
            <li>My hair grows fast and tends to frizz out a little bit if I don&#x27;t have something in it.</li>
            <li>I keep my hair really short - less than an inch on top and barely enough to pinch on the sides and back - so a little of this goes a long way, for a long time.</li>
            <li>In addition to this, a little goes a long way, which justifies the higher cost.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little waxy for my preference, and it really needs to be washed out with shampoo before restyling your hair the next day.</li>

            <li> I really loved this hair wax except that if you put a lot on it looks like you have lotion in your hair</li>
            <li> Good texture and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling grimy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly picky about my hair stuff</li>
            <li> Good job TIGI.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> but i stopped using it when my hair got longer because it just didn&#x27;t result in a good look in my opinion.</li>
            <li> , it is not at all wise to leave the wax remaining on your head while sleeping</li>
            <li> Have i mentioned it smells really good?</li>
            <li> This wax works good for shorter that needs control.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Great hold, makes yor hair look shiny/glossy in a good way</li>
            <li> Holds my relaxed hair well even in fairly windy conditions.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> This is wax is good, it doesnt have a smell, its kinda sticky but when you put it in your hair you don&#x27;t feel it, unless you put a ton.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff for almost holding any hair type.</li>
            <li> Although, not as good as this Matte Separation wax by TIGI Bed Head .  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good matte wax that holds just about any type of hair, this is it.</li>
            <li> Just buy it, save yourself the time and money of looking for a good one like I did.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> but the quality is so good.</li>
            <li> This workable wax is a fair price and does the job as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Still a good buy</li>
            <li> and I am good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not to mention the product smells good as well.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> By the end of the day you still look good.</li>
            <li> Smell is not as good as TIGI Bed Head.</li>
            <li> The Smell is great, the price is great, texture is good, and the hold is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Great hair product, works great on my fine hair.</li>
            <li> It may take a bit to figure out what the perfect amount is for you personally, but after you figure it out, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything incredible to my hair and has a really strong bro sorta smell to it.</li>
            <li> So my hair is very important to me lol.</li>
            <li> Hair product is great and cheaper on amazon which I love.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading great reviews and seeing it was a Amazon top seller.  </li>
            <li> it does add great texture and control that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m also happy to report that I STILL love it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m also happy to report that I STILL love it.</li>
            <li> This was very interesting for me.&lt;br /&gt;- Texture is between a wax, a glue, and a fiber.</li>
            <li> Its much more affordable, and works great.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with everything besides the price for its size</li>
            <li> Very satisfied to of purchased this..</li>
            <li> This is an EXCELLENT hair product and is well worth the price</li>

            <li> Good product, nice matte finish.  </li>
            <li> nice quality good smell</li>
            <li> It took a fee days to perfect, but with almost dry hair this product works best for me.  </li>
            <li> Nice to be able to get it via Amazon Prime for a great price.</li>
            <li> I tried many but this is still number 1!</li>
            <li> In all, I love this wax!</li>

            <li> I came across this TIGI product and I love it!</li>
            <li> this was the first option they showed me and also the best seller.&lt;br</li>

            <li> If you want to have matte finish for your hair without the greasy shine that many products leave you with - BUY THIS!</li>
            <li> First week I used it every day, hoping to get used to the best way around it.</li>
            <li> holds great, and washes out easy, with no scent to speak of.  </li>
            <li> As with all Bed Head products, this one is amazing.</li>
            <li> it just looks simply amazing, without looking like a guido.</li>
            <li> It works amazingly.</li>
            <li> Product is amazing.</li>
            <li> and this stuff worked amazingly.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Stuff is simply amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> As a college student, I was looking for something that&#x27;s great and also cheap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will be recommending this amazing product to all of my close friends and family.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> It also has a great, fantastic scent.</li>
            <li> Amazing, I buy one a month.</li>
            <li> This is amazing.</li>
            <li> It also has a nice smell to it.</li>
            <li> &quot; kind of style, ironically this product has Bed Head in the name.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li> In the beginning, this had a nice, malleable texture.</li>
            <li> But if your not pulling a 24 hour shift doing God knows what, this product will work really well, and provide excellent grip with a matte finish.</li>
            <li> They just care how nice their hair looks.</li>
            <li> Its not the kind of stuff that you can run your hands through your hair with after it sets.  </li>
            <li> It is really nice to not have to worry about my hair wilting as the day progresses.  </li>
            <li> It gives your hair a nice sheen.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t too crunchy and looks nice without being too shiny.</li>
            <li> So I read the reviews for this and liked what I seen.</li>
            <li> Also, it smells nice.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend really liked it</li>
            <li> I work it through and leave it kind of messy/</li>
            <li> Also, the smell is really nice.</li>
            <li> - but really gives an awesome hold and look.</li>
            <li> FYI, this is kind of too sticky.</li>
            <li> I still use this, in moderation, nearly every day, good product, best wax i&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> but I would honestly recommend just using a bit of hair gel instead of this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled finding any kind of hair product that A) worked and B)</li>
            <li> All of my reviews are written by me, and are my own opinions.</li>
            <li> Removing the residue from one&#x27;s hands requires anywhere between 2 to 5 minutes of work under warm water and</li>
            <li> It looks nice but no stylist dares to touch it until it the wax is washed off.</li>
            <li> It looks nice but no stylist dares to touch it until it the wax is washed off.</li>
            <li> This product is kind of misleading.</li>
            <li> My kind of wax.</li>
            <li> being said, it&#x27;s definitely a nice matte look.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll want your hair fairly damp, or you&#x27;ll never be able to work it through your hair.</li>
            <li> I use it on semi-wet hair and it holds nicely.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m loving it so</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> It has a nice aroma, and does well of keeping your hair up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of fro-y and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d imagine this works best if you have straight medium length</li>
            <li> It does smell nice but literally feels like you applied glue to your hair.</li>
            <li> So it looked nice</li>
            <li> When anyone touches your hair, is the kind of feeling where their hand will get stucked inside.</li>
            <li> Easy to work with and nice finishing touches!</li>
            <li> great hold, very light texture, rinses out easily and has a nice not to girly smell to it.</li>
            <li> It holds great, has a clean matte look, and has no scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Tigi is the best to be honest, this wax is really great, and the amount lasts for so long!!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, highly recommended</li>
            <li> Smells nice, holds hair pretty well for styling, and there is a good amount to use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried nearly every top-rated brand of wax, and I&#x27;m convinced this stuff is the best of its kind on the market.</li>
            <li> Good strong fibrous wax</li>
            <li> Works for quick, last-minute hairstyles and ones that command more time and work.&lt;br /&gt;Weaknesses are basically nonexistent, easily the best hair product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This one just smells great, manly but mild.  </li>
            <li> Very strong hold.</li>
            <li> This is a very strong wax that will hold all day.</li>
            <li> Very easy to work with</li>
            <li> it is very easy compared to others that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> Very strong hold.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong smell....</li>
            <li> For sure my favorite hair wax!</li>
            <li> I have tried many many types and brands of wax and gels to get my hair to look the way it did with Gillette and none have worked until now!  </li>
            <li> Great Seller, product was exactly as described!</li>
            <li> awesome- looks totally natural.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a medium hold that provides a natural flow and matte texture, this is a great product!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of hair waxes and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> The hold factor is just perfect, holds all day, but still allows hair to feel soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> Most popular hair care products are in the 8-9 range...</li>
            <li> Best hair product I have found so far.</li>
            <li> Three days of use and so far very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Although the metal packaging, like in the photo, would have been nice the product itself is fantastic!</li>
            <li> The smell is good - light fragrance.  </li>
            <li> By far the best I&#x27;ve used during for my shorter hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of products for my hair and this is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> This is the best paste/ wax I have used so far</li>
            <li> just good ,use comfortable</li>
            <li> By far the best &amp;#34;dirt&amp;#34; paste product I have used.</li>
            <li> This is by far THE best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used, period.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and had really good ratings.  </li>
            <li> Of course, this won&#x27;t be some kind of Cinderella magic paste that&#x27;ll fix your nappy hair or out-dated styles, but it will do well to give your hair a matte shine with a look that won&#x27;t look like you came out of an audition for Grease or The Outsiders.</li>
            <li> Quite good, pretty good smell</li>
            <li> This works wells keeps my hair where I want it and is easy to work with!</li>
            <li> WASHES EASILY off hands!</li>
            <li> The hold is great, and for $10 it&#x27;s worth a shot for most</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many pomades and gels and this wax has by far the best hold and look.</li>
            <li> I use this for work and save the good stuff for special occassions.</li>
            <li> Great product, very workable throughout the day!</li>
            <li> works great, this is not the first time I ordered</li>
            <li> First off this smells great</li>
            <li> just great really!</li>
            <li> I have very fine and longish hair, though, so the hold is probably better for guys with thicker and more wiry hair.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing because my hair is so fine</li>
            <li> and you get better results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there is a medium</li>
            <li> and I think its better for me</li>
            <li> Gets way more crusty than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Probably my favorite hair styling product ever.</li>
            <li> better cause it doesn&#x27;t give your hair that oily or greasy look.</li>
            <li> I love the matte finish.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite texture products but wish it had a bit more shine</li>
            <li> great stuff if you dont use too much of it.</li>
            <li> Its consistency is more like clay than wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t seem to find anything better.</li>
            <li> As with most amazon products, I found this cheaper here than it is in retail stores.</li>
            <li> well ill try one more time, wax is great best out there, good price and style.</li>
            <li> thing I really love about this product is the smell, or rather, the lack thereof.</li>
            <li> So many hair products have an overpowering and nauseating smell.</li>
            <li> Sometimes if I want a bit more hold, I&#x27;ll add some axe paste to my hair in conjunction with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this wax.</li>
            <li> I have used many hair products including AXE.  </li>
            <li> more than wearing socks with shorts....</li>
            <li> CHEAP!  </li>
            <li> STILL have yet to find anything better.  </li>
            <li> STILL have yet to find anything better.  </li>
            <li> Love the matte finish...</li>
            <li> I was having to use twice as much (or more) product when using Mitch creams/waxes.</li>
            <li> Better price, and</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for keeping my hair back out of my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth a shot if you&#x27;re looking for a good hair product.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you my top 3 choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sure to rub into your hair thoroughly-</li>
            <li> The price is so much better than comparable products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for a bit more texture in my hair and for it to stand up a bit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Redken Maneuver: Definitely the best one besides BedHead.</li>
            <li> One more benefit...</li>
            <li> intrinsically worthwhile pursuits&amp;#34;--Aristotle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though there are better products out there.</li>
            <li> Finally tried this stuff out and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love this wax.</li>
            <li> This is probably best if you combine it with a hairspray because if you use enough of this to hold your hair in place, it makes your hair feel like it has glue in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to literally shampoo my hair 3 times to feel satisfied.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair up (nothing else will) and it comes in the most convenient case ever.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> and i just ordered 3 more bottles because i am going traveling</li>
            <li> and this is my favorite wax now.</li>
            <li> If you buy it make sure it Ships from and sold by Amazon.com and not Hair Beauty Beautique.</li>
            <li> so people can&#x27;t really tell that you have product in your hair, which is great.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is one of the best hair products that I have ever used</li>
            <li> It smells like cheap cologne!</li>
            <li> Most hair products I have tried (and</li>
            <li> I love the matte finish.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d presume using more would help, but the more you use the more it tends to flake.</li>
            <li> i love this product since it looks like my hair has nothing in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> one of the best hair products I&#x27;ve ever used for that spiky look, never going back to anything else !!!!!</li>
            <li> $ will be buying more when i run out</li>
            <li> This is definitely the one of the best hair products out there.</li>
            <li> Supreme hold but still able to run my hands through my hair.  </li>
            <li> I do sometimes miss the smell of the Aveda, but otherwise this is a better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been trying many different hair waxes, but I think this is the best among the ones I have tried.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> I love this wax.</li>
            <li> one is my favorite along with Bumble and Bumble Sumotech (which is almost $30 for</li>
            <li> We both love the way it makes the hair look.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I often look for more than strictly performance.</li>
            <li> I used to love this product.</li>
            <li> I have used many different glues and waxes before, but this is the best on the market, period.</li>
            <li> you can get the style you love no problem.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I am ordering a couple more soon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many waxes throughout my years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best wax and the only product that can manage my hair.</li>
            <li> Just ok, very sticky without great hold</li>
            <li> Great product that really delivers what it should.</li>
            <li> It also makes my wave more curly.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to rub in or will leave a greyish color.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years and my container just ran out (it lasted more than a year) .</li>
            <li> But I think that TIGI Bed Head Separation Wax works better for what I use it for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it throughout my hair to just give it some more volume and hold.</li>
            <li> TIGI made this with a pop top that also can screw off.</li>
            <li> TIGI made this with a pop top that also can screw off.</li>
            <li> His hair can be styled when dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to get more out of him, but that&#x27;s all hr would tell me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> better he said because it is more moldable.</li>
            <li> I can find better quality even at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> This is the definitely the best wax I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Strong hold, lasts forever, Matte Finish, Appropriately priced.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used many.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this Matte Separation Wax.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of this wax.</li>
            <li> Works great, don&#x27;t use to much water and you won&#x27;t get the shiny glossy finish.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Better</li>
            <li> Then most of matte hair wax  ...  you can figure out what ever you want  to your  Hair</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> : I just ordered 2 more from Amazon.</li>
            <li> For years, my family and I have been looking for hair product that didn&#x27;t leave flaky residue and to be able to withstand the elements that the world can throw at us.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off buying a can of Carnauba car wax and use it instead.</li>
            <li> better than the stuff my hair stylist uses</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly satisfied with the look I get after putting this on in the mornings.  </li>
            <li> Possibly one of the best hair products available.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I do not need to use more than a pea size each morning.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> If anyone has any questions for me feel free to ask!</li>
            <li> this is not only the best but also some of the cheapest product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> My husband has tried lots of different hair products and thinks this is the best.</li>
            <li> Let me preface this by saying I LOVE this product (as do many others).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d relegated myself to the fact that I would never be able to find something that would work for me.&lt;br /&gt;...</li>
            <li> Granted, the wax smells better than Elmer&#x27;s glue but the adhesive properties are still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, this product is more drama than I could ever want.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, this product is more drama than I could ever want.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> Good fresh scent</li>
            <li> I use more to get it under control.</li>
            <li> I guess you could counter that with more product in your hair</li>
            <li> Better then crew.</li>
            <li> your hair can be restyled throughout the day without adding more, which is amazing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> It does make it so my hair has more volume, and it doesn&#x27;t feel waxy or shiny.  </li>
            <li> Just be sure to rub the product between your hands before applying it to your hair - this will help make sure it&#x27;s evenly applied.</li>
            <li> The stubbornness, coupled with the humidity of a tropical climate means that most products don&#x27;t work in my hair to do what I want with all day.</li>
            <li> a user of Sumotech, this is a more affordable subsitute.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product.</li>
            <li> Love the smell</li>
            <li> Love the matte finish on my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> But I believe it is still a very well-made product and would work great otherwise, so that&#x27;s why I gave it three stars.</li>
            <li> This works better than any of the others for us.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just an okay product.</li>
            <li> It is okay-</li>
            <li> 3rd can of this wax, great stuff!</li>
            <li> Absolutely Fantastic!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite.</li>
            <li> the feeling was so much better that this one.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this one.</li>
            <li> Love this hair wax.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Smells OK</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best for that I have come across, definitely give it a try!</li>
            <li> The product is very easy to apply and just as easily washed out.</li>
            <li> Washes off easy, very easy</li>
            <li> Strong, washes off easily when shampooing, nice scent.</li>
            <li> It spreads easy, smells nice, washes out easily, and holds all day.</li>
            <li> It holds very well and wetting your hair first makes it work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> If you want to have a nice clean look, you can do that.</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;d recommend finding that perfect amount of hair moisture before applying, otherwise it feels very thick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great matte look with decent hold.</li>
            <li> Bottom line is, this is a great product for the high hold, matte look.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> My hair looks great even in high humidity</li>
            <li> My hair looks great even in high humidity</li>
            <li> /&gt;Creates a great dry texture look and smells good.</li>
            <li> You can shape your hair very easily and you will very rarely have to worry about your hairstyle</li>
            <li> So I am used to a wax that is very smooth and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This is pretty good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s matte, but not too matte and it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty good too.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product.</li>
            <li> This product worked pretty good at maintaining the look on my hair.</li>
            <li> Just an overall amazing product!!</li>
            <li> Love it when it is this easy</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t been able to easily achieve it.  </li>
            <li> Tigis wax also smells decent too, not the best in that catagory, but good enough.</li>
            <li> Best to use after your hair is washed and completely dry.</li>
            <li> I do need to adjust my hair every so often with this product, as it is not a &amp;#34;apply-and-done&amp;#34; product like a lot of strong hold pomades are, but as the name suggest more &amp;#34;workable&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> I found the best application was when my hair was dry.</li>
            <li> Best to put this on once the hair is relatively dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite good, but not as good as American Crew Fibre.</li>
            <li> Hold is very good for short hair.  </li>
            <li> Overall a very good product.</li>
            <li> This has to be the most important.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried most of them available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks great, but she mentions ... &amp;#34;do not go anywhere near it&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair looks great, but she mentions ... &amp;#34;do not go anywhere near it&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product that lets you have that natural look without looking like a grease head.</li>
            <li> It is good Wax to keep my  hair hold whole day.</li>
            <li> very well looking good..</li>
            <li> To be fair, though, this product is still much easier to wash out than the clay-ish products like Grunge Mat or Molding Clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use very much, and it will hold all day, provide some good texture and separation, and washes out clean.</li>
            <li> I have tried about 5 other products and this one works the best.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m still trying to get use to this Bed Head stuff though by using a little more water and hoping for the best.  </li>
            <li> I hugged my female friend and she smelled my hair a good 3 times!</li>
            <li> And it washes out easy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The consistency is kind of like a pomade, but it is very sticky and softer than most wax I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It does come out rather easily in the shower with or without shampoo.</li>
            <li> Washes out easily.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, easy to wash out.</li>
            <li> The gel is easy to apply, easy to wash out and easy to wash off your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul</li>
            <li> This wax is lightweight and easily pliable after working it a bit in your hands.</li>
            <li> Washes off easily.</li>
            <li> It holds well and is easy to restyle.</li>
            <li> Works for my hair type, I think its easy to work with</li>
            <li> Matte finish and allows you to clump and twist easily.</li>
            <li> comes off easily in the shower with shampoo</li>
            <li> It allowed me to get the style I wanted, easily, without looking &amp;#34;overdone&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Holds it in place, and I can easily readjust throughout the day if it starts to fall, and does it all with the matte finish</li>
            <li> Washes fairly easily.  </li>
            <li> Holds well and washes out easily.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t flake up, and holds all day easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to put in and easy to wash out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it a 4.5 because it worked absolutely amazing giving a strong hold with a matt&amp;eacute; finish however it wasn&#x27;t able to hold longer hair very well.</li>
            <li> The product also comes out easily.</li>
            <li> easy is it to work into the hair?  </li>
            <li> it wash out easily?</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to work into the hair.  </li>
            <li> Works well, easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t smell foofie.  </li>
            <li> It also rinses out easily.  </li>
            <li> Washes out easy and is easy to mold once applied.</li>
            <li> Washes out easily.  </li>
            <li> Allows you to easily manage hair</li>
            <li> It holds strong, and has the matte finish that I want.</li>
            <li> I need something with strong hold and pliability.</li>
            <li> Which has a strong hold like that</li>
            <li> Strong hold but did not wash out with just water..</li>
            <li> Switched to Got 2 Be and was too strong.</li>
            <li> It smells like a calogne smell but not too strong.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> but the scent is not too strong.</li>
            <li> The stuff is like cement and even with my strong fingers, it was a workout just to get this stuff to break apart</li>
            <li> and well about the hold, its strong as rock...</li>
            <li> So strong, it will pull your hair out.  </li>
            <li> doesnt style too well, not too strong</li>
            <li> , the hold is strong and doesn&#x27;t sweat out, and it is matte, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> So I need something that is strong to keep it in pace.</li>
            <li> Has really strong hold for longer hair.</li>
            <li> But smells quite strong</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overpowering or too strong</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good matte style product with high hold.</li>
            <li> The Matte Separation Wax has great hold, once it dries your hair will stay there all day, and it has barely any shine to it at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly more pliable and &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; from what I would expect from a true wax.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is not bad, but I&#x27;ve smelled better.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not bad, considering what women spend on their hair :)rrible to wash off.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not bad, considering what women spend on their hair :)</li>
            <li> Hands down best wax I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product I have ever used hands down.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best product out there.</li>
            <li> a hair stylist suggested this, and it&#x27;s hands down the best one I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> It provides all day hold and has a nice clean, fresh smell.</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t intend on people touching your hair, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> This product works fine.</li>
            <li> and it was still fine</li>
            <li> &quot; it if it messes up throughout the day and it still holds just fine.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this helps make it thicker and holds it in place without a shine.</li>
            <li> I think the masculine scent is really pleasant, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This has quickly become my favorite hair styling product do to</li>
            <li> Thank you to amazon for getting this out to me so quick!</li>
            <li> excellent gel that provides strong hold with little or no shine.</li>
            <li> best wax i ever had, gives me the look that i really want, doesnt leave your hear greasy or dry, feels very natural and looks great</li>
            <li> wax is great, is easy to use, lasts all day, and only costs $5.</li>
            <li> This wax works well, holds tight, texture is good all day.&lt;br /&gt;Smells good as well.</li>
            <li> but it has a very strong hold and smells pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hold isn&#x27;t very good but the texture is just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that bothers me is that it&#x27;s riddled with chemicals, but it certainly is the best holding wax I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Good workable wax, smells great and lasts without the flakes or hard feeling.</li>
            <li> and it was a huge difference</li>
            <li> Enjoy TIGI products but was sent Bed Head B</li>
            <li> Great hold through the entire day.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a great product, would buy again.</li>
            <li> This is something I really enjoy about this product.</li>
            <li> Tigi Matte Seperation Wax is almost fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Very happy with how my hair looks everyday-</li>
            <li> Low shine, great smell, not sticky.</li>
            <li> Also, it is easy to clean up in the shower or bath.</li>
            <li> This hair wax works fantastic.</li>
            <li> Lastly, this products works great when applying it to damp hair just after showering.  </li>
            <li> This wax is absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> bought this stuff thinking it would be like the cheap hair products i used to buy</li>
            <li> Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s some cheap expired muck they put together</li>
            <li> It definitely has a Matta finish, and a great smell to it.  </li>
            <li> Best to spread it on your fingertips and apply to towel dried hair.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this will have your hair looking albeit shine free, like you put gel in it.</li>
            <li> Great value for hair product relative to the Bumble and Bumble sumotech I used to purchase.</li>
            <li> , just didn&#x27;t fit how I style my hair</li>
            <li> Yeah, great product, I&#x27;ve used Layrite, Suavecito, various drugstore brands, Paul Mitchell, etc.</li>
            <li> Great for short to medium hair.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.  </li>
            <li> Great for medium to short hair lengths.</li>
            <li> Fantastic hold and</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, important note</li>
            <li> Holds okay, but again, I think it would be good for short, spiky hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best stuff for men with short hair.  </li>
            <li> The reason I don&#x27;t go back to this one is that it doesn&#x27;t give as must texture and hold as BedHead.&lt;br /&gt;Kendra Taffy: Smells like candy, very sticky and goupy, not the best hold</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good wax if you can stand the unbearable scent, if not, skip this completely.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as good as Bumble &amp; Bumble&#x27;s Sumotech but definitely more affordable for daily use.</li>
            <li> It works, smells good, and looks natural in use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good stuff, it makes your hair look natural.</li>
            <li> So far, this is a good contender to replace it.</li>
            <li> I tried many products, from Paul Mitchell, to American Crew and nothing was as good as this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a great product and VERY worth it.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have tried many a hair gel in an attempt to find a gel that didn&#x27;t make me look like a grease ball, washed out easily and was affordable.</li>
            <li> This is much better than what I had experienced with other products.  </li>
            <li> Matt effect, good and flexible hold for many hours, suggested for medium short hair, clean finishing.</li>
            <li> When I first applied the wax it was very light and smooth.</li>
            <li> The hold is not that great, my hair moves too easily and portions look like there&#x27;s product and portions look completely dry and move.</li>
            <li> mainly because they&#x27;re paraben-free, though I would lean more toward Star Wax since it has a nicer fragrance and holds better</li>
            <li> Most other products give decent hold, but Tigi&#x27;s Matte Separation Wax has superb hold.</li>
            <li> Makes the styling of gravity defying hairdos easy and quick, without all of the additives that can make your hair greasy or clumpy.</li>
            <li> Maybe need a little more than I used to, but it still smells great, holds great, and is definitely still matte.</li>
            <li> Maybe need a little more than I used to, but it still smells great, holds great, and is definitely still matte.</li>
            <li> very strong hold, much stronger than i was expecting.</li>
            <li> First of all, it&#x27;s not a wax, more like a pomade.</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty well, however I wish it stayed better because I have to use a lot</li>
            <li> At first, i wasnt sure if i should order it</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m not that excited.</li>
            <li> I love this product.helping me a lot to make my hair that how l exactly want..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about a year now and love it; does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to with no shine or grease.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually more of a bumble &amp; bumble sumotech fan, but this product works pretty well also.  </li>
            <li> at first I wasn&#x27;t really sure weather to order it or not.</li>
            <li> This is exactly how this listing works - it&#x27;s more of a lottery.</li>
            <li> but each have a unique set of pros and cons.  </li>
            <li> The best hair wax for my fine but thick hair, and I&#x27;ve literally tried them all.</li>
            <li> As for the real bed head product it is amazing if you get the real deal!!</li>
            <li> I have very fine, straight hair and this stuff</li>
            <li> I have curly and somewhat dry hair and this works great.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this product is it is the only product that offers a matte finish.  </li>
            <li> Smells clean too.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous men&#x27;s hair products over the years and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo gets rid of it very easily, clean up is no problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very knowledgeable about the whole process and difference between them all, but this has been the best thing I&#x27;ve had so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When compared to bottom-of-the-line AXE fiber, which goes on smoothly (and rubs out just as quickly), TIGI immediately works in the hair to give it volume and hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its good at what it does for the price just got more than I expected</li>
            <li> The best thing about what this product does is that, when the wind blows your hair down/left or right, with just a little help from your hand, it retains its desired styling.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your hair in a nice matte finish and it looks very natural looking.</li>
            <li> but right now I would say its not what I thought it would be!</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold is great and it harder than normal wax sold in stores for a better hold of hair, but easy to style.</li>
            <li> With this product, I get the same great control, but with a dryer more natural look, and it lasts all day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too particular about my hair products, but this is much better than cheap grocery store stuff I was using before.  </li>
            <li> The product has a great overall texture once applied -- exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Just might not be the best if your hair is like a thick scrub brush / chia pet like mine.</li>
            <li> Be sure to spread it evenly throughout as much of your hair as you want control over and let the product do its work.</li>
            <li> Creates a nice texture and hold with a natural look.</li>
            <li> Has a good and lasting hold all throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I use about a finger full for my medium-short length hair.</li>
            <li> Good standard matte wax.</li>
            <li> Smells good but leaves the white wax look</li>
            <li> If anything, the separation wax has a mild, clean smell that was not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Depending on the amount of product you use you can achieve different look, but it always looked good for me.</li>
            <li> I can definitely see it being a good choice for others, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on thick, works best if you work it between your hands.</li>
            <li> If I accidentally use too much in my hair you can feel it, but most of the time that&#x27;s not a problem.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest this product to anyone that wants to be stylish and not look like a member of the Jersey Shore.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate this, so I don&#x27;t have to apply more.</li>
            <li> Lastly, the hold and look it gives is superior even to Crew-Fiber.</li>
            <li> and I really have to say I like this better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching and searching for a product that would leave my hair with a true matte finish with no avail for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anything longer than an inch or so, and I&#x27;d look at some of the American Crew products (Fiber would be a good place to start).</li>
            <li> Good for short to medium hair.</li>
            <li> All day hold, nice smell, soft matte finish.</li>
            <li> It did a good job holding my short to medium length hair in place.</li>
            <li> If this works for you then I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to get it because everything else it states is true.</li>
            <li> Smell is a little strong but it works great.</li>
            <li> My hair stays up for most of the day and doesn&#x27;t get messed up by wind or rain, which is important since I live in Vancouver, Canada.</li>
            <li> Finding the right hair product has taken years of trial and error, and I can finally say that I&#x27;ve settled on this remarkable product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less waxy and more sticky, but does a good job.</li>
            <li> later).&lt;br /&gt;- decent smell, very light or non-existent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS</li>
            <li> , it is still strong as when I first applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also, it washes out pretty easily since it&#x27;s water soluble.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These hair gels are all fairly pricey with the paul Mitchell being the most of the three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tigi bed head provides a gel that really keeps your hair looking dry and clean.</li>
            <li> The price is great for such a large size--this is my go-to from now on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many hair products in the past, and this wax is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t smell like some other products.</li>
            <li> I went with this due to the great reviews and Iam not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I will use the rest of it, and once it&#x27;s in it looks great and stays amazingly, but the application is something I&#x27;m finding a tough time getting used to.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is more than strong enough to style your hair, and it does not leave your hand filled with your hair that has fallen out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice soft looking hold, but very durable, except if you ride motorcycles, cause it can&#x27;t handle that, but it&#x27;s easy to fix post-ride.</li>
            <li> Starting at the top of my head, I apply the product in circular motions making sure to spread it across my roots to the tips of my hairs.&lt;br /&gt;7)</li>
            <li> super hold for inexpensive product</li>
            <li> adds tremendous volume to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He only buys this wax because he says the others look and feel sticky or simply don&#x27;t work as best.</li>
            <li> Luckily I found &amp;#34;bed head&amp;#34; and it works like a charm for my wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> This product gives me great hold, it&#x27;s easy to apply, you don&#x27;t need much to get the job done, and it washes out with minimal effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> came quickly and as advertised</li>
            <li> I also love the top which snaps open instead of having to unscrew each time.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and does not produce any flakes.  </li>
            <li> I never review any product, but in this particular case I wish someone would have advice me better on my decision.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m trying to make my most sincere objective way of rating this product.</li>
            <li> Once you can figure out the right ratio of how much you need this product will make your hair have an awesome matte finish with some serious hold that legit lasts me all day and all night!&lt;br /&gt;I can now say that I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it, last for as long as you want to leave it, washes out super easy, hold with a great dry look, not the kind you can run your fingers through but gives you a natural dry look for appearance and durability is great!</li>
            <li> guess I can&#x27;t fault this particular product too much because I wasn&#x27;t sure what to look for with this type of product, and now I&#x27;ve learned this is not as pliable and easy to apply as I&#x27;d hoped hair wax would be.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair which generally has a mind of its own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products for my thick wavy hair and this one is the best so far that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;Bed Head&#x27; brand is fast becoming my favourite choice for hair care and styling products.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon, all or most of the &#x27;Bed Head&#x27; products are available much cheaper at the click of a button.&lt;br /&gt;Regarding</li>
            <li> Has good hold on my ~2.5 in hair, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> To start off, the container of this product is superb, high quality, and not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made it a habit to buy my boyfriend a new hair wax to try every time he runs out so that he can decide which is his favorite.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my new favorite styling product, for $12</li>
            <li> I apply a finger full and rub in hands, then apply to my short-length coarse hair and the pliability is amazing when I work it</li>
            <li> This product really holds well, and it is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take much to style your hair.  </li>
            <li> So it makes your hair look more natural and full.  </li>
            <li> It looses it&#x27;s hold very quick and does not have the Matte finish the REAL version</li>
            <li> really like how easy it comes off my hands when I wash them after each use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Gives a great hold, smells good on the head, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> do almost any possible hairdo, last for hours nice touch nice smell , totally matte , simple a perfect product if you like matte waxes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too hard to wash off your hands, easy to apply, smells great  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make a mess, smells great and holds the hair in place.</li>
            <li> But overall, I love this product!</li>
            <li> Not even the real product!!</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> The best part about this product is that it will last you a very long time.</li>
            <li> Its definitely better than most gels and can be used with damp or dry hair.</li>
            <li> so before using your favorite shampoo run some regular bar soap through your hair and it will remove it easily before you shampoo.</li>
            <li> I personally like this slightly more than Fiber - as the hold strong</li>
            <li> A great wax, holds tight.</li>
            <li> Turns out though, that can&#x27;t break free from his usual nice, neat style too much, so I tried the wax on my bangs &amp; I liked it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 years now with plenty compliments on my hair from guys to girls, straight to gay and of all ages.</li>
            <li> Great product of you&#x27;re looking for a strong hold, minimal shine and natural finish.</li>
            <li> I bought this wax years ago, and it worked great -- all day hold, little shine.</li>
            <li> This has great hold and little shine.</li>
            <li> I personally place more priority on the matte look, so the weaker hold compared to some greasier waxes was fine for me.</li>
            <li> You also have to get your hair the way you like it pretty quickly, because it dries quick</li>
            <li> It has a very nice texture, almost like a thick cream, and easily distributes consistantly through my hair without clumping.</li>
            <li> Light and not too &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; smelling (since I&#x27;m a woman and don&#x27;t particularly want to smell like a man!).  </li>
            <li> This stuff is more of a dry cream that has no shine and everything I was looking for, I put it on right after a shower with toweled dried hair, I use about the size of a pea and it works great!</li>
            <li> Definitely buy this product if you want something that has amazing hold and a non-greasy look.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t as nice as it used to be, its more heavy and cream-ish than it used to be.</li>
            <li> Great one, even not as firm as I thought</li>
            <li> Works amazing on short to medium</li>
            <li> My only experience with this kind of product was Garnier Fructis Pliable Clay.  </li>
            <li> I end up with nicely defined curls that stay put for the entire day.</li>
            <li> But if you use it with wet hair you lose volume and it doesn&#x27;t look good.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite hair product to use.  </li>
            <li> It has a strong hold, but didn&#x27;t work too well for my particular style.</li>
            <li> I bet the old formulation was more in the 4-5 range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Try a final swipe over your eyebrows to give them texture/hold, as well, brushing up/away from the nose to set the direction; they&#x27;ll look nice and stay that way.</li>
            <li> I take 2 fingertips worth of product, and rub generously between my hands to heat it up and evenly distribute it.&lt;br /&gt;6)</li>
            <li> I declare it a manscaping success.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve many of these so far, and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> and it was so worth the 20</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t too strong and it gives a clean, masculine smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also similar to the others in terms of smelling nice, packaging, quantity, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s relatively affordable, gives my hair a &amp;#34;bedhead&amp;#34; look, doesn&#x27;t look greasy and has a nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thing that set TIGI&#x27;s wax ahead of the Fiber was the softer, more natural feel that my hair head compared to Fiber.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks now and this matte wax really is worth every penny in my opinion.</li>
            <li> imagine if you have straight hair or maybe even just not having thick hair this would be absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li> If I ever have to travel to Mars or another distant location, I will be sure to take as many as the spaceship will let me carry.</li>
            <li> So far this is one of the better hair products I&#x27;ve used, and its definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> can* smell it, which is rare.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more of a malleable natural hair look-making wax.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect hair product for guys with thin hair.  </li>
            <li> then tidy up the back and run a comb through the front to keep it up.</li>
            <li> so it looks the most natural my hair has ever looked with a hair product...</li>
            <li> Worth the price</li>
            <li> They are professional and always love to help!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hold is good and no real shine to it.</li>
            <li> is i need to use more of this than my old hair product(crew fiber) to get the hold i want.</li>
            <li> It worked nicely when my hair was short (1-3 inches)</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> this workable wax is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> This has got to be my favorite hair wax by far.</li>
            <li> Wow, so glad I took a chance on this wax.  </li>
            <li> when put through the hair (I use a finger or so&#x27;s worth after blow drying).</li>
            <li> It holds my hair up, giving it lasting volume and a soft natural texture while still providing excellent control.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This TIGI product is a nice blend of shiny and matte look, right in the middle in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It does take a bit of work to get the wax to go in all the right places, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> i use it on my hair when i put it up in a pony tail for work to tame all the fly aways and it holds for my 12hr shifts.</li>
            <li> I like my hair slicked pretty tight and this is great</li>
            <li> so i need something strong but at the same time not so strong that it&#x27;ll leave gunky crunchy residue on my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve smelled other stuff that smells REALLY good, but those kinds of hair products are made with a lot of carcinogenic ingredients.</li>
            <li> As other reviews have said this has good hold, and is truly a matte finish.</li>
            <li> Very Fast Shipping, would highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Gives it just the right amount of shape and hold.  </li>
            <li> So my advice: find the right amount of wetness your hair needs to be at before applying this product.</li>
            <li> This one is just the right balance of pliability without shine.</li>
            <li> The girl that cuts my hair rightly chided me for using this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Just right.</li>
            <li> then you&#x27;ve found the right product.</li>
            <li> right now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my go to right now.</li>
            <li> I found this works well, and the price is right.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, however this product is hands down the best product I have used with my fine fine hair.</li>
            <li> yes with abit of moisture on the head it turns out to be easy to style..but lets see im gonna try out new techniques of applying it like</li>
            <li> First, I wet my hair and get a good amount of water in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> wax makes controls your hair very well, and it does an especially good job at not making your hair rock hard (even if built up in certain areas).</li>
            <li> I love this product because I use a small amount and lightly coat my hair and beard and look great all day long.  </li>
            <li> This new product is nowhere near as sticky as the original, it is more like a paste.</li>
            <li> The thing that separates this from Gatsby the most is that you need significantly less to achieve significantly more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However on my second order the product wasn&#x27;t as smooth or easy to handle as before.  </li>
            <li> While it isn&#x27;t super potent, when anyone does actually smell it, compliments follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The more you put, the more dry and down it will feel, you have to apply just the right amount to get it looking nice without killing the volume of your hair.</li>
            <li> This had a short stint in &#x27;09 and is no longer available, but man this stuff was just as good as PM&#x27;s and was only like $4.</li>
            <li> This had a short stint in &#x27;09 and is no longer available, but man this stuff was just as good as PM&#x27;s and was only like $4.</li>
            <li> The thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it feels kind of strange in your hair.</li>
            <li> This product is simply the best, it leaves your hair looking great all day and does not leave a shiny or wet look, I&#x27;ve also used it on long and short hair</li>
            <li> I have fine, light blonde hair</li>
            <li> Proper all-day hold and superior humidity resistance for this hot New York City summer.</li>
            <li> This stuff, though it feels super sticky at first, actually comes off without having to wipe most of it off with a drying towel.</li>
            <li> This stuff, though it feels super sticky at first, actually comes off without having to wipe most of it off with a drying towel.</li>
            <li> It clumps together really easily and even wet was kind of hard to work in and make it look good.</li>
            <li> It offers hold and gives some shine, but isn&#x27;t greasy and is easy to wash out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> its good, not great, but better than everything else i had tried until bed head.  </li>
            <li> This one costs less and does just as good of a job.  </li>
            <li> It does have a slight scent to it, but I&#x27;m fairly indifferent to it when I *</li>
            <li> Smells great - like its a more expensive product.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well to give a good hold to hair, without any glossy or wet look.  </li>
            <li> - thanks very much mum!)</li>
            <li> You also don&#x27;t have to use very much.</li>
            <li> Decent price and and great hold a little waxy though</li>
            <li> I would say I have better control with the dry wax, but the Bed Head makes my hair look more natural and dryer looking.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this makes your hair look natural and feels fine running your fingers through it.&lt;br /&gt;i can adjust my hair through out</li>
            <li> The new formulation uses synthetic beeswax, and I believe there&#x27;s more &amp;#34;paraben&amp;#34; type chemicals in the new formulation.</li>
            <li> It has good hold with little grease.</li>
            <li> Other wise it takes way to long to receive and cost more.</li>
            <li> It most certainly is a great buy, especially when comparing it with others in-store, and it will last you quite a long time (I had mine for a good three and a half months).</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great product and is cheaper on amazon as Target and K mart have it for close to $20, and that is when they have it in stock because it&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li> I style it into a Nick Wooster-esque quiff, which is basically extremely short on the sides with a lot of length and disconnection on top.</li>
            <li> Great all day hold, leaves a matte finish, and my natural waves don&#x27;t reappear as soon as I step outside in the summer like they did with my old product.</li>
            <li> Before that I was using a combination of Garnier Play Style Reshapable Putty and a coat of Big Sexy Hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Before I used American Crew Fiber but always wanted something better.</li>
            <li> It definitely doesn&#x27;t give the hold that the TIGI gives, and looks a bit more greasy.</li>
            <li> It actually holds much much better than the strongest store bought gel.  </li>
            <li> My first wax product</li>
            <li> I did EXACTLY that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than the Gatsby or American Crew wax products.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, you can style and restyle as needed.</li>
            <li> Mitchell is very similar but it costs about 50% more.</li>
            <li> Probably better for short hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a clay than a wax as it&#x27;s not as shiny or sliming as traditional waxes.  </li>
            <li> This container will probably last me 2 more years</li>
            <li> in the morning, after you put this onto wet hair, it looks and holds pretty well, but it still looks like there&#x27;s some kind of gel in your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to products more similar to cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has the least greasy feel, but still has great hold.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Sumotech is a better product because it is not as sticky, but Sumotech is $30 dollars a jar, versus Bedhead which is only $10.</li>
            <li> Seems to be better mixed formula than what I buy in stores.</li>
            <li> is performing EXACTLY as advertised.</li>
            <li> Today was the first day I went to work with the wax in my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> everything held in place pretty well and only the wind in the evening was able to distort my hair temporarily, which wasn&#x27;t anything to complain about.&lt;br</li>
            <li> is the first wax I&#x27;ve tried, based on Amazon reviews, and it seems to be going well.</li>
            <li> After switching from American Crew Fiber, which I was pretty satisfied with, the first thing that I noticed was the smell--unlike AC, this doesn&#x27;t smell like glue</li>
            <li> only flaw I found was that if too much water and wax is applied, flaking may occur; however for the most part flaking was rare.</li>
            <li> Compared to American Crew Fiber, this is a bit better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very likely that it works better on guys with shorter hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, like almost all hair products, hot weather is a hair ruiner.</li>
            <li> be definitely be buying more when we run out.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;e exactly what they did with this wax.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll get nice spiked up hair without the flaky or overly wet spiky look.  </li>
            <li> A lot of the products he&#x27;s tried have been way to shinny, and this wax is exactly as described</li>
            <li> (thanks Grandpa!)  </li>
            <li> Would most likely buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- maintains the hairstyle even on hot &amp; sweaty days without creating run off from the sweat&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I am by no means a hair expert, but this is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is so much better than Crew or similar products and it lasts me about 3-4 months.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described, matte finish.</li>
            <li> I am pretty picky about getting my hair</li>
            <li> product works pretty well holding my hair in place.</li>
            <li> With the pop top I can just close it with the back of my hand.</li>
            <li> With the pop top I can just close it with the back of my hand.</li>
            <li> Pretty sticky, my grandson likes Gatsby (purple)</li>
            <li> This was one of the first products I tried when looking for a light-hold, disheveled/messy-look product, and it&#x27;s served me quite well.</li>
            <li> Distribute at&lt;br /&gt;roots first and work your way throughout your hair.</li>
            <li> I really recommend!</li>
            <li> I am almost out of my first jar and I will be ordering again soon.</li>
            <li> It lasts pretty well, and I can always re-style</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a more solid wax this is not for you.</li>
            <li> this is the first one I&#x27;ve used-</li>
            <li> When I first bought this product I thought it wasn&#x27;t what i was looking for after I tried it.</li>
            <li> ;) ....</li>
            <li> I even used a competitor brand after i ran out of the first one</li>
            <li> Definitely on my list of &amp;#34;Will be buying more of.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I am a side-sleeper and it is evident as I woke up with a lob-sided mohawk after I accidentally forgot to wash out the wax from my hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look like I have any product at all which is exactly what I want.</li>
            <li> Although I personally use the equivalent of a Tablespoon when styling my hair (my hair is extremely thick), I have been able to get great results with just a dime sized piece of the wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order more next week.</li>
            <li> The part I like the best is that my hair doesn&#x27;t look fake with the product in.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the natural look.</li>
            <li> More chances of having white spots on your hair while using fiber than while using TIGI - this happens when you do not spread the product evenly on your palm/fingers while applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> HAHA!</li>
            <li> Pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the hold consistent?</li>
            <li> If you want more of a shine/wet-look, then go back to the 80s.</li>
            <li> Be aware.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even seen smaller containers of this wax selling for more than $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Highly highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> and this was the first product his stylist recommended.</li>
            <li> , it does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> This is really good hair product for a dried look - not shiny which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It works on damp or dry hair, but i think it looks best styled when hair is towel-dried, a little damp.</li>
            <li> I loved that it showed the true color of my hair dye (super dark blue &amp;#34;Blue Muse&amp;#34; by Vidal Sessions).</li>
            <li> Clearly, I need a very powerful hair product to keep my hair up.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a good thing), and I think for the price they are both good products, comparable to AC fiber, and they both blow AXE away (impossible to wash away.. feel like they are on my hand</li>
            <li> Have tried American Crew Fiber and a number of other products, and for all-in-one, this is the best so far.</li>
            <li> , sometimes I use a bit of fine mist hairspray to hold it into place a little more.</li>
            <li> Good wax that isn&#x27;t too greasy and stiff.</li>
            <li> Super strong hold, lasts all day, and much stronger than American Crew Fiber.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for a good matte wax that will make hair appear natural.</li>
            <li> This wax gave me a nice hold with out the greasiness of other waxes.</li>
            <li> I chose this product based on other reviews, I can say I really liked it.</li>
            <li> Works great on my long, thin hair, giving me the ability to pull of a nice comb over look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, well as easy as any other wax, and doesn&#x27;t require much.</li>
            <li> It actually works pretty well, has pretty strong hold, and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This hair wax has been my favorite so far, it makes my hair look natural and still provides an all day hold for work.</li>
            <li> The reviews helped so much to make this a success-- don&#x27;t use too much, hair shld be damp.</li>
            <li> The American Crew Fiber is good, but it is so greasy it takes multiple washes to get out of your hair.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m going for a straight more slicked back look</li>
            <li> The hold is mediocre, can&#x27;t understand how this has so many good reviews.</li>
            <li> When i got this i was kind of skeptical about it, but after only my first day using it, it was great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strong hold that lasts all day without being stiff and you just have to make sure you don&#x27;t use too much so your hair won&#x27;t be too sticky.  </li>
            <li> The hold is pretty strong for short to short/medium hair.  </li>
            <li> I love how it makes my hair look, and how long the hold lasts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to control my hair all day long, all without a grease look to it.</li>
            <li> I put it in my hair in the morning and it pretty much holds all day, even in wind</li>
            <li> First off i will say it was much cheaper to buy here.</li>
            <li> Since I bought my first container they have changed the scent (which I don&#x27;t like as much now) and also the texture.</li>
            <li> Exactly the one I bought from the hair salon but so much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> No matter how much you rubbed it in your palms first, it always stayed rubbery.</li>
            <li> I have the gentleman&#x27;s cut with really long bangs and it was able to hold it all day</li>
            <li> Nice smooth, subtle scent.</li>
            <li> It is pretty hard washing it off your hair and hands since it sticks so good.</li>
            <li> Make sure that you work this product into dry hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff holds pretty much the whole day.</li>
            <li> When dry you can run your fingers through your&lt;br /&gt;hair and shape it even more.</li>
            <li> No flaky residue, easy to wash out, and revived with just simply wetting the fingers.</li>
            <li> Both times, I am handed off to an assistant who washes off the wax completely before even touching my hair with bare hands.</li>
            <li> Both times, I am handed off to an assistant who washes off the wax completely before even touching my hair with bare hands.</li>
            <li> Washes off your hands easily too, which is a big one for me.</li>
            <li> Used to use axe hair products, but they weren&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still searching for a perfect product for my thick, medium long hair.</li>
            <li> The Matte wax is the only product that I can find that provides a strong hold and is truly a Matte finish.  </li>
            <li> However, be careful when touching your hair in hot weather because it&#x27;s much easier to rub</li>
            <li> good texture, low shine, interesting (not good) smell, doesn&#x27;t hold well.</li>
            <li> He has shorter hair that is styled in a kind of mess look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very workable and easy to wash out later.</li>
            <li> I have thick dry hair, and this is the best hair wax I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> As I suspected, it works best in dry hair... at least to achieve the look I&#x27;m going for.</li>
            <li> As I suspected, it works best in dry hair... at least to achieve the look I&#x27;m going for.</li>
            <li> In fact, I would say that it works in much the same way as texturising paste, and is easily washed/rinsed</li>
            <li> you have fine hair, you definitely would NOT want to use this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through a lot and this one is one of my personal favorites.nd it was still fine</li>
            <li> My fine hair finally has some texture</li>
            <li> Demographically, I&#x27;m 20, male, with medium length fine blond hair, but a lot of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought two of these so far and have just finished my first tub (after about 6 months!)</li>
            <li> Pretty much since High School I&#x27;ve kept my head buzzed with a #1 length on clippers.</li>
            <li> Most Punjabi people have very thick hair, and mine is even thicker than most.</li>
            <li> on the hair, it is ok, but it shines a little more than American Crew Fiber and this is NOT the look I&#x27;m going for.  </li>
            <li> It smells very clean, and fresh, not sweet, fruity, or like perfume at all.</li>
            <li> Once the wax is applied there also isn&#x27;t much I can do to sculpt or style it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just hope the prices stay reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really like tgr seductive smell.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I really like this wax.</li>
            <li> The hold is really intense -</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find a straight review comparing the two products anywhere in my cursory search so, here&#x27;s a tip.</li>
            <li> Really like the product.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that it:&lt;br /&gt;* smells good&lt;br</li>
            <li> * doesn&#x27;t get really hard&lt;</li>
            <li> and knows what he wants in a hair product.  </li>
            <li> We found there weren&#x27;t many products that would hold his hair up all day without looking spikey or wet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After much research, we landed with this workable wax.</li>
            <li> Leaves glops in my hair and doesn&#x27;t style very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really torn with this hair wax.</li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t get quite as much hold</li>
            <li> I much prefer By Vilain&#x27;s wax.</li>
            <li> You need to really work the wax in your hand before applying.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really stay pliable through the day.</li>
            <li> I can really fault this product for</li>
            <li> The wax also seems to be drying out my hands a bit, not quite as much as the alcohol-containing hair gel</li>
            <li> Holds very well, without the shine.  </li>
            <li> This has replaced that product, and I&#x27;m so much happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the whole</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very matte finish, so if you want shine it may not be for you.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for shipping</li>
            <li> But it does not require a whole lot to get the hair to stand up.</li>
            <li> Really awsome product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really like the feel on my hair</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li> but it works really well.</li>
            <li> I have used a variety of waxes and pomades, but this stuff really tops them all.</li>
            <li> The wife can still run her fingers through it, but it&#x27;s much easier to shape.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s instantly ready after applying.</li>
            <li> Too much and your hair will look greasy.</li>
            <li> an wants a straight controlled look that lasts all day and night</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not using as much wax for my hair anymore...</li>
            <li> this stuff really trains your hair.. wish it was cheaper</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t straight up spike the whole thing--</li>
            <li> Very Tacky.</li>
            <li> it seems to hold much longer than AC Fiber.</li>
            <li> but it DOES adhere better even with wet hair than AC</li>
            <li> but it DOES adhere better even with wet hair than AC</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to flake much.</li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t really hold much.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be better, it says matte , but in reality , it&#x27;s still a bit greasy .</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> wax is very hard.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t really the products&#x27; fault; if you want separation with a matte finish I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Its very dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is the only hair product that my husband says works for him, it is light, not greasy, and gives his hair the hold and lift.</li>
            <li> but I really like this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still works very well and use it every day without issues</li>
            <li> The difference is the TIGI wax is a lot stickier, and stays sticky throughout the whole day, whereas the sumotech dries out and becomes soft/smooth.  </li>
            <li> thanks ..</li>
            <li> I really like this a lot.</li>
            <li> And he&#x27;s very picky.</li>
            <li> Keeps my style on hold even after hours and even after much movements.</li>
            <li> /regrowth  because it will make the hairloss look that much</li>
            <li> it is very workable once in your hair and has an all day hold&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t put product in my hair, it is bone straight, however with this product it adds volume and texture.</li>
            <li> On that note, it&#x27;s very affordable compared to others in</li>
            <li> so, I really like it</li>
            <li> Imagine you order a gallon of whole milk in a glass bottle, but you receive 3/4 of a gallon of fat-free milk in a plastic container.</li>
            <li> With this wax, you really don&#x27;t need much, and it maintains your hairs matte finish, while still keeping it in place.</li>
            <li> Product is matte if you dont use too much.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t really evenly distributes into your hair.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this product.  </li>
            <li> this (and a bit of hair spray) helps him style it the way he wants.</li>
            <li> It works your hair really well.</li>
            <li> for the record, this product(along with TONS of others) is far better than American Crew Fiber.</li>
            <li> This product works incredibly well on my thick Asian hair.</li>
            <li> your natural hair suddenly just became more behaved.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands with the old Tigi beating out all of them in hold while not causing shine.</li>
            <li> So far he&#x27;s gone through about 8 different brands and among his favorites were J. Crew Fiber and Go247, but the BedHead is his favorite.</li>
            <li> It is subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li> It is subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li> When the wetness of your hair disappears sometime later, the last thing you may want to touch is your own scalp.</li>
            <li> This is my backup when I have trouble finding Kevin Murphy&#x27;s Night Rider (or just don&#x27;t feel like spending that kind of money at the time).</li>
            <li> I combined with pomade a few times and liked the look.</li>
            <li> it is thick but seems to wash out good.</li>
            <li> Hands down, the best product I have used over the past 20 years.</li>
            <li> There are many that claim to have a matte finish, but very few are true matte.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He has fine hair that tends to fall flat and</li>
            <li> Stick to professional barbershops or drugstores to buy this product or an authorized dealer because this stuff will do harm to your hair!!!</li>
            <li> I have short hair and this works great at holding your hair in place but not making it too stiff.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s fine if you are looking for something with a little more hold and maybe a little thicker than Fiber (this also doesn&#x27;t wash out as easily as Fiber).</li>
            <li> Very natural look, good price, and long lasting hold.</li>
            <li> I also just received my first new brown container</li>
            <li> I also just received my first new brown container</li>
            <li> It allows me to create any style for my hair easily, and it lasts for all day long.</li>
            <li> Overall, I use this if I run out of my other products and have nothing else that provided as good of a hold without making my head feel like a sticky greased sculpture.</li>
            <li> Most of the other comparable products, which I didn&#x27;t like quite as much, cost me $25+.</li>
            <li> You only need to use a little bit at a time so its a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> Also, when you wash your hair, the product actually comes off very easily unlike many of the other products I mentioned above.</li>
            <li> This hair product works much better than any other product I have used.</li>
            <li> and I even tried some of their other satisfying products.</li>
            <li> I have noticed I need a bit more then other creams I have used before</li>
            <li> The texture is more matte than the other brands and doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy.</li>
            <li> It has the staple &#x27;Bed Head&#x27; scent and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue like so many other waxes on the market.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They recently changed the container design (it used to be black) but the product itself is the best I have used so far (and the first I can remember purchasing as a repeat customer in a very long time).</li>
            <li> I sometimes let my hair grow to 4+ inches, and this product still has the strength to give me consistent, matte, messy look that gets me more compliments than I probably need.</li>
            <li> much do you need to get a decent hold?  </li>
            <li> This particular product is very smelly.</li>
            <li> this re-workable wax product from the &#x27;For Men&#x27; range, I would most certainly recommend to guys who have slightly finer hair than others.</li>
            <li> This product is thicker and denser than most other products; however, unlike Fiber (with the wet sand feel), this product is still very creamy - thus it&#x27;s still easy to spread into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t very responsive to most products and tended to either become very oily when I applied enough product to actually control it.</li>
            <li> This product offers the strong hold on my stubborn Asian hair.</li>
            <li> I really like that I can use it as more of a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; if I don&#x27;t mess with my hair after its dry but can also style after it drys for a more natural look.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty long on the top (maybe 6\\&quot;) and extremely short on the sides (buzzed)</li>
            <li> so my hair normally shoots straight like a porcupine.</li>
            <li> - there&#x27;s a little plastic seal in there that you&#x27;ll be tempted to take out and throw away, because it gets in the way of the ease of access of the pop-up cap - my recommendation is to leave it in and just unscrew the whole top every time you want to use it.</li>
            <li> Think I found my new hair product!</li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a LONG way (about the very tip of one finger will hold a full head of hear for a full day).</li>
            <li> This wax still leaves a bit of shine, but it is less greasy than most products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff to replace my Enjoy Dry Wax, and I like the difference.</li>
            <li> hold is much better than my previous wax, and the matte finish is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Feels a bit unnatural, but that&#x27;s a given when using wax</li>
            <li> I use this or Enjoy Dry Hair Wax depending on the style I am trying to achieve on a given day.</li>
            <li> My hair is about an inch and a half on top</li>
            <li> Less is more, you guys.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s the real stuff, except it&#x27;s nowhere near as much as they charge at salons for it.</li>
            <li> Ive been trying to post a decent review of this product and amazon doesn&#x27;t let me me post it for some reason,</li>
            <li> Decent functionality, but it smells like</li>
            <li> I have coarse hair cut short that used to do whatever the heck it pleased.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many different men&#x27;s hair waxes (comparisons below) and I always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> I found this wax to provide a decent hold.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, especially if you have thick hair like me.</li>
            <li> I can smell it on my head for a couple of hours before it starts to dissipate, which is the only redeeming part since it doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
            <li> Lastly, when you compare this to my second favorite product which is Sumotech, the pricing of the TIGI Bead Head Men Matte Separation Wax cannot be beat.</li>
            <li> Decent strength and decent price.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t shine at all, and washes out relatively easily, mainly with water and perhaps a bit of shampoo/soap.</li>
            <li> I loved Sebastian crude clay and used that product for many years until the discontinued it.</li>
            <li> Ive used tea tree and american crew products and always found i had to keep getting more out to finally get it to stay.</li>
            <li> I have never had such ease working it quickly into my hair and going.</li>
            <li> We particularly like this for our boys because they play and play but their hair will keep its style.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more &#x27;sticky&#x27; if that makes any sense as it is much more difficult to rub on your hands before applying to your hair.  </li>
            <li> I wear my hair in the classic side part now with about 4&amp;#34; of length.</li>
            <li> This does a decent job.</li>
            <li> This stuff was decent.</li>
            <li> Overall it is okay product for the price, but I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily</li>
            <li> The American Crew is much less sticky right off the bat, it comes out feeling more like a modern day wax/pomade than a hardcore clay.</li>
            <li> (Thanks to an aunt that worked at Sally&#x27;s Beauty and a sister who&#x27;s a professional stylist/esthetician!)</li>
            <li> Strong hold, adds volume, washes out easily and doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp like hair spray and other gels can!</li>
            <li> I have tight fade on the sides of my hair and about ~3in on top.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is highly moldable throughout the day and does not smell at all.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> high quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this because I ran out of some really high quality hair sculting gel/wax from Brazil I had been using for a while.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> all the time I highly wreak amend this to anyone that has curly hair</li>
            <li> Highly recommend buying from Amazon because this will cost about $17 at a target/walmart.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Why all the high ratings?  </li>
            <li> i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This wax is great - doesn&#x27;t leave my hair too greasy, and I really only need a VERY small amount to get my hair in a workable shape.</li>
            <li> it flat, always shine free and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> I have short hair, so l use about half a fingertip&#x27;s amount of product for my hair, but l don&#x27;t think anyone would need more than one fingertip&#x27;s worth per session.</li>
            <li> It is very firm, dry wax, but works great, holds all day and doesn&#x27;t flake off.</li>
            <li> Love how it holds, and I can change my hair throughout the day with just a little water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason for 4 stars and not 5, is that I feel this wax could and should have a little bit more hold.</li>
            <li> a little water in hands to make more playable.</li>
            <li> The first day using this was fine and after a few days of using it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to easily style my hair with the amount of hold i want without being stiff or wet looking.  </li>
            <li> Best to work in when hair is a little wet, or to wet hands a bit to work in.</li>
            <li> , it is very thick at first, so you have to rub it in your hands first before putting it in your hair, the more you rub it</li>
            <li> I have yet to notice a huge difference in the two products, and I don&#x27;t think my usage is as sophisticated or specific enough to justify buying the TIGI versus the Joico (especially since I&#x27;m low on cash!)</li>
            <li> I pulled out an old container of this stuff and noticed -- this company once used REAL beeswax, and it has now been replaced with SYNTHETIC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, this great product is now completely mediocre.</li>
            <li> My hair is very shiny naturally and this does not give me the matte look.</li>
            <li> A great product for men who don&#x27;t like American Crew or Axe and want to look great without any hassle or terrible scent.</li>
            <li> Great quality product that isn&#x27;t overly expensive.</li>
            <li> Probably because most people using this stuff don&#x27;t know and don&#x27;t care about lathering your head everyday with carcinogenic and endocrine disrupting chemicals.</li>
            <li> I also feel this wax works better on short to medium length hair as opposed to long.</li>
            <li> Taking price into consideration and overall quality, Bedhead wins.</li>
            <li> Better hold than the Crew Pomades and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hold---8/10--- I last the whole day and your able to just wet it and reshape it.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I used it everyday, but AC Fiber had a plastic smell to it that I didn&#x27;t love.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I used it everyday, but AC Fiber had a plastic smell to it that I didn&#x27;t love.</li>
            <li> He is Asian, and his hair is about 3 inches long on top.</li>
            <li> After using this and a few hair products, this item seems to give better results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything from American Crew, and for my hair this product beats all those.</li>
            <li> Still, both of these commercial brands have chemicals and I&#x27;ll personally be looking to move onto a more natural product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also worth noting that I only use the product (as I&#x27;ve done with others); meaning I don&#x27;t use hair spray, or a blow drier, or whatever,</li>
            <li> As for my style, I normally have a Zayn Malik type haircut or a combover type-thing; I dont know what to call it.</li>
            <li> I think this is good for short hair but not too long spkies like muhawk or long fuhawk</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell that&#x27;s very subtle.  </li>
            <li> It is too thick and just isn&#x27;t effective at all.</li>
            <li> Easy to work with, though it can clump together a little if it&#x27;s not warm enough; I always make sure to get it warm enough before applying.</li>
            <li> half the size).&lt;br /&gt;The smell on this is very mild but it works very well in my hair and holds it all day in a very natural looking way.</li>
            <li> Is not hard to blend..</li>
            <li> Not at all greasy and not hard</li>
            <li> I have smooth straight black hair.</li>
            <li> I use this probably 6 days out of the week, and if it&#x27;s anything like the AC Fiber which I used the same amount of, then it will last me about 3-4 months easily.</li>
            <li> I use this probably 6 days out of the week, and if it&#x27;s anything like the AC Fiber which I used the same amount of, then it will last me about 3-4 months easily.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s sort of beach-y, works much better in dry hair, I put it in last thing before going out the door</li>
            <li> It has a nice neutral smell that doesn&#x27;t smell too artificial and not too strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different products, but this one is just the right mixture of hold and texture for me.</li>
            <li> It holds all day and when used right it doesn&#x27;t leave a white, greasy residue!</li>
            <li> Too tacky for my very straight &amp; fine hair, even in small quantities.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much, didn&#x27;t keep the hair straight and white globs would show up if a decent amount is used.</li>
            <li> My first experience with the company was when I got my hair cut professionally for the first time as a 16 year old teenage lad.</li>
            <li> Nothing but good stuff to say:  a little goes a long way, almost no smell, not greasy, strong enough to last all day without making your hair overly stiff/hard, can be easily reworked with your fingers if needed, washes out easily, never flakes, etc.  </li>
            <li> Holds my difficult fine hair in place waaayyy better than Regis styling mud or whatever.</li>
            <li> Ive been looking everywhere for this particular product for a couple months and finally found it here for a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> If you go too light, it doesn&#x27;t do anything or the hold is not consistent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s matte but it gives my hair a nice little shine (I think that&#x27;s specific to my hair color not the product).</li>
            <li> This is my new goto.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to using hair products, but it works for me.  </li>
            <li> My new hair product from this point on</li>
            <li> And maybe because this stuff is new to my routine...</li>
            <li> And maybe because this stuff is new to my routine...</li>
            <li> I think I found my new go to hair product.  </li>
            <li> I have been searching for a new hair product after my standby product was discontinued.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this item, the image on the listing was of the new formula (twisting metal lid with brown label)</li>
            <li> Not a 6 stars because the picture shows the new container design in aluminum</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very nice (not overwhelming) and unlike other waxes, this one does not leave you looking like a greaser.</li>
            <li> But if you cool it down again, it goes right back to normal!</li>
            <li> The barber jacked up my hair, so I bought this to style it more effectively and now my hair doesn&#x27;t look too bad.</li>
            <li> I have medium length, heavier hair and wanted a product light enough to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> What I particularly like is that it looks natural with no oily shine.  </li>
            <li> The cream is more sticky and thicker, which makes it harder to apply than the Tea Tree Shaping Cream, but this is not a big issue once you get used to it.</li>
            <li> This is the only hair product I have ever been able to find that doesn&#x27;t make your hair look wet and greasy and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair, and of the products I have this works the best, but you really have to water it down as the texture is extremely firm.</li>
            <li> Other products often look very shiny in your hair and it is evident that there is gel/product in your hair, but this is very discreet.</li>
            <li> To have a more direct feel on the texture difference, imagine you leaving the new version one open exposed in air for a long time, with some moisture gone, the dryer remainder feel like the old formula, tougher to apply but hold</li>
            <li> In three different occasions me and my buddies order from this link since May 2015 this year, with the first one arrived being the original formula in black can (75g), the second one being the new silver version (85g, as seen in pictures) and the most recent one being the black original version again.</li>
            <li> Very natural look.</li>
            <li> And the delivery was very fast, only that it was a restricted product and it took me a lot of time and money to get it out from the customs, no one told me about that.</li>
            <li> very little product.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts most of the day unless you&#x27;ve been scratching your head at work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Matte finish, strong hold, long lasting.</li>
            <li> Strong and long lasting hold.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good but sometimes makes hair too hard!!!</li>
            <li> It has an odd smell, but once you get used to it its fine.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t keep your hair exactly how you style it, but you hair will resiliently keep to that basic shape.  </li>
            <li> This TIGI one actually smells pretty darn</li>
            <li> It washes out 100 times better than other similar products that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> It is easier to apply, but that is a small gain compared to the many negatives.</li>
            <li> This will be the first I will purchase a second time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A dimes worth on a finger will go a long way with application.</li>
            <li> Normally, American Crew&#x27;s product left my hair a bit harder than I liked, but eventually softened up.</li>
            <li> Just need to get some water in the hair before applying this stuff or you&#x27;ll look funny with white wax in the hair.</li>
            <li> My favorite as I&#x27;ve tried countless other brands as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with pretty short hair</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, and I plan to keep using it in the future.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny, I actually put it on at night when I got it and went to sleep with it on.</li>
            <li> It definitely holds up for many hours when applied correctly, and works well with other hair products or sprays.</li>
            <li> and if i blow hot air to melt the wax, it gives it a different look.</li>
            <li> I constantly used Fiber by American Crew but this was significantly cheaper but works twice as well.  </li>
            <li> Bought 2 of these, I have pretty regular hair</li>
            <li> So far I like the Alterna Hemp Hair Concrete</li>
            <li> This Wax is ok but can not compare with the other products mentioned above.</li>
            <li> It is the exact same wax that I&#x27;ve seen for $15+ elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I am able to use it to pull my hair back from sitting in front of my eyes to a swept back look similar to this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[</li>
            <li> The best way to use this product is to, using your index finger, pull out a small amount (the material is very thick) and spread it into both of your hands.</li>
            <li> I know this because I compared the old and new ingredient lists.</li>
            <li> I enjoy all of those products, but wanted something with a less greasy and shiny feel and look.</li>
            <li> Usually have trouble keeping my hair to stand, but this stuff works great.  </li>
            <li> I can easily achieve a messy or a neater look depending on my mood.</li>
            <li> It gives hold while still making your hair feel fresh and dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally shampoo much, maybe only once or twice a week, but even with shampoo</li>
            <li> I have been using almost all of the usual suspects and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> This wax certainly does that and only a small amount is needed, in most cases, to get the job done.</li>
            <li> just a little in your SLIGHTLY damp hair, and youre good to go.  </li>
            <li> I was previously using Mitchell Tea Tree gel, which i loved the smell but that gel was a little too &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; for my preferences.</li>
            <li> A big mistake I made when I first used this product was using too much and not spreading it enough.</li>
            <li> I used a much more expensive product for a long time, but I&#x27;m glad I discovered this.</li>
            <li> it gives you dry look if you applied a little and little oily look if you applied more just like Daniel Day-Lewis, love this product.</li>
            <li> Holds up my hair the whole day, and it really gives you that dry matte look.</li>
            <li> It is typically 50% more if purchased at your local retailer.</li>
            <li> It simply means less hold, and more shine.</li>
            <li> My hair is very light and soft so its hard to get it to shape and look the way I want it too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best if you keep your hair a little wet as this stuff is really dry but not too wet.</li>
            <li> The consistency will feel very sticky, but once put into your damp to dry hair (depending on how much shine you want), it comes out completely matte.</li>
            <li> When I wore it messy and kept it around 2&amp;#34; it worked fine.</li>
            <li> A little hard to manipulate but results are great and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> that I have tried Tigi&#x27;s re-workable wax, I will certainly be adding it to my top ten list of hair-care products, probably alternating it between the firm-hold gel and the &#x27;Hard To Get&#x27; texturising paste.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s definitely better products out there, but for the price I paid it&#x27;s hard to beat.</li>
            <li> but you really have to be careful how much you use.  </li>
            <li> This product is like a waxy cream rather than a clear gel.  </li>
            <li> This wax is clear and workable.</li>
            <li> I love it but is getting harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li> As well as a Redkin wax, Crew Fiber, and Paul Mitchell Clean Cut which was my previous wax.  </li>
            <li> it is not messy at all.</li>
            <li> but this stuff works just plenty well for me in giving a natural look</li>
            <li> Its very similar to crew fiber but is easier to work in and doesn&#x27;t clump as much.  </li>
            <li> This product gives you control and hold,  but feels natural.  </li>
            <li> This stuff&#x27;s reasonably priced and nothing else short of glue will do what this wax does--</li>
            <li> 16 year old girls want 18 year old boys to smell.</li>
            <li> Also sometimes if you use too much it will leave your hair looking white at the ends where you applied it.</li>
            <li> In addition, it does make your hair styling look so natural.</li>
            <li> Beware not to use too much on your hair or the residue is not going to spread evenly, therefore leaving some white wax on your hair.</li>
            <li> So far its been a year</li>
            <li> hair has a natural look and holds the style even on a windy day.</li>
            <li> I would use this after blow drying my hair and it would keep it soft and natural looking all day.</li>
            <li> so far-</li>
            <li> However, after about 2 hours, if you run your hands through your hair and restyle, you can achieve a really natural look.</li>
            <li> My scalp is quite sensitive to products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not like a soft gelly application.</li>
            <li> natural looking &amp;#34;bedhead&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the product is now very close to the American Crew Fiber paste but with a weaker hold.</li>
            <li> Comfortable, not too messy, not too shiny.</li>
            <li> This does provide a natural look unlike a lot of those pomades, though.</li>
            <li> #34;synthetic bees wax&amp;#34; instead of the natural Bees wax it used to contain.</li>
            <li> I go to the gym early in the morning</li>
            <li> /&gt;After applying this to my hair, my hair still has volume and the natural look.  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my 8 year old boys hair.</li>
            <li> but it holds for a lot longer and still gives off a natural look.</li>
            <li> This will obviously vary depending on how much oil your head produces throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Kept it neat and professional.</li>
            <li> It does not flake and keeps my hair looking natural and in place all day.</li>
            <li> I comb the front over after and it looks as natural as you can get after using something.</li>
            <li> This stuff holds very well with just a tiny amount!</li>
            <li> works really well, though the only thing i dont like is that sometimes it makes my hair/scalp smell funky (like mildew)  </li>
            <li> Product work as advertised and it holds well and last the whole day.</li>
            <li> If at any time, you touch your hair to perhaps alter the style, or fix a mistake you did not catch earlier, your hands once again have a sticky residue that is very troublesome to get rid</li>
            <li> However, I now frequently use it for my beard (when I let it grow out).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product out there that does the job he wants.  </li>
            <li> so I was fairly surprised.  </li>
            <li> If I use too much it will be flaky and have white specs.</li>
            <li> and it gives you that natural bed hair look where you can fix it up at your liking.</li>
            <li> natural does the hair feel throughout the day?  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the chemical/soapy smell, but I&#x27;m scent sensitive.</li>
            <li> Buy this wax if you want something that smells absolutely fricken terrific.  </li>
            <li> Been using it for a year so far</li>
            <li> you are chemically sensitive and want a pomade for your hair, buy the TIGI Bed Head stick: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NRXYM/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o09_s00_i00</li>
            <li> About a year ago my boyfriend started getting his hair professionally cut and styled</li>
            <li> So overall, this ends up being a good product, just not a great one.</li>
            <li> After a quick two minute blow dry and mousse, I simply add this in by hand (don&#x27;t use too much), and I can tame my wild locks with a quick flick of the wrist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wax, but the texture acts very much like dry clay</li>
            <li> Ok so this product doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars for price, but it&#x27;s not as expensive as others I&#x27;ve tried and as of right now (06/28/12) on Amazon its under $15.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair, and the product is still relatively easy to apply after a little getting used to, plus it washes out in the shower extremely easily.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes your hair look dry and natural, but really holds it in place!</li>
            <li> If you want some shine, you can put more into your hair and it will start to look very slick</li>
            <li> +) but on amazon I save a significant amount and purchase a few to stock up.</li>
            <li> With other products sometimes it seems to have absorbed or something and by the end of the day</li>
            <li> It is completely matte without any gloss, has high hold that will last all day.</li>
            <li> Once you do, it provides decent hold and a matte finish, but I would say after using this product, I only like the way my hair looks maybe</li>
            <li> I used to have trouble with the bed head stick not holding very well in the heat of summer, but this wax must have a higher melting point.</li>
            <li> would only need a small quarter size to run through your hair and it stays stylish throughout the day....</li>
            <li> At first it is more &amp;#34;solid&amp;#34; or denser than other products, and it&#x27;s hard to work into your hands, but once you have it worked in your hands</li>
            <li> However, as of now, this will be my first and last attempt at switching away from American Crew Fiber.</li>
            <li> Does the same thing as the older product.</li>
            <li> Smells a lot different when compared to the older mixture.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a replacement for American Crew: Classic Fiber.</li>
            <li> Currently being sold at the Fort Bragg, NC North PX (Main Gate).</li>
            <li> This was a tough decision for me to try a new hair product, but I didn&#x27;t want to use gels any more.</li>
            <li> and then you&#x27;re left in a bigger mess trying to fix it if you still have more styling to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My pomade of choice is American Crew Pomade, with Medium Hold and High Shine.  </li>
            <li> As someone who moved from So Cal to Atlanta, I had to find a new product because my old hair product just didn&#x27;t stand up to the Southern humidity.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase and that is saying something as I am not very brand loyal.  </li>
            <li> I tried other products similar to this, but I keep coming back to this as it is easy to work with and does not produce a shiny look, which is what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It washes out easy and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down as long as you don&#x27;t use too much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the wax is applied onto your hair (post towel-drying) and it is styled to your preferences (so long as it does not try to defy gravity too much), the hold remains for the duration of the day.</li>
            <li> And last, but not least...</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different brands of hair wax, and this is definitely may favorite.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably go back to what I normally use after i finish this.</li>
            <li> Gives your hair a shiny, wet look, but not a greasy look - although it does leave it feeling a bit crisp.</li>
            <li> The hold of the new paste is also nowhere near the hold of the old black container which lasted a whole day.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely thick and pretty difficult to manage so if you have fine hair it may work much better for you.</li>
            <li> Smell---10/10, its very clean and subtle smelling that lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;While some people like the older version for it containing real bee wax (yes, the new silver version use synthetic bee wax), I found myself like the newer formula better, part of the reason that I&#x27;m very unhappy for receiving the black one again on my most recent order.</li>
            <li> The only downside for this is that I feel like it makes my hair just a bit too stiff ( I have fine hair)</li>
            <li> If you wanted that straight up glued look, I suppose you could use it on dry</li>
            <li> This has made using the product very convenient when I do not have time to completely dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is a dry wax so it does not leave a shine or hardness on his hair but keeps it in place how he wants it.</li>
            <li> It also works very well when you towel dry.</li>
            <li> At least with the Joico, you get more bang for your buck, at the same quality.</li>
            <li> If you have longer hair and use too much, you will be sorry.  :)</li>
            <li> The opinions expressed here should not be taken as any legal or medical advise these are just my personal experiences/opinions. </li>
            <li> In one instance of an intimate encounter I was cuddling next to someone and my hair brushed against her skin.</li>
            <li> In one instance of an intimate encounter I was cuddling next to someone and my hair brushed against her skin.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ve found that if i don&#x27;t thin out the wax a bit, even after rubbing it to warm it up, it can leave white on his hair.</li>
            <li> The hold was also strong as advertised - a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> As long as you let your hair dry JUST enough, but not TOO dry, you can use this to work some magic.</li>
            <li> other than that, i just rub in my palm/fingers and put it on my hair first than start adjusting how i like it.</li>
            <li> and it seems like I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in it!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any weird odors and washes off my hands pretty easily.  </li>
            <li> I have a medium military fade, short on top but enough to spike in the front (a military haircut).</li>
            <li> It does hold my flat asian hair for a whole day without greasy look.</li>
            <li> I have flat, straight Asian hair</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey, and you have to order it online, but it is well worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little cheaper, but I guess it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Use way less than you think you will need when applying it, and make sure your hair is towel-dry (toweled off but still SLIGHTLY damp).</li>
            <li> My hands only get slightly greasy when touching, but it holds enough weight where it doesn&#x27;t stick straight up after working in the heat for a few hours.</li>
            <li> time I shop for a product like this, I think I will go for something that is a little more workable for thick, stubborn, straight hair like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was using Aveda&#x27;s Grooming Clay for a bit, but I find this has better hold and less mess.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, TIGI&#x27;s product felt more aqueous and less glue-like, plus it was easier to wash off without that gross feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can make a jar last months where I am lucky if the other last a month or 2.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to use too much or your hair will turn into a rock.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like it when you start to get near the bottom of the tub it hardens and makes it unusable.</li>
            <li> It holds your hair really well and unlike others it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or wet look.</li>
            <li> I could barely run my fingers through it and made me look like I stepped out of an 80&#x27;s movie.</li>
            <li> Holds very well, but be careful to apply evenly or you&#x27;ll have chunks in your hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried several brands of hair &amp;#34;goop&amp;#34; and so far this one is my favorite.&lt;br</li>
            <li> only complaint is that, in terms of texture, it seems to have the same hold as cheaper products, notably Joico Ice Erratic Molding Clay.</li>
            <li> With bed head not only does it keep my hair in place but it leaves it soft and i can even run my fingers through it without compromising the hold.</li>
            <li> It has a medium hold that will last all day and gives a natural look.</li>
            <li> and in the heat just barely sticky?</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;You get what you pay for&amp;#34; does not apply, because I&#x27;m surprised they&#x27;re not charging double.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m never going back to the old products because this works the way I want it to work.&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
            <li> The strength is considerable and can even last me over night if I decide to not wash my hair.</li>
            <li> People are always surprised that I actually do have some form of hair product in my hair, and if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for, this is the product you want.</li>
            <li> Since then, they have stopped carrying this product at the salon and he&#x27;s tried several others, but this is by far my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First of all, this product works really well for my thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will not be buying this again and sadly will have to go back to the far superior Sumotech, which I hate paying for, but it makes my hair look great.</li>
            <li> This wax is crazy good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not put this on to wet hair, as it will not style well, must be dry hair in order for it to do it&#x27;s magic, also use a thick large comb to comb your hair or you can just use your fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I, personally, have very fine and thin hair (which I get from my mother</li>
            <li> All 3 I received in an order from a seller (who I bought from for the first time) were watered down and thinner.</li>
            <li> Two star for their arbitrarily mixing the new and old versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it actually lasted me a total of 88 days before I had to order a new</li>
            <li> it offers a dry natural look</li>
            <li> no particular order of concern it is important to note that once the item has been sitting around for the duration of a month (despite regular use), the wax begins to harden along the outside and soften on the inside within its closed container.</li>
            <li> After a few trials of getting the right amount to prevent a glossy appearance on my hair</li>
            <li> It just takes a few times using it to figure out the right amount for the look and feel you are going for.  </li>
            <li> those with curly, frizzy or messy hair: I would definitely avoid this wax and spend a little more money to get something like J Beverly Clear Wax.</li>
            <li> It only gets better, you only need to use a subtle amount.</li>
            <li> I want my hair to look natural, but maybe even give it that flat iron look without having to straighten it.  </li>
            <li> Really sticky, but if other stuff doesn&#x27;t do the job this will.</li>
            <li> I have thick, straight asian hair by the way, and I must say, this wax works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, 17 years old with a full head of thick, darker blonde hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For a long time I was searching high and low for a product that would hold my super-thick hair, and not leave it looking like I dipped my head in Crisco.</li>
            <li> But I guess the inconsistency might cause other people trouble and it is so easily avoidable, but they haven&#x27;t done so.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know how you can go wrong buying this product for how cheap it</li>
            <li> There is a ton of product available as well, I expect this to last me at least 6 months from date of purchase.</li>
            <li> I have really thick coarse hair and was looking for a light hold product.  </li>
            <li> use it everyday, about a fingernail&#x27;s worth (or two, depending on how my hair is acting).</li>
            <li> I found a few good ones,  but was never completely happy with them.  </li>
            <li> first I thought the price was a bit steep, but then I realized how little of it you need each day</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t sleep with this, because it will probably make your hair look like a mess that&#x27;s much harder to clean</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works great in the heat and the cold!</li>
            <li> The actual wax itself is legit,  it&#x27;s not a rip-off like other reviews state.</li>
            <li> I ordered it along with 2 similar products (both from American Crew), all at the same time, to compare them, and this was the clear winner.  </li>
            <li> I really like the fact that I can put this stuff in my hair and wet it the next day to get the same look.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what its name suggests: It is a quality wax that you can work through your hair in order to give a messy separation while giving a matte shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, this is a lot more difficult to use than American Crew Fiber - which is what I have used for years.  </li>
            <li> I had used the AC Fiber for a few years now and it does exactly what I want it</li>
            <li> It does give hair a natural look, it does not get as hard as gel and is definitely better than the stiff I used before.</li>
            <li> On the performance part, this product definitely delivers as promised: it really does hold well - even in difficult weather, like hot temperatures, high humidity etc. -</li>
            <li> Pretty basic, a little too oily for my taste and makes my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> Anything longer, and it&#x27;s super hard to work through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is less greasy than Garnier and doesn&#x27;t darken my hair as much.  </li>
            <li> If I want a lot of hold, I let my hair dry almost completely.</li>
            <li> Just a natural dry.</li>
            <li> I usually dry until my hair is at the &amp;#34;almost completely dry&amp;#34</li>
            <li> If you want to the dry Pompadour professional look.....</li>
            <li> Fiber gave me the ability to add volume to my hair and make it look less... combed and straight</li>
            <li> I have straight black hair and it works in well.</li>
            <li> less than $20, expectations are already pretty low; there&#x27;s a lot more expensive products out there that didn&#x27;t even help, but I gave this one a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a heavy user myself (I get through a jar in three weeks, Ok it is a small jar but still)</li>
            <li> SUPER thick</li>
            <li> Hair quickly develops a thick, slightly-sticky and sandy texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it used real beeswax and overall less toxic ingredients than what&#x27;s in the formula now.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about BedHead Matte Separation Wax is that it is a bit difficult to wash out; I definitely find myself using more shampoo and spending more time massaging my hair in the shower to get all of it out, as compared to other products.</li>
            <li> I have heavy, coarse, Asian hair that when long will defeat this stuff but with a fresh cut it will hold up.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair, and a lot of it.</li>
            <li> I have gone through nearly 4 containers of this product and have found that it provides a matte finish and good, but not great, hold, and it can be hard to work through hair when it is dry.</li>
            <li> My hair grows fast and tends to frizz out a little bit if I don&#x27;t have something in it.</li>
            <li> I keep my hair really short - less than an inch on top and barely enough to pinch on the sides and back - so a little of this goes a long way, for a long time.</li>
            <li> In addition to this, a little goes a long way, which justifies the higher cost.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little waxy for my preference, and it really needs to be washed out with shampoo before restyling your hair the next day.</li>
            <li> half the reason I&#x27;m writing this review is to compare it to the American Crew equivalent (by product description: high hold/low shine) Fiber.</li>
            <li> If I run thru my hair 8 hours or so after initially applying the product, I can sometimes get a messy/natural look that looks really cool and is impossible to get if you&#x27;re putting this stuff in your hair fresh out of the shower.</li>
            <li> The hold strength and matte look is approximately the same when comparing to certain types of Gatsby, but I only need a few smudges on my fingers and I&#x27;m good to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who hasn&#x27;t used hair wax before, it&#x27;s a bit awkward at first</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product...buy it if you want a new look to your hair that won&#x27;t let you down.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I spray a small bit of hairspray for initial hold and then enjoy playing with the hair later; after it has dried.</li>
            <li> Since this is a wax, your significant other, by definition, will not like it because your hair will be sticky and hard to play with.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, and a little thin.  </li>
            <li> At least it&#x27;s hold is phenomenal but the process is not enjoyable.</li>
            <li> only a small amount spread around your hands will take care of your whole head, depending on the length of your hair.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s definitely going to last a long while.  </li>
            <li> only minor issue I see with this product is that it leaves my hair feeling somewhat sticky to the touch for the first few hours, but it&#x27;s certainly not a large enough shortcoming for me to look for another product.</li>
            <li> it does exactly what i want my hair to do(which is hard</li>
            <li> (Ohh and WARNING: if you get too much wax in one spot you will have a white creamy spot that will NEVER blend just be careful and use a little bit at a time and build it up to what you need)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad because I was pretty excited about the product.</li>
            <li> It holds my hair up very well even during harsh humidity weather!</li>
            <li> : To use it, just sprinkle one hand under water for an instant, then shake it off so it&#x27;s barely wet, then mix a tiny dab of this stuff in and rub your hands together; this will make a totally homogenous goo that will evenly rub into your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hold last all day long regardless the weather.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot) leave my hair flat by midday.</li>
            <li> then flat iron then finish by using this product to get the look desired.</li>
            <li> Make my hair go flat too.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this stuff holds pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I bought this wax for my husband who had a new hairstyle because he wanted something to make it look a little &amp;#34;funkier&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just your average middle class father/husband, but who&#x27;s had major hair product experience</li>
            <li> I hate the look of men&#x27;s hair when it looks hard or like there is a ton of product in it, so this is perfect.</li>
            <li> my hair is hard to manage no matter the length (varies from super short to slightly shaggy throughout the year.)</li>
            <li> Every few years I have to find a new hair product because it discontinues.  </li>
            <li> It is a true wax, meaning it is hard to break down on my fingers and palms and work through my locks.</li>
            <li> Its very long lasting!</li>
            <li> One tip is to try using it with different levels of dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I WAS using, but still enough to notice dry flaky skin on the fingers I use to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just use a tiny dab on dry hair and it does the trick.</li>
            <li> but I received the old formula in a black plastic container.</li>
            <li> As the hair becomes harder throughout the day, it becomes slightly more difficult to wash out.  </li>
            <li> This is glue, I used it for a month and it is the sole reason why my scalp would become dry.</li>
            <li> If you want something with a firm hold that has a natural, matte looking finish with low shine, this product is for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> If you have thin-short hair this would probably do for you, but if you have thick straight asian hair like me - this product is sub-par compared.</li>
            <li> Because it is so strong it can clump and be difficult to wash out of hair and hands.  </li>
            <li> I can then style it by combing it back; then run my fingers through it for a bit of a textured look, and my hair will stay put all day long if i want!!</li>
            <li> This might be the case with other waxes too, but I find that this effect is easier to achieve versus using the blue American Crew pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried countless other hair waxes and i finally found one that works.</li>
            <li> I literally get comments from women about my hair a few times a week, which didn&#x27;t happen very often with any other products.</li>
            <li> I prefer this to Suave and other more expensive molding paste products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Actually last longer then Axe products because you need less to get the same lasting results.</li>
            <li> the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s hard to manage loose strains of hair that you need to get in place since this is more of a thick textured application.</li>
            <li> It is cheaper than many of the other products out there and holds up my thick, straight hair without fail.</li>
            <li> It looks and feels amazing, also there&#x27;s not any bad smell.</li>
            <li> I used crew fiber for a long time but decided to try this being that it is a bit cheaper.  </li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> That is minor problem in my opinion</li>
            <li> I tried putting this in my hair while it was wet and then blowdrying it into shape but that made my hair feel sticky and it definitely didn&#x27;t give me a matte finish that way.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this a while ago and its lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> Im going to use this for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> And it stays on for a long time.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> long</li>
            <li> Long hold.</li>
            <li> Gos a long way too.</li>
            <li> The hair product arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> But it will hold your hair all day long.  </li>
            <li> The product holds my hair well in the shape i want in and stays all day long.  </li>
            <li> It still works the same but harder to use.  </li>
            <li> My hair is about 6inches long</li>
            <li> Wet your hair, rub off with a towel, and then put a tiny bit into your hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Quality&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Holds up my pompadour style hair all day long.</li>
            <li> Gives a medium to low shine depending on how wet your hair is.</li>
            <li> My husband loves using this hair product, it allows for a soft, textured, spiky look - without having it look crusty, shiny or really heavy with product.</li>
            <li> It really does give your hair a matted, thick look to it.</li>
            <li> If you struggled with hair products that don&#x27;t really do much for your thick and/or curly hair, this product is for you.</li>
            <li> The only down side for me is if you put too much especially in the front part of your hair it makes it spike up.</li>
            <li> At this point my hair is still too wet to have this product applied, so I use a blow dryer to further dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> The only downside is that your hair will start to feel slightly sticky and sandy several hours after application.  </li>
            <li> WOW, this stuff is stiff.  </li>
            <li> Finding just the right wax is EXTREMELY frustrating.</li>
            <li> It is soft and will allow you to tame the wilder hairs.</li>
            <li> The new one is less stiff to apply and hold well enough for my purpose.</li>
            <li> Extremely greasy, I only use it if I&#x27;m out of everything else or have a while</li>
            <li> Other products I&#x27;ve tried stop working by the end of 1 day, and the hair is back in my face.</li>
            <li> I have tried and tried a lot of different products but for some reason everything I used made my hair matt together or shine or one thing or the other.</li>
            <li> I have used Bumble and Bumble SumoTech, Gatsby (all of the different colors), Paul Sebastian, Crew Fiber, and a myriad of other clay/wax products.</li>
            <li> Other products that I have left in like this tend to run out in my sweat and burn my eyes this one did not.</li>
            <li> Even a little moisture in your hair makes it more difficult for the wax to fully adhere...</li>
            <li> Even a little moisture in your hair makes it more difficult for the wax to fully adhere...</li>
            <li> Other waxes that I used (including American Crew&#x27;s Fiber) just didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped, and I&#x27;d all but given up on finding something.</li>
            <li> the easier it is to put in your hair, and when it comes to hairloss, you don&#x27;t want to try to place this in your hair without rubbing it in your hands first because it will pull out weak hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please see my other reviews to compare against all of the above products.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty thick, coarse hair, and I&#x27;ve always had trouble finding stuff to control it, but this does the trick well.  </li>
            <li> Others have said that this doesn&#x27;t hold for very long, which I would disagree with.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for hard to manage hair.</li>
            <li> Being new to this game of hair product (prior product was gel only)</li>
            <li> You need your hair to be mostly dry</li>
            <li> I recommend using this with dry hair</li>
            <li> Finish looks dry.</li>
            <li> But not blow-dried dry (where the hair looks feathery and 80&#x27;s style).</li>
            <li> No hairdryer needed if you apply to dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Then I use a towel to dry out the excess water.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> The water in your hair needs to dry out, until then it could change shape if you&#x27;re moving your head a lot.</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s dry, I haven&#x27;t had it deform my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t make the mistake of applying it on dry hair.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that I can put it on damp hair or dry but get results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes ur hair look really dry..</li>
            <li> can start to harden/dry a bit based on environmental conditions (if around steam or dry heat too</li>
            <li> With Bedhead, I jump out of the shower, towel dry, work about a dime size in and within 30 seconds</li>
            <li> with my fingers and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> Your hair will look dry, yet styled.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like how &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; my hair was after it would dry.</li>
            <li> Applies well damp or dry.  </li>
            <li> It gives your hair a dry look hold</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few dozen different gels and various hair products over the years.  </li>
            <li> My main complaint with this wax is the scent.</li>
            <li> I have long, naturally wavy hair, and this wax when used in a small amount</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really works on thin, straight hair to give it manageable results that actually hold.</li>
            <li> Tried a few different brands (mainly American Crew)</li>
            <li> Kind of sad how people will be dishonest just to make money.</li>
            <li> It definitely works, but I have thick hair with tons of cowlicks and going for a neat, professional look</li>
            <li> Despite how coarse it gets, my hair remained natural looking yet controlled (I have thick, wavy hair).</li>
            <li> If you use too much, its a little too stiff and gooey.  </li>
            <li> I find if you use a drop of a base putty or wax first such as Gatsby Ultra hard wax this stuff works even better.  </li>
            <li> I use a small amount in the morning, and it lasts the whole day without running down your forehead.  </li>
            <li> It has limited hold.</li>
            <li> It is hard when i want to do a simple pomp or combover or anything really when I use other pomades because they are not strong enough.</li>
            <li> It is not worth the extra hassle in the morning</li>
            <li> It is not worth the extra hassle in the morning</li>
            <li> Does what it is suppose to and is easier to get of your hair compared to some other waxes that take a few washes to completely get out.</li>
            <li> i have wicked thick hair, so i usually sport my hair pretty short.  </li>
            <li> I have been on a hunt for a hair product that could hold my hair up all day long, but also not give a wet look.</li>
            <li> i have gel for the loose strands.</li>
            <li> (it won&#x27;t loose hold if you swae all day, hell</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t even loose hold after a 2 hour dive in the north Pacific...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, since this is a wax, I have to blow dry my hair every morning to quickly get it styled the way I want it.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Image Gelwhip but those @$$holes changed the formula and forced me to try something new.  </li>
            <li> This product acts more like a gel since when it drys up its impossible to do anything to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d previously been using American Crew&#x27;s Fiber product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in both wet and dry hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seems to work wet or dry molded looks.</li>
            <li> Doing so will add a slight shine but relatively still gives a &amp;#34;dry-look&amp;#34; if that&#x27;s what you are looking for</li>
            <li> You can use on dry or wet hair, but works in easier with damp hair.</li>
            <li> I like to put it in my hair when it&#x27;s dry and then fluff it up a bit.  </li>
            <li> Its matt and its not super sticky that you can&#x27;t wash it off without a second shampooing.</li>
            <li> I was previously using American Crew&#x27;s fiber and I had no problems with that.</li>
            <li> I use less and it last longer.  </li>
            <li> If you are black plastic tube series user looking for the next one, be warned.</li>
            <li> Still around half left even after a couple months of use.</li>
            <li> In the past, I have used all American crew products (except grooming cream), gatsby purple and gatsby pink, difi products, Sebastian craft clay, Osmo clay, KMS molding clay, Paul Mitchell tea tree shaping cream, etc., just to name several products I have used.</li>
            <li> I became very ill and went through powerful medications which made my hair fall out in chunks, which takes months to grow back and even longer to grow back evenly.</li>
            <li> I have short hair that I sort of spike up with a dry, messy look.  </li>
            <li> Minor detail, but one less annoyance in the morning goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Minor detail, but one less annoyance in the morning goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wet hair, semi wet hair, almost dry hair, etc.</li>
            <li> It a really sticky feeling, very hard to apply no matter how you do it.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, within about a week the stuff starts to firm up (no matter how tightly you close the lid), and then it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as it did when it was a paste.</li>
            <li> This little tub will last forever</li>
            <li> You just have to play with it a little to figure out how to properly use it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend starting with a little bit on your finger and rub it on your hands then work it in to your hair.</li>
            <li> I got one that is a little bit different by the container</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty thick and this product is probably one of the few that keeps the due up without turning me into a Greaser.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, straight hair</li>
            <li> It does however start to smell a little bad at the end of the day and the wax tends to dry out pretty fast if you leave the lid open a little.</li>
            <li> Despite the small size, this will no doubt last for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look wet.</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> I had been using American crew fiber for few years and thought that I would never ever changed to others till I put this one on.</li>
            <li> It was a messy solution that also left a lot of stickiness in between my palm.</li>
            <li> The product is very &amp;#34; tacky &amp;#34; &amp;#34; gluey &amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li> Not really a smell.</li>
            <li> Would recommend putting in your hair when wet.</li>
            <li> I can fluff my hair curly or cob</li>
            <li> my hair is too wet</li>
            <li> has proven trickier than I expected with this.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s why it still looks kinda shiny or wet.</li>
            <li> I just wish it didn&#x27;t look wet or shiny at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All those brands would give me headaches from the smell and/or chemicals and would make my eyes feel heavy and sleepy, likely from the greasiness/stickiness.</li>
            <li> the wet look</li>
            <li> No real scent to deal with.</li>
            <li> It held my hair firmly in place and if i ran my hand through it, it&#x27;d go back to how it was.</li>
            <li> Will continuing purchasing it monthly, one of few waxes that actually allow me to mold my hair the way I want it to.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t use a lot, and I use it on my wet hair</li>
            <li> so no shiny wet looking hair.</li>
            <li> TIGI is not very sticky on your fingers while applying.</li>
            <li> received as expected.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> Again, not a huge deal, but definitely appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Again, not a huge deal, but definitely appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To be honest I hate using this wax.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to the original sticky wax that was in the black container you will be sorely disappointed once you receive the new redesigned product in a metal container.</li>
            <li> Product left my hair stiff and sticky, nothing close to a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; feel for styling purposes.  </li>
            <li> After about two years of no hair products, except for shampoo, I was sick of not being able to do my hair.</li>
            <li> Spikey might be a bad word to use since it&#x27;s a bit extreme, but I noticed the hair groups together more than I want.</li>
            <li> The hold is not strong enough for my medium length hair though.</li>
            <li> My hair is less than 2 inches long at the longest.  </li>
            <li> and with other producta I have used, it gets too clumped, and wet looking.</li>
            <li> My only complaint with this product is that is does not hold up in humid/hot weather at all; as soon as you step outside with this product in your hair, it will fall down.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of sumotech by bumble &amp; bumble but that stuff has a less sticky dry to it.</li>
            <li> negative is that the hold doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> otherwise, the wax will stay in your hair and you can keep styling it after you dry off again, albeit with a slightly looser result thereafter.</li>
            <li> Compared to Tea Tree Shaping Cream by Paul Mitchell, this product has slightly less shine and a little bit longer lasting hold.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy at all and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Smells like oranges, gets semi-chunky and you have to bust it up, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> With this wax, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little product goes a long way in the hair.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Remember a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so</li>
            <li> I decided to buy into the hype behind the high ratings for this product and just don&#x27;t get it.  </li>
            <li> Very little goes a long way when you apply it to dry hair.</li>
            <li> The product is great and doesn&#x27;t harden like water based pomades (really gross and hard looking hair), and doesn&#x27;t shine like oil based pomades (shiny and awful to wash out).</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other product.</li>
            <li> have been hit and miss on other products in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about 6-8 other products</li>
            <li> I read other reviews on here, and hoped they were right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I do notice some clumping of hair when using this, whereas other products seem to not make my hair so &amp;#34;spikey&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My hair style is usually just slicked back and this product works wonders for the style.</li>
            <li> Once the product is fully applied (no excess product left in hair and all parts of hair have been covered), I use a comb to slick my hair back.&lt;br /&gt;Tip</li>
            <li> It usually holds the same all day.</li>
            <li> it in with minimal water or damp hair then style!</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick/straight hair.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s extremely versatile for styling any look.</li>
            <li> Axe creams and other spiking gels.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly what I was hoping for</li>
            <li> For the past 6 months I&#x27;ve actually been growing out my hair and styling it.</li>
            <li> I have shorter hair and this product only requires a small dab.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Previously he was using DE:fi extreme hold for years.</li>
            <li> as a reasonably small amount can do the job for an entire day; a container lasts me</li>
            <li> I have tried different waxes in the past, but non seem to work for my hair.</li>
            <li> It does not leave an oily sheen in my hair like other cheaper matte wax products.</li>
            <li> I know 13 bucks sounds like a lot for such a small amount</li>
            <li> Personally I like to have a little maneuverability with my hair throughout the day to fix little things here or there, but not with this product.</li>
            <li> As some other people have mentioned in their reviews it doesn&#x27;t leave grease stains and if you fall asleep for a nap</li>
            <li> smell unlike some other matte stuff I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This stuff is extremely sticky....</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely stubborn.</li>
            <li> Not exactly.  </li>
            <li> but this over some other products.</li>
            <li> Other products he&#x27;s tried had that sandalwood smell, which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Texture: as other reviewers have said, it&#x27;s a matte, flexible hold that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> No unwanted sheen/shine like in other products&lt;</li>
            <li> I would use this over other waxes.</li>
            <li> before I go out so it can dry a little.</li>
            <li> a little dry looking</li>
            <li> I have thin straight hair, and I was looking for something to add a little matte texture and body to it, and</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s a little too solid to work into your type of hair just add few drops of water before working it in.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after using hair gel that worked OK, but dried out my hands so badly my fingers would crack and bleed.</li>
            <li> after a few days would get sticky and nasty and would have to use shampoo...if you use shampoo then it washes out great and will work for you.</li>
            <li> heavy wax firm hold (yellow one):</li>
            <li> Even helps with my cow licks.</li>
            <li> I have been searching everywhere for a hair product (wax, gel, etc) that will give me that messy hair, out of bed look without making my hair look dry or shiny.  </li>
            <li> Not much needed for per use and leave my hair with a slight shine.</li>
            <li> once it is all dried, especially if you are those who use styling products while the hair is still towel dried (damp).</li>
            <li> Very disappointed because read a lot of good reviews.</li>
            <li> This product leaves your hair stiff and dry.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a little bit harder than this to hold hair in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too tough or too soft</li>
            <li> It does feel slightly greasier than other waxes I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s hard to ask for a lasting hold from a non-gel product, but it CAN be done people.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is, its hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> Along with that, my hands were always left with a sticky feel that was hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> One container should last you at least 2 months.  </li>
            <li> This seems like a silly perk, but it&#x27;s actually appreciated.</li>
            <li> This seems like a silly perk, but it&#x27;s actually appreciated.</li>
            <li> I usually struggle finding a product that can hold my hair that long.  </li>
            <li> An average amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As my supplies finally dwindled, I was forced to search for an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Back in 2010, I was economically forced to purchase....</li>
            <li> The coolest part is that you can restyle your hair, if you still have wax in your hair, by adding wet hands and styling again for those times when hair gets messy or from exercising</li>
            <li> The wax is firm, yet after spreading it across my hands and into my hair, my hair become pliable and the hold stays just about all day unless it gets wet.</li>
            <li> This can probably be curbed if you use a lesser amount; however, if you have thick hair, be prepared to experience this downside.bably be curbed if you use a lesser amount; however, if you have thick hair, be prepared to experience this downside.</li>
            <li> Well, I have thick and curly short hair.  </li>
            <li> Its thick and leaves white residue.</li>
            <li> It takes very little, and lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> ive said before, this brand never lets me down.</li>
            <li> and this beats them hands down.</li>
            <li> Lasts for a ling time and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> so I wanted something that would hold down the sides and flyaways.</li>
            <li> Hands down, the highest hold, lowest shine product I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> doesnt look like gel or feel crunchy like gel and other products!</li>
            <li> and i usually just take a shower in the mornings, towel dry my hair, and put about a dime-amount in my palm and rub it in my hair.</li>
            <li> My only problem is that it makes your hair a little hard.</li>
            <li> You only need to use a small amount,  so the expensive container will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I hate paying a premium for hair products, and every kind of paste, wax and pomade for men seems to cost at least $15 in a grocery or big box store, and at least $20 at a barber shop or salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually wait until my hair is slightly damp, but mostly dry before putting this product in my hair.</li>
            <li> works gently, but I think this is little bit expensive.</li>
            <li> The wax also feels very thick and heavy in the hair, and does makes me want to shower nearly immediately after putting it on.</li>
            <li> I have various hair styles, but it works for almost all of them, including keeping my hair in that hard to get messy but up look.</li>
            <li> It has a slight waxy smell, and that&#x27;s it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> half the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Idk...I think I&#x27;ll experiment with the less toxic hair care products.</li>
            <li> Idk...I think I&#x27;ll experiment with the less toxic hair care products.</li>
            <li> I was previously using Axe Shine Pomade.</li>
            <li> The smell is neutral like previous review but it took me a while to get used to.</li>
            <li> Less sticky and holds well.</li>
            <li> I got the black container which is not the one pictured on the page.</li>
            <li> and I am not even half way through the container.</li>
            <li> but my preference is while it is still slightly damp after showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (generally less</li>
            <li> Seriously, sometimes I&#x27;ll forget to wash it out before bed and my hair will look the same as when I went to sleep!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I will look for something with less maintenance.the wax from my hair.</li>
            <li> but I will look for something with less maintenance.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Sebastian craft clay before they cut the size in half and doubled the price.</li>
            <li> Fiber lasts slightly longer than TIGI Matte Separation wax.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> and it shines when you work with slightly damp hair.</li>
            <li> , instead I received the black plastic one.</li>
            <li> Personally I want a semi-natural messy spikey look ( I have thick hair), but I want it to stay like that all day and night.  </li>
            <li> If you use more than necessary for your hair length, you will have a nasty mess on your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If your hair is too wet, the wax will melt/dissolve into your hair and you&#x27;ll end up looking like a slick guido.</li>
            <li> If you want something to hold your hair exactly how you want it, without a crusty artificial look, this is your stuff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t spend money and time on my hair just to have someone run their hands through it during the day and mess it all up.</li>
            <li> Works wonders and has late a long time.</li>
            <li> a guy, I have thick medium to long hair that I like to style with volume.</li>
            <li> , I wish this was a little less shiny looking</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both this and the Fat Hair thickening pomade workable wax interchangeably, but prefer this one slightly since it seems to be a little easier to work into my hair.  </li>
            <li> down side is that the product is heavy and is quite noticeable when you run your fingers through it.</li>
            <li> You need 2x as much as Bumble and Bumble Sumo Tech, 1.5-Ounce Jar, it smells bad and lasts half as long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male with very thick, dark hair.</li>
            <li> This wax is truly &#x27;matte&#x27;, &#x27;dry&#x27;, THICK.</li>
            <li> It came in a all black round plastic container.</li>
            <li> Put it on your fingertips and mix with a LITTLE water.  </li>
            <li> Although that hair regimen worked well, my hair looked a little too shiny.</li>
            <li> I (dumbly) forgot my second tub of TIGI Bed Head at home and couldn&#x27;t find the product in any stores nearby.</li>
            <li> This stuff is just a little too matte, it makes my hair look</li>
            <li> A little dab is all it</li>
            <li> Also a little bit sticky.</li>
            <li> ; point but still has a little cold/wetness feeling in it.&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li> Added a little bit of water and combed my hair again</li>
            <li> You can style any shape with your hair after using a little bit of this wax.</li>
            <li> Bought hoping it would be a little thinner and lighter than Crew Fiber.</li>
            <li> A little bit will&lt;br</li>
            <li> i also use it on my 2 boys and their little faux hawks.</li>
            <li> it feels a little too greasy/heavy, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Until one day I did my research and came to this little guy.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> Apply a little water or apply to damp hair to make styling easier.</li>
            <li> But, this TIGI Bed Head Men Matte Separation Wax is just a little bit better(and cheaper).</li>
            <li> You just need to put a little bit of it and your set.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes along way with this product.</li>
            <li> Redken Outplay texture putty&amp;#34; which gives it a little shine.</li>
            <li> Still have about half left, so it lasts approximately 8 months for me.</li>
            <li> and I find that manufacturers have largely neglected this in men&#x27;s products, which is disappointing.</li>
            <li> If you have colored hair, it doesn&#x27;t weigh down to the color and doesn&#x27;t make it darker!</li>
            <li> the was is very thick and white.</li>
            <li> an asian with very thick hair and my hair grown moderatley, Iv used this for like a couple of days</li>
            <li> If the wax if left on your scalp and you have very thick hair, you wake up to a mirror</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair hard or greasy and is pliable just by running your wet hands through your hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Context: I am south asian with thick, hard to manage hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that once it dries out completely it loses its quality.</li>
            <li> Pro tip for others with thick, wavy hair... rub some coconut oil into your hair while it&#x27;s still wet, I started doing this about two months ago</li>
            <li> messy look.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time, or money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time, or money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want it messy, this will allow that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Firm all day hold.  </li>
            <li> : Give this product a few minutes to &amp;#34;settle&amp;#34; in your hair.</li>
            <li> It may take a few tries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve slept with it still in my hair by accident a few nights and it doesn&#x27;t flake out.</li>
            <li> I have thin short hair</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and/or heavy.  </li>
            <li> after I&#x27;ve towel dried it a bit out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Washes out with shampoo without any trouble, unlike products like the Bed Head wax stick.</li>
            <li> Felt like I was putting dried out play-doh in my hair.</li>
            <li> the messy look (oxymoron)</li>
            <li> styling wax that give my hair the messy look</li>
            <li> In that predicament, what you may have is a can of dried up Elmer&#x27;s glue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use as an everyday product.</li>
            <li> Like I said, this is the stickiest stuff I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used quite a few</li>
            <li> firm hold without the gloss</li>
            <li> Both have a firm hold which lasts throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I tried it out a few times and stopped.  </li>
            <li> and it became pretty much impossible to find.  </li>
            <li> and this is one of the few products that can tame, flatten, and style it.</li>
            <li> In the morning, the combed wax on my hair looked like it was untouched, not oily, but semi shiny, doesn&#x27;t give the hard hair feel as much as other waxes and also doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s balding your scalp away either.</li>
            <li> It holds my hair style without making it look too stiff.</li>
            <li> but it makes your hair stiff and not playable which I like.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t look stiff or shiny.</li>
            <li> I feel my hair and it feels stiff and waxy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the product to be so stiff.</li>
            <li> It gets stiff when it dries but its not sticky or crusty like some gels get.  </li>
            <li> The product is just way too stiff for my hair and felt like it was going to break off.</li>
            <li> It gives a lot of volume to your hair without looking waxy or stiff.  </li>
            <li> Its stuck like that unless you wash it off or just plain deal with it.</li>
            <li> Using gel made me look like a sleazeball and didn&#x27;t really tame it.  </li>
            <li> The secret to this stuff is that a little bit goes A LONG WAY!</li>
            <li> helps tame the frizz.</li>
            <li> I usually rub little bit of this in my hands then evenly through my hair and it holds all day.</li>
            <li> The one negative is that it has slightly less of a hold, but that&#x27;s not a huge priority for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It holds my hair as tight as I want it, doesn&#x27;t leave my hands sticky, and keeps hold through heat &amp; humidity (and even sleeping!</li>
            <li> To accomplish this look I usually use Redken polish up, some john frieda products, and axe messy look paste.</li>
            <li> gave it a few tries but always left my head feeling clammy, and my hair looked and felt oily and dirty</li>
            <li> If you like to run your fingers through your hair this will definitely make that a little difficult.</li>
            <li> The only negative I have to say is that it tends to leave a flaky residue behind.  </li>
            <li> I have really thick, black hair as a result from being Indian, speicifcally Punjabi.</li>
            <li> Thin individual hairs, thick head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, if I use just a little bit, perfection!</li>
            <li> The only thing that&#x27;s a little difficult is that it has to go on damp hair, but that&#x27;s a small thing to worry about.</li>
            <li> While this product does have a matte finish and a firm hold, it is not suitable for thin/fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is a HARD WAX that is tacky and takes a little effort and warmth before spreading and being pliable.</li>
            <li> A little hard to work in.</li>
            <li> I use very little and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> There is very little smell which means I don&#x27;t get headaches like I get with the others.</li>
            <li> Conclusion, its an average wax product with laughable maneuverability and leaves your hair feeling hard and not a natural feel.</li>
            <li> Trust me, is really really that bad.</li>
            <li> im not one who usually gels his hair</li>
            <li> Been using this for the past 4 years.</li>
            <li> I got this stuff based on the rave reviews and have to say I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> #34;I haven&#x27;t moved past 90&#x27;s fashion&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> no more shiny hair.</li>
            <li> Just a small dab in the morning and it stays in place all day and all night.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would buy again.</li>
            <li> product has a faint manly scent, similar to axe maybe?&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Just use a small amount.</li>
            <li> No more paste.</li>
            <li> Not really sure if I should buy again.</li>
            <li> While it does have some hold to it, I think it is too difficult to &amp;#34;play&amp;#34; with it especially if you have long-ish hair like I do.</li>
            <li> The size may seem small, but you do not need to use a lot of wax to style your hair.  </li>
            <li> But over the past six months or so, I&#x27;ve noticed that it &amp;#34;falls out&amp;#34; after about five hours.</li>
            <li> You HAVE to use a small amount though.</li>
            <li> I use it in my Beard in small amounts to correct the grain.</li>
            <li> ; AUTOMATICALLY MEANT SLICK.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not overwhelming, but that it&#x27;s not odorless</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not overwhelming, but that it&#x27;s not odorless</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use this but decided to try this one out just for the heck of it.</li>
            <li> After using it a few times I realize it&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been looking for all along!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting it into a small bottle for air travel.</li>
            <li> so not sure how those things would tie</li>
            <li> or any time of day, I just happen to use it in the morning) at a small dime-sized amount, this wax leaves a sticky residue on your hair, hands, the container, and whatever else you may touch (perhaps your faucet, sink, or towel as you may try to wash off the wax from your hands).</li>
            <li> I use a really small amount.</li>
            <li> While the container is fairly small, it lasts me about three months.</li>
            <li> Over the past year, I have been in search of the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; hair creme/wax which provides the highest hold and a matte look.  </li>
            <li> It gives the hair a very natural hold that lasts throughout the day, and without making it shiny or unpleasant to run your fingers through (which my girlfriend appreciates).</li>
            <li> Used in *very* small quantities, this wax provides a subtle hold with no visible shine, clumping or other signs that you are using hair product.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and difficult to apply, and seems to make my curly hair a total mess.</li>
            <li> Almost no smell with a few subtle floral notes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and there is never a build up or a stiff feeling!</li>
            <li> Also, when my hair was a 3-5 inches long, the product had a difficult time keeping my hair in the position I wanted.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty unruly hair and hate using gel.</li>
            <li> This however, is just not suitable for my hair type.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not very easy to work into your hair.</li>
            <li> so it saves us a few hard earned bucks as well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly strong and really disgusting.</li>
            <li> Has a strong hold that lasts just about all day and doesn&#x27;t have that insane hardness that makes you feel like you&#x27;re wearing a helmet.</li>
            <li> Product is to hard to apply.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve learned the hard way, applying to damp hair will lead to clumps.</li>
            <li> However, over time, when you don&#x27;t use the wax, it creates this surface that dries up and remains hard.</li>
            <li> hard to apply.</li>
            <li> I wanted to see if it was anything like the TIGI Hard</li>
            <li> Hard to find that combination with the pastes out there</li>
            <li> /&gt;We were looking for something that would help style his way, removing frizz and maintain the hairstyle he wanted, without the hard look and residue that gel leaves.</li>
            <li> 3 stars as of now hard to use or maybe I just suck for now its suavecito for me...</li>
            <li> Your hair does feel hard though.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to hold in place or to keep shaped all day.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It can be hard to find this in stores</li>
            <li> Hard to shampoo out</li>
            <li> - it gets a bit hard inside the puck once the product gets thinned out.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick and heavy, medium length hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used Star Wax and it had such a sickening fragrance that I had to send it back.</li>
            <li> But I prefer non-water containing products, at least not for me.</li>
            <li> The TIGI Bed Head hold lasts me all day, at least from 8am until 11pm.  </li>
            <li> recommend to anybody like matt wax, at least after they fix this mix-and-match issue.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the spike look at least not in the front of my hair.</li>
            <li> This is what David Tennent uses, so I bought some, and now I have hair like his, but honestly, I am not any happier than I otherwise would have been.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this keeps it under control and manageable.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, for thick hair, this product does not hold well.</li>
            <li> (I have thick hair), and I wouldn&#x27;t notice those clumps until I saw them in the mirror.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly thick hair</li>
            <li> have wavy, thick oily hair.</li>
            <li> but I have extremely thick hair</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m just forced to use a lot of this because of my hair</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been told I&#x27;ve got thick</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> My hair is thick too and its just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I needed a product that held my (thick) hair while not looking like I put a pound of gel in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you have thick hair, it&#x27;s a no-brainer to buy this product.</li>
            <li> (i have thick hair) always making you tug and pull your hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly/wavy hair, so gel was no longer an option for me after the hair fell.</li>
            <li> My hair is 1-2 inches, extremely thick</li>
            <li> Once the product is settled in to my hair, it is practically impossible to touch hair or re-shape it, which became a major flaw, at least for my taste.</li>
            <li> Not sure what happened, but don&#x27;t like it at all!</li>
            <li> , they are usually too weak or make your hair a helmet.</li>
            <li> So what does that mean?</li>
            <li> By wax, they mean wax.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t mean I do this all the time</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product I hated it.</li>
            <li> All you need is a very small amount.</li>
            <li> It has a subtle smell - people can&#x27;t smell your hair from a mile away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only wrong, but really wrong.</li>
            <li> but I hated the constant wet greasy</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair pliable yet stable with a subtle shine that doesn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> it actually wasn&#x27;t THAT bad.  </li>
            <li> If my hair is wet, it usually won&#x27;t hold or I end up with bad hair.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> The hold of the Axe problem was atrocious, and it always left my hair feeling oily, shiny, douche-smelly, etc.</li>
            <li> This product is not good.</li>
            <li> This Tigi matte separation is not exceptionally good or anything.</li>
            <li> It also leaves your hair feeling very hard like you put gel instead of wax.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am a man with very thick hair.</li>
            <li> The wax is in a form of very thick and matte material.</li>
            <li> its very thick don&#x27;t expect to run your fingers through your hair with ease.</li>
            <li> I have very thick corse hair</li>
            <li> I am not an expert on hair wax, but this felt very thick to me.</li>
            <li> For the purposes of imagery, hair on your head will feel akin to combing your hand inside dried-up rice pudding or dried-up oatmeal (assuming your hair is very thick, which mine is).</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my &amp;#34;head hair&amp;#34; but I have since decided that it&#x27;s too expensive and hard to massage in for the hair on my head.</li>
            <li> I subtracted one star because it started to go bad before it was empty</li>
            <li> Got tired of looking like</li>
            <li> I take a dab and rub it into a thin layer on my palms then use that to apply.</li>
            <li> (although when applied, AC&#x27;s gluey smell was nonexistent).</li>
            <li> This paste is extremely thick and difficult to distribute on your hair.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to guys with thin hair.</li>
            <li> Because once I take out a dollop, muck up my hands, I don&#x27;t necessarily want to get the crap all over the sides of the container.</li>
            <li> Because once I take out a dollop, muck up my hands, I don&#x27;t necessarily want to get the crap all over the sides of the container.</li>
            <li> the case is broken already</li>
            <li> Adds a lot of texture and volume to my thin hair.</li>
            <li> After leaving the wax in your hair for an extended period of time and accidentally sleeping in it, your hair must be washed thoroughly because it is very difficult to control if the scalp is just washed with water then slowly dried with a towel.</li>

            <li> But after extensive tryouts, I decided to stop using it, the way your hair feels is just bad!</li>
            <li> Real hard to style hair with it.</li>
            <li> The wax is really tough and somewhat difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think its a bad product in general, i just think its a bad product for me.</li>
            <li> Axe products are the worst as far as fragrance goes.</li>
            <li> This was either horrible or old.</li>
            <li> I have real thick hair, like real thick</li>
            <li> oh and hard, crunchy hair!!</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not to shiny; I hate appearing as if a cow has lick me.</li>
            <li> , I ALWAYS have to cocktail products, because I have difficult hair.</li>
            <li> It was expensive at around $16 delivered, but woeh every penny.  </li>
            <li> Can be a bit difficult to wash out.</li>
            <li> Think stereotypical overpowering musky deodorant type smells.</li>
            <li> In stores it is rather expensive ($16</li>
            <li> Sadly, they just stopped making it.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, they just stopped making it.  </li>
            <li> Would use again if it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> it is kinda difficult to use...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really shocking how much of a different it</li>
            <li> This product is sticky and difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> so I could be using it all wrong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, you won&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, you won&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> and the Fiber can be difficult at times to work with.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The wax also seems difficult to remove from my hair.</li>
            <li> Bit expensive</li>
            <li> I used to use Alterna Hemp Styling mud, but unfortunately it&#x27;s been discontinued.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to re-shape during the day unless you drench a lot of water on your head.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s normally expensive at the salon.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong--</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it to be prohibitively expensive,</li>
            <li> Cant really go wrong with any bed head product.</li>
            <li> I came across the Bed Head Men&#x27;s Matte Separation Wax randomly on Amazon and gave it a try.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it was just too time-consuming, and I still got the sticky feel that I get from hair gel.  </li>
            <li> This product was fake .I</li>
            <li> even though it&#x27;s expensive the quality and value makes me buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want it to be flat and boring.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when you put the wax in your hair, it acts as some sort of glue and makes it impossible to move again.</li>
            <li> but I hated how it made my hair rock hard</li>
            <li> They make my hair feel greasy and dirty.  </li>
            <li> WAS AFRAID</li>
            <li> But If i were anyone deciding to buy these products over the internet, I suggest you buy them when the climate is cold in your area</li>
            <li> If they mad one of these with shine I&#x27;d buy a lifetime supply.</li>
            <li> Cant go wrong here!</li>
            <li> Lame!</li>
            <li> one is very difficult to apply.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Its very difficult to work into your hair</li>
            <li> but this is by no means a bad product.  </li>
            <li> One seller, who Amazon probably will not let me name in a review, sold me either a bad batch or counterfeit products.</li>
            <li> It &amp;#34;gunked&amp;#34; my hair up so bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping it is just part of a bad batch.</li>
            <li> Definitely disappointed.</li>
            <li> i promise you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t hate it, but I didn&#x27;t keep using it, either.</li>
            <li> , I find that it won&#x27;t hold as well and will often deform my hair as the water dries in my hair, which gets annoying.</li>
            <li> and I hate it</li>
            <li> I hate any shine as I find the look to be just</li>
            <li> and i found that really annoying...</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t understand the reviews saying &amp;#34;girlfriends&amp;#34; hate it.</li>
            <li> GF&#x27;s hate it...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whenever I walked into a salon to get my hair trimmed, the cosmetologist always looks disgusted at how unpleasant my hair is to touch.</li>

            <li> Bad move!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell awful.</li>
            <li> It scores a 6 out of 10, 10 being the worst.</li>
            <li> And that looks nasty.</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> AC Fiber was horrible to wash off.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t make my head feel all crusty and nasty.  </li>
            <li> But the texture of it was awful.</li>
            <li> But worst, is the way your hair feels after applied.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product really holds well, and it is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Also it is not messy at all.</li>
            <li> Love it when it is this easy</li>
            <li> To be honest I hate using this wax. I don&#x27;t look forward to mornings where I know I&#x27;m going to need to style my hair for work. It is very thick and difficult to apply, and seems to make my curly hair a total mess. Once the wax is applied there also isn&#x27;t much I can do to sculpt or style it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely is correct in it&#x27;s description of being a matte wax. The hold was also strong as advertised - a little goes a long way. It also has a nice smell to it. I didn&#x27;t rate this one star because I recognize that this product could work for people with straighter or lighter hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those with curly, frizzy or messy hair: I would definitely avoid this wax and spend a little more money to get something like J Beverly Clear Wax. It&#x27;s just way easier to apply and you get better results.</li>
            <li> I have really thick coarse hair and was looking for a light hold product.  This is pretty good but you really have to be careful how much you use.  If you go too light, it doesn&#x27;t do anything or the hold is not consistent.  If you use too much, its a little too stiff and gooey.  I&#x27;m sure there is a medium but I haven&#x27;t been able to easily achieve it.  Been using Woody&#x27;s Web Matte stuff and I think its better for me but this is by no means a bad product.  Just might not be the best if your hair is like a thick scrub brush / chia pet like mine.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great because it does not look like there is anything in your hair. It holds great. It doesn&#x27;t smell awful. And it washes out easy.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it holds very well. It does however start to smell a little bad at the end of the day and the wax tends to dry out pretty fast if you leave the lid open a little.</li>
            <li> Nice transaction works great.</li>
            <li> My only experience with this kind of product was Garnier Fructis Pliable Clay.  I used Garnier for 4 or 5 years.  I even stocked up when it got discontinued.  As my supplies finally dwindled, I was forced to search for an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an extensive search, this product is now my go-to hair product.  It is less greasy than Garnier and doesn&#x27;t darken my hair as much.  The one negative is that it has slightly less of a hold, but that&#x27;s not a huge priority for me.  I really don&#x27;t know how you can go wrong buying this product for how cheap it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just hope the prices stay reasonable.  It seems like companies like to offer these kinds of products at low prices to get people in, and then they jack up the prices afterwards.  I bought this product for under $5.50 a couple months ago, and I see it&#x27;s already almost $8 now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stock up now!!</li>
            <li> Works good. Gets way more crusty than I thought it would. Perfect matte finish though, and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male with very thick, dark hair. I style it into a Nick Wooster-esque quiff, which is basically extremely short on the sides with a lot of length and disconnection on top. I like to keep it in a \\&quot;bed-head\\&quot; kind of style, ironically this product has Bed Head in the name. It has lots of hold, texture and separation while keeping it matte, but not dull.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t ever use one product on it&#x27;s own, I ALWAYS have to cocktail products, because I have difficult hair. Bottom line is, this is a great product for the high hold, matte look.&lt;br /&gt;And for the record, this product(along with TONS of others) is far better than American Crew Fiber.</li>
            <li> It has an odd smell, but once you get used to it its fine. It holds very well and wetting your hair first makes it work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> As someone who moved from So Cal to Atlanta, I had to find a new product because my old hair product just didn&#x27;t stand up to the Southern humidity. This does. Great all day hold, leaves a matte finish, and my natural waves don&#x27;t reappear as soon as I step outside in the summer like they did with my old product. I have short to medium length hair and the 2.65 ounces has lasted just over six months. Pro tip for others with thick, wavy hair... rub some coconut oil into your hair while it&#x27;s still wet, I started doing this about two months ago and it&#x27;s changed my life.</li>
            <li> This product works incredibly well on my thick Asian hair. If I want a lot of hold, I let my hair dry almost completely. The matte finish is awesome- looks totally natural. I mash a pea size amount into my palms and then work it in. I can easily achieve a messy or a neater look depending on my mood. Believe it or not, one container lasts me 3-4 months. I won&#x27;t use any other product. This is the BEST.</li>
            <li> Product is to hard to apply. Too sticky</li>
            <li> im not one who usually gels his hair but this stuff works just plenty well for me in giving a natural look</li>
            <li> I used crew fiber for a long time but decided to try this being that it is a bit cheaper.  Now I prefer Bed Head.  Its very similar to crew fiber but is easier to work in and doesn&#x27;t clump as much.  And with it being cheaper it was a no brainer to switch.  Its close enough though that if crew was cheaper I would buy that  product.  Both good products</li>
            <li> Product left my hair stiff and sticky, nothing close to a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; feel for styling purposes.  Definitely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Used in *very* small quantities, this wax provides a subtle hold with no visible shine, clumping or other signs that you are using hair product. It&#x27;s like your natural hair suddenly just became more behaved. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Hair product is great and cheaper on amazon which I love.  This wax is good for the that &amp;#34;out of the bed messy look.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Probably my favorite hair styling product ever. I love how it makes my hair look, and how long the hold lasts. It&#x27;s a nice soft looking hold, but very durable, except if you ride motorcycles, cause it can&#x27;t handle that, but it&#x27;s easy to fix post-ride. I recently switched from  American Crew defining paste, and I like this one better cause it doesn&#x27;t give your hair that oily or greasy look. It&#x27;s not too hard to wash off your hands, easy to apply, smells great  (reminds me of Abercrombie Fierce) after its applied.  Very happy I made the switch!  The actual wax itself is legit,  it&#x27;s not a rip-off like other reviews state. I was recommended this product by a girl at a salon, and the way it leaves my hair is identical as it was in the salon, so I know it&#x27;s the real stuff, except it&#x27;s nowhere near as much as they charge at salons for it. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Enjoy TIGI products but was sent Bed Head B</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take much to style your hair.  It doesn&#x27;t have any weird odors and washes off my hands pretty easily.  I will definitely puchase again once I run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few dozen different gels and various hair products over the years.  I found a few good ones,  but was never completely happy with them.  I bought this product after reading great reviews and seeing it was a Amazon top seller.  It was expensive at around $16 delivered, but woeh every penny.  I finally have a product that allows me to style my hair without it being basically cemented together and feeling sticky.  This product gives you control and hold,  but feels natural.  You only need to use a small amount,  so the expensive container will last a long time.  One tip is to try using it with different levels of dry hair.  It took a fee days to perfect, but with almost dry hair this product works best for me.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Perfect hair product. I love the matte finish.</li>
            <li> This is the best putty(ish) hair putty I&#x27;ve ever used. It has good hold with little grease.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite texture products but wish it had a bit more shine</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this keeps it under control and manageable.  Put it on your fingertips and mix with a LITTLE water.  I also like the fact it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look wet.</li>
            <li> As with all Bed Head products, this one is amazing. In fact, I will not use anything else. I do not need a lot of product, and it will last for entire day. It&#x27;s easy to use, and has a pleasant smell. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> As expected. And rapid delivery.</li>
            <li> great stuff if you dont use too much of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too particular about my hair products, but this is much better than cheap grocery store stuff I was using before.  It isn&#x27;t greasy at all and a little bit goes a long way.  My hair stays the same all day.</li>
            <li> I really like tgr seductive smell.  I think this is good for short hair but not too long spkies like muhawk or long fuhawk</li>
            <li> i like it..but i do add a bit of water to the pea sized amount i use for my child&#x27;s hair. he has darker hair and i&#x27;ve found that if i don&#x27;t thin out the wax a bit, even after rubbing it to warm it up, it can leave white on his hair. the was is very thick and white. it does add great texture and control that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> Great product! Makes all the difference when styling hair.</li>
            <li> I would not advertise this product as wax. Its consistency is more like clay than wax. Make sure that you work this product into dry hair. As I&#x27;ve learned the hard way, applying to damp hair will lead to clumps. Furthermore, for thick hair, this product does not hold well. If you have thin-short hair this would probably do for you, but if you have thick straight asian hair like me - this product is sub-par compared. I used it for a couple of days and never went back to it again.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like it, but it didn&#x27;t work for me personally. I have thin, fine hair, and a lot of it. It clumps together really easily and even wet was kind of hard to work in and make it look good. The hold is great, and for $10 it&#x27;s worth a shot for most I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple of weeks ago--good thing I did. This works very good in my hair. It holds strong, and has the matte finish that I want. Also, it&lt;br /&gt;smells great.</li>
            <li> Great product, very workable throughout the day!</li>
            <li> Awesome product and awesome price!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a medium hold that provides a natural flow and matte texture, this is a great product!  It won&#x27;t keep your hair exactly how you style it, but you hair will resiliently keep to that basic shape.  I bought a can in August and have used it almost every day.  Still have about half left, so it lasts approximately 8 months for me.</li>
            <li> Great for volume/height-</li>
            <li> Best wax ever! I&#x27;ve used it for years and I can&#x27;t seem to find anything better. I tried many but this is still number 1!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good if it is what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 8 months now. Before that I was using a combination of Garnier Play Style Reshapable Putty and a coat of Big Sexy Hair. Although that hair regimen worked well, my hair looked a little too shiny. With this product, I get the same great control, but with a dryer more natural look, and it lasts all day! I&#x27;m on my 3rd container and I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more. As with most amazon products, I found this cheaper here than it is in retail stores.</li>
            <li> Great hold through the entire day. Can be a bit difficult to wash out.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, straight hair and this is the only way that I can get my hair to shape up. Tigi lasts all day, and I&#x27;m happy to pay a premium. This stuff&#x27;s reasonably priced and nothing else short of glue will do what this wax does-- no gels, no pomades, etc.. Last thought the odor of this stuff is tolerable.</li>
            <li> After hearing about this product, I decided to give it a chance. Before I used American Crew Fiber but always wanted something better. This product offers the strong hold on my stubborn Asian hair. It is highly moldable throughout the day and does not smell at all. In fact, I like the smell. It only gets better, you only need to use a subtle amount. Be careful not to use too much or your hair will turn into a rock. In all, I love this wax!</li>
            <li> Ive been trying to post a decent review of this product and amazon doesn&#x27;t let me me post it for some reason, well ill try one more time, wax is great best out there, good price and style.</li>
            <li> Decent functionality, but it smells like 16 year old girls want 18 year old boys to smell. Think stereotypical overpowering musky deodorant type smells.</li>
            <li> Great Stuff! holds my hair well all day and doesn&#x27;t make hair shiny. I like the matte look</li>
            <li> Best hair product I have ever used! So happy AMAZON has it because I can&#x27;t find it anywhere else</li>
            <li> Been using this for the past 4 years. Love how it holds, and I can change my hair throughout the day with just a little water. Plus the best part is that there isnt a shine to it. The only thing I don&#x27;t like it when you start to get near the bottom of the tub it hardens and makes it unusable. Also sometimes if you use too much it will leave your hair looking white at the ends where you applied it.</li>
            <li> Smells great. The hold is not strong enough for my medium length hair though. Stay away from this if your hair is longer than 3 or so inches. Also doesn&#x27;t hold up great to wind or rain.</li>
            <li> Great product for men&#x27;s hair.  It is not too sticky or too grimy, the perfect combination for the at work person.</li>
            <li> This wax is awesome! It does hold my flat asian hair for a whole day without greasy look. I had been using American crew fiber for few years and thought that I would never ever changed to others till I put this one on. Give it a shot!</li>
            <li> This hair wax has been my favorite so far, it makes my hair look natural and still provides an all day hold for work. It&#x27;s has great feel while styling, letting you manipulate your hair with ease. I end up with nicely defined curls that stay put for the entire day. Overall it&#x27;s a great product, would buy again.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what its name suggests: It is a quality wax that you can work through your hair in order to give a messy separation while giving a matte shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a man with very thick hair. My hair grows fast and tends to frizz out a little bit if I don&#x27;t have something in it. I need something with strong hold and pliability. To accomplish this look I usually use Redken polish up, some john frieda products, and axe messy look paste. I enjoy all of those products, but wanted something with a less greasy and shiny feel and look. This wax still leaves a bit of shine, but it is less greasy than most products I&#x27;ve used. This is something I really enjoy about this product. It offers hold and gives some shine, but isn&#x27;t greasy and is easy to wash out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is kind of like a pomade, but it is very sticky and softer than most wax I&#x27;ve used. I usually wait until my hair is slightly damp, but mostly dry before putting this product in my hair. This is key! If your hair is too wet, the wax will melt/dissolve into your hair and you&#x27;ll end up looking like a slick guido. Not good. You need your hair to be mostly dry so the wax can stick to it and offer hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I really love about this product is the smell, or rather, the lack thereof. So many hair products have an overpowering and nauseating smell. Axe products are the worst as far as fragrance goes. I&#x27;ve also used Star Wax and it had such a sickening fragrance that I had to send it back. Tigi Matte Seperation Wax is almost fragrance free. It has a slight waxy smell, and that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for 4 stars and not 5, is that I feel this wax could and should have a little bit more hold. It&#x27;s slightly more pliable and &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; from what I would expect from a true wax. Sometimes if I want a bit more hold, I&#x27;ll add some axe paste to my hair in conjunction with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really like this wax. I get compliments on my hair all the time, from men and women.n and women.</li>
            <li> Got this when I was frantically searching for substitutes for Tigi&#x27;s Bedhead Mastermind. Extremely greasy, I only use it if I&#x27;m out of everything else or have a while before I go out so it can dry a little. Can&#x27;t get myself to throw it out just yet, but probably will.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for more than 5 years and it had been always best hair wax.</li>
            <li> great hold, very light texture, rinses out easily and has a nice not to girly smell to it. Been about 6 months and I&#x27;m still on my same jar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought two of these so far and have just finished my first tub (after about 6 months!) and have been really happy with the results. A big mistake I made when I first used this product was using too much and not spreading it enough. The best way to use this product is to, using your index finger, pull out a small amount (the material is very thick) and spread it into both of your hands. The consistency will feel very sticky, but once put into your damp to dry hair (depending on how much shine you want), it comes out completely matte. Be sure to spread it evenly throughout as much of your hair as you want control over and let the product do its work. The hold is really intense - I can have it in for a day, sleep in with it, and still have some residual hold into the next day. It does come out rather easily in the shower with or without shampoo. If you want some shine, you can put more into your hair and it will start to look very slick (I found this out by mistake). In summary - good hold, great for disconnected undercuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now half the reason I&#x27;m writing this review is to compare it to the American Crew equivalent (by product description: high hold/low shine) Fiber. I (dumbly) forgot my second tub of TIGI Bed Head at home and couldn&#x27;t find the product in any stores nearby. I couldn&#x27;t find a straight review comparing the two products anywhere in my cursory search so, here&#x27;s a tip. The American Crew is much less sticky right off the bat, it comes out feeling more like a modern day wax/pomade than a hardcore clay. It definitely doesn&#x27;t give the hold that the TIGI gives, and looks a bit more greasy. However, if the TIGI is a 5 star the American Crew would be a 3.5-4 star.</li>
            <li> Really like the product. The price is very good for the quality...I have tried more expensive products. I really like the fact that it:&lt;br /&gt;* smells good&lt;br /&gt;* doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue&lt;br /&gt;* has a good feel to it&lt;br /&gt;* doesn&#x27;t get really hard&lt;br /&gt;* stays pliable throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I love this wax. Creates a nice texture and hold with a natural look. I have curly and somewhat dry hair and this works great.</li>
            <li> In the beginning, this had a nice, malleable texture. I try not to use wax too often. However, over time, when you don&#x27;t use the wax, it creates this surface that dries up and remains hard. You need to break into the texture with your thumbs, use some water, soften it up, and then apply it. It was a messy solution that also left a lot of stickiness in between my palm. At least it&#x27;s hold is phenomenal but the process is not enjoyable. I&#x27;d recommend something else.</li>
            <li> If you want something to hold your hair exactly how you want it, without a crusty artificial look, this is your stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used many hair products including AXE.  None of them work like this stuff.  They make my hair feel greasy and dirty.  I really like the fact that I can put this stuff in my hair and wet it the next day to get the same look. The matte look is definitely superior to the glossy look.</li>
            <li> Has a good and lasting hold all throughout the day. It holds my hair style without making it look too stiff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done through a lot of hair products over time.. I have frizzy, wavy hair but you would never know with this product. I sometimes let my hair grow to 4+ inches, and this product still has the strength to give me consistent, matte, messy look that gets me more compliments than I probably need. In stores it is rather expensive ($16+) but on amazon I save a significant amount and purchase a few to stock up.</li>
            <li> I got this stuff based on the rave reviews and have to say I&#x27;m pretty disappointed. First of all, it&#x27;s not a wax, more like a pomade. Reminds me of sumotech by bumble &amp; bumble but that stuff has a less sticky dry to it. The hold is not that great, my hair moves too easily and portions look like there&#x27;s product and portions look completely dry and move. I have wavy hair and it&#x27;s pretty long on the top (maybe 6\\&quot;) and extremely short on the sides (buzzed), it&#x27;s like Beckham&#x27;s 2012/2013 look. So perhaps this stuff is great for shorter hair but for my length it doesn&#x27;t do the job at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use a hair wax called LA Belle, I bought it in Israel and it was the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used. However I can&#x27;t find it in the USA or even online anywhere, so I&#x27;m trying to find something similar here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many hair products in the past, and this wax is by far the best I&#x27;ve used. It has a great hold that lasts all day and provides great texture. Great for a semi-messy style. It does take a bit of work to get the wax to go in all the right places, but it is worth it. It has a subtle smell - people can&#x27;t smell your hair from a mile away. I get compliments all the time on my hair when using this product :P . It is a little pricey, and you have to order it online, but it is well worth it in my opinion. The container holds enough stuff to last about a month with the amount I use (about the size of a blueberry). Overall this wax deserves 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just your average middle class father/husband, but who&#x27;s had major hair product experience (Thanks to an aunt that worked at Sally&#x27;s Beauty and a sister who&#x27;s a professional stylist/esthetician!) and knows what he wants in a hair product.  And that is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- MATTE FINISH!  This has to be the most important.  I want my hair to look natural, but maybe even give it that flat iron look without having to straighten it.  There are many that claim to have a matte finish, but very few are true matte.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- NO CRUNCH!  Nothing says &amp;#34;I haven&#x27;t moved past 90&#x27;s fashion&amp;#34; more than wearing socks with shorts....oh and hard, crunchy hair!! Probably plastered with L.A. Looks gel, and maybe topped off with some Aqua Net.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- LASTING HOLD!  I know it&#x27;s hard to ask for a lasting hold from a non-gel product, but it CAN be done people.  This product is proof.  It lasts alllllll day.  I put this stuff on at about 7:00AM every morning and my hair keeps its shape until I go to bed.  Granted I only wash my hair with shampoo on Saturdays...that might help too I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- CHEAP!  Ok so this product doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars for price, but it&#x27;s not as expensive as others I&#x27;ve tried and as of right now (06/28/12) on Amazon its under $15.  That&#x27;s a price I can justify not spending on my daughter or wife.  And last, but not least...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- DOESN&#x27;T SMELL LIKE A DOUCHEBAG!  Yeah.  Back in 2010, I was economically forced to purchase....an AXE product!  Ewwww, I know.  I know.  I cringe just saying that name.  But I got the &amp;#34;messy look&amp;#34; paste and it actually wasn&#x27;t THAT bad.  It&#x27;s biggest flaw was one that should&#x27;ve been an obvious one: it reeked of butt and douchiness.  This TIGI one actually smells pretty darn good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I&#x27;ve finally found my savoir in hair products.  TIGI Bedhead Matte Separation Wax.  This just replaced Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shaping Cream for the #1 spot.  CHI Matte Wax comes in at #3, but I heard they&#x27;re discontinuing this if they haven&#x27;t already.  #4 Is surprisingly Garnier Fructis Pliable Clay.  This had a short stint in &#x27;09 and is no longer available, but man this stuff was just as good as PM&#x27;s and was only like $4. Sadly, they just stopped making it.  &#x27;  Axe, Suave, American Crew, Woody&#x27;s, Matrix, Joico, Got2b?  Don&#x27;t waste your time, or money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah.  Buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2015 UPDATE ---------------------&lt;br /&gt;Wrote this 3 years ago and I&#x27;m happy to say I still use this stuff.  STILL have yet to find anything better.  I also just received my first new brown container and I&#x27;m also happy to report that I STILL love it. Maybe need a little more than I used to, but it still smells great, holds great, and is definitely still matte. So yeah.  Buy this.iscontinuing this if they haven&#x27;t already.  #4 Is surprisingly Garnier Fructis Pliable Clay.

            <li> The product is as described.  It actually holds much much better than the strongest store bought gel.  The best thing about what this product does is that, when the wind blows your hair down/left or right, with just a little help from your hand, it retains its desired styling.  In addition, it does make your hair styling look so natural.</li>
            <li> This stuff does not weaken, it will make your hair look greasy before it loosens its grip ( and this is after 14+ hours). But if your not pulling a 24 hour shift doing God knows what, this product will work really well, and provide excellent grip with a matte finish.</li>
            <li> To start off, the container of this product is superb, high quality, and not too heavy. The wax is in a form of very thick and matte material. It is pretty hard washing it off your hair and hands since it sticks so good. Beware not to use too much on your hair or the residue is not going to spread evenly, therefore leaving some white wax on your hair.</li>
            <li> My first wax product and I think this is great.  One recommendation, keep in mind that you can overdo it at which point your hair will look greasy.  You will probably not want to skip a day of showering/washing your hair after using this for the same reason.</li>
            <li> Freaking awesome product! The reviews helped so much to make this a success-- don&#x27;t use too much, hair shld be damp. I did EXACTLY that and the result is hair with texture with or without blow dryer assistance. Finding just the right wax is EXTREMELY frustrating. I can&#x27;t tell you how much money I&#x27;ve wasted on &amp;#34;eh&amp;#34;. This will last me a loooong while. Very happy. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love the matte finish...no more shiny hair. Just a small dab in the morning and it stays in place all day and all night.&lt;br /&gt;Great product...buy it if you want a new look to your hair that won&#x27;t let you down.</li>
            <li> great product, smells nice, does not leave hair shiny which I like. Does not flake. Washes out easily. So far its been a year and I still have not run out. I use the product daily.</li>
            <li> Picture shown doesn&#x27;t match what I received, but heck - it&#x27;s the same stuff. This wax is great - doesn&#x27;t leave my hair too greasy, and I really only need a VERY small amount to get my hair in a workable shape. I was having to use twice as much (or more) product when using Mitch creams/waxes.</li>
            <li> I get this all the time now! It&#x27;s comparable to American Crew Fiber. Better price, and I think the masculine scent is really pleasant, not overpowering. A little goes a long way. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I recommend using this with dry hair it works great and holds good. But if you use it with wet hair you lose volume and it doesn&#x27;t look good.</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t smell like some other products.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for keeping my hair back out of my face. It will last multiple days, I can just comb it into place in the morning. Other products I&#x27;ve tried stop working by the end of 1 day, and the hair is back in my face. Not greasy, easy to wash out. This is my new goto.</li>
            <li> The best hair wax for my fine but thick hair, and I&#x27;ve literally tried them all. It&#x27;s better than the Gatsby or American Crew wax products. If they mad one of these with shine I&#x27;d buy a lifetime supply. This stuff is just a little too matte, it makes my hair look dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Have been using this for years, used 15+ containers. Still great, but beware of FAKES. One seller, who Amazon probably will not let me name in a review, sold me either a bad batch or counterfeit products. All 3 I received in an order from a seller (who I bought from for the first time) were watered down and thinner. BEWARE. When you get your product, take a bit with your finger and rub it. in your palm. This is a HARD WAX that is tacky and takes a little effort and warmth before spreading and being pliable. If your product is immediately &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34; and spreads like lotion, then you have a &amp;#34;bad batch&amp;#34; or counterfeit product, and contact Amazon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think its a bad product in general, i just think its a bad product for me. The product is very &amp;#34; tacky &amp;#34; &amp;#34; gluey &amp;#34; feeling. Which has a strong hold like that but it makes your hair stiff and not playable which I like. Very disappointed because read a lot of good reviews.</li>
            <li> Best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty well, however I wish it stayed better because I have to use a lot and it starts looking too clumpy.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband, who had been using Got2Be glue. We found there weren&#x27;t many products that would hold his hair up all day without looking spikey or wet. Problem with the glue was it tended to pull out his hair because it was so strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After much research, we landed with this workable wax. Here are the features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Need just a tiny bit. Best to work in when hair is a little wet, or to wet hands a bit to work in. This little tub will last forever&lt;br /&gt;- Hair is &amp;#34;workable&amp;#34; all day. Meaning it sort of molds hair into a clay, which will stay if not fussed with. Out of curiosity, I molded his hair into a fauxhawk just to see if it would work, several hours after he put it in. Sure enough, you can style and restyle as needed. This was very interesting for me.&lt;br /&gt;- Texture is between a wax, a glue, and a fiber. If you wanted that straight up glued look, I suppose you could use it on dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;- Finish looks dry. But not blow-dried dry (where the hair looks feathery and 80&#x27;s style). Just a natural dry. If you want to piece it out, you can do that. If you want to have a nice clean look, you can do that. If you want it messy, this will allow that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff.  I&#x27;ve used American Crew fiber for years and wanted to try something different.  My hair stays put in the summer while doing stuff outside.  And it doesn&#x27;t look stiff or shiny.</li>
            <li> no matter what quantity I used or what application method I tried, I could not make it look good in my hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Hold isn&#x27;t that good. Not sure if I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Firm all day hold.  Not to sticky or shinny.  Would use again if it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this stuff holds pretty well.  You don&#x27;t have to use a lot so it lasts a long time.  If you do use a lot, though, it will give your hair a hardened look/feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not bad, but I&#x27;ve smelled better.  It&#x27;s definitely worth a shot if you&#x27;re looking for a good hair product.</li>
            <li> I finally found a hair gel for me. First of all, I have tried many a hair gel in an attempt to find a gel that didn&#x27;t make me look like a grease ball, washed out easily and was affordable. Let me tell you my top 3 choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Choice #1 Tigi Bed Head&lt;br /&gt;Choice #2 Paul Mitchell Grean tea&lt;br /&gt;Choice #3 American Crew Fiber&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These hair gels are all fairly pricey with the paul Mitchell being the most of the three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tigi bed head provides a gel that really keeps your hair looking dry and clean. The gel is easy to apply, easy to wash out and easy to wash off your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Mitchell is very similar but it costs about 50% more.</li>
            <li> My hair looks great with this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of hair waxes and this is by far the best. It spreads easy, smells nice, washes out easily, and holds all day.</li>
            <li> i have wicked thick hair, so i usually sport my hair pretty short.  i have literally tried everything our local retailers (walgreens, cvs) had to offer, and had settled on american crew. its good, not great, but better than everything else i had tried until bed head.  just a little in your SLIGHTLY damp hair, and youre good to go.  it just looks simply amazing, without looking like a guido. holds great, and washes out easy, with no scent to speak of.  just cant recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> I went with this due to the great reviews and Iam not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;My hair has a natural look and holds the style even on a windy day. Very happy with how my hair looks everyday- have been hit and miss on other products in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to rub into your hair thoroughly- you don&#x27;t want white clumps of wax hanging around!</li>
            <li> This works wells keeps my hair where I want it and is easy to work with!</li>
            <li> Probably better for short hair. I have just over finger length hair, and this stuff leaves it waxy. Holds okay, but again, I think it would be good for short, spiky hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best stuff for men with short hair.  The hold factor is just perfect, holds all day, but still allows hair to feel soft to the touch.  The best thing about this product is it is the only product that offers a matte finish.  So it makes your hair look more natural and full.  Hands down, the best product I have used over the past 20 years.</li>
            <li> it is kinda difficult to use...</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite hair product to use.  It gives just enough hold that I&#x27;m not too worried about wind but is pliable enough that I can fix it if it does get messed up.  It&#x27;s more like a clay than a wax as it&#x27;s not as shiny or sliming as traditional waxes.  You also don&#x27;t have to use very much. I use about a finger full for my medium-short length hair.</li>
            <li> I have coarse hair cut short that used to do whatever the heck it pleased.  Using gel made me look like a sleazeball and didn&#x27;t really tame it.  This stuff does the trick like a champ and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking greasy.  I also don&#x27;t have to use a ton of it; each tub probably lasts me about 4 months.</li>
            <li> The Matte Separation Wax has great hold, once it dries your hair will stay there all day, and it has barely any shine to it at all. My only problem is that it makes your hair a little hard. If you like to run your fingers through your hair this will definitely make that a little difficult. As long as you don&#x27;t intend on people touching your hair, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase and that is saying something as I am not very brand loyal.  Doesn&#x27;t make a mess, smells great and holds the hair in place.</li>
            <li> Im finally writing a review for this after buying and using this for over a year now. I regularly use this and i still have about 2/3rds of the container left. It works amazingly. A lot of the time, depending on what look i am going for, it doesn&#x27;t even look like im using any product in my hair. This container will probably last me 2 more years (so 3 years total) until i buy some more.&lt;br /&gt;As ive said before, this brand never lets me down. I use their shampoo as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.  The price is so much better than comparable products.  The only negative I have to say is that it tends to leave a flaky residue behind.  If not for this, I would have given 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different men&#x27;s hair waxes (comparisons below) and I always come back to this one. I have short hair that just needs some life. I&#x27;m looking for a bit more texture in my hair and for it to stand up a bit. I don&#x27;t want it to be flat and boring. I also don&#x27;t want the hair product to overpower my cologne. This wax is lightweight and easily pliable after working it a bit in your hands. Not really a smell. It&#x27;s not tacky or sticky, great texture. It may take a bit to figure out what the perfect amount is for you personally, but after you figure it out, it&#x27;s perfect. I go through one tub every 4-5months. Great price here on Amazon too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe Grooming Texture paste: good texture, low shine, interesting (not good) smell, doesn&#x27;t hold well. Often feel like I use a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;Difi heavy wax firm hold (yellow one): Smells like oranges, gets semi-chunky and you have to bust it up, a little goes a long way, sticky, often feel like it&#x27;s too greasy and shiny (though it&#x27;s \\&quot;low shine\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;Redken Maneuver: Definitely the best one besides BedHead. Low shine, great smell, not sticky. The reason I don&#x27;t go back to this one is that it doesn&#x27;t give as must texture and hold as BedHead.&lt;br /&gt;Kendra Taffy: Smells like candy, very sticky and goupy, not the best hold</li>
            <li> This stuff is really great! I would use this after blow drying my hair and it would keep it soft and natural looking all day. Not shiny! Perfect amount of hold.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> It has a strong hold, but didn&#x27;t work too well for my particular style.</li>
            <li> not for me. hard to apply.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair, and of the products I have this works the best, but you really have to water it down as the texture is extremely firm. Also, it seems like it takes a lot of effort to work it into your hair. Once you do, it provides decent hold and a matte finish, but I would say after using this product, I only like the way my hair looks maybe half the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have fine hair, you definitely would NOT want to use this product.</li>
            <li> This is currently my go-to hair product.  I have short hair that I sort of spike up with a dry, messy look.  No hairdryer needed if you apply to dry hair.  My hair is less than 2 inches long at the longest.  It smells great.  It washes out 100 times better than other similar products that I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;ve tried about 6-8 other products so far- and this has been the best for me.  Very strong hold.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff to replace my Enjoy Dry Wax, and I like the difference. I would say I have better control with the dry wax, but the Bed Head makes my hair look more natural and dryer looking. But my hair still holds well all day. Probably going to buy this stuff again.</li>
            <li> First of all, this product works really well for my thick, wavy hair. It&#x27;s matte, but not too matte and it smells pretty good. I&#x27;ve smelled other stuff that smells REALLY good, but those kinds of hair products are made with a lot of carcinogenic ingredients. Also, a can of this stuff seems to last a solid 5 months or longer. One more benefit... in the morning, after you put this onto wet hair, it looks and holds pretty well, but it still looks like there&#x27;s some kind of gel in your hair. However, after about 2 hours, if you run your hands through your hair and restyle, you can achieve a really natural look. If I run thru my hair 8 hours or so after initially applying the product, I can sometimes get a messy/natural look that looks really cool and is impossible to get if you&#x27;re putting this stuff in your hair fresh out of the shower. This might be the case with other waxes too, but I find that this effect is easier to achieve versus using the blue American Crew pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, here&#x27;s why I gave it 3 instead of 5 stars:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a bottle of this stuff about 1 year ago (maybe around November of 2012) and it used real beeswax and overall less toxic ingredients than what&#x27;s in the formula now. I know this because I compared the old and new ingredient lists. The new formulation uses synthetic beeswax, and I believe there&#x27;s more &amp;#34;paraben&amp;#34; type chemicals in the new formulation. Why change?? Probably because most people using this stuff don&#x27;t know and don&#x27;t care about lathering your head everyday with carcinogenic and endocrine disrupting chemicals. They just care how nice their hair looks. Can&#x27;t blame them, though...&amp;#34;Nice hair is one of those intrinsically worthwhile pursuits&amp;#34;--Aristotle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, check out EWG&#x27;s cosmetic database for a list of the potential carcinogens in this product. It scores a 6 out of 10, 10 being the worst. Most popular hair care products are in the 8-9 range...I bet the old formulation was more in the 4-5 range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I buy it again? Idk...I think I&#x27;ll experiment with the less toxic hair care products. If they suck, then I&#x27;ll go back to this.ange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I buy it again? Idk...I think I&#x27;ll experiment with the less toxic hair care products. If they suck, then I&#x27;ll go back to this.</li>
            <li> Its not the kind of stuff that you can run your hands through your hair with after it sets.  The hold is pretty strong for short to short/medium hair.  Any longer and it will give out.  I have heavy, coarse, Asian hair that when long will defeat this stuff but with a fresh cut it will hold up.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!  I ordered it along with 2 similar products (both from American Crew), all at the same time, to compare them, and this was the clear winner.  I have thin straight hair, and I was looking for something to add a little matte texture and body to it, and this looks *great*.  It&#x27;s really shocking how much of a different it makes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: To use it, just sprinkle one hand under water for an instant, then shake it off so it&#x27;s barely wet, then mix a tiny dab of this stuff in and rub your hands together; this will make a totally homogenous goo that will evenly rub into your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another tip: Try a final swipe over your eyebrows to give them texture/hold, as well, brushing up/away from the nose to set the direction; they&#x27;ll look nice and stay that way.</li>
            <li> You need 2x as much as Bumble and Bumble Sumo Tech, 1.5-Ounce Jar, it smells bad and lasts half as long.  It is easier to apply, but that is a small gain compared to the many negatives.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was hoping to find a product that could save me the $24 cost of Bumble and Bumble Sumotech. I read other reviews on here, and hoped they were right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only wrong, but really wrong. This product is sticky and difficult to apply. It would leave clumps of product in my hair (I have thick hair), and I wouldn&#x27;t notice those clumps until I saw them in the mirror. Ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be buying this again and sadly will have to go back to the far superior Sumotech, which I hate paying for, but it makes my hair look great.</li>
            <li> Good for the price. Though there are better products out there.</li>
            <li> Great hold. Would recommend putting in your hair when wet. Never used Crew but I am staying with TIGI Wax.</li>
            <li> Strong hold but did not wash out with just water..after a few days would get sticky and nasty and would have to use shampoo...if you use shampoo then it washes out great and will work for you.</li>
            <li> Holds up my hair the whole day, and it really gives you that dry matte look. It smells good as well, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome. You MUST get this. Bed head is probably the best type of hair wax I&#x27;ve ever used. BUY IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to using hair products, but it works for me.  Has good hold on my ~2.5 in hair, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This wax gave me a nice hold with out the greasiness of other waxes. Very little goes a long way when you apply it to dry hair. I believe you can also apply it to damp hair but haven&#x27;t tried that yet.</li>
            <li> I have fine, light blonde hair and it tosses in the wind.  I love this product because I use a small amount and lightly coat my hair and beard and look great all day long.  It does not have any perfume.  So, it does not smell and give me a headache.  Also, it is easy to clean up in the shower or bath.</li>
            <li> Used to use axe hair products, but they weren&#x27;t strong enough. Switched to Got 2 Be and was too strong. Finally tried this stuff out and works perfectly. It gives the hair that pliable consistency which is perfect for the beach and i just take a pinch and rub it through my hair. It gives my hair that matte look without ling like I use hair products.</li>
            <li> The best product I have found for my hair.  Gives it just the right amount of shape and hold.  Lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;Your hair will look styled but not glossy or crunchy. A little dab is all it takes.&lt;br /&gt;Smells good too!</li>
            <li> This product works fine. Doesn&#x27;t do anything incredible to my hair and has a really strong bro sorta smell to it. I didn&#x27;t hate it, but I didn&#x27;t keep using it, either.</li>
            <li> Hands down best wax I&#x27;ve found. Matte finish, strong hold, long lasting.</li>
            <li> This stuff holds pretty much the whole day. Has a &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; musk smell thats pleasing. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I&#x27;ve never used a wax before so I could be using it all wrong. I&#x27;m used to products more similar to cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product when my hair was a bit longer and when it was a bit on the shorter side. My hair is extremely thick and pretty difficult to manage so if you have fine hair it may work much better for you. I found this wax to provide a decent hold. The thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it feels kind of strange in your hair. Like you don&#x27;t want to touch your head all day while it&#x27;s on. Also, when my hair was a 3-5 inches long, the product had a difficult time keeping my hair in the position I wanted. And I found myself just not using the product. Overall, I use this if I run out of my other products and have nothing else that provided as good of a hold without making my head feel like a sticky greased sculpture. I won&#x27;t throw away, but I probably won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I ride a motorcycle which is a constant ordeal with my hair. I&#x27;ve been looking for a workable matte hair product that will give all day hold even though I am putting a helmet on and off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of hair products. This will be the first I will purchase a second time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only down side is that the product is heavy and is quite noticeable when you run your fingers through it. Also a little bit sticky. That is minor problem in my opinion and I believe all waxes and pomades experience this problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of hair wax, glue, whatever you wanna call it. This ones has got to be the best one out there i&#x27;ve tried. It holds your hair really well and unlike others it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or wet look. If it&#x27;s a little too solid to work into your type of hair just add few drops of water before working it in. Tigis wax also smells decent too, not the best in that catagory, but good enough. I love this wax.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, especially if you have thick hair like me. I&#x27;m able to control my hair all day long, all without a grease look to it.</li>
            <li> This is really good hair product for a dried look - not shiny which is what I wanted. However, I do notice some clumping of hair when using this, whereas other products seem to not make my hair so &amp;#34;spikey&amp;#34;. Spikey might be a bad word to use since it&#x27;s a bit extreme, but I noticed the hair groups together more than I want.</li>
            <li> I tried putting this in my hair while it was wet and then blowdrying it into shape but that made my hair feel sticky and it definitely didn&#x27;t give me a matte finish that way.  What worked for me was blowdrying my hair first and then putting a small amount of this wax through my hair and shaping it.  The hold isn&#x27;t very good but the texture is just what I expected.  This is probably best if you combine it with a hairspray because if you use enough of this to hold your hair in place, it makes your hair feel like it has glue in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary: Use sparingly in blowdried hair and finish with hairspray for best results.  Don&#x27;t expect anything a lot of hold.</li>
            <li> Container is much smaller than I imagined. Leaves glops in my hair and doesn&#x27;t style very well. The scent is pleasant I must say.</li>
            <li> The hold last all day long regardless the weather. The only problem is, its hard to wash off. I have to literally shampoo my hair 3 times to feel satisfied.</li>
            <li> This hair wax works fantastic.</li>
            <li> Best hair product I have found so far. I can fluff my hair curly or cob it flat, always shine free and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> This product is matte and lasts all day! i used it every day and the tub lasts me about 3-4 months! Cant go wrong here!</li>
            <li> Excellent! I will recommend this to others!</li>
            <li> I have medium length, heavier hair and wanted a product light enough to use on a daily basis. My hair style is usually just slicked back and this product works wonders for the style. If you want something with a firm hold that has a natural, matte looking finish with low shine, this product is for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I personally apply it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) First, I wet my hair and get a good amount of water in it.&lt;br /&gt;2) Then I use a towel to dry out the excess water.&lt;br /&gt;3) At this point my hair is still too wet to have this product applied, so I use a blow dryer to further dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;4) You need to find the perfect amount of hair dampness for this product. I usually dry until my hair is at the &amp;#34;almost completely dry&amp;#34; point but still has a little cold/wetness feeling in it.&lt;br /&gt;5) I take 2 fingertips worth of product, and rub generously between my hands to heat it up and evenly distribute it.&lt;br /&gt;6) Starting at the top of my head, I apply the product in circular motions making sure to spread it across my roots to the tips of my hairs.&lt;br /&gt;7) Once the product is fully applied (no excess product left in hair and all parts of hair have been covered), I use a comb to slick my hair back.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Give this product a few minutes to &amp;#34;settle&amp;#34; in your hair. The water in your hair needs to dry out, until then it could change shape if you&#x27;re moving your head a lot. Once it&#x27;s dry, I haven&#x27;t had it deform my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my hair is too wet and I apply this product, I find that it won&#x27;t hold as well and will often deform my hair as the water dries in my hair, which gets annoying. So my advice: find the right amount of wetness your hair needs to be at before applying this product. It may take a few tries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this hair product hasn&#x27;t given up on me mid day or anything. It usually holds the same all day. I once fell asleep with the product still in my hair and woke up the next day. Added a little bit of water and combed my hair again and it was still fine the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, you won&#x27;t go wrong with this product. I&#x27;ve been through a lot and this one is one of my personal favorites.nd it was still fine the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, you won&#x27;t go wrong with this product. I&#x27;ve been through a lot and this one is one of my personal favorites.</li>
            <li> Too tacky for my very straight &amp; fine hair, even in small quantities.</li>
            <li> Came promptly in a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has a faint manly scent, similar to axe maybe?&lt;br /&gt;The hold is much better than my previous wax, and the matte finish is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Feels a bit unnatural, but that&#x27;s a given when using wax</li>
            <li> Highly recommend. I will be a repeat customer in the future.</li>
            <li> gave it a few tries but always left my head feeling clammy, and my hair looked and felt oily and dirty</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, highly recommended</li>
            <li> Product is amazing. It keeps my hair up (nothing else will) and it comes in the most convenient case ever. My new hair product from this point on</li>
            <li> The hair looks awesome and doesn&#x27;t bundle like it does with gels. The smell received a number of compliments too!</li>
            <li> Great hair product, works great on my fine hair. Best to use after your hair is washed and completely dry. Has a great hold.</li>
            <li> I ordered this a while ago and its lasted a long time. Its a very good wax with a matte finish. I use it after i blowdry and straighten my hair. Its hold is good and i like the way it feels in my hair.  I love the smell of it. It smells like a calogne smell but not too strong. Its perfect. At first, i wasnt sure if i should order it but then i did and i was happy. With this wax, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bottle has lasted me about two months and i just ordered 3 more bottles because i am going traveling and this is my favorite wax now. I really love the smell and the hold is just excellent. If you need a good wax with a perfect matte finish, then this is it.</li>
            <li> just great. my go-to prod. matte is great. shiny is embarrassing. and east coast. and i&#x27;m not that excited. buy this.</li>
            <li> This is the best product! I have tried about 5 other products and this one works the best. It has the least greasy feel, but still has great hold. If you buy it make sure it Ships from and sold by Amazon.com and not Hair Beauty Beautique. Other wise it takes way to long to receive and cost more.</li>
            <li> Very natural look, good price, and long lasting hold. It&#x27;s very workable and easy to wash out later. I&#x27;ve slept with it still in my hair by accident a few nights and it doesn&#x27;t flake out. Smells clean too. I have incredibly thick hair and this is one of the few products that can tame, flatten, and style it. You only need to use a little bit at a time so its a pretty good deal. I declare it a manscaping success.</li>
            <li> This hair product works much better than any other product I have used. It has an incredible amount of hold, but isn&#x27;t too sticky or shiny. Once you put it in your hair and shape your hair a bit, it has sort of a matte finish so people can&#x27;t really tell that you have product in your hair, which is great. Other products often look very shiny in your hair and it is evident that there is gel/product in your hair, but this is very discreet. I put it in my hair in the morning and it pretty much holds all day, even in wind and after it rains (though you may have to adjust your hair a bit). In addition to this, a little goes a long way, which justifies the higher cost. Overall, this is one of the best hair products that I have ever used</li>
            <li> Nowhere in the description could I find all ingredients. Only under the product when I received it. It does smell good. But I prefer non-water containing products, at least not for me.</li>
            <li> theres no comparison on the quality of this wax matte finish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;can do almost any possible hairdo, last for hours nice touch nice smell , totally matte , simple a perfect product if you like matte waxes.</li>
            <li> I have a medium military fade, short on top but enough to spike in the front (a military haircut). I have tried and tried a lot of different products but for some reason everything I used made my hair matt together or shine or one thing or the other. I was looking for something that didn&#x27;t make my hair clump together, something that provided control with no shine etc. This stuff is more of a dry cream that has no shine and everything I was looking for, I put it on right after a shower with toweled dried hair, I use about the size of a pea and it works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really torn with this hair wax. It actually works pretty well, has pretty strong hold, and lasts all day. It&#x27;s easy to apply, well as easy as any other wax, and doesn&#x27;t require much. A dimes worth on a finger will go a long way with application. I also feel this wax works better on short to medium length hair as opposed to long. My main complaint with this wax is the scent. It&#x27;s incredibly strong and really disgusting. It smells like cheap cologne! I can smell it on my head for a couple of hours before it starts to dissipate, which is the only redeeming part since it doesn&#x27;t last all day. It&#x27;s a good wax if you can stand the unbearable scent, if not, skip this completely.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product I hated it. It &amp;#34;gunked&amp;#34; my hair up so bad I could barely run my fingers through it and made me look like I stepped out of an 80&#x27;s movie. I was about to throw it away, but something made me try it again. The secret to this stuff is that a little bit goes A LONG WAY! Use way less than you think you will need when applying it, and make sure your hair is towel-dry (toweled off but still SLIGHTLY damp). Once you can figure out the right ratio of how much you need this product will make your hair have an awesome matte finish with some serious hold that legit lasts me all day and all night!&lt;br /&gt;I can now say that I love this product. You just have to play with it a little to figure out how to properly use it. My only complaint about BedHead Matte Separation Wax is that it is a bit difficult to wash out; I definitely find myself using more shampoo and spending more time massaging my hair in the shower to get all of it out, as compared to other products. If this is a problem for you, I suggest using American Crew Fiber; it produces the same matte finish but you don&#x27;t get quite as much hold and the Fiber can be difficult at times to work with. But overall, I love this product!</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different brands of hair wax, and this is definitely may favorite.  The TIGI Bed Head hold lasts me all day, at least from 8am until 11pm.  This is much better than what I had experienced with other products.  It is really nice to not have to worry about my hair wilting as the day progresses.  Lastly, this products works great when applying it to damp hair just after showering.  This has made using the product very convenient when I do not have time to completely dry my hair.  In fact, I never even bother to do so because this wax works so well on damp hair.</li>
            <li> This wax is absolutely fantastic. It smells great, it holds well, and it looks great. I have tried numerous men&#x27;s hair products over the years and this is by far the best. It has a nice neutral smell that doesn&#x27;t smell too artificial and not too strong. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair crusty but it still holds great. It gives your hair a nice sheen. I have used American Crew, Axe, Redken, and Suave and this beats them hands down.</li>
            <li> This has quickly become my favorite hair styling product do to it&#x27;s solid hold and having the ability to re-style throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a guy, I have thick medium to long hair that I like to style with volume. Most hair products I have tried (and I have tried a lot) leave my hair flat by midday. The Matte Seperation by Bed Head stays put without adding a ton of extra weight. After a quick two minute blow dry and mousse, I simply add this in by hand (don&#x27;t use too much), and I can tame my wild locks with a quick flick of the wrist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They recently changed the container design (it used to be black) but the product itself is the best I have used so far (and the first I can remember purchasing as a repeat customer in a very long time). Buy it...you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Pretty basic, a little too oily for my taste and makes my hair look greasy. I much prefer By Vilain&#x27;s wax.</li>
            <li> Good product at great price. I use to use Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s Sumotech for my hair but thought i should try this product based on the reviews and price. I am very happy with Bedhead Matte Separation Wax and recommend it. Sumotech is a better product because it is not as sticky, but Sumotech is $30 dollars a jar, versus Bedhead which is only $10. Taking price into consideration and overall quality, Bedhead wins.</li>
            <li> Ive been looking everywhere for this particular product for a couple months and finally found it here for a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> great product, thank you</li>
            <li> Got tired of looking like I just walked off of a desert island.  Great hold and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It works so well, I&#x27;ve many of these so far, and will continue to do so. I recommend this for any one who wishes to style their hair.</li>
            <li> Description says 3oz, product received is 2.65oz. As you can see in photo, product received doesn&#x27;t match picture.</li>
            <li> Listing is incorrect, shows 3 oz, 85gr, product that shipped is 2.65 oz, 75gr.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair in place. I love the matte finish. You need to really work the wax in your hand before applying. Smells GREAT. Washes off easily. Doesn&#x27;t feel like its hurting my hair or scalp. My scalp is quite sensitive to products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative is that the hold doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like. You&#x27;d presume using more would help, but the more you use the more it tends to flake. And that looks nasty.</li>
            <li> i love this product since it looks like my hair has nothing in it.&lt;br /&gt;i just use a pea size amount on short-medium hair and it works.&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t like using hair products because of the greasy look or harden look.&lt;br /&gt;this makes your hair look natural and feels fine running your fingers through it.&lt;br /&gt;i can adjust my hair through out the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s hard to manage loose strains of hair that you need to get in place since this is more of a thick textured application. not like a soft gelly application. i have gel for the loose strands. other than that, i just rub in my palm/fingers and put it on my hair first than start adjusting how i like it. natural looking &amp;#34;bedhead&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> one of the best hair products I&#x27;ve ever used for that spiky look, never going back to anything else !!!!!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser suggested this product after i got a pixie... it&#x27;s supposedly for men, but I think that&#x27;s just a marketing ploy because there&#x27;s nothing manly about it. There&#x27;s definitely better products out there, but for the price I paid it&#x27;s hard to beat.</li>
            <li> bought this stuff thinking it would be like the cheap hair products i used to buy and it was so worth the 20$ will be buying more when i run out</li>
            <li> I have ordered this one before but Seems like this time around I got a different TIGI Bed Head Matte Separation, it smells different and holds my hair completely different too. It looses it&#x27;s hold very quick and does not have the Matte finish the REAL version has.  Not sure what happened, but don&#x27;t like it at all!</li>
            <li> Holds very well, but be careful to apply evenly or you&#x27;ll have chunks in your hair. Doesn&#x27;t really stay pliable through the day.</li>
            <li> super hold for inexpensive product</li>
            <li> I used a much more expensive product for a long time, but I&#x27;m glad I discovered this. Its much more affordable, and works great. I have various hair styles, but it works for almost all of them, including keeping my hair in that hard to get messy but up look.</li>
            <li> I have used Bumble and Bumble SumoTech, Gatsby (all of the different colors), Paul Sebastian, Crew Fiber, and a myriad of other clay/wax products. I have thin short hair and I prefer the matte look over the shiny look. This is the best product I have come across in regards to control and weight. Also, when you wash your hair, the product actually comes off very easily unlike many of the other products I mentioned above. Lastly, when you compare this to my second favorite product which is Sumotech, the pricing of the TIGI Bead Head Men Matte Separation Wax cannot be beat. I hope they do not stop making this product because nothing else will match this product in regards to both quality and price.</li>
            <li> Seems to be better mixed formula than what I buy in stores.</li>
            <li> Greta wax! Better hold than the Crew Pomades and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for mortar or your hair, this is your product.  I bought this because I wanted a replacement for bumble and bumble&#x27;s hair wax which is excellent.  You get what you pay for, I guess.  This product leaves your hair stiff and dry.  I feel like I want to wash it out as soon as I use it.  I was using Aveda pomade for men, but my hairdresser suggested I switch off. Bad move!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after using hair gel that worked OK, but dried out my hands so badly my fingers would crack and bleed. I figured this wax would prevent this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can really fault this product for is performing EXACTLY as advertised. This wax is truly &#x27;matte&#x27;, &#x27;dry&#x27;, THICK. It definitely works, but I have thick hair with tons of cowlicks and going for a neat, professional look has proven trickier than I expected with this. I simply think this wax is too &#x27;matte&#x27; for me. I will use the rest of it, and once it&#x27;s in it looks great and stays amazingly, but the application is something I&#x27;m finding a tough time getting used to. The wax also seems to be drying out my hands a bit, not quite as much as the alcohol-containing hair gel I WAS using, but still enough to notice dry flaky skin on the fingers I use to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax also seems difficult to remove from my hair. It&#x27;s not noticeable when it&#x27;s in place, but when I go to take my morning shower I feel my hair and it feels stiff and waxy. I don&#x27;t normally shampoo much, maybe only once or twice a week, but even with shampoo my hair doesn&#x27;t feel normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I shop for a product like this, I think I will go for something that is a little more workable for thick, stubborn, straight hair like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I can&#x27;t fault this particular product too much because I wasn&#x27;t sure what to look for with this type of product, and now I&#x27;ve learned this is not as pliable and easy to apply as I&#x27;d hoped hair wax would be.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Holds very well, without the shine.  Wish I had come across this product years ago.</li>
            <li> Today was the first day I went to work with the wax in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After a few trials of getting the right amount to prevent a glossy appearance on my hair (If your hair is short you only need a pea size, maybe.) everything held in place pretty well and only the wind in the evening was able to distort my hair temporarily, which wasn&#x27;t anything to complain about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t too strong and it gives a clean, masculine smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first wax I&#x27;ve tried, based on Amazon reviews, and it seems to be going well.</li>
            <li> Good standard matte wax. Smells good. Doesn&#x27;t work as good as Bumble &amp; Bumble&#x27;s Sumotech but definitely more affordable for daily use.</li>
            <li> Holds my difficult fine hair in place waaayyy better than Regis styling mud or whatever. Even helps with my cow licks. Smells nicer, too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different expensive hair products from Bumble and Bumble, Bed Head, Kerastase, and Crew. This one is just the right balance of pliability without shine. It&#x27;s also similar to the others in terms of smelling nice, packaging, quantity, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, it&#x27;s only $9! Most of the other comparable products, which I didn&#x27;t like quite as much, cost me $25+. This Matte Separation is a steal!</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but even conservative application of Bed Head leaves my hair feeling sticky and gross.  The girl that cuts my hair rightly chided me for using this stuff.  Not my cup of tea.</li>
            <li> Im very happy with it but It doesn&#x27;t have the hold I wanted anyway it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> Works great. Just use a small amount.</li>
            <li> works great, this is not the first time I ordered</li>
            <li> Good strong fibrous wax</li>
            <li> I have tried several brands of hair &amp;#34;goop&amp;#34; and so far this one is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s relatively affordable, gives my hair a &amp;#34;bedhead&amp;#34; look, doesn&#x27;t look greasy and has a nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Win Win!</li>
            <li> Smell---10/10, its very clean and subtle smelling that lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold---8/10--- I last the whole day and your able to just wet it and reshape it. its very thick don&#x27;t expect to run your fingers through your hair with ease. thicker than I thought. adds tremendous volume to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;I have wavy, thick oily hair. and this stuff worked amazingly. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love it, last for as long as you want to leave it, washes out super easy, hold with a great dry look, not the kind you can run your fingers through but gives you a natural dry look for appearance and durability is great!</li>
            <li> Smells good but leaves the white wax look</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to the original sticky wax that was in the black container you will be sorely disappointed once you receive the new redesigned product in a metal container. I&#x27;ve tried many different brands with the old Tigi beating out all of them in hold while not causing shine. This new product is nowhere near as sticky as the original, it is more like a paste. The hold of the new paste is also nowhere near the hold of the old black container which lasted a whole day. The consistency of the product is now very close to the American Crew Fiber paste but with a weaker hold.</li>
            <li> While this product does have a matte finish and a firm hold, it is not suitable for thin/fine hair. It is a true wax, meaning it is hard to break down on my fingers and palms and work through my locks. I wanted to see if it was anything like the TIGI Hard To Get; it&#x27;s not. Would not buy it again. If I could return it without a loss, I would.</li>
            <li> I love this wax! It&#x27;s a white, pasty substance, the consistency of a sticky clay. Just work through your palm, rub evenly, and apply to your hair, adding focus to all sides and the roots to add the best hold. I was previously using Axe Shine Pomade. The hold of the Axe problem was atrocious, and it always left my hair feeling oily, shiny, douche-smelly, etc. This has replaced that product, and I&#x27;m so much happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that, in terms of texture, it seems to have the same hold as cheaper products, notably Joico Ice Erratic Molding Clay. At least with the Joico, you get more bang for your buck, at the same quality. I have yet to notice a huge difference in the two products, and I don&#x27;t think my usage is as sophisticated or specific enough to justify buying the TIGI versus the Joico (especially since I&#x27;m low on cash!)</li>
            <li> This is definitely the one of the best hair products out there. It is typically 50% more if purchased at your local retailer. I have curly hair and I hate it, I blowdry and then flat iron then finish by using this product to get the look desired. Once I have achieved maximum beauty and sexiness I then finish with a dash of hairspray and voila, baby... eat your heart out!</li>
            <li> In three different occasions me and my buddies order from this link since May 2015 this year, with the first one arrived being the original formula in black can (75g), the second one being the new silver version (85g, as seen in pictures) and the most recent one being the black original version again. We happen to have different preferences toward different formula, so we can swap them around. But I guess the inconsistency might cause other people trouble and it is so easily avoidable, but they haven&#x27;t done so. Two star for their arbitrarily mixing the new and old versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, here&#x27;s my personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While some people like the older version for it containing real bee wax (yes, the new silver version use synthetic bee wax), I found myself like the newer formula better, part of the reason that I&#x27;m very unhappy for receiving the black one again on my most recent order. The new one is less stiff to apply and hold well enough for my purpose. It&#x27;s also easier to wash away. To have a more direct feel on the texture difference, imagine you leaving the new version one open exposed in air for a long time, with some moisture gone, the dryer remainder feel like the old formula, tougher to apply but hold longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both version smell similar (it&#x27;s a good thing), and I think for the price they are both good products, comparable to AC fiber, and they both blow AXE away (impossible to wash away.. feel like they are on my hand the whole day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend to anybody like matt wax, at least after they fix this mix-and-match issue.</li>
            <li> Supreme hold but still able to run my hands through my hair.  Hard to find that combination with the pastes out there, they are usually too weak or make your hair a helmet.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t make the mistake of applying it on dry hair. The smell is neutral like previous review but it took me a while to get used to. Last all day but does require a lot of water to remove, shampoo recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Doctor Who cosplayer (I cosplay the 10th doctor) and I use this to set up my hair all spiky like David Tennant. Works quite well, sometimes I use a bit of fine mist hairspray to hold it into place a little more. I like that it&#x27;s unscented! (Cough, cough, Axe hair products) It&#x27;s awesome, and works perfectly for my use! Allons-y!</li>
            <li> I was using Aveda&#x27;s Grooming Clay for a bit, but I find this has better hold and less mess. I do sometimes miss the smell of the Aveda, but otherwise this is a better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great in the heat and the cold! I used to have trouble with the bed head stick not holding very well in the heat of summer, but this wax must have a higher melting point. I take a dab and rub it into a thin layer on my palms then use that to apply. Otherwise I find you get bits that clump and it looks like you&#x27;ve been watching There&#x27;s Something About Mary for hair tips.</li>
            <li> Great wax. Comfortable, not too messy, not too shiny. Just right. Smells great too. Definitely a great buy.</li>
            <li> First off i will say it was much cheaper to buy here. I saw this on the shelves at 18$&lt;br /&gt;most importantly!! This product is amazing. it does exactly what i want my hair to do(which is hard cuz i have asian hair)&lt;br /&gt;Put it in with minimal water or damp hair then style! doesnt look like gel or feel crunchy like gel and other products! plus its matte like no shine!</li>
            <li> best wax i ever had, gives me the look that i really want, doesnt leave your hear greasy or dry, feels very natural and looks great</li>
            <li> only wax that I use on my hair, it does not leave that greasy look. holds well. have this on auto ship</li>
            <li> Great stuff!! Love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using almost all of the usual suspects and this is by far my favorite.  The American Crew Fiber is good, but it is so greasy it takes multiple washes to get out of your hair.  This is really good in that is has the same hold but it will rinse out of your hair.  it isn&#x27;t too crunchy and looks nice without being too shiny.</li>
            <li> Super strong hold, lasts all day, and much stronger than American Crew Fiber.  Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and/or heavy.  This has become my goto product for the last year or so.  It&#x27;s a very matte finish, so if you want shine it may not be for you.  If you&#x27;re going for a matte bedhead look, look no further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Context: I am south asian with thick, hard to manage hair.</li>
            <li> It is good Wax to keep my  hair hold whole day. I use it this product  regular basis.Thanks for shipping</li>
            <li> I have been trying many different hair waxes, but I think this is the best among the ones I have tried. Decent strength and decent price. I think I am going to purchase this product in the future too.</li>
            <li> After switching from American Crew Fiber, which I was pretty satisfied with, the first thing that I noticed was the smell--unlike AC, this doesn&#x27;t smell like glue (although when applied, AC&#x27;s gluey smell was nonexistent). If anything, the separation wax has a mild, clean smell that was not overpowering. First, I&#x27;d recommend finding that perfect amount of hair moisture before applying, otherwise it feels very thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that set TIGI&#x27;s wax ahead of the Fiber was the softer, more natural feel that my hair head compared to Fiber. Normally, American Crew&#x27;s product left my hair a bit harder than I liked, but eventually softened up. Along with that, my hands were always left with a sticky feel that was hard to wash off. On the other hand, TIGI&#x27;s product felt more aqueous and less glue-like, plus it was easier to wash off without that gross feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only flaw I found was that if too much water and wax is applied, flaking may occur; however for the most part flaking was rare. The product is best used for shorter hair, but longer hair can be managed as well. Compared to American Crew Fiber, this is a bit better.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Less sticky and holds well. Bit expensive but Amazon is the cheapest.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the product to be so stiff. The wax is really tough and somewhat difficult to apply. But it does not require a whole lot to get the hair to stand up. Just need to get some water in the hair before applying this stuff or you&#x27;ll look funny with white wax in the hair.</li>
            <li> My style can last all day with this wax. A must-have.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty thick and this product is probably one of the few that keeps the due up without turning me into a Greaser.</li>
            <li> If you want to the dry Pompadour professional look.....this is the product!!&lt;br /&gt;You would only need a small quarter size to run through your hair and it stays stylish throughout the day....</li>
            <li> Great product. high quality.&lt;br /&gt;It works gently, but I think this is little bit expensive. I like it. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product!  It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair hard or greasy and is pliable just by running your wet hands through your hair.</li>
            <li> Tried a ton of different products. This one is the best.  Great way to create a non-greasy messy/spiky hairstyle.</li>
            <li> Really awsome product. It holds well and is easy to restyle. I like the fact that I can put it on damp hair or dry but get results. I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product I have ever used hands down. Hair looks MATTE and with good texture. Depending on the amount of product you use you can achieve different look, but it always looked good for me. No more paste. Im going to use this for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> the hold lasts for comfortably 12 hours and it&#x27;s the perfect amount of shine</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really like the feel on my hair maybe just not for me</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Have been using it for a while and there is never a build up or a stiff feeling! Love the matte finish, I&#x27;m not a shiny look person when it comes to hair! And you can&#x27;t beat the price!!!</li>
            <li> I love this wax. I have extremely thick/straight hair. I have gone through nearly 4 containers of this product and have found that it provides a matte finish and good, but not great, hold, and it can be hard to work through hair when it is dry. I do need to adjust my hair every so often with this product, as it is not a &amp;#34;apply-and-done&amp;#34; product like a lot of strong hold pomades are, but as the name suggest more &amp;#34;workable&amp;#34; product. This does provide a natural look unlike a lot of those pomades, though. My only complaint with this product is that is does not hold up in humid/hot weather at all; as soon as you step outside with this product in your hair, it will fall down. On the counter side of that, my hair in cooler months maintains the style all day without needing to restyle my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used alot of different Matte Finish products.&lt;br /&gt;This one is my favorite along with Bumble and Bumble Sumotech (which is almost $30 for half the size).&lt;br /&gt;The smell on this is very mild but it works very well in my hair and holds it all day in a very natural looking way.</li>
            <li> Not really sure if I should buy again. I got the black container which is not the one pictured on the page. VERY DISAPPOINTED! 😕</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  Just a tiny amount spread over my fingers is enough to style my hair the way I want it, without looking like I use gel in my hair.  I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough.</li>
            <li> I have real thick hair, like real thick so i need something strong but at the same time not so strong that it&#x27;ll leave gunky crunchy residue on my hair. i have used the american crew fiber mold and it just lacks strength. i have also used the axe hair products and well even though they say it dosent leave you with crunchy hair, it still does! With bed head not only does it keep my hair in place but it leaves it soft and i can even run my fingers through it without compromising the hold. i promise you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made it a habit to buy my boyfriend a new hair wax to try every time he runs out so that he can decide which is his favorite. So far he&#x27;s gone through about 8 different brands and among his favorites were J. Crew Fiber and Go247, but the BedHead is his favorite. It doesn&#x27;t leave his hands sticky or leave residue in his hair. It works on damp or dry hair, but i think it looks best styled when hair is towel-dried, a little damp. I hate the look of men&#x27;s hair when it looks hard or like there is a ton of product in it, so this is perfect. It gives the perfect amount of texture and body and I can still run my hands through it.</li>
            <li> This paste is extremely thick and difficult to distribute on your hair. While it does have some hold to it, I think it is too difficult to &amp;#34;play&amp;#34; with it especially if you have long-ish hair like I do. It&#x27;s very likely that it works better on guys with shorter hair. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to guys with thin hair.</li>
            <li> I used to use GATSBY Moving Rubber Hair Wax. I used Gatsby diligently for about 6 years. The thing that separates this from Gatsby the most is that you need significantly less to achieve significantly more. The hold strength and matte look is approximately the same when comparing to certain types of Gatsby, but I only need a few smudges on my fingers and I&#x27;m good to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who hasn&#x27;t used hair wax before, it&#x27;s a bit awkward at first but it works really well. You can shape your hair very easily and you will very rarely have to worry about your hairstyle again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, like almost all hair products, hot weather is a hair ruiner. You&#x27;re going to have troubles with the wax melting, as it melts the hold on your hair. But if you cool it down again, it goes right back to normal! However, be careful when touching your hair in hot weather because it&#x27;s much easier to rub off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also don&#x27;t sleep with this, because it will probably make your hair look like a mess that&#x27;s much harder to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo gets rid of it very easily, clean up is no problem.</li>
            <li> Three days of use and so far very happy with it. Doesn&#x27;t require a lot. I apply it to my hair after I&#x27;ve towel dried it a bit out of the shower. Good product</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it! We both love the way it makes the hair look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were looking for something that would help style his way, removing frizz and maintain the hairstyle he wanted, without the hard look and residue that gel leaves. This is a great option as it satisfies all it checks all those boxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be definitely be buying more when we run out.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, like it a lot !!!</li>
            <li> A great wax, holds tight.</li>
            <li> He only buys this wax because he says the others look and feel sticky or simply don&#x27;t work as best. He has also tried the more expensive brands. They are $16 at our local store so it saves us a few hard earned bucks as well!</li>
            <li> You can style any shape with your hair after using a little bit of this wax.</li>
            <li> Lovveesss this wax. It really does give your hair a matted, thick look to it. I use this or Enjoy Dry Hair Wax depending on the style I am trying to achieve on a given day.</li>
            <li> Stays on all day, I can adjust my hair anytime I want. GREAT Product!!</li>
            <li> Hands down the best product out there. I&#x27;ve tried so many pomades and gels and this wax has by far the best hold and look. Lasts all day and is seemingly immune to wind. Definitely buy this product if you want something that has amazing hold and a non-greasy look.</li>
            <li> On the performance part, this product definitely delivers as promised: it really does hold well - even in difficult weather, like hot temperatures, high humidity etc. - doesn&#x27;t shine at all, and washes out relatively easily, mainly with water and perhaps a bit of shampoo/soap. As a heavy user myself (I get through a jar in three weeks, Ok it is a small jar but still) I can definitely see it being a good choice for others, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These days though there&#x27;s a lot of different styling products on the market so I often look for more than strictly performance. For example: hair products for women always smell really great and I find that manufacturers have largely neglected this in men&#x27;s products, which is disappointing. Personally, I prefer [[ASIN:B00999CJES Star Wax | Premium Pomade, Clay, by Star Pro Line - 5 fl. oz. Jar]] or [[ASIN:B000V2ACH8 GATSBY MOVING RUBBER SPIKY EDGE Hair Wax, 80g/2.8oz]] mainly because they&#x27;re paraben-free, though I would lean more toward Star Wax since it has a nicer fragrance and holds better so you get a nice bonus (not to mention the best rinsability of them all). I took off a star for each of these features that TIGI lacks. So overall, this ends up being a good product, just not a great one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using the men&#x27;s CREW but decided to try the Bed Head wax.  It&#x27;s great! Light and not too &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; smelling (since I&#x27;m a woman and don&#x27;t particularly want to smell like a man!).  Lasts for a ling time and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> tried just about every mens hair product through the years and this is the best.  It gets stiff when it dries but its not sticky or crusty like some gels get.  Your hair will hold/stay in place all day without it drying out and getting the frizz.</li>
            <li> This is a very strong wax that will hold all day. It smells great  but the scent is not too strong. It&#x27;s a natural looking finish, no shine or wet look. Matte look is definitely the hair style look you want these days.</li>
            <li> The only difference this time is that there is a flowery scent.  The hold does seem a bit weaker than before but the product is solid overall.</li>
            <li> This stuff is excellent. I have used a variety of waxes and pomades, but this stuff really tops them all. At first it is more &amp;#34;solid&amp;#34; or denser than other products, and it&#x27;s hard to work into your hands, but once you have it worked in your hands then it goes on well. And it stays on for a long time. It&#x27;s not shiny at all and lets you move your hair around yet still maintains a good hold. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Not shiny and maintains hair for the entire day.</li>
            <li> This product is simply the best, it leaves your hair looking great all day and does not leave a shiny or wet look, I&#x27;ve also used it on long and short hair so it&#x27;s extremely versatile for styling any look.</li>
            <li> This is perfect!  Good hold for medium-length hair without being greasy or shiny.  The wife can still run her fingers through it, but it&#x27;s much easier to shape.  The price is great for such a large size--this is my go-to from now on.</li>
            <li> i keep buying this product over and over.</li>
            <li> If you purchased once before, then you&#x27;ll keep coming back again and again for this product as I always do!</li>
            <li> Works for my hair type, I think its easy to work with and I even had the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; hair day with this product. Even had compliments from a stranger.</li>
            <li> I used to use Alterna Hemp Styling mud, but unfortunately it&#x27;s been discontinued.  Luckily I found &amp;#34;bed head&amp;#34; and it works like a charm for my wavy hair.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for getting your hair to do what you want. Really sticky, but if other stuff doesn&#x27;t do the job this will. A container of this lasted me five months. It&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years now. Matte finish and allows you to clump and twist easily. Washes out with shampoo without any trouble, unlike products like the Bed Head wax stick.</li>
            <li> I used to love this product. However, the ingredients in the recent batch has changed. Now, it contains &amp;#34;synthetic bees wax&amp;#34; instead of the natural Bees wax it used to contain. So what does that mean? It simply means less hold, and more shine. The product doesn&#x27;t hold as well anymore, through out the day , it feels like the product has vanished from the hair. Companies often reformulate products when they find a substitute ingredient that will save them the cost. And that&#x27;e exactly what they did with this wax.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to look for another product now.</li>
            <li> It works, smells good, and looks natural in use.</li>
            <li> My favorite as I&#x27;ve tried countless other brands as well. Not too sticky on hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used hair products that I could get at walmart. Axe creams and other spiking gels.  I&#x27;m not very knowledgeable about the whole process and difference between them all, but this has been the best thing I&#x27;ve had so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rub a dab of TIGI bed head men matte separation wax into your hair after you take a shower and you&#x27;ll get nice spiked up hair without the flaky or overly wet spiky look.  This stuff will keep your hair in place for over 24hr and continues to work after sleeping.  I go to the gym early in the morning and this stuff is still looking good after sleeping.</li>
            <li> This was a tough decision for me to try a new hair product, but I didn&#x27;t want to use gels any more. So I read the reviews for this and liked what I seen. Anyways for a steep price I just took a gamble and purchased it and I knew I had to start somewhere. I apply a finger full and rub in hands, then apply to my short-length coarse hair and the pliability is amazing when I work it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks now and this matte wax really is worth every penny in my opinion. Bed head is a reliable name in my book now and I even tried some of their other satisfying products.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great it offers a dry natural look that&#x27;s instantly ready after applying. Also this doesn&#x27;t contain the chemicals that can cause permanent damage to your hair. NOTE: I would recommend starting with a little bit on your finger and rub it on your hands then work it in to your hair. Too much and your hair will look greasy.</li>
            <li> I like the look and the easiness of applying this product. The only down side for me is if you put too much especially in the front part of your hair it makes it spike up. Don&#x27;t like the spike look at least not in the front of my hair. Makes me look like alfalfa from the rascals lol! Oh and also in my opinion doesn&#x27;t work well when your hair is short. Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Keeps you hair in place without looking like you have product in your hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to work with and nice finishing touches!</li>
            <li> So far, this is a lot more difficult to use than American Crew Fiber - which is what I have used for years.  I decided to buy into the hype behind the high ratings for this product and just don&#x27;t get it.  The stuff is like cement and even with my strong fingers, it was a workout just to get this stuff to break apart so I could use it for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once on the hair, it is ok, but it shines a little more than American Crew Fiber and this is NOT the look I&#x27;m going for.  I hate any shine as I find the look to be just bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still trying to get use to this Bed Head stuff though by using a little more water and hoping for the best.  However, as of now, this will be my first and last attempt at switching away from American Crew Fiber.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I ran out of some really high quality hair sculting gel/wax from Brazil I had been using for a while.  The first day using this was fine and after a few days of using it I felt a lot of wax build up (even after washing my hair thouroughly every day). The product is just way too stiff for my hair and felt like it was going to break off. Difficult to re-shape during the day unless you drench a lot of water on your head. Felt like I was putting dried out play-doh in my hair. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I got this because it had a lot of good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on thick, works best if you work it between your hands. I have noticed I need a bit more then other creams I have used before but it has a very strong hold and smells pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest showering before bed when wearing this because it is a bit tacky. Other products that I have left in like this tend to run out in my sweat and burn my eyes this one did not.</li>
            <li> This is a must have! I used to use gel, moose, palmade; name it all. This is on the only stuff that I can find that I can style my hair with and not make it shine, greasy, or rock solid.</li>
            <li> Excellent hold and manly smells lasts all day until you remove it showering but does the job!!!</li>
            <li> Bought hoping it would be a little thinner and lighter than Crew Fiber. It&#x27;s the opposite. So it&#x27;s fine if you are looking for something with a little more hold and maybe a little thicker than Fiber (this also doesn&#x27;t wash out as easily as Fiber). Not exactly what I was hoping for</li>
            <li> 3 stars as of now hard to use or maybe I just suck for now its suavecito for me... Update once I use it for a week</li>
            <li> Gives a great hold in your hair without making it crusty like gel. Your hair does feel hard though. Looks like nothing is applied in your hair and smells great</li>
            <li> I buy this for my fiance and he loves it. A lot of the products he&#x27;s tried have been way to shinny, and this wax is exactly as described--it&#x27;s perfectly matte, no &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; look when applied. The hold is great, as well--it lasts well over eight hours, and holds up even in windy weather.</li>
            <li> I have used many different glues and waxes before, but this is the best on the market, period. you can get the style you love no problem. The best part about this product is that your hair stays the way you want it all day. love it. I am ordering a couple more soon</li>
            <li> Not even the real product!! It&#x27;s some cheap expired muck they put together so DO NOT BUY!!! Stick to professional barbershops or drugstores to buy this product or an authorized dealer because this stuff will do harm to your hair!!! As for the real bed head product it is amazing if you get the real deal!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many waxes throughout my years. I have very thick corse hair (thanks Grandpa!)  I loved Sebastian crude clay and used that product for many years until the discontinued it. I tried some AXE products but found them lacking in hold. I came across this TIGI product and I love it! It&#x27;s the best wax and the only product that can manage my hair. I would recommend this product to all!</li>
            <li> I have thick dry hair, and this is the best hair wax I&#x27;ve ever used. Very natural look. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist uses this and it&#x27;s normally expensive at the salon.  Ordered two online.  It definitely has a Matta finish, and a great smell to it.  It has a medium hold that will last all day and gives a natural look.</li>
            <li> when I typed on amazon regarding hair waxes for men this was the first option they showed me and also the best seller.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an asian with very thick hair and my hair grown moderatley, Iv used this for like a couple of days but..hmm how do i say? not what I thought it would be from all the reviews on this amazon page...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes ur hair look really dry..and well about the hold, its strong as rock...but it will give you a messy look to your hair rather than a defining look and it sets up really really fast and sometimes even before you set up ur hair and i found that really annoying...yes with abit of moisture on the head it turns out to be easy to style..but lets see im gonna try out new techniques of applying it like maybe mix it abit with water and so on...but right now I would say its not what I thought it would be!</li>
            <li> Every day is a good hair day now!  Thank you internets for this recommendation as an alternative to stinky Mousse</li>
            <li> I have been searching everywhere for a hair product (wax, gel, etc) that will give me that messy hair, out of bed look without making my hair look dry or shiny.  After I gave Bed Head a try, the search is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying this to my hair, my hair still has volume and the natural look.  If that is what you are looking for, then this will give you the hold and appearance that you&#x27;re seeking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is more than strong enough to style your hair, and it does not leave your hand filled with your hair that has fallen out.  Also, it smells nice.  I put this on at 6:30am and by the end of the day (10:00pm), it is still strong as when I first applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.  The size may seem small, but you do not need to use a lot of wax to style your hair.  One container should last you at least 2 months.  I have been using it for a month and I am not even half way through the container.</li>
            <li> Great Hold as read in reviews!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Pretty much since High School I&#x27;ve kept my head buzzed with a #1 length on clippers. For the past 6 months I&#x27;ve actually been growing out my hair and styling it. I used gel briefly but I hated the constant wet greasy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this and it was a huge difference, I wish this was a little less shiny looking but I have extremely thick hair and it&#x27;s also curly, I&#x27;m going for a straight more slicked back look so I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m just forced to use a lot of this because of my hair and that&#x27;s why it still looks kinda shiny or wet. I just wish it didn&#x27;t look wet or shiny at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I imagine if you have straight hair or maybe even just not having thick hair this would be absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li> it gives you dry look if you applied a little and little oily look if you applied more just like Daniel Day-Lewis, love this product.</li>
            <li> excellent gel that provides strong hold with little or no shine.</li>
            <li> The formula for this hair wax has been altered. I bought this wax years ago, and it worked great -- all day hold, little shine. But over the past six months or so, I&#x27;ve noticed that it &amp;#34;falls out&amp;#34; after about five hours. I pulled out an old container of this stuff and noticed -- this company once used REAL beeswax, and it has now been replaced with SYNTHETIC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this great product is now completely mediocre. It falls out and leaves my hair greasy by the end of the day. I&#x27;ll be looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> The product packaging was different from the picture. It came in a all black round plastic container. Although the metal packaging, like in the photo, would have been nice the product itself is fantastic! Would most likely buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Took a chance on this.  I&#x27;d previously been using American Crew&#x27;s Fiber product. This one costs less and does just as good of a job.  The smell is good - light fragrance.  I keep my hair really short - less than an inch on top and barely enough to pinch on the sides and back - so a little of this goes a long way, for a long time. This product is like a waxy cream rather than a clear gel.  If I accidentally use too much in my hair you can feel it, but most of the time that&#x27;s not a problem.  Also, it washes out pretty easily since it&#x27;s water soluble.  All in all, a good product.</li>
            <li> Every few years I have to find a new hair product because it discontinues.  My friend that&#x27;s a hair stylist suggested this, and it&#x27;s hands down the best one I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  I use a small amount in the morning, and it lasts the whole day without running down your forehead.  What I particularly like is that it looks natural with no oily shine.  I&#x27;d suggest this product to anyone that wants to be stylish and not look like a member of the Jersey Shore.</li>
            <li> This stuff is some of the thickest hair wax I have ever tried. If you want spikes and solid hold get this. I didn&#x27;t like the way it made my hair feel and I will be trying something else next purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for molding and shaping hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- no shine nor stiffening like gel&lt;br /&gt;- maintains the hairstyle even on hot &amp; sweaty days without creating run off from the sweat&lt;br /&gt;- comes off easily in the shower with shampoo&lt;br /&gt;- lasts a long time. I bought this product in June 2013 and it just ran out (8 months later).&lt;br /&gt;- decent smell, very light or non-existent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- can start to harden/dry a bit based on environmental conditions (if around steam or dry heat too often).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, the best product for this need.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I am a product junky. I spend about $75 every month to get my hair cut. So my hair is very important to me lol. This stuff is great! You HAVE to use a small amount though. If you use more than necessary for your hair length, you will have a nasty mess on your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand the reviews saying &amp;#34;girlfriends&amp;#34; hate it. I don&#x27;t spend money and time on my hair just to have someone run their hands through it during the day and mess it all up. If you want to play with my hair, which my boyfriend does, they you do it after you wash it out at night.</li>
            <li> Best stuff there is in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Just ok, very sticky without great hold</li>
            <li> Great product that really delivers what it should.</li>
            <li> This hair product is awesome I use it alone with nothing else  all the time I highly wreak amend this to anyone that has curly hair an wants a straight controlled look that lasts all day and night I will use this product always over anything else don&#x27;t think buy it</li>
            <li> Matt effect, good and flexible hold for many hours, suggested for medium short hair, clean finishing. Best wax ever !</li>
            <li> i have bought this product like three times in the last three months... i&#x27;m not using as much wax for my hair anymore... this stuff really trains your hair.. wish it was cheaper</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, and a little thin.  This product is amazing because my hair is so fine it&#x27;s hard to hold in place or to keep shaped all day.  This stuff makes your hair look dry and natural, but really holds it in place!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this wax in every store i go to and online some stores online carry it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold is great and it harder than normal wax sold in stores for a better hold of hair, but easy to style.</li>
            <li> I am by no means a hair expert, but this is exactly what I was looking for. I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for a good matte wax that will make hair appear natural. A big bonus is the scent. While it isn&#x27;t super potent, when anyone does actually smell it, compliments follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought the price was a bit steep, but then I realized how little of it you need each day, it&#x27;s definitely going to last a long while.  Excellent!</li>
            <li> I have shorter hair and this product only requires a small dab.  If you have longer hair and use too much, you will be sorry.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is so much better than Crew or similar products and it lasts me about 3-4 months.  Highly recommend buying from Amazon because this will cost about $17 at a target/walmart.</li>
            <li> This product is for men, but I&#x27;m a girl and use it. I have long, naturally wavy hair, and this wax when used in a small amount helps tame the frizz. It also makes my wave more curly. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get the desired results. I also use it on my 8 year old boys hair. He has shorter hair that is styled in a kind of mess look. It works great to keep his hair in place all day, which is saying a lot when he comes home from school and his hair still looks good. It is slightly expensive, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find store brand wax products that work this well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002N5MI2S TIGI Bed Head Men Matte Separation Wax, 2.65 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> This stuff just works for my hair. I&#x27;ve tried a ton of different products, but this one is just the right mixture of hold and texture for me. I remember trying this stuff when I had short hair, and it didn&#x27;t quite have enough hold. However, now that my hair has a bit of length to it, it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This wax is clear and workable. It is soft and will allow you to tame the wilder hairs.I use it in my Beard in small amounts to correct the grain.</li>
            <li> Love this. My boyfriend really liked it and I use it as well. Exactly as described, matte finish. Just make sure to rub in or will leave a greyish color. Is not hard to blend.. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Best hair product I use. If I ever have to travel to Mars or another distant location, I will be sure to take as many as the spaceship will let me carry.</li>
            <li> Does the same thing as the older product. But they updated it so now it has synthetic beeswax. Yuck. Smells a lot different when compared to the older mixture.</li>
            <li> Ive used tea tree and american crew products and always found i had to keep getting more out to finally get it to stay. Not with this. only a small amount spread around your hands will take care of your whole head, depending on the length of your hair. great product but does not like to come off of your hands even after washing them.</li>
            <li> Stuff is simply amazing. I have never had such ease working it quickly into my hair and going. I am pretty picky about getting my hair the messy look (oxymoron) and with other producta I have used, it gets too clumped, and wet looking. With Bedhead, I jump out of the shower, towel dry, work about a dime size in and within 30 seconds I&#x27;m good to go. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> My hair is about an inch and a half on top and I&#x27;ve been told I&#x27;ve got thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works pretty well holding my hair in place. I only use a dab of it, rub it into my hands and then rub into my hair. It does feel slightly greasier than other waxes I&#x27;ve used but it holds for a lot longer and still gives off a natural look.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that controls the hair without &amp;#34;looking&amp;#34;like you have product in your hair. I have been using it for years and my container just ran out (it lasted more than a year) . Nice to be able to get it via Amazon Prime for a great price.</li>
            <li> Great matte look with decent hold. I personally place more priority on the matte look, so the weaker hold compared to some greasier waxes was fine for me. I have very fine and longish hair, though, so the hold is probably better for guys with thicker and more wiry hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really great product.</li>
            <li> Nothing but good stuff to say:  a little goes a long way, almost no smell, not greasy, strong enough to last all day without making your hair overly stiff/hard, can be easily reworked with your fingers if needed, washes out easily, never flakes, etc.  I&#x27;ve used this in both wet and dry hair but my preference is while it is still slightly damp after showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be hard to find this in stores but I always order from Amazon since their prices blow away those of my local retailers.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. I&#x27;m a Caucasian male and my hair is about 5&amp;#34; long and I wear it slicked back. This product gives me great hold, it&#x27;s easy to apply, you don&#x27;t need much to get the job done, and it washes out with minimal effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you shop around here you can find a good price on it shipped. I wish it came in a 4oz container like similar products, but this has lasted me quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new favorite styling product, for $12 I suggest you try it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.helping me a lot to make my hair that how l exactly want..</li>
            <li> I was looking for a replacement for American Crew: Classic Fiber. I had used the AC Fiber for a few years now and it does exactly what I want it to: good hold, matte finish, almost a &amp;#34;beach hair&amp;#34; feel. I&#x27;m asian so my hair normally shoots straight like a porcupine. Fiber gave me the ability to add volume to my hair and make it look less... combed and straight (generally less asian).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I like that product a lot and still do. But I think that TIGI Bed Head Separation Wax works better for what I use it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WAS AFRAID THAT &amp;#34;WAX&amp;#34; AUTOMATICALLY MEANT SLICK. I was wrong-- this stuff works JUST LIKE fiber and I would argue better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it everyday, about a fingernail&#x27;s worth (or two, depending on how my hair is acting). I use it throughout my hair to just give it some more volume and hold. I don&#x27;t straight up spike the whole thing-- I work it through and leave it kind of messy/up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS (all of these are in relation to AC Fiber):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Very Tacky. It&#x27;s not like putting glue in my hair, but it has substantial stickiness to it that I like because I know that it&#x27;s actually working. When compared to bottom-of-the-line AXE fiber, which goes on smoothly (and rubs out just as quickly), TIGI immediately works in the hair to give it volume and hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Long hold. Others have said that this doesn&#x27;t hold for very long, which I would disagree with. it seems to hold much longer than AC Fiber. Throughout the day, whenever I go to the bathroom, I can run my hands through my hair and readjust things as if I just put the product in my hair. With AC Fiber, my ability to manipulate my hair throughout the day would diminish at around the end of work. With TIGI, the hold keeps through dinner/going out after work. I really appreciate this, so I don&#x27;t have to apply more. This will obviously vary depending on how much oil your head produces throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- WASHES EASILY off hands! AC Fiber was horrible to wash off. This stuff, though it feels super sticky at first, actually comes off without having to wipe most of it off with a drying towel. Minor detail, but one less annoyance in the morning goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Pop lid AND screw lid. This seems like a silly perk, but it&#x27;s actually appreciated. TIGI made this with a pop top that also can screw off. Why is this a big deal? Because once I take out a dollop, muck up my hands, I don&#x27;t necessarily want to get the crap all over the sides of the container. With the pop top I can just close it with the back of my hand. Again, not a huge deal, but definitely appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Scent. It is subtle and pleasant. Maybe it&#x27;s because I used it everyday, but AC Fiber had a plastic smell to it that I didn&#x27;t love. And maybe because this stuff is new to my routine... but I like the way it smells. I like that it&#x27;s not overwhelming, but that it&#x27;s not odorless either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, none yet that I&#x27;ve found. As I suspected, it works best in dry hair... at least to achieve the look I&#x27;m going for. Even a little moisture in your hair makes it more difficult for the wax to fully adhere... but it DOES adhere better even with wet hair than AC Fiber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, great product. Premium performance at an affordable price. I use this probably 6 days out of the week, and if it&#x27;s anything like the AC Fiber which I used the same amount of, then it will last me about 3-4 months easily. That&#x27;s not bad, considering what women spend on their hair :)rrible to wash off.

            <li> I bought this for my husband after reading tons of reviews for men&#x27;s hair products. He is Asian, and his hair is about 3 inches long on top. He says he likes the hold, and the smell. It doesn&#x27;t seem to flake much. His hair can be styled when dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to get more out of him, but that&#x27;s all hr would tell me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously he was using DE:fi extreme hold for years.</li>
            <li> Works great and with a Great price. I use very little and it lasts all day. Also, the smell is really nice.</li>
            <li> After using this and a few hair products, this item seems to give better results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax makes controls your hair very well, and it does an especially good job at not making your hair rock hard (even if built up in certain areas). So far this is one of the better hair products I&#x27;ve used, and its definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> Best ever, does have a perfume smell, but the best hold and texture, I even wake up with good hair</li>
            <li> Strong, washes off easily when shampooing, nice scent.</li>
            <li> its really great if you don&#x27;t use a lot of it at one time, because you have to test it out to see what&#x27;s the perfect amount to apply for your hair. The more you put, the more dry and down it will feel, you have to apply just the right amount to get it looking nice without killing the volume of your hair. Its definitely better than most gels and can be used with damp or dry hair. The coolest part is that you can restyle your hair, if you still have wax in your hair, by adding wet hands and styling again for those times when hair gets messy or from exercising</li>
            <li> Pretty sticky, my grandson likes Gatsby (purple) better he said because it is more moldable.</li>
            <li> I want my product to have hold but I also don&#x27;t want it look like its gelled. I found the best application was when my hair was dry. Use your fingers and not your palm and it works well.</li>
            <li> love this, excellent matte finish and is very good for the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5 would recommend</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much, didn&#x27;t keep the hair straight and white globs would show up if a decent amount is used. I have thick hair so it didn&#x27;t really hold much.</li>
            <li> I like it. It does give hair a natural look, it does not get as hard as gel and is definitely better than the stiff I used before.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be better, it says matte , but in reality , it&#x27;s still a bit greasy . I like the package, and that&#x27;s about it. I can find better quality even at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> The product has great hold and smells like cologne. It does stick to ur hand but it will begin to wipe off as u keep rupping it thru ur hair.</li>
            <li> The hold is mediocre, can&#x27;t understand how this has so many good reviews. I&#x27;m a white dude with 2 inch straight-ish hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with pretty short hair and I like to use a paste/wax to style up the front area of my hair. I&#x27;ve been using American Crew Fiber paste for several years and have also tried Axe paste, Garnier Fructis, etc. All those brands would give me headaches from the smell and/or chemicals and would make my eyes feel heavy and sleepy, likely from the greasiness/stickiness. This is the definitely the best wax I&#x27;ve used. There is very little smell which means I don&#x27;t get headaches like I get with the others. The texture is more matte than the other brands and doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy. Lastly, the hold and look it gives is superior even to Crew-Fiber. It gives hold while still making your hair feel fresh and dry. And after just getting back from an intense hour at the gym, I can say it holds up to heavy sweating. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> This was one of the first products I tried when looking for a light-hold, disheveled/messy-look product, and it&#x27;s served me quite well. Easy to work with, though it can clump together a little if it&#x27;s not warm enough; I always make sure to get it warm enough before applying. I have extremely thick hair, and the product is still relatively easy to apply after a little getting used to, plus it washes out in the shower extremely easily. It does have a slight scent to it, but I&#x27;m fairly indifferent to it when I *can* smell it, which is rare. The product has a great overall texture once applied -- exactly what I was looking for. I don&#x27;t find it to be prohibitively expensive, as a reasonably small amount can do the job for an entire day; a container lasts me several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only minor issue I see with this product is that it leaves my hair feeling somewhat sticky to the touch for the first few hours, but it&#x27;s certainly not a large enough shortcoming for me to look for another product. Exactly what I wanted, and I plan to keep using it in the future.</li>
            <li> Best hold ever. Have used AXE for years but this stuff blows it away. A little bit will&lt;br /&gt;do. Best to spread it on your fingertips and apply to towel dried hair. Distribute at&lt;br /&gt;roots first and work your way throughout your hair. I just shape my hair the way I&lt;br /&gt;want with my fingers and let it air dry. When dry you can run your fingers through your&lt;br /&gt;hair and shape it even more. Lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strong hold, lasts forever, Matte Finish, Appropriately priced.</li>
            <li> Replaced my Crew Fiber.</li>
            <li> This is what David Tennent uses, so I bought some, and now I have hair like his, but honestly, I am not any happier than I otherwise would have been. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that works on my husband&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li> So strong, it will pull your hair out.  Hard to shampoo out - but really gives an awesome hold and look.</li>
            <li> This wax is crazy good. It holds my hair up very well even during harsh humidity weather! I love the way my hair just stay in one spot!</li>
            <li> FYI, this is kind of too sticky. By wax, they mean wax. I was hoping for more of a malleable natural hair look-making wax. but this will have your hair looking albeit shine free, like you put gel in it. No complaints but not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> By far the best I&#x27;ve used during for my shorter hair. Kept it neat and professional. I doubt I&#x27;ll ever use gel again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good stuff, it makes your hair look natural.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried countless other hair waxes and i finally found one that works. i use it on my hair when i put it up in a pony tail for work to tame all the fly aways and it holds for my 12hr shifts. i also use it on my 2 boys and their little faux hawks. i will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> doesnt style too well, not too strong</li>
            <li> Very good product! I&#x27;ve been trying so many styling stuff, but now I&#x27;ll stay with this one! Love it! I really recommend!</li>
            <li> I have a pretty unruly hair and hate using gel. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of products for my hair and this is the best I&#x27;ve found so far. It does not flake and keeps my hair looking natural and in place all day.</li>
            <li> My hair is very shiny naturally and this does not give me the matte look. My hair is thick too and its just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Best hair product I&#x27;ve ever found and I&#x27;ve used many. Gos a long way too. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The hair product arrived earlier than expected. Very easy to work with and I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about a year now and love it; does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to with no shine or grease.</li>
            <li> First off this smells great, the hold is strong and doesn&#x27;t sweat out, and it is matte, which I appreciate. The only downside for this is that I feel like it makes my hair just a bit too stiff ( I have fine hair) and in the heat just barely sticky? I still use this, in moderation, nearly every day, good product, best wax i&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this Matte Separation Wax. It does not make my hair greasy and you cannot tell it is there. It does hold my hair in place well although i have short hair.</li>
            <li> Great Seller, product was exactly as described! Very Fast Shipping, would highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I have been on a hunt for a hair product that could hold my hair up all day long, but also not give a wet look. This product did it! I love it. It last about six months for me, and I know when I use it in the morning when I get home, My hair wont look totally different. Great product.</li>
            <li> This is awesome lightweight great control and NO sheen product for men.  I love it but is getting harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect hair product for guys with thin hair.  It gives a lot of volume to your hair without looking waxy or stiff.  I am almost out of my first jar and I will be ordering again soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried pretty much everything from American Crew, and for my hair this product beats all those. It&#x27;s not 100% matte - it feels a little too greasy/heavy, but it gets the job done. My preferred product is Redken Maneuver, but when my hair is short I like this wax.</li>
            <li> It lasts pretty well, and I can always re-style</li>
            <li> Love the feel of this wax. It&#x27;s funny, I actually put it on at night when I got it and went to sleep with it on. In the morning, the combed wax on my hair looked like it was untouched, not oily, but semi shiny, doesn&#x27;t give the hard hair feel as much as other waxes and also doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s balding your scalp away either. Very pleased with everything besides the price for its size</li>
            <li> Strongest hold of any matte finish pomade/cream type products.  Because it is so strong it can clump and be difficult to wash out of hair and hands.  But it will hold your hair all day long.  We particularly like this for our boys because they play and play but their hair will keep its style.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use this but decided to try this one out just for the heck of it. The product is very easy to apply and just as easily washed out. The only problem is that I don&#x27;t like the texture it gives to my hair or the hold as opposed to American Crew Fibre. I&#x27;ll probably go back to what I normally use after i finish this. It&#x27;s quite good, but not as good as American Crew Fibre.</li>
            <li> I really loved this hair wax except that if you put a lot on it looks like you have lotion in your hair</li>
            <li> Hold is very good for short hair.  Compared to Tea Tree Shaping Cream by Paul Mitchell, this product has slightly less shine and a little bit longer lasting hold.  The hold will definitely last all day.  The cream is more sticky and thicker, which makes it harder to apply than the Tea Tree Shaping Cream, but this is not a big issue once you get used to it.</li>
            <li> Great wax. If you struggled with hair products that don&#x27;t really do much for your thick and/or curly hair, this product is for you. It is hard when i want to do a simple pomp or combover or anything really when I use other pomades because they are not strong enough. This wax gets the job done. it is thick but seems to wash out good. I bought it again.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend loves it!!!</li>
            <li> This is probably the best type of working/separation wax I&#x27;ve found yet. It definitely holds up for many hours when applied correctly, and works well with other hair products or sprays.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping. Great product.</li>
            <li> I needed a product that held my (thick) hair while not looking like I put a pound of gel in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wax does the job perfectly. What I do is run it all through my hair then tidy up the back and run a comb through the front to keep it up. It&#x27;s best if you keep your hair a little wet as this stuff is really dry but not too wet. I comb the front over after and it looks as natural as you can get after using something.</li>
            <li> Your hair will look dry, yet styled. It takes very little, and lasts a very long time. Been using it for years, and always happy. Don&#x27;t let the price scare you. Its very long lasting!</li>
            <li> So I am used to a wax that is very smooth and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;This one is very difficult to apply.&lt;br /&gt;The wax is very hard.&lt;br /&gt;Once applied, your hair can be styled throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;Washing it is very easy compared to others that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Only if this was a bit easier to apply...</li>
            <li> Great value for hair product relative to the Bumble and Bumble sumotech I used to purchase. Lasts quite a while and has a solid matter appearance.</li>
            <li> styling wax that give my hair the messy look i want and if i blow hot air to melt the wax, it gives it a different look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like glue in your hair where you can&#x27;t run your fingers through your hair. Make my hair go flat too. I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Works great, don&#x27;t use to much water and you won&#x27;t get the shiny glossy finish.  I used this on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Since I bought my first container they have changed the scent (which I don&#x27;t like as much now) and also the texture. I can still make it work but it isn&#x27;t as nice as it used to be, its more heavy and cream-ish than it used to be. If you&#x27;re looking for a more solid wax this is not for you. If your looking for a thick/semi solid molding cream then you&#x27;ve found the right product. (Ohh and WARNING: if you get too much wax in one spot you will have a white creamy spot that will NEVER blend just be careful and use a little bit at a time and build it up to what you need)</li>
            <li> My husband and son are giant babies if they don&#x27;t have this product. It holds all day and when used right it doesn&#x27;t leave a white, greasy residue!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used gel for awhile now and I really have to say I like this better. Good texture and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling grimy.</li>
            <li> This stuff works amazingly well. Sometimes I spray a small bit of hairspray for initial hold and then enjoy playing with the hair later; after it has dried. Some of the best pomade/wax products out there</li>
            <li> Think I found my new hair product! This stuff holds very well with just a tiny amount! Also it has no shine to it so it looks the most natural my hair has ever looked with a hair product... Very satisfied to of purchased this.. But If i were anyone deciding to buy these products over the internet, I suggest you buy them when the climate is cold in your area so you don&#x27;t get a delivery of a jar that the product isn&#x27;t solid! It came perfect when I bought in below 30 weather :)</li>
            <li> I am female, and just recently cut my hair short (very short!) so I wanted something that would hold down the sides and flyaways. Well...it did that. Unfortunately, when you put the wax in your hair, it acts as some sort of glue and makes it impossible to move again. If I try to brush my hair at the end of the night, the brush gets stuck and it hurts to pull it through. The wax also feels very thick and heavy in the hair, and does makes me want to shower nearly immediately after putting it on. Maybe this is how hair waxes and pomades are supposed to work- this is the first one I&#x27;ve used- but I would honestly recommend just using a bit of hair gel instead of this.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I constantly used Fiber by American Crew but this was significantly cheaper but works twice as well.  The product holds my hair well in the shape i want in and stays all day long.  Plus it as matte look instead of waxy or shiny... I feel that look doesn&#x27;t work well with today&#x27;s men hairstyles.  I reorder it here because it is cheaper than a brick and mortar store and I don&#x27;t like going into specialty shops just to find it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However on my second order the product wasn&#x27;t as smooth or easy to handle as before.  It&#x27;s more &#x27;sticky&#x27; if that makes any sense as it is much more difficult to rub on your hands before applying to your hair.  It still works the same but harder to use.  I&#x27;m hoping it is just part of a bad batch.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because I did not like the way the matte finish looked. This isn&#x27;t really the products&#x27; fault; if you want separation with a matte finish I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Better Then most of matte hair wax  ...  you can figure out what ever you want  to your  Hair</li>
            <li> When I first bought this product I thought it wasn&#x27;t what i was looking for after I tried it. After using it a few times I realize it&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been looking for all along! I&#x27;m a guy with the vintage \\&quot;James Dean\\&quot; cut... My hair is about 6inches long and i usually just take a shower in the mornings, towel dry my hair, and put about a dime-amount in my palm and rub it in my hair. I can then style it by combing it back; then run my fingers through it for a bit of a textured look, and my hair will stay put all day long if i want!! It is a wax so when it comes time to wash it you will need shampoo and conditioner to get it all out.. otherwise, the wax will stay in your hair and you can keep styling it after you dry off again, albeit with a slightly looser result thereafter. Either way, as well, you can put the product in your hair and you can restyle it or \\&quot;fix\\&quot; it if it messes up throughout the day and it still holds just fine. LOVE LOVE LOVE this wax!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I just ordered 2 more from Amazon. ;) ....I even used a competitor brand after i ran out of the first one and i threw it away. This TIGI wax is the BEST!!!</li>
            <li> Hands down, the highest hold, lowest shine product I have ever tried. Instantly sculpt that fauxhawk from any length of hair, with ease. Doesn&#x27;t smell like fruit (Gatsby), douchebag (Crew, Axe), or a botany garden.</li>
            <li> Worked well for me when my hair was short but now that it&#x27;s medium length it gets clumped up. I wear my hair in the classic side part now with about 4&amp;#34; of length. When I wore it messy and kept it around 2&amp;#34; it worked fine.</li>
            <li> Its very dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply it to my hair when its still soaked out of the shower because I&#x27;m going foe the wet look right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to work wet or dry molded looks.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely a bit greasy and therefore a cheaper counterpart to something like Matterial by Paul Mitchell.  Still, both of these commercial brands have chemicals and I&#x27;ll personally be looking to move onto a more natural product.</li>
            <li> Great product! Great Seller!</li>
            <li> This has great hold and little shine. Doesn&#x27;t make the hair crispy like gels do. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Exactly the one I bought from the hair salon but so much cheaper.  Works great and I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting it into a small bottle for air travel.</li>
            <li> Best stuff for men who don&#x27;t like the shiny look; and I&#x27;ve tried all the hair products out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still searching for a perfect product for my thick, medium long hair. This does a decent job. My hands only get slightly greasy when touching, but it holds enough weight where it doesn&#x27;t stick straight up after working in the heat for a few hours. It&#x27;s my go to right now. My only complaint is that once it dries out completely it loses its quality.</li>
            <li> As a college student, I was looking for something that&#x27;s great and also cheap. After deciding between a plethora of waxes, this was the final choice and I do not regret it all!&lt;br /&gt;1)The hold is great. It holds all day, even through the gym, windy/raining days.&lt;br /&gt;2)Smell is great.&lt;br /&gt;3)Great overall, you won&#x27;t regret it. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best paste/ wax I have used so far and I especially like the fact that there is no odor.  It&#x27;s a strong hold that lasts all day without being stiff and you just have to make sure you don&#x27;t use too much so your hair won&#x27;t be too sticky.  It just takes a few times using it to figure out the right amount for the look and feel you are going for.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair in a nice matte finish and it looks very natural looking. The barber jacked up my hair, so I bought this to style it more effectively and now my hair doesn&#x27;t look too bad.</li>
            <li> This is the only hair product that my husband says works for him, it is light, not greasy, and gives his hair the hold and lift. Great product I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!!!!  For years, my family and I have been looking for hair product that didn&#x27;t leave flaky residue and to be able to withstand the elements that the world can throw at us.  And this product is absolutely perfect.  No flaky residue, easy to wash out, and revived with just simply wetting the fingers.</li>
            <li> Why all the high ratings?  This stuff is nothing but beeswax...makes my hair crusty feeling.  Yuk.  You&#x27;re better off buying a can of Carnauba car wax and use it instead.</li>
            <li> better than the stuff my hair stylist uses</li>
            <li> very good hair product for men. very strong hold, much stronger than i was expecting. I was previously using Mitchell Tea Tree gel, which i loved the smell but that gel was a little too &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; for my preferences. This TIGI product is a nice blend of shiny and matte look, right in the middle in my opinion. Smell is very good too. A little product goes a long way in the hair. Definitely would recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hold is great and lasts all day. It leaves my hair pliable yet stable with a subtle shine that doesn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> This is great to work with and it lasts all day.  I like the smell too.  I&#x27;m fairly picky about my hair stuff but I really like this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled finding any kind of hair product that A) worked and B) didn&#x27;t make my head feel all crusty and nasty.  This is some of the best product I&#x27;ve ever used. It allowed me to get the style I wanted, easily, without looking &amp;#34;overdone&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> my hair is hard to manage no matter the length (varies from super short to slightly shaggy throughout the year.) I&#x27;m able to easily style my hair with the amount of hold i want without being stiff or wet looking.  i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have tried different waxes in the past, but non seem to work for my hair. My hair is very light and soft so its hard to get it to shape and look the way I want it too. After trying out TIGI, I will never go back. It looks and feels amazing, also there&#x27;s not any bad smell.</li>
            <li> I found this works well, and the price is right.  Its a bit stickier than I would like it to be but that&#x27;s also why it gives a a great styling hold all day.  No real scent to deal with.</li>
            <li> This was either horrible or old. No matter how much you rubbed it in your palms first, it always stayed rubbery. It looked like something splattered on my head.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! Keeps my hair in a hold and leaves no shine whatsoever.  I&#x27;m highly satisfied with the look I get after putting this on in the mornings.  Wet your hair, rub off with a towel, and then put a tiny bit into your hair.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Possibly one of the best hair products available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really works on thin, straight hair to give it manageable results that actually hold. Good job TIGI. Definitely on my list of &amp;#34;Will be buying more of.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And on a bonus side, it smells like Mexican rice. Yum!</li>
            <li> The Matte wax is the only product that I can find that provides a strong hold and is truly a Matte finish.  It does not leave an oily sheen in my hair like other cheaper matte wax products. Except when I haven&#x27;t washed it for a couple days.  Then you get what you get. I have short hair so I do not need to use more than a pea size each morning.  A 2.65 oz portion lasts months.  Worth the price</li>
            <li> Pretty good but sometimes makes hair too hard!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. I used this every day for my hair, wen I ran out I had to re-order the same thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be recommending this amazing product to all of my close friends and family.

            <li> just good ,use comfortable</li>
            <li> I think I found my new go to hair product.  I have pretty thick, coarse hair, and I&#x27;ve always had trouble finding stuff to control it, but this does the trick well.  Holds it in place, and I can easily readjust throughout the day if it starts to fall, and does it all with the matte finish so it looks like there&#x27;s nothing in your hair.  Your hair will retain that way/sticky feel, but it won&#x27;t be on your hand if you run your fingers through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also worth noting that I only use the product (as I&#x27;ve done with others); meaning I don&#x27;t use hair spray, or a blow drier, or whatever, so not sure how those things would tie in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that&#x27;s just how I like it; one product and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> works really well, though the only thing i dont like is that sometimes it makes my hair/scalp smell funky (like mildew)  if i re-wet my hair, or if i leave it on overnight.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 of these, I have pretty regular hair it&#x27;s not too tough or too soft however I wanted wax that&#x27;s a little bit harder than this to hold hair in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still works very well and use it every day without issues, just didn&#x27;t fit how I style my hair I guess.</li>
            <li> This product is one of the best products I have ever used. It allows me to create any style for my hair easily, and it lasts for all day long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually more of a bumble &amp; bumble sumotech fan, but this product works pretty well also.  The difference is the TIGI wax is a lot stickier, and stays sticky throughout the whole day, whereas the sumotech dries out and becomes soft/smooth.  The hold on the TIGI wax is a lot stronger than the sumotech.  I have thick, straight asian hair by the way, and I must say, this wax works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Great works good.. A+ A+ A+ A A A a aa a a a a a aa aaaa  aaa  a</li>
            <li> came quickly and as advertised</li>
            <li> Yeah, great product, I&#x27;ve used Layrite, Suavecito, various drugstore brands, Paul Mitchell, etc. this is not only the best but also some of the cheapest product I&#x27;ve used. Try to buy from &amp;#34;TOP SHELF-BRANDS&amp;#34; as I bought 3 for about $6 for one tin. The product is great and doesn&#x27;t harden like water based pomades (really gross and hard looking hair), and doesn&#x27;t shine like oil based pomades (shiny and awful to wash out). I like my hair slicked pretty tight and this is great</li>
            <li> Works great! Priced to sell! A fraction of the price at the salon.  I highly recommend this product for hard to manage hair.</li>
            <li> the case is broken already</li>
            <li> been using this for a week or so now. it works pretty well. hold is good and no real shine to it. smell is also pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;only thing i noticed is i need to use more of this than my old hair product(crew fiber) to get the hold i want. maybe i am not using it the correct way.</li>
            <li> Best hair product I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve tried most of them available on Amazon.  I have fine hair and this helps make it thicker and holds it in place without a shine. I usually rub little bit of this in my hands then evenly through my hair and it holds all day. For even stronger hold I&#x27;ll hit it with  some hairspray.</li>
            <li> Usually have trouble keeping my hair to stand, but this stuff works great.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t flake, and can be restyled your hair gets messed up during the day.</li>
            <li> I am not an expert on hair wax, but this felt very thick to me. It worked nicely when my hair was short (1-3 inches) but i stopped using it when my hair got longer because it just didn&#x27;t result in a good look in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My husband has tried lots of different hair products and thinks this is the best. It is a dry wax so it does not leave a shine or hardness on his hair but keeps it in place how he wants it.</li>
            <li> Product work as advertised and it holds well and last the whole day. All you need is a very small amount.</li>
            <li> Let me preface this by saying I LOVE this product (as do many others).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a long time I was searching high and low for a product that would hold my super-thick hair, and not leave it looking like I dipped my head in Crisco. Other waxes that I used (including American Crew&#x27;s Fiber) just didn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped, and I&#x27;d all but given up on finding something. I&#x27;d relegated myself to the fact that I would never be able to find something that would work for me.&lt;br /&gt;...Until one day I did my research and came to this little guy.&lt;br /&gt;At less than $20, expectations are already pretty low; there&#x27;s a lot more expensive products out there that didn&#x27;t even help, but I gave this one a shot.&lt;br /&gt;It holds my hair as tight as I want it, doesn&#x27;t leave my hands sticky, and keeps hold through heat &amp; humidity (and even sleeping! Seriously, sometimes I&#x27;ll forget to wash it out before bed and my hair will look the same as when I went to sleep!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thick hair, it&#x27;s a no-brainer to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Where shall one begin with the pitfalls of this product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In no particular order of concern it is important to note that once the item has been sitting around for the duration of a month (despite regular use), the wax begins to harden along the outside and soften on the inside within its closed container. In that predicament, what you may have is a can of dried up Elmer&#x27;s glue. Granted, the wax smells better than Elmer&#x27;s glue but the adhesive properties are still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If used in the morning (or any time of day, I just happen to use it in the morning) at a small dime-sized amount, this wax leaves a sticky residue on your hair, hands, the container, and whatever else you may touch (perhaps your faucet, sink, or towel as you may try to wash off the wax from your hands). Removing the residue from one&#x27;s hands requires anywhere between 2 to 5 minutes of work under warm water and soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the wax is applied onto your hair (post towel-drying) and it is styled to your preferences (so long as it does not try to defy gravity too much), the hold remains for the duration of the day. When the wetness of your hair disappears sometime later, the last thing you may want to touch is your own scalp. For the purposes of imagery, hair on your head will feel akin to combing your hand inside dried-up rice pudding or dried-up oatmeal (assuming your hair is very thick, which mine is). If at any time, you touch your hair to perhaps alter the style, or fix a mistake you did not catch earlier, your hands once again have a sticky residue that is very troublesome to get rid off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, it is not at all wise to leave the wax remaining on your head while sleeping but sometimes we as humans forget. If the wax if left on your scalp and you have very thick hair, you wake up to a mirror and you can see your sleeping patterns. I am a side-sleeper and it is evident as I woke up with a lob-sided mohawk after I accidentally forgot to wash out the wax from my hair. After leaving the wax in your hair for an extended period of time and accidentally sleeping in it, your hair must be washed thoroughly because it is very difficult to control if the scalp is just washed with water then slowly dried with a towel. Not to mention it&#x27;s a time-consuming process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I walked into a salon to get my hair trimmed, the cosmetologist always looks disgusted at how unpleasant my hair is to touch. It looks nice but no stylist dares to touch it until it the wax is washed off. Both times, I am handed off to an assistant who washes off the wax completely before even touching my hair with bare hands. Both times were such an embarrassing ordeal. In one instance of an intimate encounter I was cuddling next to someone and my hair brushed against her skin. Her words were not at all reassuring. My hair looks great, but she mentions ... &amp;#34;do not go anywhere near it&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this product is more drama than I could ever want. It is not worth the extra hassle in the morning, the glue-like texture, the residue, the disgust, let alone it&#x27;s price for all the downfalls. My hair looks great even in high humidity but I will look for something with less maintenance.the wax from my hair.

            <li> I used to use hair gel but I hated how it made my hair rock hard, it felt like I could cut diamonds with it. After about two years of no hair products, except for shampoo, I was sick of not being able to do my hair. When i got this i was kind of skeptical about it, but after only my first day using it, it was great. It held my hair firmly in place and if i ran my hand through it, it&#x27;d go back to how it was. I love this. The best part about this product is that it will last you a very long time. I&#x27;ve had mine for a few weeks and it seems like I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in it! &amp;#34;You get what you pay for&amp;#34; does not apply, because I&#x27;m surprised they&#x27;re not charging double. Have i mentioned it smells really good? I hugged my female friend and she smelled my hair a good 3 times! Overall it&#x27;s a great product and VERY worth it.</li>
            <li> I know 13 bucks sounds like a lot for such a small amount but it actually lasted me a total of 88 days before I had to order a new and that&#x27;s with using it on the daily.</li>
            <li> This product is kind of misleading. It says workable wax yet it not workable at all! Its very difficult to work into your hair (i have thick hair) always making you tug and pull your hair. This product acts more like a gel since when it drys up its impossible to do anything to it. Personally I like to have a little maneuverability with my hair throughout the day to fix little things here or there, but not with this product. Its stuck like that unless you wash it off or just plain deal with it. It also leaves your hair feeling very hard like you put gel instead of wax. Conclusion, its an average wax product with laughable maneuverability and leaves your hair feeling hard and not a natural feel. The only reason this gets 2 stars is because its actually a matte finish.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair in place without looking oily</li>
            <li> It works and my hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy with it in. I have very thick and heavy, medium length hair. Does it&#x27;s job, and holds up just enough in the rain. The smell is pretty good too. I prefer the matte look and this is my go-to.</li>
            <li> A little hard to manipulate but results are great and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best hair wax that I have tried. And the delivery was very fast, only that it was a restricted product and it took me a lot of time and money to get it out from the customs, no one told me about that.</li>
            <li> Great product. Holds hair in place for hours. Apply a little water or apply to damp hair to make styling easier. Doing so will add a slight shine but relatively still gives a &amp;#34;dry-look&amp;#34; if that&#x27;s what you are looking for</li>
            <li> By far the best &amp;#34;dirt&amp;#34; paste product I have used. I prefer a nonshiny spikey look and this works great. Doesn&#x27;t look like I have any product at all which is exactly what I want.</li>
            <li> This wax works good for shorter that needs control. You can use on dry or wet hair, but works in easier with damp hair. A little hard to work in.</li>
            <li> Is not matte look.. But it holds hair very well looking good.. thanks ..</li>
            <li> Since this is a wax, your significant other, by definition, will not like it because your hair will be sticky and hard to play with. As a dude who likes to have his head played with this did not work for me. That being said, it is great for sports (it won&#x27;t loose hold if you swae all day, hell it didn&#x27;t even loose hold after a 2 hour dive in the north Pacific...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Great hold, makes yor hair look shiny/glossy in a good way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Too great of a hold, need to wash with product to get it off your hair, GF&#x27;s hate it...</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my &amp;#34;head hair&amp;#34; but I have since decided that it&#x27;s too expensive and hard to massage in for the hair on my head. However, I now frequently use it for my beard (when I let it grow out). It smells good, and does a great job of holding the hair in place. As some other people have mentioned in their reviews it doesn&#x27;t leave grease stains and if you fall asleep for a nap it&#x27;s still allows you to work the hair the way you want when you get up.</li>
            <li> I really like this a lot. It is very firm, dry wax, but works great, holds all day and doesn&#x27;t flake off. I have wavy hair which generally has a mind of its own. So I need something that is strong to keep it in pace. This does the job wonderfully! I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Great one, even not as firm as I thought</li>
            <li> Quite good, pretty good smell that&#x27;s sort of beach-y, works much better in dry hair, I put it in last thing before going out the door</li>
            <li> Great product - doesn&#x27;t smell, not oily, etc. I&#x27;ve been using this product since last November and it&#x27;s the only thing I buy for my hair now.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of hair products, and FINALLY i have found one that gets my hair to actually look the way I want. It holds all day and night. It is reworkable. It looks GREAT. I literally get comments from women about my hair a few times a week, which didn&#x27;t happen very often with any other products. This is an EXCELLENT hair product and is well worth the price</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my teenage son.  He is extremely happy with the product. It&#x27;s the only product out there that does the job he wants.  And he&#x27;s very picky.</li>
            <li> Cant really go wrong with any bed head product. I have been using them for years. And I am guy!!!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a new hair product after my standby product was discontinued. So far, this is a good contender to replace it. It holds great, has a clean matte look, and has no scent. A great product for men who don&#x27;t like American Crew or Axe and want to look great without any hassle or terrible scent.</li>
            <li> Very strong hold. Good fresh scent</li>
            <li> This is the only hair product I have ever been able to find that doesn&#x27;t make your hair look wet and greasy and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> My kind of wax. I can achieve that bed head with ease</li>
            <li> A great medium hold wax. I have medium length hair for a guy and I&#x27;m very happy with the product. Washes off your hands easily too, which is a big one for me.</li>
            <li> I prefer this to Suave and other more expensive molding paste products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Good product! :D the best hair wax in the market!</li>
            <li> Tried a few different brands (mainly American Crew) but I keep coming back to this one. I have flat, straight Asian hair so this keeps it up without making it shiny. I just use a tiny dab on dry hair and it does the trick. I have tight fade on the sides of my hair and about ~3in on top.</li>
            <li> Make me look like a champ. Matte finish.. I use more to get it under control. No odor. Excellent</li>
            <li> I used to use the Sebastian craft clay before they cut the size in half and doubled the price. So far I like the Alterna Hemp Hair Concrete the best. This Wax is ok but can not compare with the other products mentioned above.</li>
            <li> Good product, nice matte finish.  Washes fairly easily.  Nice smooth, subtle scent.</li>
            <li> Very good holding. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Will continuing purchasing it monthly, one of few waxes that actually allow me to mold my hair the way I want it to.</li>
            <li> Works how I thought. It&#x27;s matte but it gives my hair a nice little shine (I think that&#x27;s specific to my hair color not the product). Holds my relaxed hair well even in fairly windy conditions.&lt;br /&gt;When the weather says winds gust up to 15+ mph I wear a hat. I guess you could counter that with more product in your hair but I don&#x27;t want to pack my hair with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Works wonders and has late a long time. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Good wax that isn&#x27;t too greasy and stiff. Just use sparingly.</li>
            <li> No oily look.&lt;br /&gt;Need very little product.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts most of the day unless you&#x27;ve been scratching your head at work.&lt;br /&gt;No smell unlike some other matte stuff I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair looking good all day! I like styling my hair using this! Keeps my style on hold even after hours and even after much movements.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It washes out easy and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down as long as you don&#x27;t use too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Creates a great dry texture look and smells good.</li>
            <li> Great for short to medium hair. Has a great smell as well.</li>
            <li> Has really strong hold for longer hair. Better then crew. I have the gentleman&#x27;s cut with really long bangs and it was able to hold it all day no problem has no shine which I like..I definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I became very ill and went through powerful medications which made my hair fall out in chunks, which takes months to grow back and even longer to grow back evenly. I have thick curly/wavy hair, so gel was no longer an option for me after the hair fell. I tried many products, from Paul Mitchell, to American Crew and nothing was as good as this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) it&#x27;s a Matte product, which has no shine because the last thing you need is for your hair to shine when going through hairloss/regrowth  because it will make the hairloss look that much worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) it is very workable once in your hair and has an all day hold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) your hair can be restyled throughout the day without adding more, which is amazing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Washes off easy, very easy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, it is very thick at first, so you have to rub it in your hands first before putting it in your hair, the more you rub it the easier it is to put in your hair, and when it comes to hairloss, you don&#x27;t want to try to place this in your hair without rubbing it in your hands first because it will pull out weak hair fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not put this on to wet hair, as it will not style well, must be dry hair in order for it to do it&#x27;s magic, also use a thick large comb to comb your hair or you can just use your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and is cheaper on amazon as Target and K mart have it for close to $20, and that is when they have it in stock because it&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li> Makes the styling of gravity defying hairdos easy and quick, without all of the additives that can make your hair greasy or clumpy. Although I personally use the equivalent of a Tablespoon when styling my hair (my hair is extremely thick), I have been able to get great results with just a dime sized piece of the wax. A truly great product.</li>
            <li> Holds well and washes out easily.</li>
            <li> I chose this product based on other reviews, I can say I really liked it. It does what is supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;I really like how easy it comes off my hands when I wash them after each use.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, however this product is hands down the best product I have used with my fine fine hair. If I don&#x27;t put product in my hair, it is bone straight, however with this product it adds volume and texture. It is worth every penny. On that note, it&#x27;s very affordable compared to others in it&#x27;s same level.</li>
            <li> I like to put it in my hair when it&#x27;s dry and then fluff it up a bit.  It&#x27;s excellent for that.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I wish it was a little cheaper, but I guess it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this wax for my husband who had a new hairstyle because he wanted something to make it look a little &amp;#34;funkier&amp;#34;. Turns out though, that can&#x27;t break free from his usual nice, neat style too much, so I tried the wax on my bangs &amp; I liked it. I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Best wax I&#x27;ve ever used!! Tigi is the best to be honest, this wax is really great, and the amount lasts for so long!! My hair is &#x27;medium&#x27; so I don&#x27;t use a lot, and I use it on my wet hair so, I really like it and it holds really great</li>
            <li> This is wax is good, it doesnt have a smell, its kinda sticky but when you put it in your hair you don&#x27;t feel it, unless you put a ton. I use a really small amount.</li>
            <li> Smell is a little strong but it works great. I&#x27;m a girl and use it on my short hair every day. One of the best matte products i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. SUPER thick so you only need a tiny bit and it covers alot of hair. Has a matte finish so no shiny wet looking hair. Doesn&#x27;t flake up, and holds all day easily. Shampoo might not get all of it out... so before using your favorite shampoo run some regular bar soap through your hair and it will remove it easily before you shampoo. Really love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both this and the Fat Hair thickening pomade workable wax interchangeably, but prefer this one slightly since it seems to be a little easier to work into my hair.  It does make it so my hair has more volume, and it doesn&#x27;t feel waxy or shiny.  Definitely recommended for hair styles for thinning hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff was decent. It&#x27;s easy to put in and easy to wash out. I didn&#x27;t like how &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; my hair was after it would dry. Despite how coarse it gets, my hair remained natural looking yet controlled (I have thick, wavy hair). It didn&#x27;t leave my hair with any sort of wet/gel look. I&#x27;m going to look into buying a different product once this runs out.</li>
            <li> Being new to this game of hair product (prior product was gel only) this workable wax is my favorite so far. Not much needed for per use and leave my hair with a slight shine. I have straight black hair and it works in well. Will continue to use as an everyday product.</li>
            <li> at first I wasn&#x27;t really sure weather to order it or not. But, I took the chance and did. When I first applied the wax it was very light and smooth. I even sleep without washing my hair and wake the next day without that white flakes on my head. I&#x27;m going to order more next week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching and searching for a product that would leave my hair with a true matte finish with no avail for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I bought this product. If you want to have matte finish for your hair without the greasy shine that many products leave you with - BUY THIS! I was skeptical, but after a couple weeks of using this product I can say with certainty this is without a doubt my favorite hair product on the market. Couple this with a hair dryer before styling and you&#x27;re guaranteed a matte finish. Just be sure to rub the product between your hands before applying it to your hair - this will help make sure it&#x27;s evenly applied.</li>
            <li> This stuff is extremely sticky....so I can only recommend it with very short hair...like an inch in length. Anything longer, and it&#x27;s super hard to work through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it&#x27;s definitely a nice matte look. You&#x27;ll want your hair fairly damp, or you&#x27;ll never be able to work it through your hair. Like I said, this is the stickiest stuff I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used quite a few waxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anything longer than an inch or so, and I&#x27;d look at some of the American Crew products (Fiber would be a good place to start).</li>
            <li> My expectations was attended. Thas an awesome product and make your hair the way you want to. I surelly reccomend.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely stubborn. The stubbornness, coupled with the humidity of a tropical climate means that most products don&#x27;t work in my hair to do what I want with all day. I came across the Bed Head Men&#x27;s Matte Separation Wax randomly on Amazon and gave it a try. The wax is firm, yet after spreading it across my hands and into my hair, my hair become pliable and the hold stays just about all day unless it gets wet. The part I like the best is that my hair doesn&#x27;t look fake with the product in. I really enjoy the natural look.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair non-frizzy and workable when applied to damp hair. It especially works well when coming out of the shower. Will definitely be buying again</li>
            <li> This is by far THE best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used, period. Proper all-day hold and superior humidity resistance for this hot New York City summer. The matte finish is perfect - and it smells great too. 100% recommended.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.  It has a very good hold that lasts me for around 12 hours.  I have medium length hair so I was fairly surprised.  I usually struggle finding a product that can hold my hair that long.  Unfortunately, since this is a wax, I have to blow dry my hair every morning to quickly get it styled the way I want it.  If my hair is wet, it usually won&#x27;t hold or I end up with bad hair.</li>
            <li> This has got to be my favorite hair wax by far. I used gatsby for years until i started to realize the hassle of washing it out of my hair. This is perfect. Its matt and its not super sticky that you can&#x27;t wash it off without a second shampooing.</li>
            <li> Imagine you order a gallon of whole milk in a glass bottle, but you receive 3/4 of a gallon of fat-free milk in a plastic container. This is exactly how this listing works - it&#x27;s more of a lottery. When I ordered this item, the image on the listing was of the new formula (twisting metal lid with brown label) but I received the old formula in a black plastic container. The ingredients are different between the two. Why does Amazon allow selling two technically different items on the same listing??</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it a 4.5 because it worked absolutely amazing giving a strong hold with a matt&amp;eacute; finish however it wasn&#x27;t able to hold longer hair very well. Additionally, it was a great price and I got about 8 months out of it.</li>
            <li> firm hold without the gloss</li>
            <li> I wish I knew about this earlier. This is good stuff for almost holding any hair type. And it&#x27;s not to shiny; I hate appearing as if a cow has lick me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products for my thick wavy hair and this one is the best so far that I&#x27;ve used. I was previously using American Crew&#x27;s fiber and I had no problems with that. But, this TIGI Bed Head Men Matte Separation Wax is just a little bit better(and cheaper). Holds up my pompadour style hair all day long. A little bit of this goes a long way. I use it on semi-wet hair and it holds nicely. If I use too much it will be flaky and have white specs. But, if I use just a little bit, perfection!</li>
            <li> Good workable wax, smells great and lasts without the flakes or hard feeling.</li>
            <li> Both are great products but here&#x27;s the comparison in my opinion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Fiber lasts slightly longer than TIGI Matte Separation wax.&lt;br /&gt;2. TIGI is not very sticky on your fingers while applying. With fiber, I always had to wash my hands with soap after applying the product on my hair. So TIGI saves me some time while i am rushing in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;3. Both result in a Matte finish. Both have a firm hold which lasts throughout the day.  Fiber has a &amp;#34;slightly&amp;#34; stronger hold.&lt;br /&gt;4. More chances of having white spots on your hair while using fiber than while using TIGI - this happens when you do not spread the product evenly on your palm/fingers while applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would give TIGI Matte separation wax 5 stars (Fiber might get 4.5)</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. I am not too fond of the &amp;#34;fresh-out-of-the-shower&amp;#34; look that gel gives your hair. With gel, I found that I needed quite a bit to keep my hair in place. With this wax, you really don&#x27;t need much, and it maintains your hairs matte finish, while still keeping it in place. While the container is fairly small, it lasts me about three months.</li>
            <li> I started from American Crew, Gatsby Hair Wax Matte Type, then to TIGI Bed Head Matte Wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gives me an all day hold and it shines when you work with slightly damp hair. It also works very well when you towel dry. Sometimes I don&#x27;t wash my hair before I go to bed and I get up the next day with this stuff on and it gives you that natural bed hair look where you can fix it up at your liking. HAHA! This doesn&#x27;t mean I do this all the time but hey it does work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m never going back to the old products because this works the way I want it to work.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a shot! It might work. It&#x27;s inexpensive, it smells good, and it works! It&#x27;s also the number one best seller for men that&#x27;s why I gave this product a shot and I&#x27;m loving it so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Moved on with the AXE molding paste.</li>
            <li> The best wax I have used.  I have tried a bunch of crappy generic ones. As well as a Redkin wax, Crew Fiber, and Paul Mitchell Clean Cut which was my previous wax.  Also a great one.  Although, not as good as this Matte Separation wax by TIGI Bed Head .  I use less and it last longer.  All day? No problem.  If you are looking for a good matte wax that holds just about any type of hair, this is it. Just buy it, save yourself the time and money of looking for a good one like I did.&lt;br /&gt;And a side not. It is also cheaper then the last 4 waxes I have tried.</li>
            <li> a user of Sumotech, this is a more affordable subsitute. It&#x27;s less waxy and more sticky, but does a good job. I use this for work and save the good stuff for special occassions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple different hair products at this spoint: American Crew Molding Clay, American Crew Pomade, L&#x27;oreal Mineral FX, and Gatsby Air Rise. All are great products, but this one is my favourite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have really thick, black hair as a result from being Indian, speicifcally Punjabi. Most Punjabi people have very thick hair, and mine is even thicker than most. As for my style, I normally have a Zayn Malik type haircut or a combover type-thing; I dont know what to call it. My hair&#x27;s length varies from 2.5-4 inches depending on what style I&#x27;m rocking in that month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Clearly, I need a very powerful hair product to keep my hair up. Most other products give decent hold, but Tigi&#x27;s Matte Separation Wax has superb hold. My hair stays up for most of the day and doesn&#x27;t get messed up by wind or rain, which is important since I live in Vancouver, Canada. The Smell is great, the price is great, texture is good, and the hold is fantastic. This product is recommnded.</li>
            <li> Great quality product that isn&#x27;t overly expensive. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good matte style product with high hold.</li>
            <li> This is my backup when I have trouble finding Kevin Murphy&#x27;s Night Rider (or just don&#x27;t feel like spending that kind of money at the time). Excellent product. I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
            <li> I tried other products similar to this, but I keep coming back to this as it is easy to work with and does not produce a shiny look, which is what I&#x27;m looking for. Best to put this on once the hair is relatively dry.</li>
            <li> I have medium length hair and this works well to hold it in place. I really like that I can use it as more of a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; if I don&#x27;t mess with my hair after its dry but can also style after it drys for a more natural look.</li>
            <li> I got one that is a little bit different by the container but the quality is so good. Perfect smell (Y)</li>
            <li> Pretty good product. Smells great - like its a more expensive product. I also love the top which snaps open instead of having to unscrew each time. Could be a bit drying for some people&#x27;s hair. I combined with pomade a few times and liked the look.</li>
            <li> Hold is great, makes your hair sticky though.</li>
            <li> Happy with purchase, works good</li>
            <li> This wax works well, holds tight, texture is good all day.&lt;br /&gt;Smells good as well. I would buy it again</li>
            <li> If you are black plastic tube series user looking for the next one, be warned.</li>
            <li> This workable wax is a fair price and does the job as advertised.  It has a pleasant smell that&#x27;s very subtle.  Nice product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m a hair guy, but this is one f the best hair products I&#x27;ve used. You don&#x27;t need to use very much, and it will hold all day, provide some good texture and separation, and washes out clean.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two months. The strength is considerable and can even last me over night if I decide to not wash my hair. The product also comes out easily. There is a ton of product available as well, I expect this to last me at least 6 months from date of purchase. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Nice wax, just as described! I would definitely recommend it to a friend. Hair with looks great after using it.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product. Gives a medium to low shine depending on how wet your hair is. Holds my hair in place without the added weight I get with similar products from American Crew.</li>
            <li> stuff is awesome, works great smells great, easy to wash out</li>
            <li> Product is matte if you dont use too much. The hold is medium. Good for short to medium hair. This product will not hold up a mohawk, but will give texture to hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. A tiny bit goes a LONG way (about the very tip of one finger will hold a full head of hear for a full day). Despite the small size, this will no doubt last for quite a long time. It provides all day hold and has a nice clean, fresh smell. The only thing that&#x27;s a little difficult is that it has to go on damp hair, but that&#x27;s a small thing to worry about.</li>
            <li> Great product that lets you have that natural look without looking like a grease head. Actually last longer then Axe products because you need less to get the same lasting results. I can make a jar last months where I am lucky if the other last a month or 2.</li>
            <li> Not a 6 stars because the picture shows the new container design in aluminum, instead I received the black plastic one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of months, and it is EXCELLENT! I have short hair, so l use about half a fingertip&#x27;s amount of product for my hair, but l don&#x27;t think anyone would need more than one fingertip&#x27;s worth per session. The fragrance is very nice (not overwhelming) and unlike other waxes, this one does not leave you looking like a greaser. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> You have to apply a lot if you want to fix your hair style</li>
            <li> Awesome wax with incredible hold.  If this was organic, I would pay 5 times the price for it.  The only thing that bothers me is that it&#x27;s riddled with chemicals, but it certainly is the best holding wax I have ever used.  I used to use Image Gelwhip but those @$$holes changed the formula and forced me to try something new.  I wish I found this years ago!</li>
            <li> Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> My hair is 1-2 inches, extremely thick and I prefer the spiky look.  Over the past year, I have been in search of the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; hair creme/wax which provides the highest hold and a matte look.  In short, there are lots of options that function very differently.  To date, I have tried American Crew Fiber, D:fi D:sculpt, TIGI matte separation, Moving Rubber Spiky Edge, Moving Rubber Grunge Mat, Jonathan Dirt, Sticky Rice, TRENDStarter matte finishing wax and Eufora Hero.  All of these options are priced in the same range (per oz) but each have a unique set of pros and cons.  I&#x27;m still searching for the silver bullet (for my hair type and style).  For TIGI Matter separation wax, here&#x27;s the breakdown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s the \\&quot;actual\\&quot; hold like?  Pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How easy is it to work into the hair?  Moderate.  This product is thicker and denser than most other products; however, unlike Fiber (with the wet sand feel), this product is still very creamy - thus it&#x27;s still easy to spread into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How natural does the hair feel throughout the day?  Hair quickly develops a thick, slightly-sticky and sandy texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is the hold consistent? Yes; however, the sacrifice is that the hair will not feel quite as natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How much do you need to get a decent hold?  An average amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it wash out easily? Not exactly.  As the hair becomes harder throughout the day, it becomes slightly more difficult to wash out.  To be fair, though, this product is still much easier to wash out than the clay-ish products like Grunge Mat or Molding Clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does it smell? Almost no smell with a few subtle floral notes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please see my other reviews to compare against all of the above products.  I personally like this slightly more than Fiber - as the hold strong and it&#x27;s easy to work into the hair.  The only downside is that your hair will start to feel slightly sticky and sandy several hours after application.  This can probably be curbed if you use a lesser amount; however, if you have thick hair, be prepared to experience this downside.bably be curbed if you use a lesser amount; however, if you have thick hair, be prepared to experience this downside.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend Loved it!! It was the perfect gift!! Love the smell</li>
            <li> Excellent product...exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Love the matte finish on my hair. Smells good too! Getting lots of compliments no doubt!</li>
            <li> Extremely similar to American Crew Fiber, but with a big stronger hold. I love this stuff. It is cheaper than many of the other products out there and holds up my thick, straight hair without fail.</li>
            <li> Works well, easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t smell foofie.  I subtracted one star because it started to go bad before it was empty - it gets a bit hard inside the puck once the product gets thinned out.  Still a good buy</li>
            <li> It has a nice aroma, and does well of keeping your hair up.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the chemical/soapy smell, but I&#x27;m scent sensitive.</li>
            <li> It works wonders for like the first 2 hours and it pretty much useless when it&#x27;s a windy day. You will need to apply around 2-3 days if you&#x27;re out and about</li>
            <li> This product is not good. It is too thick and just isn&#x27;t effective at all.</li>
            <li> All day hold, nice smell, soft matte finish. I&#x27;ve tried nearly every top-rated brand of wax, and I&#x27;m convinced this stuff is the best of its kind on the market.</li>
            <li> Adds a lot of texture and volume to my thin hair. Great for medium to short hair lengths.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve been experimenting with pomades a lot and decided that maybe I should give something like this a try.  It&#x27;s cheap and had really good ratings.  Why not?  Well, I have thick and curly short hair.  It&#x27;s kind of fro-y and frizzy.  My pomade of choice is American Crew Pomade, with Medium Hold and High Shine.  This however, is just not suitable for my hair type.  I&#x27;d imagine this works best if you have straight medium length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Smells good, pleasant texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Doesn&#x27;t work well with curly/frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, there ya go.  If you have a hair type similar to mine then I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.  But I believe it is still a very well-made product and would work great otherwise, so that&#x27;s why I gave it three stars.</li>
            <li> A great hold without the Jersey Shore shine. A+</li>
            <li> Buy this wax if you want something that smells absolutely fricken terrific.  You get what you pay for with waxes and this is the best value I&#x27;ve been able to find.</li>
            <li> As long as you let your hair dry JUST enough, but not TOO dry, you can use this to work some magic. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 years now with plenty compliments on my hair from guys to girls, straight to gay and of all ages. Of course, this won&#x27;t be some kind of Cinderella magic paste that&#x27;ll fix your nappy hair or out-dated styles, but it will do well to give your hair a matte shine with a look that won&#x27;t look like you came out of an audition for Grease or The Outsiders. People are always surprised that I actually do have some form of hair product in my hair, and if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for, this is the product you want. If you want more of a shine/wet-look, then go back to the 80s. Just kidding, check out American Crew&#x27;s wax -- the one with the blue label.</li>
            <li> My fine hair finally has some texture</li>
            <li> Works great on my long, thin hair, giving me the ability to pull of a nice comb over look. Been using it for a year so far</li>
            <li> Strong and long lasting hold.  Doesn&#x27;t get greasy.  Applies well damp or dry.  Overall a very good product.</li>
            <li> Best wax I ever tried, period</li>
            <li> For sure my favorite hair wax! If you have colored hair, it doesn&#x27;t weigh down to the color and doesn&#x27;t make it darker! I loved that it showed the true color of my hair dye (super dark blue &amp;#34;Blue Muse&amp;#34; by Vidal Sessions). All day hold!</li>
            <li> Have tried American Crew Fiber and a number of other products, and for all-in-one, this is the best so far.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well to give a good hold to hair, without any glossy or wet look.  It dries quickly and does not produce any flakes.  It also rinses out easily.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Make that hair look suave as hell!</li>
            <li> TIGI products are great. I will not deny that. This particular product is very smelly. If you have chemical sensitivity this is not the product for you. Despite the smelliness, it does an excellent job of keeping my mohawk up all day. When my hair starts to relax I simply remold my hair using the product that is already in my hair and I am good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are chemically sensitive and want a pomade for your hair, buy the TIGI Bed Head stick: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010NRXYM/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o09_s00_i00</li>
            <li> Did not like this product. It has a very strong smell....reminds me of an Axe product smell.</li>
            <li> Strong hold, adds volume, washes out easily and doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp like hair spray and other gels can!</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just not used to hair wax.  I tried it out a few times and stopped.  Was looking forward to using this but unfortunately it was just too time-consuming, and I still got the sticky feel that I get from hair gel.  It&#x27;s too bad because I was pretty excited about the product.</li>
            <li> Its wax and it works great.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used. It allows my hair to be pliable and moveable while still providing excellent hold. My hair stays all day in the position, but I can fix my hair if I need to throughout the day and that will hold as well. Not to mention the product smells good as well.</li>
            <li> Good product. Currently being sold at the Fort Bragg, NC North PX (Main Gate). Remember a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This product worked pretty good at maintaining the look on my hair. You just need to put a little bit of it and your set.</li>
            <li> Great product of you&#x27;re looking for a strong hold, minimal shine and natural finish. A little bit goes along way with this product.</li>
            <li> This is glue, I used it for a month and it is the sole reason why my scalp would become dry. It has limited hold. It does smell nice but literally feels like you applied glue to your hair. Might have worked for others, but didn&#x27;t for me. I have smooth straight black hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of guys hair products for my teenagers hair.  This works better than any of the others for us.  As the day goes by you can just run your hands back through &amp; your style is back in shape.</li>
            <li> My husband loves using this hair product, it allows for a soft, textured, spiky look - without having it look crusty, shiny or really heavy with product.</li>
            <li> Be aware. Kind of sad how people will be dishonest just to make money. This product was fake .I figured this out by comparing it to to the same product at the salon and with TIGI.</li>
            <li> received as expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just an okay product. In the past, I have used all American crew products (except grooming cream), gatsby purple and gatsby pink, difi products, Sebastian craft clay, Osmo clay, KMS molding clay, Paul Mitchell tea tree shaping cream, etc., just to name several products I have used. This Tigi matte separation is not exceptionally good or anything. It is okay- meaning it does what it says it does. It is completely matte without any gloss, has high hold that will last all day. HOWEVER, it does get crunchy and hard-ish once it is all dried, especially if you are those who use styling products while the hair is still towel dried (damp). Once the product is settled in to my hair, it is practically impossible to touch hair or re-shape it, which became a major flaw, at least for my taste. Overall it is okay product for the price, but I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily but this over some other products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little waxy for my preference, and it really needs to be washed out with shampoo before restyling your hair the next day.</li>
            <li> 3rd can of this wax, great stuff!</li>
            <li> nice quality good smell</li>
            <li> Best hair paste I&#x27;ve used, but as all paste, doesn&#x27;t work well the longer hair you have. Works amazing on short to medium</li>
            <li> Smells great and has great hold and appearance.</li>
            <li> My husband wanted to try this.  We purchased this he loves it uses it daily and tells everybody who asks what it is.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;Bed Head&#x27; brand is fast becoming my favourite choice for hair care and styling products. My first experience with the company was when I got my hair cut professionally for the first time as a 16 year old teenage lad. Ever since then, the coconut fragrance has had me hooked, though the price that salons sell the products at can sometimes lead me to cheaper brands in the interim. Thanks to Amazon, all or most of the &#x27;Bed Head&#x27; products are available much cheaper at the click of a button.&lt;br /&gt;Regarding this re-workable wax product from the &#x27;For Men&#x27; range, I would most certainly recommend to guys who have slightly finer hair than others. I, personally, have very fine and thin hair (which I get from my mother - thanks very much mum!) and I require a wax that holds my hair in place throughout the day. This wax certainly does that and only a small amount is needed, in most cases, to get the job done. It has the staple &#x27;Bed Head&#x27; scent and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue like so many other waxes on the market. In fact, I would say that it works in much the same way as texturising paste, and is easily washed/rinsed out.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have tried Tigi&#x27;s re-workable wax, I will certainly be adding it to my top ten list of hair-care products, probably alternating it between the firm-hold gel and the &#x27;Hard To Get&#x27; texturising paste. It most certainly is a great buy, especially when comparing it with others in-store, and it will last you quite a long time (I had mine for a good three and a half months).</li>
            <li> I hate paying a premium for hair products, and every kind of paste, wax and pomade for men seems to cost at least $15 in a grocery or big box store, and at least $20 at a barber shop or salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wax is great, is easy to use, lasts all day, and only costs $5. It is the exact same wax that I&#x27;ve seen for $15+ elsewhere. I&#x27;ve even seen smaller containers of this wax selling for more than $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it runs out (probably next year), I&#x27;ll definitely reorder from Amazon</li>
            <li> Wow, so glad I took a chance on this wax.  Have tried numerous products ( American crew gel, holding creme, and fancier wax).  THis beats them all and is affordable.  A+ product.</li>
            <li> Great texture, and a sturdy hold.&lt;br /&gt;Add a little water in hands to make more playable.</li>
            <li> WOW, this stuff is stiff.  Its good at what it does for the price just got more than I expected</li>
            <li> Not at all greasy and not hard when put through the hair (I use a finger or so&#x27;s worth after blow drying). Probably the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used! Fantastic hold and just great really!</li>
            <li> One of the bests hair products I ever used. Decent price and and great hold a little waxy though but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> best hair product i&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. Has a strong hold that lasts just about all day and doesn&#x27;t have that insane hardness that makes you feel like you&#x27;re wearing a helmet. Washes out easy and is easy to mold once applied.</li>
            <li> Demographically, I&#x27;m 20, male, with medium length fine blond hair, but a lot of it. Thin individual hairs, thick head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wax works brilliantly. It gives the hair a very natural hold that lasts throughout the day, and without making it shiny or unpleasant to run your fingers through (which my girlfriend appreciates). I am able to use it to pull my hair back from sitting in front of my eyes to a swept back look similar to this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With no issues. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely Fantastic!</li>
            <li> It did a good job holding my short to medium length hair in place. But the texture of it was awful. It made my hair feel so waxy and gross. So it looked nice but it just wasn&#x27;t touchable</li>
            <li> Like this product, it works well and I have oily hair.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start with me. I&#x27;m a guy, 17 years old with a full head of thick, darker blonde hair. Finding the right hair product has taken years of trial and error, and I can finally say that I&#x27;ve settled on this remarkable product. My hair isn&#x27;t very responsive to most products and tended to either become very oily when I applied enough product to actually control it. This product has ended my struggles. It has a very nice texture, almost like a thick cream, and easily distributes consistantly through my hair without clumping. It holds my hair up, giving it lasting volume and a soft natural texture while still providing excellent control. Works for quick, last-minute hairstyles and ones that command more time and work.&lt;br /&gt;Weaknesses are basically nonexistent, easily the best hair product I have ever used. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is the best wax I&#x27;ve ever used. Tried lots of others, but this is the best for the money</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every matte hair product out there (i.e American Crew fiber, surf hair, axe stuff, redken, etc.) as my mom is a hairdresser and I get all the goods to sample. This is my favorite. I have very fine, straight hair and this stuff gives me the hold and matte finish I need to look like JT. A little goes a long way, so even though it&#x27;s expensive the quality and value makes me buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> Great product, delivered on time</li>
            <li> Does what it is suppose to and is easier to get of your hair compared to some other waxes that take a few washes to completely get out. I used the wax on moist hair after a shower and followed up with TRESsem&amp;eacute; hairspray to get the hold I need.</li>
            <li> love this stuff....works and smells great. Great hold. It gives your hair a dry look hold</li>
            <li> It is and was a very good product</li>
            <li> As other reviews have said this has good hold, and is truly a matte finish. It also has a great, fantastic scent. It smells very clean, and fresh, not sweet, fruity, or like perfume at all. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not very easy to work into your hair. It&#x27;s a wax, but the texture acts very much like dry clay so it doesn&#x27;t really evenly distributes into your hair. If this works for you then I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to get it because everything else it states is true.</li>
            <li> Great! But smells quite strong</li>
            <li> Never bought wax before for my hair, but I can never go back to gel! Smells nice, holds hair pretty well for styling, and there is a good amount to use! Still around half left even after a couple months of use.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Real hard to style hair with it. Its thick and leaves white residue.</li>
            <li> Less is more, you guys. Don&#x27;t get that &amp;#34;crunch&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li> Gives a great hold, smells good on the head, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product based on so many great reviews. First week I used it every day, hoping to get used to the best way around it. Wet hair, semi wet hair, almost dry hair, etc. But after extensive tryouts, I decided to stop using it, the way your hair feels is just bad! It a really sticky feeling, very hard to apply no matter how you do it. But worst, is the way your hair feels after applied. When anyone touches your hair, is the kind of feeling where their hand will get stucked inside. Trust me, is really really that bad. I wish I haven&#x27;t bought this product. I never review any product, but in this particular case I wish someone would have advice me better on my decision. I can&#x27;t think of someone happy with the feeling of this product on their hair, I just can&#x27;t. And I&#x27;m trying to make my most sincere objective way of rating this product. I used to have a five bucks vo5 styling wax that I bough in the UK and the feeling was so much better that this one. Lame!</li>
            <li> Amazing, I buy one a month. Just an overall amazing product!! So happy I found this!!!! Highly highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> About a year ago my boyfriend started getting his hair professionally cut and styled and this was the first product his stylist recommended. Since then, they have stopped carrying this product at the salon and he&#x27;s tried several others, but this is by far my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Smell: I love the smell of this one. Other products he&#x27;s tried had that sandalwood smell, which I don&#x27;t like. This one just smells great, manly but mild.  It&#x27;s not overpowering or too strong but when I lean in close for a kiss or cuddle, it&#x27;s wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Texture: as other reviewers have said, it&#x27;s a matte, flexible hold that lasts all day. It&#x27;s dependable. By the end of the day you still look good. With other products sometimes it seems to have absorbed or something and by the end of the day it looks like you never even styled your hair at all.  But not this product. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> Love this hair wax.  Washes out easily.  Smell is not as good as TIGI Bed Head.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this product.  He has fine hair that tends to fall flat and this (and a bit of hair spray) helps him style it the way he wants.</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Allows you to easily manage hair&lt;br /&gt;- No unwanted sheen/shine like in other products&lt;br /&gt;- Plenty of wax, could last you months&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Smells OK</li>
            <li> I have short hair and this works great at holding your hair in place but not making it too stiff.  When applied the product does leave your hair a little dry looking so I use this with a :Redken Outplay texture putty&amp;#34; which gives it a little shine.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! Gives your hair a shiny, wet look, but not a greasy look - although it does leave it feeling a bit crisp. You also have to get your hair the way you like it pretty quickly, because it dries quick and then you&#x27;re left in a bigger mess trying to fix it if you still have more styling to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, important note - there&#x27;s a little plastic seal in there that you&#x27;ll be tempted to take out and throw away, because it gets in the way of the ease of access of the pop-up cap - my recommendation is to leave it in and just unscrew the whole top every time you want to use it. Otherwise, within about a week the stuff starts to firm up (no matter how tightly you close the lid), and then it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as it did when it was a paste.</li>
            <li> Best stuff out there.</li>
            <li> I used to use Gillette Precision Putty until they discontinued it and it became pretty much impossible to find.  I have tried many many types and brands of wax and gels to get my hair to look the way it did with Gillette and none have worked until now!  I find if you use a drop of a base putty or wax first such as Gatsby Ultra hard wax this stuff works even better.  Than I finish it off with a holding hairspray.  Personally I want a semi-natural messy spikey look ( I have thick hair), but I want it to stay like that all day and night.  This stuff is the best for that I have come across, definitely give it a try!</li>
            <li> This is amazing. It works your hair really well. You can style it anyway you want and it leaves no shine at all. Smell is awesome too</li>
            <li> Great product.Probably the best I&#x27;ve ever used. Combined with a comb and a fan it works miracles and the finish is truly matte.</li>
            <li> I like this, it does exactly what it says. I would use this over other waxes. It is not shiny.</li>
