            <li>The winner in this set is Zom-body to Love.  </li>
            <li>Love to use them together or seperate.</li>
            <li>OPI is my favorite brand of polish.  </li>
            <li>and I had read the reviews saying that the polish wouldn&#x27;t come out the correct color unless you used MANY coats</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m going to post pics for sure if I can figure it out.</li>
            <li>I like this MUCH better.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments when I wear these.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS SET.</li>
            <li>i love both of the nail polishes</li>
            <li>It took tons of coats and wasn&#x27;t smooth!  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got it, and have fun wearing it on its own.</li>
            <li>I loved this pack because of the great tealy color and the black shatter.  </li>
            <li>It seems to separate easily in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I love the special editions of OPI.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for some glow in the dark polish and this is perfect.  </li>
            <li>The glow in the dark looks great too!</li>
            <li>Fortunately OPI dries very quickly between coats.  </li>
            <li>(you have to hold your nails under a light source, and then turn out the light.  </li>
            <li>I put it by a light for about 3 minutes and got aproximately 2 minutes of glow time.</li>
            <li>I was very excited about this product when I first heard about it!</li>
            <li>FAST DELIVERY!!!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be super wicked looking--great for Halloween right around the corner.</li>
            <li>Love this set - The glow green color alone is not that great in color.  </li>
            <li>The black nail polish is pretty cool, and the end result is awesome too!</li>
            <li>I really like putting a top coat over it, because the texture is wierd otherwise.  </li>
            <li>My advice would be to take more care than normal</li>
            <li>I plan on selling at first garage sale!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun.  </li>
            <li>Fun fun fun.</li>
            <li>these are pretty cool.</li>
            <li>but i love it more than the purple glow in the dark from tattoo ta-boo.</li>
            <li>With the shattered black on top it looks very cool.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mostly reviewing the color, and that is personal opinion.  </li>
            <li>so I was ready for this!</li>
            <li>Overall, once again pleased with OPI.</li>
            <li>I only gave this polish 4 stars instead of 5 because you have to put WAY more coats on of the first polish than the instructions say.  </li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t this gorgeous green color either.</li>
            <li>My fingers glowed for a good half hour!  </li>
            <li>colors are good and the one really glows in the dark!</li>
            <li>Overall my favorite nail polishes by far!</li>
            <li>During daylight hours, it looks just like in the bottle, which is very springy somehow.  </li>
            <li>gals/guys or really anyone.  </li>
            <li>Seller was very prompt in shipping, in fact, got this in&lt;br /&gt;2-3 days...</li>
            <li>would (or maybe I just didn&#x27;t give it enough light).</li>
            <li>OPI usually never disappoints but there is always a first time.  </li>
            <li>I wish they would&#x27;ve came out with a pink because green, especially this kind of green, isn&#x27;t my favorite kind...</li>
            <li>The more coats you add, the more your nails will glow in the dark and the darker the green will get.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this polish to everyone who asks me about it...</li>
            <li>Needless to say, when I actually tried it, I was more than pleased with it!</li>
            <li>From the pic I thought it was more teal colored, but it is a light lime green that glows in the dark.</li>
            <li>Never gets old!</li>
            <li>but like i said i went by the picture which i was not happy about at first, but now i love it and</li>
            <li>old granddaughter for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>, it takes on a whole different look.  </li>
            <li>the formula is just like any normal opi, unlike the purple thats gooey and gritty.</li>
            <li>Seems to stay on much longer than other brands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a huge shatter fan but the Black Shatter does shatter fine.  </li>
            <li>(less polish for more shattered pieces, thick for fewer).</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really complain, the glow on mainstream polishes all seem to be a little blah, this one is no exception.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Product drys and clumps really fast and the black shatter is a bit tricky!</li>
            <li> I still get a kick out of using the glow in the dark and painting mummies over the glow in the dark color, then locking family and friends in the dark and listening to them laugh!</li>
            <li> The green has a strange gritty feeling to it, but it does actually glow in the dark (not bright enough to be a reading light or anything but enough to freak my husband out when he wasn&#x27;t expecting it).</li>
            <li> The glow effect works really well and lasts at least a week</li>
            <li> glow doesn&#x27;t work for very long.</li>
            <li> Wish the blue color would have been the same upon arrival but it was lime green...</li>
            <li> The nail polish glowed in the dark after multiple layers.</li>
            <li> It definitely lives up to glowing in the dark!</li>
            <li> Came in the mail quicker than I expected.</li>
            <li> I let the polish dry for a few hours before applying the shatter because the shatter won&#x27;t work if the polish isn&#x27;t 100% dry.</li>
            <li> Yes, it glows in the dark</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the shatter with the glow in the dark polish</li>
            <li> besides that I havent seen it glow in the dark either..</li>
            <li> Had to put 5 layers of glow in the dark polish just to see it</li>
            <li> After reading the review I decided to put four coats of the glow in the dark on before the crackle.</li>
            <li> The only problem is, she may have a fight on her hands sharing it with her Mother who has to wear green and black to work!!</li>
            <li> I plan to put this on my toes while I&#x27;m at summer camp, and wear it with the black shatter for Halloween.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the crackle black on it</li>
            <li> The glowing polish glows a little, but not like a glow stick</li>
            <li> the green takes a few coats to show up</li>
            <li> After the polish dried I held my fingers up to a lamp for a minute or two then turned out the lights.  </li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t know about any longer than that, since I usually removed it around then).</li>
            <li> The green glowing polish is a little thin, so I used 3 coats.</li>
            <li> The green takes almost 7 coats to look the way it should, making it impossible for it to dry.</li>
            <li> It took me three coats to reduce the visible nail line enough so it wasn&#x27;t annoying me.  </li>
            <li> The base color is very green FYI.</li>
            <li> still disappointed,</li>
            <li> Bad quality!</li>
            <li> Hated it!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Yes, this nail polish glows but hated the texture!  </li>

            <li> I love OPI, and have no complaints about the product.  I&#x27;m mostly reviewing the color, and that is personal opinion.  I&#x27;m not a huge shatter fan but the Black Shatter does shatter fine.  It looks good for what it is.  The winner in this set is Zom-body to Love.  Yes, it glows in the dark (you have to hold your nails under a light source, and then turn out the light.  It&#x27;s fun.  It took me three coats to reduce the visible nail line enough so it wasn&#x27;t annoying me.  I really like putting a top coat over it, because the texture is wierd otherwise.  It seems to separate easily in the bottle.  During daylight hours, it looks just like in the bottle, which is very springy somehow.  I&#x27;m so glad I got it, and have fun wearing it on its own.</li>
            <li> Very fun and great colors. Love to use them together or seperate. Sent this as a gift and they loved it.</li>
            <li> Bought this nail polish gift set for our 16 yr. old granddaughter for Christmas.  She loves anything different.  Never saw this on a store shelf so I know she won&#x27;t already have it.  The only problem is, she may have a fight on her hands sharing it with her Mother who has to wear green and black to work!!</li>
            <li> I loved this pack because of the great tealy color and the black shatter.  I love the special editions of OPI.  I try to collect them all and Amazon is really the best place to purchase them.</li>
            <li> OPI is my favorite brand of polish.  Seems to stay on much longer than other brands.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my Daughter . She was thrilled with the polish and really liked how bright it glowed. My Granddaughter wanted to steal it from her. Thank you for a Quality product that arrived in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> I got this polish and I had read the reviews saying that the polish wouldn&#x27;t come out the correct color unless you used MANY coats so I was ready for this! I used 6-7 coats actually, lol! It came out AMAZING! It looks just like the bottle on my fingers. I let the polish dry for a few hours before applying the shatter because the shatter won&#x27;t work if the polish isn&#x27;t 100% dry. It came out amazingly well. I&#x27;ve never posted pics before but I&#x27;m going to post pics for sure if I can figure it out. I HIGHLY recommend this polish to everyone who asks me about it...which is just about EVERYONE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glow doesn&#x27;t work for very long. I put it by a light for about 3 minutes and got aproximately 2 minutes of glow time. NOTHING like I got with my wet and wild glow polish that comes with the tombstone lid...but it isn&#x27;t this gorgeous green color either. I like this MUCH better.</li>
            <li> This pairing is incredible! I get so many compliments when I wear these.  \\&quot;Zom-body to Love\\&quot; takes about 2-3 coats to go on thickly enough, but I don&#x27;t mind it. The glow effect works really well and lasts at least a week (I don&#x27;t know about any longer than that, since I usually removed it around then). The shatter polish coat goes on really nicely and you can control how it shatters to an extent (less polish for more shattered pieces, thick for fewer). Overall my favorite nail polishes by far!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SET. the green takes a few coats to show up but i love it more than the purple glow in the dark from tattoo ta-boo. the formula is just like any normal opi, unlike the purple thats gooey and gritty. the shatter doesnt work as nicely as the sinful colors one but its ok.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about this product when I first heard about it! Needless to say, when I actually tried it, I was more than pleased with it! It definitely lives up to glowing in the dark! I haven&#x27;t tried the shatter with the glow in the dark polish but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be super wicked looking--great for Halloween right around the corner. The more coats you add, the more your nails will glow in the dark and the darker the green will get. I wish they would&#x27;ve came out with a pink because green, especially this kind of green, isn&#x27;t my favorite kind... Overall, once again pleased with OPI.</li>
            <li> Fun fun fun. I still get a kick out of using the glow in the dark and painting mummies over the glow in the dark color, then locking family and friends in the dark and listening to them laugh! Never gets old!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for some glow in the dark polish and this is perfect.  It took 3-4 coats to fully cover my nails.  Fortunately OPI dries very quickly between coats.  After the polish dried I held my fingers up to a lamp for a minute or two then turned out the lights.  My fingers glowed for a good half hour!  I plan to put this on my toes while I&#x27;m at summer camp, and wear it with the black shatter for Halloween.</li>
            <li> The nail polish glowed in the dark after multiple layers. I didn&#x27;t expect it to work as well as it did!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really complain, the glow on mainstream polishes all seem to be a little blah, this one is no exception. the shatter is great when applied correctly.</li>
            <li> Love this set - The glow green color alone is not that great in color.  Once you put&lt;br /&gt;the crackle black on it, it takes on a whole different look.  Great for halloween, goth&lt;br /&gt;style gals/guys or really anyone.  Seller was very prompt in shipping, in fact, got this in&lt;br /&gt;2-3 days...</li>
            <li> Wish the blue color would have been the same upon arrival but it was lime green...definatley thought the picture did no justice for the color...besides that I havent seen it glow in the dark either..so It&#x27;s kind of disappointing.</li>
            <li> Best crackle nail polish that I have EVER owned! The glow in the dark looks great too! This also has a GREAT price considering the brand name O.P.I.! Recommended!</li>
            <li> i love both of the nail polishes but when i bought these i was going by the picture. when i got them in the mail i was extremely happy but like i said i went by the picture which i was not happy about at first, but now i love it and that is why im givng it 5 stars</li>
            <li> Great colors! The base color is very green FYI. From the pic I thought it was more teal colored, but it is a light lime green that glows in the dark. With the shattered black on top it looks very cool.</li>
            <li> Hated it! Had to put 5 layers of glow in the dark polish just to see it and then it came off in one day. Bad quality! Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I only gave this polish 4 stars instead of 5 because you have to put WAY more coats on of the first polish than the instructions say.  Otherwise this polish works great and just as it says.  Gives a great shatter look.</li>
            <li> Yes, this nail polish glows but hated the texture!  OPI usually never disappoints but there is always a first time.  It took tons of coats and wasn&#x27;t smooth!  The next day my nails were chipping!  I couldn&#x27;t wait to get off!  It took a lot of time removing; wouldn&#x27;t come off!  I plan on selling at first garage sale!</li>
            <li> My advice would be to take more care than normal polish-- it&#x27;s a necessity. Product drys and clumps really fast and the black shatter is a bit tricky!</li>
            <li> Came in the mail quicker than I expected. The green glowing polish is a little thin, so I used 3 coats. The black nail polish is pretty cool, and the end result is awesome too! The glowing polish glows a little, but not like a glow stick would (or maybe I just didn&#x27;t give it enough light). Either way, I&#x27;m very happy with this product and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> FAST DELIVERY!!! AAAAAAA+++++++++</li>
            <li> The green takes almost 7 coats to look the way it should, making it impossible for it to dry. The crackle is great. still disappointed,</li>
            <li> these are pretty cool. colors are good and the one really glows in the dark! very cool, great for the holiday season</li>
            <li> The green has a strange gritty feeling to it, but it does actually glow in the dark (not bright enough to be a reading light or anything but enough to freak my husband out when he wasn&#x27;t expecting it).</li>
            <li> Just got this and I love it. After reading the review I decided to put four coats of the glow in the dark on before the crackle. Worked perfect. I would buy again.</li>
