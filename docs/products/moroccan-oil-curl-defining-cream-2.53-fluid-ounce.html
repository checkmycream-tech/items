            <li>My hair is a new kind of curly since starting the line of Morrocan Oil Products.  </li>
            <li>The oil serum was too heavy but this product works great to give me soft shiny curls.</li>
            <li>I guess I was trying to use something other than Mixed Chicks Leave-in conditioner, which works great for me.  </li>
            <li>My hair is extremely curly on top but mostly frizz in the back.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>really smooth!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was expecting some REAL curl definition, decrease in frizz, and to give my some shine.</li>
            <li>None of this really happened.</li>
            <li>she really likes it.  </li>
            <li>I will stick with the intense curl cream,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how they justify charging so much for this product</li>
            <li>Oh and it smells a touch like cologne, but in a good way (to me at least).</li>
            <li>, crunchy feel you get with so many other products.  </li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t do anything more for my hair than any other product I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of products!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair and putting this on makes my curls come alive!</li>
            <li>Smells divine and makes my hair soft and wavy.</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully on my natural curls</li>
            <li>This curl defining cream works well on my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s stays soft</li>
            <li>Reaonable orice though goes fast with long hair.</li>
            <li>It really does result in defined curls but if I use too much my hair never seems to dry and too little makes no difference at all.</li>
            <li>The curly parts respond very well to this cream and almost instantly form tight soft shiny curls.</li>

            <li> This is a holy grail product for my dry coarse curls.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long curly hair that tends to frizz.</li>
            <li> The scent lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Soft, manageable curls without the stiff</li>
            <li> We tried about 10 other products.</li>
            <li> Other hair products I&#x27;ve used make my hair look dry and dull.</li>

            <li> but you definitely need to wash each day or you get some serious product buildup.  </li>
            <li> A little dab&#x27;ll do ya.</li>

            <li> My daughter has long curly hair that tends to frizz. We tried about 10 other products. This one my sister found and works great. Can&#x27;t find localbut reordered just to get it. Reaonable orice though goes fast with long hair.</li>
            <li> Great product, but over priced.</li>
            <li> Although I have yet to open this tube, I use this product on my curly hair religiously.  No need to try other products as this cream works perfectly on my hair.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Smells divine and makes my hair soft and wavy.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully on my natural curls</li>
            <li> This curl defining cream works well on my naturally curly hair. The oil serum was too heavy but this product works great to give me soft shiny curls.</li>
            <li> Great product...fast shipping</li>
            <li> I sure this on my hair, and my husband uses it on his mustache.</li>
            <li> The product does add moisture to your hair... its thick and softens my thick kinky curls..  the only draw back is the cost</li>
            <li> I think this product is really great!&lt;br /&gt;It smells amazing and makes my curls really smooth!&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that you pay a lot and don&#x27;t get much&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;d definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great product I get more curls when drying my hair than I ever did without it. Shipping was quick and packaging was great</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product! I have wavy hair and putting this on makes my curls come alive! Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Love Moroccanoil Oil Products.  The Curl Defining Cream did not disappoint &amp; works great for my natural curly hair.  Would by again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  My husband loves the smell and I do too!</li>
            <li> Really disliked this product it was so drying to my hair and it didn&#x27;t add any shine or moisture at all!!</li>
            <li> Eliminates frizz and helps shape waves/curls well. A little dab&#x27;ll do ya. Massaging well into slightly damp hair. down to roots, works best. No residue unless you overdo it.</li>
            <li> love this product, been using it for 3 or 4 years and it makes my hair look and feel great.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair and this is a great product for scrunching. Leaves hair soft. Like it much better than mousse.</li>
            <li> I have mixed race, curly, 3C hair. (Those of you in the curly hair community know what this means). This didn&#x27;t do anything more for my hair than any other product I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of products! I was expecting some REAL curl definition, decrease in frizz, and to give my some shine. None of this really happened. Especially the curl definition part. So, with that said......NEXT!!</li>
            <li> Great product not greasy</li>
            <li> This is a holy grail product for my dry coarse curls. I use it to scrunch in over mouse or gel and it softens the hair just enough. Just don;t pile it on heavy or it will way your hair down if its not super thick like mine. Oh and it smells a touch like cologne, but in a good way (to me at least).</li>
            <li> My hair is a new kind of curly since starting the line of Morrocan Oil Products.  Soft, manageable curls without the stiff, crunchy feel you get with so many other products.  Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> great product....works terrific!</li>
            <li> A little heavy on my hair.  Keeps the hair organized but you definitely need to wash each day or you get some serious product buildup.  The day after hair is really wonky looking so be prepared to wash more often.  It&#x27;s important to get it really evenly distributed too.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It not only gives your hair more body but adds shine. And it smells heavenly too!  Other hair products I&#x27;ve used make my hair look dry and dull.</li>
            <li> It curls my hair so nice and it&#x27;s stays soft</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t too much to define my curls, but was OK to use.</li>
            <li> I have thin, curly hair &amp; it works well for me. It makes my hair curly, soft, &amp; smell nice.  The smell is strong &amp; will stick for days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  I guess I was trying to use something other than Mixed Chicks Leave-in conditioner, which works great for me.  I gave Morrocanoil to my mom - she really likes it.  The scent lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!!! I love it and very fast delivery!!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find that this product did anything worth ordering it again. I will stick with the intense curl cream,</li>
            <li> It really does result in defined curls but if I use too much my hair never seems to dry and too little makes no difference at all. My hair is extremely curly on top but mostly frizz in the back. The curly parts respond very well to this cream and almost instantly form tight soft shiny curls. The frizzy back however is quite resistent so I am still experimenting with the correct amount to use. The usual advice to use a pea- size bit of product I think is not correct, more like a small dollop. The fragrance is absolutely fabulous. I don&#x27;t understand how they justify charging so much for this product but i will probably buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> The product is fantastic!</li>
