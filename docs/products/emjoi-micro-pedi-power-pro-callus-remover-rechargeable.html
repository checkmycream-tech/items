            <li>While I cannot compare it to the corded version since I&#x27;ve never had one, I think that the rechargeable one was a good choice.  </li>
            <li>Works surprisingly well.  </li>

            <li>This was another  example of good customer service as they stood by their add.</li>
            <li>Although this buffer works good, I would suggest it be used on maintained callouses.</li>

            <li>It is very easy to use and does a great job.</li>

            <li>Love this foot buffer!  </li>

            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>I am in love!  </li>
            <li>This is better than ANY pedicure I have ever gotten!  </li>
            <li>I could not recommend it more!  </li>
            <li>I love this foot buffer!.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This works great and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>and it is so easy to use and very effective.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>it is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for quality nail care products so that I can do my own mani/pedis when I prefer to.  </li>
            <li>I decided to buy my own and found this rechargeable model and bought it.  </li>
            <li>Nice design and power.  </li>
            <li>that kind of bugs me but is not the end of the world.  </li>
            <li>Love the Micro-Pedi and it has a good amount of power.  </li>
            <li>So nice to use and  </li>
            <li>I used the Emjoy and liked it</li>
            <li>Also, the charger is not as effective in a surge protector strip.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Needless to say, my mom was thrilled.</li>
            <li>I agree you have to make sure you have good brand batteries when using this item.</li>
            <li>They, too, give this 5 stars and have NEVER gotten this kind of result from a nail salon.  </li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it!!  </li>
            <li>We each have our own rollers and swap them out when using (very easy to do).</li>
            <li>Easy to use and being able to charge rather than continue to take batteries is a great option.</li>
            <li>It works remarkably well leaving your feet smooth..</li>
            <li>like it , work good not as strong of a motor as i think it should be</li>
            <li>I found the Emjoi very easy to use.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving it even more.</li>
            <li>This easy rechargeable buffer is the absolute best buy I&#x27;ve made in a longtime.i recommend this product to all who suffer from callouses on their feet.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and does the job!</li>
            <li>and IT SO EASY TO USE!  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product!  </li>
            <li>Love love love this thing!</li>
            <li>But it was GREAT, as I could see that it was being effective, even though it felt gentle.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is worth the money and beats going to the salon to pay money for someone to do your feet, then have to go home and redo your own heels because the salon did not do a good job</li>
            <li>Love this-  easy to use, does a great job in keeping skin smooth.  </li>
            <li>We both find it very easy to use and able to reach all over our feet.</li>
            <li>It gives beautiful results very quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The battery is very important, and you would not want to compromise its performance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>feet were very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>maybe the plug in model has more torque.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>Well pleased with the ..</li>
            <li>I love the Emjoi pedi foot buffer.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I ABSOLUTELY LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>I have friends who have the Amope, which allows you to see your foot better, but has insufficient power and isn&#x27;t rechargeable.</li>
            <li>so I knew I wanted more power.</li>
            <li>When I started buffing the callouses on the ball of my left foot, the results were immediately impressive.</li>
            <li>my heels are almost soft--few more days</li>
            <li>Love the rechargeable feature, too--</li>
            <li>The results were markedly better than using a manual file.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this a couple times and love it.</li>
            <li>so make sure you get what you were promised...</li>
            <li>but i do love the product and will order more for friends for christmas gifts.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you did......</li>
            <li>I must really love this tool.  </li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>I love this buffer.  </li>
            <li>I tried to return it a month and 5 days after the date of purchace and received notice from Amazon that the seller follows the Amazon policy of not accepting returns more than 30 days after purchase.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I chose the rechargeable version.  </li>
            <li>I now have smooth feet!</li>
            <li>Better yet...</li>
            <li>Made me feet feel better than a $75 pedicure ever did.</li>
            <li>and it makes your feet feel really nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>PedEgg works better, but this is easier to maneuver.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it&lt;</li>
            <li>The more feminine versions start at $8.95.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do make sure you have dampened your feet before using the Microplane.</li>
            <li>It sure works unlike anything else I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>There are many complaints of dust everywhere.</li>
            <li>so hopefully it will be a great product thanks</li>
            <li>My sister-in-law gave me my Micro Pedi for Christmas and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Recharge lasts through many times.  </li>
            <li>You will love it,</li>
            <li>This just keeps getting better and better.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Tried many manual pumice stones, but this is much better and requires no effort.</li>
            <li>ALL I HAVE TO DO IS A QUICKY EACH WEEK :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad my girlfriend brought hers when she came to visit.</li>
            <li>Recharging takes many hours and you don&#x27;t know when it is fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love , love ,love</li>
            <li>So much better then</li>
            <li>So glad I bought this item.  </li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Better to exfoliate weekly, then attempting to remove thicker callouses all at once.</li>
            <li>They  haven&#x27;t been this smooth since I can&#x27;t remember when!  </li>
            <li>This works better than anything I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>the battery powered Foot Buffer completely satisfied</li>
            <li>does a better job than my pedicurist.  </li>
            <li>stays charges for many many uses.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many of the store bought foot scrapers and nothing compares to this.</li>
            <li>I thought of the use of this product it gets better.</li>
            <li>I love this buffer, I tested the Amope also.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I can not say how much I love this device.  </li>
            <li>It is absolutely fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m keeping it because it&#x27;s not horrible.</li>
            <li>I just wish it had more strength.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like magic.</li>
            <li>This will be great for the summer because I have a concrete deck around my pool and calluses end up drying out and cracking!  </li>
            <li>Best at home pedicure, makes your feet very soft with little workâ€¦.the attachments are great too!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is one of the best expenditures I have made in a long time.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m not afraid to TAKE ON my feet!!)</li>
            <li>The new one works great.  </li>
            <li>Works great; better than paying for pedicures to get soft feet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have it as it helps avoid the huge callus cracks that happen if I don&#x27;t keep on top of the callus status.</li>
            <li>Easy to use cost was ok for what the product is to be used for.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does an excellent job removing the dry skin and calluses.  </li>
            <li>Excellent buffer but can&#x27;t tell when fully charged as the charging light is red and doesn&#x27;t change colors or turn off when fully charged</li>
            <li>Moving the Micro-Pedi in a downward motion is how you will get the greatest buffing action and greatest results in the least amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am finally able to get the callouses on my toes under control and the snaggy bits on my heels gone in one sitting.</li>
            <li>Best investment in a very, very long time!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m squeezing 3-4 uses out of each, but they&#x27;re most effective with the first two uses.  </li>
            <li>they started becoming unsightly again after a day or two, despite applying lotion and wearing socks overnight.</li>
            <li>A great tool which has fixed a long-term problem.</li>
            <li>One thing I wish the manufacturer would improve on is the option of different widths of the head for smaller areas, but otherwise a great find, and great buy!</li>
            <li>and they all felt cheap and most needed batteries.  </li>
            <li>and it does what it claims to do have two smooth healthy</li>
            <li>I was delighted to see and feel such great results after just the first use.  </li>
            <li>Much more user friendly that a file.  </li>
            <li>So cool and painless now!</li>
            <li>The unit is compact - easy to store.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Does what it claims and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It is easy and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li>Changing the rollers is really easy.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this Emjoi that is rechargeable.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product; a good deal for the price.  </li>
            <li>Love not having to go bi-monthly and pay $55 for a full pedicure.  </li>
            <li>The Micro-Pedi buffer works just fine for me.  </li>
            <li>Received the product, charged it up per directions, it worked fine.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, and easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>This buffer is easy to use, easy to clean, and works as promised.</li>
            <li>Easy to refill and quick clean up!</li>
            <li>Best thing ever coming down the pike for feet!  </li>
            <li>It keeps me callous free.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t something to use one time and then expect your feet to be smooth forever.  </li>
            <li>This is a definite great purchase, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>The product does smooth some of the roughness on my feet; however, it takes a while to smooth the skin</li>
            <li>buff those calluses away, leaves foot smooth</li>
            <li>My feet are so smooth  </li>
            <li>but overall I&#x27;m happy with my purchase</li>
            <li>My lady friend used her mini Pedi Egg on my feet last year and they felt great.  </li>
            <li>I use it with a light touch and it just goes to work.</li>
            <li>After I was done, I used a manual buffer to smooth and then put on a pair of Bliss socks.</li>
            <li>My feet are so smooth they slide in my shoes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and change the head.  </li>
            <li>The charge light never goes off</li>
            <li>Made my feet really smooth.</li>
            <li>My feet have never been so smooth.</li>
            <li>It has held its charge and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The charge light continued blinking even after charging for 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>MY FEET ARE SOOOOO SMOOTH - I&#x27;VE</li>
            <li>This is easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it (lightly) for 3 nights now, with the discs recommended for guys</li>
            <li>buff the bottom of your feet smooth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for in-between touch ups, but it definitely can&#x27;t replace good old fashioned elbow grease.</li>
            <li>If you have calluses that are a few millimeters in thickness that just need to be made smooth, the Emjoi may be the perfect solution for you.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li>Not as effective as I had hoped, but it does a decent job maintaining smoothness for a while after I&#x27;ve had a pedicure.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cleans up quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Be sure to follow the instructions and charge it for 16 hours before using it the first time.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time and was in original sealed box.</li>
            <li>and the indicator light never told me it was done, but it was still pretty effective after a first charge of the recommended time.</li>
            <li>works great on cleaning the roller better than that dinky little brush they put in the box.</li>
            <li>you want the world to see, but the money you can save by spending your own time is wildly gratifying... to me!</li>
            <li>Very light pressure on DRY feet was all that&#x27;s needed to get my feet in better shape than they have been since I was a baby 68 years ago!  </li>
            <li>Just got my Rechargeable Emjoi Micro-Pedi Pro Foot Buffer (Special Edition)&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>The Amope is better for men or people with large feet.  </li>
            <li>The cone accessories that can be ordered separately, are a wonderful compliment  for hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li>Works great on my rough heals.</li>
            <li>pretty good considering how much has buffed off my feet during these first uses.</li>
            <li>and she liked the way he feet felt soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>I love everything about this item except how fast you go through the rollers.  </li>
            <li>it together, the batteries will only allow for one good treatment.</li>
            <li>It is always at full power for each use.  </li>
            <li>If you search amazon for &amp;#34;microplane&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;foot,&amp;#34; you&#x27;ll find the full line.</li>
            <li>The roller is good for multiple uses.</li>
            <li>Good product, would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>Works like a charm to do around all fingernails and both feet all over without any hurry on one full charge.</li>
            <li>you have to use cautiously,  especially at first til you become accustomed to how much skin it removes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for dealing with rough heels in between pedicures!  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if the red light ever went off to let you know when it was charged, but this hasn&#x27;t been an issue since it&#x27;s always charged when I need it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure the first one had a defective battery from the get-go.  </li>
            <li>During use, the motor can be heard to quickly lose intensity.  </li>
            <li>If it only had a built-in vacuum cleaner it would be perfect.</li>
            <li>I end up roughing my feet first with a foot rasp, then using this product to smooth out my skin.</li>
            <li>It works so much quicker and your feet are left feeling nice and smooth!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing how soft and not frightening the heels of my feet are anymore.  </li>
            <li>The emjoi buffer is fast easy and safe&lt;</li>
            <li>This is an easy product to use and smooths the heel very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this easy to use foot buffer.  </li>
            <li>very convenient, easy to use, and always there when you need it because it is rechargable.</li>
            <li>Does a good job on dry feet.  </li>
            <li>For me, using it the first time, there was a lot!  </li>
            <li>The vender was very helpful in replacing the unit for the one I have now (which works just fine..)</li>
            <li>THIS IS A FABULOUS PRODUCT - IT CAME ALREADY CHARGED AND READY TO GO -</li>
            <li>The primary reason why I&#x27;m giving 4 instead of 5 stars is because of two things: 1) the rotating head isn&#x27;t viewable 360 degrees  (i.e. covered on one side), so it really limits the ability to see what you&#x27;re buffing.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have smooth heels and feet, and also to those who have tender skin because it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely amazing how simple the technology is and how thoroughly it works.</li>
            <li>worth it to purchase.</li>
            <li>The power is good, although I could see that a man with really thick calluses might need more power.</li>
            <li>I chose the Emjoi because it looked sturdier and more comfortable to hold than similar units I saw online.</li>
            <li>This was worth the price.  </li>
            <li>worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>To my pleasant surprise, they actually felt better, even after standing or walking for long periods of time.</li>
            <li>Gentle but VERY powerful.</li>
            <li>I bought myself one and liked it so much that I ordered two more for other people.  </li>
            <li>have tried many other techniques, but none of them equal the great results you get with Micro-Pedi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cindy</li>
            <li>In just one quick easy session my feet or soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>By the time I finished my right foot</li>
            <li>I had a shoulder replacement and the strength in my right arm</li>
            <li>This smooths then right out.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone wanting smooth heels.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and feet are so soft!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the dust factor is considerably less once your feet are in better shape.  </li>
            <li>It works beautifully and the recharging capabilities mean that she can use it anywhere in the house, but not have to fuss with AA or AAA batteries.</li>
            <li>This powered foot sanding buffer works very well and quickly.</li>
            <li>The rollers are easy to replace but so far they have held up well and not needed replacement.</li>
            <li>Since I liked the ped-egg, I hadn&#x27;t  really opened this until recently.  </li>
            <li>Leaves feet very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It left my feet very smooth after just the first use.  </li>
            <li>Works nice and quick, especially when you order the super coarse rollers for this thing.</li>
            <li>Works really well!</li>
            <li>First time user and</li>
            <li>way it leaves their feet; smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I was able to use this buffer for both feet after only charging for 30 minutes, then plugged it in for the recommended time.</li>
            <li>So overall, I would recommend this product based on the batteries saved by recharging, the power, the comfort in your hand, and it&#x27;s effectiveness on most parts of my feet.</li>
            <li>So overall, I would recommend this product based on the batteries saved by recharging, the power, the comfort in your hand, and it&#x27;s effectiveness on most parts of my feet.</li>
            <li>I researched motorized buffers pretty thoroughly before trying the Emjoi.</li>
            <li>but I followed the directions and let it charge overnight before my first use.</li>
            <li>I was mindful during my first session that I didn&#x27;t want to overdo it.</li>
            <li>It was also nice not having my socks get stuck to my rough heels.</li>
            <li>and she told me that she is satisfied, later my mother used it on my stepfather</li>
            <li>It has an easy to change sanding roller, and the replacement&lt;br /&gt;sanding rollers are available in Fine to Extra Coarse Grit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The directions are silent about leaving the product on the charger--I read the instructions carefuilly, and most products allow leaving them on the charger.  </li>
            <li>I use it ever day to keep my feet smooth and soft all the time.</li>
            <li>I was worried that this thing might be under-powered but it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>It makes my feet soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>It performs exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>My first buffer did not work, wouldn&#x27;t even charge.</li>
            <li>Still on the first head.</li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>So far everyone with the battery Enjoy is.  </li>
            <li>Love it, I used it several times.</li>
            <li>**, better than the battery only .</li>
            <li>It does exactly what its suppose to do.</li>
            <li>Lost the first one I bought</li>
            <li>It has much more power than the earlier models.  </li>
            <li>It made them soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This product does what I expected it to in an effective way.</li>
            <li>I read reviews of many different models of this type of product.  </li>
            <li>So much so that this comment is for the one I ordered for my mother!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is exactly as described and was timely delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it will do...</li>
            <li>Do over a few days and still use a good moisturizer on your heels.</li>
            <li>The rechargeable stays powerful and I can keep the power strong by using the cord on it at the same time.</li>
            <li>For the first time since I was a child, my feet are decent!  </li>
            <li>No cutting at all, just a nice little pummace stone that gently smooths the feet.  </li>
            <li>This cordless version has plenty of power and holds a charge remarkably long after many uses.</li>
            <li>Also, I got two blue refills (which work great for getting rid of the rough part), but I noticed that I need to get the pink one (in order to achieve super smooth results).</li>
            <li>It has made my other wise rough feet feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>Be sure to place a towel under your feet to catch all the dry skin.</li>
            <li>It works, but it&#x27;s a slow process, and my feet are in pretty good shape.</li>
            <li>and it has been going strong without a second charge for 3 days.  </li>
            <li>I have used the same one for five times and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>The reviews on this unit indicated it was much more powerful and did not bog down as you pressed it into a callous.  </li>
            <li>I have a callous on my foot that hurts when I wear certain shoes.  </li>
            <li>Removes dead skin and callouses with ease and sure does leave your feet silky smooth (new to me).  </li>
            <li>Never do pedicures, very particular about my feet &amp; the foot rasp products really freak me out.</li>
            <li>Just so you know, this comes with 2 regular buffer rollers, which is fine for those who want to do routine maintenance.</li>
            <li>Just wish they had them in bright yellow and the file rollers were a little cheaper and more coarse.  </li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It holds a charge really well.  </li>
            <li>Since I had been raving about how much I like this tool, I brought it along with me</li>
            <li>Very efficient - not aggressive at all.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know a whole lot about foot grinding (my wife just loves that I call it that), but they are all raving about how well they work and</li>
            <li>I love her, but boy she has some rough feet.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>I really like the fact that it is rechargeable</li>
            <li>It works as advertised and really helps and saves me money</li>
            <li>If you are considering the non-rechargeable battery driven version, understand that it goes though batteries fast and that costs $.</li>
            <li>Bummed out about this, and now I wish I had spent more money and bought the rechargeable verison.</li>
            <li>I had to get my feet beach ready over night and got this tool.</li>
            <li>My heels get really calloused from all that &amp;#34;barefoot&amp;#34; training/running stuff.</li>
            <li>If you have borderline OCD like me, reign that madness in, otherwise you&#x27;re going to take off too much and your feet will be tender.</li>
            <li>The same rollers fit this version.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, much of the advantage disappears.</li>
            <li>Just a sander roll 2 gently sand away the callus.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that it is rechargeable.</li>
            <li>I have others but they use either too much of my strength, time, and ineffective.  </li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>Says &amp;#34;it&#x27;s amazing&amp;#34; and that it really works.</li>
            <li>it works very superficially.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s taken awhile, but her feet are much improved with each use.</li>
            <li>My feet really needed work.</li>
            <li>are to gentle.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>I really like the Foot Buffer, helps w/ callouses.  </li>
            <li>Confess it takes much longer to give yourself the quality manicure and pedicure</li>
            <li>probably much longer.</li>
            <li>I assume I just have too much callus</li>
            <li>And when I put too much pressure on it, it does not do the job.</li>
            <li>This product works and is much easier than manual buffing.</li>
            <li>I use it every day since I am one of those everyday sandals kind of person and the skin builds up fast on the heels.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product for my own personal use only.</li>
            <li>The first time I pretty much had to sweep and vacuum my bathroom floor right after.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, and the rechargeable battery lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>I read horror stories about returns and I wish that Amazon would contact that company and credit me with what I paid for this broken one, would gladly send it back, but want the rechargeable one in my hand first, to see if it is ok, not trusting this company right now, but the one thing I can say, it does work.</li>
            <li>I have used it numerous times since I bought it and still have not had to replace the original head.</li>
            <li>The tool works great but my qualm is with th erefill rollers they just dont last long enough for you to get that bang for the dollar feeling!</li>
            <li>, I would have purchased the more abrasive green roller to use first.  </li>
            <li>I would have liked to have been able to select different rollers to come with it as the blue are not coarse enough for my feet</li>
            <li>The cords on plug-in units were not long enough for my single-outlet bathroom, plus I wanted more convenience, so I opted for a rechargeable unit.</li>
            <li>my feet are so soft and pretty now..</li>
            <li>My heels are very dry and crack easily.</li>
            <li>The blue buffer has lasted 4 uses so far and seems to still work fine, which is</li>
            <li>but the roller is still easily stopped when applying what feels like minimal pressure.  </li>
            <li>This helps buff those rough areas easily and makes my feet smoother all over.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended over the strictly battery operated one.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>, refills are too high.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it, you will not regret getting it</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this item to anyone who wears sandals or flip flops</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Wow!  Purchase this product!  </li>
            <li>It does a smooth job on my rough feet.  </li>
            <li>I am really amazed how soft my feet are by using the Emjoi.  </li>
            <li>pads are holding up much better than we expected lasting very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I must need coarser rollers, because this takes way longer than I expected to smooth your feet.</li>
            <li>The manual says not to wash the refills, so I have been using the included brush after wetting it to clean my refill and then setting aside to air dry.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but this is good product that actually works.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how my feet would feel after a few days of walking around with no callouses to protect them.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the extra money to get the rechargeable as compared to battery one.</li>
            <li>The Microplanes are also a lot cheaper: The one I use, the Microplane Colossal Pedicure Rasp, is currently listed for $9.50 on amazon.</li>
            <li>This seriously works better than any salon I&#x27;ve ever been to!</li>
            <li>Micro-Pedi is second only to the other product at taking dead skin off--it does a good job at taking alot of dead skin off--and has the added benefit of being able to smooth off the skin surface better than the other product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to reach all areas with a portable unit whereas I suspect the corded model would be more difficult to maneuver.  </li>
            <li>and I always plug it right back in to the power line when I am finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it every other day and my feet are always smooth.</li>
            <li>I share other reviewers&#x27; concerns about the charging light never going off</li>
            <li>This way over time you get to the new skin without creating soreness in your feet.  </li>
            <li>There are readily available manual removers for dead skin that work better and cost much, much less.</li>
            <li>: I have super dry feet.</li>
            <li>I gifted this to my husband who has little time to take care of his feet and he loves this!  </li>
            <li>I charged it for the full 16 hours as per the directions and it runs fast and efficiently and has not slowed down during its use.  </li>
            <li>My feet are very soft</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t appear that the &#x27;dust&#x27; gets into any moving parts, so hopefully, it will be easy to maintain/will last a long time.</li>
            <li>I used it the first time with the blue roller that came with the unit.  </li>
            <li>My actual words, partway into my first buffing session, were &amp;#</li>
            <li>That part of my foot hadn&#x27;t felt that soft in decades!</li>
            <li>in fact i ordered a second one for my granddaughter a couple days after my first one arrived.  </li>
            <li>i order 2 extra buffer refills later and did receive them with the second order but never received the original 2 that should have shipped with my first order.  </li>
            <li>I bought the coarse rollers and used that first.</li>
            <li>I was using it about once a day for the first week and now I only uses it about once a week.</li>
            <li>Works quite well and feet so soft!</li>
            <li>I have tried many products (buffer stones for use in and out of bath, creams, various hand-held scrapers, even a different battery operated buffer)and none of them would do the trick.  </li>
            <li>My feet are baby soft!  </li>
            <li>but overall excited to use this far into the future.</li>
            <li>I live alone, so just had it plugged in near where I sit to watch TV.  </li>
            <li>So I did and was amazed at how easy it is to use and how much dead skin it removed.</li>
            <li>I took some hints from earlier reviews and do not push down to &amp;#34;do a better job&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I was completely amazed to see how soft this made my feet!  </li>
            <li>I wear flip flops all year long (live in Arizona where it&#x27;s hot all the time)</li>
            <li>, it has a loud, high-pitched drill sound (think dental office), and the rollers don&#x27;t last very long--</li>
            <li>ALSO PURCHASE THE LITTLE MICRO-PEDI MANICURE PIECES THAT FIT ON IT...</li>
            <li>I got the rechargeable and definitely recommend paying a little more for that model.  </li>
            <li>Just wish the replacement rollers would come in a larger pack size and were a little more cost efficient.</li>
            <li>This thing is pretty much as advertised, but it&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li>; version, as I don&#x27;t like the expense and hassle of frequent battery replacement/disposal.  </li>
            <li>I used this for 1 minute on each toe and the calluses are completely gone.</li>
            <li>Even after a professional pedicure, my feet still looked calloused and unsightly.  </li>
            <li>and they will be soft.  </li>
            <li>I had purchased another brand of this type of unit (nearly identical) that runs on batteries.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I found Amazon had it rechargeable.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to go and get pedicures as frequently as before.</li>
            <li>wow..</li>
            <li>No trouble with it stopping</li>
            <li>I have used it 4 times so far without needing to recharge.</li>
            <li>These uses were not just for a moment or two either, but for a considerable time.</li>
            <li>Thanks to my Micro Pedi his feet no longer pick by bedding and after the initial tickle he was alright with it.</li>
            <li>I contacted this seller who suggested I contact Emjoi directly.</li>
            <li>The job it does on calluses is complete and painless.</li>
            <li>Since I became an adult, my heels have been...</li>
            <li>I use it every night on my feet and it is gentle enough that my kids like to use it, too!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly how long a full charge lasts, because I&#x27;ve never run it all the way down buffing both feet (about 15 min).</li>
            <li>I could tell by all the dead skin dust falling to the floor that the Emjoi was making far better progress than my usual foot file, but it was when I touched the freshly buffed area that I exclaimed out loud.</li>
            <li>the buffer/roller on this Micro-Pedi is inset pretty deeply between the side pieces meaning that you can&#x27;t really buff anything that&#x27;s not convex  </li>
            <li>It really works for getting rid of dry dead skin and making your feet feel smooth.</li>
            <li>There was a big different after just the first use.</li>
            <li>The other one, Microplane Brown Colossal Pedicure Foot Rasp I found on Amazon, is manual, with great blades that take a lot of dead skin off in a hurry but leave your skin a little rough.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend... to recharge or not to recharge, definitely yes</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m pretty pleased with this buffer, but there are a few small things that I think Emjoi could improve on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not often you purchase something online without seeing it that you get exactly what was expected.  </li>
            <li>When charging there&#x27;s a little red light</li>
            <li>is limited, so manual pedi is difficult, and the Micro-Pedi is very effective without applying pressure.  </li>
            <li>I quickly ordered refills and even some extreme course for my husband&#x27;s feet because there&#x27;s no way this is going back to Amazon.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s extremely difficult for me to use the typical tools for dealing with my dry heels, so this is wonderful!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter how much lotion I use, they&#x27;re always dry and sometimes cracked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It basically works the same as the foot files you would use except for since it&#x27;s electric you don&#x27;t have to do that whole scrubbing back and forth.  </li>
            <li>After one use you can feel a major difference.  </li>
            <li>Finally - something that keeps my feet soft and presentable!</li>
            <li>(i.e. can&#x27;t really buff flat or concave surfaces on your feet, only things that stick up/out like heels and toes).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a problem for years with dry cracking heels - gross - &amp; only intermittent success with pumice stones etc.  </li>
            <li>This means that I can&#x27;t adequately buff the callus just below my 2nd toe on the ball of my foot, which is a slightly concave area.</li>
            <li>I stand and walk all day at work and my feet have it rough, but with this little appliance they are smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>But I wish the side pieces didn&#x27;t stick so far out beyond the roller limiting usefulness on concave parts of the foot, and I wish the roller wasn&#x27;t covered on the back limiting visibility.fer.</li>
            <li>But I wish the side pieces didn&#x27;t stick so far out beyond the roller limiting usefulness on concave parts of the foot, and I wish the roller wasn&#x27;t covered on the back limiting visibility.</li>
            <li>No regrets on this unplanned purchase</li>
            <li>The charge lasts for several days, even with frequent use.</li>
            <li>gave the second one to my 82 year old mother, who has &amp;#34;dragon feet&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in bare feet quite a bit because I teach yoga classes</li>
            <li>No more long waits at the podiatrist&#x27;s office; I can do this myself and so easily.  </li>
            <li>I also pull the skin tight and start at the edges of thick callouses towards the inside to kind of wear them away.  </li>
            <li>Replacement rollers are very affordable compaired to other brands.</li>
            <li>Much much easier than manually using those other devices.</li>
            <li>for a long time, the rolls seem to last for a good while and the replacements aren&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li>It runs for a very long time on a charge which is a big plus as it takes several minutes of use to get the effect one wants.</li>
            <li>I wear sandals as much of the year as I possibly can so my heels are always rough.</li>
            <li>The initial charge got me through my first session with no signs of slowing down.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I moved into our new home with wooden floors (which I have never had in my life), my heels dry out from the dehumidification needed to maintain the wood floors.  </li>
            <li>But rollers do wear down fast</li>
            <li>My thanks to the other reviewers and the Q&#x27;s &amp; A&#x27;s for helping me decide to &#x27;splurge&#x27; on this product!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a couple brief follow-up sessions to buff down the balls of my feet a bit further and remove some new dry skin from my heels, but it looks like less than 5 minutes a week will keep my feet looking and feeling fabulous all through the summer.</li>
            <li>The sanding tubes do not have a very long life, but I do use mine frequently.</li>
            <li>I use it approximately for 15 minutes each time, and it is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>Buy extra rollers from the get go, the extreme ones, because the effectiveness goes down quickly, after about 6 uses.</li>
            <li>Simple, powerful enough for some pretty tough heels!</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this based on other Emjoi products.</li>
            <li>Lightly run the Emjoi over a callused area to take a little dead skin off and then rub your fingers over the area.</li>

            <li> Works surprisingly well.  </li>

            <li> This was another  example of good customer service as they stood by their add.</li>
            <li> Although this buffer works good, I would suggest it be used on maintained callouses.</li>

            <li> Love this foot buffer!  </li>

            <li> I am in love!  </li>
            <li> This is better than ANY pedicure I have ever gotten!  </li>
            <li> I could not recommend it more!  </li>
            <li> I love this foot buffer!.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> This works great and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> and it is so easy to use and very effective.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li> it is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for quality nail care products so that I can do my own mani/pedis when I prefer to.  </li>
            <li> I decided to buy my own and found this rechargeable model and bought it.  </li>
            <li> Nice design and power.  </li>
            <li> that kind of bugs me but is not the end of the world.  </li>
            <li> Love the Micro-Pedi and it has a good amount of power.  </li>
            <li> So nice to use and  </li>
            <li> I used the Emjoy and liked it</li>
            <li> Also, the charger is not as effective in a surge protector strip.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Needless to say, my mom was thrilled.</li>
            <li> I agree you have to make sure you have good brand batteries when using this item.</li>
            <li> They, too, give this 5 stars and have NEVER gotten this kind of result from a nail salon.  </li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it!!  </li>
            <li> We each have our own rollers and swap them out when using (very easy to do).</li>
            <li> Easy to use and being able to charge rather than continue to take batteries is a great option.</li>
            <li> It works remarkably well leaving your feet smooth..</li>
            <li> like it , work good not as strong of a motor as i think it should be</li>
            <li> I found the Emjoi very easy to use.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m loving it even more.</li>
            <li> This easy rechargeable buffer is the absolute best buy I&#x27;ve made in a longtime.i recommend this product to all who suffer from callouses on their feet.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and does the job!</li>
            <li> and IT SO EASY TO USE!  </li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product!  </li>
            <li> Love love love this thing!</li>
            <li> But it was GREAT, as I could see that it was being effective, even though it felt gentle.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is worth the money and beats going to the salon to pay money for someone to do your feet, then have to go home and redo your own heels because the salon did not do a good job</li>
            <li> Love this-  easy to use, does a great job in keeping skin smooth.  </li>
            <li> We both find it very easy to use and able to reach all over our feet.</li>
            <li> It gives beautiful results very quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery is very important, and you would not want to compromise its performance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> feet were very smooth.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> maybe the plug in model has more torque.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think.  </li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Well pleased with the ..</li>
            <li> I love the Emjoi pedi foot buffer.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> I have friends who have the Amope, which allows you to see your foot better, but has insufficient power and isn&#x27;t rechargeable.</li>
            <li> so I knew I wanted more power.</li>
            <li> When I started buffing the callouses on the ball of my left foot, the results were immediately impressive.</li>
            <li> my heels are almost soft--few more days</li>
            <li> Love the rechargeable feature, too--</li>
            <li> The results were markedly better than using a manual file.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a couple times and love it.</li>
            <li> so make sure you get what you were promised...</li>
            <li> but i do love the product and will order more for friends for christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be glad you did......</li>
            <li> I must really love this tool.  </li>
            <li> What more can I say?</li>
            <li> I love this buffer.  </li>
            <li> I tried to return it a month and 5 days after the date of purchace and received notice from Amazon that the seller follows the Amazon policy of not accepting returns more than 30 days after purchase.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I chose the rechargeable version.  </li>
            <li> I now have smooth feet!</li>
            <li> Better yet...</li>
            <li> Made me feet feel better than a $75 pedicure ever did.</li>
            <li> and it makes your feet feel really nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> PedEgg works better, but this is easier to maneuver.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it&lt;</li>
            <li> The more feminine versions start at $8.95.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do make sure you have dampened your feet before using the Microplane.</li>
            <li> It sure works unlike anything else I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> There are many complaints of dust everywhere.</li>
            <li> so hopefully it will be a great product thanks</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law gave me my Micro Pedi for Christmas and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Recharge lasts through many times.  </li>
            <li> You will love it,</li>
            <li> This just keeps getting better and better.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Tried many manual pumice stones, but this is much better and requires no effort.</li>
            <li> ALL I HAVE TO DO IS A QUICKY EACH WEEK :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad my girlfriend brought hers when she came to visit.</li>
            <li> Recharging takes many hours and you don&#x27;t know when it is fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love , love ,love</li>
            <li> So much better then</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this item.  </li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Better to exfoliate weekly, then attempting to remove thicker callouses all at once.</li>
            <li> They  haven&#x27;t been this smooth since I can&#x27;t remember when!  </li>
            <li> This works better than anything I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> the battery powered Foot Buffer completely satisfied</li>
            <li> does a better job than my pedicurist.  </li>
            <li> stays charges for many many uses.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many of the store bought foot scrapers and nothing compares to this.</li>
            <li> I thought of the use of this product it gets better.</li>
            <li> I love this buffer, I tested the Amope also.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I can not say how much I love this device.  </li>
            <li> It is absolutely fabulous!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping it because it&#x27;s not horrible.</li>
            <li> I just wish it had more strength.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like magic.</li>
            <li> This will be great for the summer because I have a concrete deck around my pool and calluses end up drying out and cracking!  </li>
            <li> Best at home pedicure, makes your feet very soft with little workâ€¦.the attachments are great too!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is one of the best expenditures I have made in a long time.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not afraid to TAKE ON my feet!!)</li>
            <li> The new one works great.  </li>
            <li> Works great; better than paying for pedicures to get soft feet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have it as it helps avoid the huge callus cracks that happen if I don&#x27;t keep on top of the callus status.</li>
            <li> Easy to use cost was ok for what the product is to be used for.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does an excellent job removing the dry skin and calluses.  </li>
            <li> Excellent buffer but can&#x27;t tell when fully charged as the charging light is red and doesn&#x27;t change colors or turn off when fully charged</li>
            <li> Moving the Micro-Pedi in a downward motion is how you will get the greatest buffing action and greatest results in the least amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am finally able to get the callouses on my toes under control and the snaggy bits on my heels gone in one sitting.</li>
            <li> Best investment in a very, very long time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m squeezing 3-4 uses out of each, but they&#x27;re most effective with the first two uses.  </li>
            <li> they started becoming unsightly again after a day or two, despite applying lotion and wearing socks overnight.</li>
            <li> A great tool which has fixed a long-term problem.</li>
            <li> One thing I wish the manufacturer would improve on is the option of different widths of the head for smaller areas, but otherwise a great find, and great buy!</li>
            <li> and they all felt cheap and most needed batteries.  </li>
            <li> and it does what it claims to do have two smooth healthy</li>
            <li> I was delighted to see and feel such great results after just the first use.  </li>
            <li> Much more user friendly that a file.  </li>
            <li> So cool and painless now!</li>
            <li> The unit is compact - easy to store.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Does what it claims and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It is easy and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li> Changing the rollers is really easy.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this Emjoi that is rechargeable.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product; a good deal for the price.  </li>
            <li> Love not having to go bi-monthly and pay $55 for a full pedicure.  </li>
            <li> The Micro-Pedi buffer works just fine for me.  </li>
            <li> Received the product, charged it up per directions, it worked fine.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, and easy to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> This buffer is easy to use, easy to clean, and works as promised.</li>
            <li> Easy to refill and quick clean up!</li>
            <li> Best thing ever coming down the pike for feet!  </li>
            <li> It keeps me callous free.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t something to use one time and then expect your feet to be smooth forever.  </li>
            <li> This is a definite great purchase, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> The product does smooth some of the roughness on my feet; however, it takes a while to smooth the skin</li>
            <li> buff those calluses away, leaves foot smooth</li>
            <li> My feet are so smooth  </li>
            <li> but overall I&#x27;m happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> My lady friend used her mini Pedi Egg on my feet last year and they felt great.  </li>
            <li> I use it with a light touch and it just goes to work.</li>
            <li> After I was done, I used a manual buffer to smooth and then put on a pair of Bliss socks.</li>
            <li> My feet are so smooth they slide in my shoes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and change the head.  </li>
            <li> The charge light never goes off</li>
            <li> Made my feet really smooth.</li>
            <li> My feet have never been so smooth.</li>
            <li> It has held its charge and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The charge light continued blinking even after charging for 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> MY FEET ARE SOOOOO SMOOTH - I&#x27;VE</li>
            <li> This is easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it (lightly) for 3 nights now, with the discs recommended for guys</li>
            <li> buff the bottom of your feet smooth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for in-between touch ups, but it definitely can&#x27;t replace good old fashioned elbow grease.</li>
            <li> If you have calluses that are a few millimeters in thickness that just need to be made smooth, the Emjoi may be the perfect solution for you.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> Not as effective as I had hoped, but it does a decent job maintaining smoothness for a while after I&#x27;ve had a pedicure.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleans up quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Be sure to follow the instructions and charge it for 16 hours before using it the first time.  </li>
            <li> Arrived on time and was in original sealed box.</li>
            <li> and the indicator light never told me it was done, but it was still pretty effective after a first charge of the recommended time.</li>
            <li> works great on cleaning the roller better than that dinky little brush they put in the box.</li>
            <li> you want the world to see, but the money you can save by spending your own time is wildly gratifying... to me!</li>
            <li> Very light pressure on DRY feet was all that&#x27;s needed to get my feet in better shape than they have been since I was a baby 68 years ago!  </li>
            <li> Just got my Rechargeable Emjoi Micro-Pedi Pro Foot Buffer (Special Edition)&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> The Amope is better for men or people with large feet.  </li>
            <li> The cone accessories that can be ordered separately, are a wonderful compliment  for hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li> Works great on my rough heals.</li>
            <li> pretty good considering how much has buffed off my feet during these first uses.</li>
            <li> and she liked the way he feet felt soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this item except how fast you go through the rollers.  </li>
            <li> it together, the batteries will only allow for one good treatment.</li>
            <li> It is always at full power for each use.  </li>
            <li> If you search amazon for &amp;#34;microplane&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;foot,&amp;#34; you&#x27;ll find the full line.</li>
            <li> The roller is good for multiple uses.</li>
            <li> Good product, would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm to do around all fingernails and both feet all over without any hurry on one full charge.</li>
            <li> you have to use cautiously,  especially at first til you become accustomed to how much skin it removes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for dealing with rough heels in between pedicures!  </li>
            <li> It would be nice if the red light ever went off to let you know when it was charged, but this hasn&#x27;t been an issue since it&#x27;s always charged when I need it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure the first one had a defective battery from the get-go.  </li>
            <li> During use, the motor can be heard to quickly lose intensity.  </li>
            <li> If it only had a built-in vacuum cleaner it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> I end up roughing my feet first with a foot rasp, then using this product to smooth out my skin.</li>
            <li> It works so much quicker and your feet are left feeling nice and smooth!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing how soft and not frightening the heels of my feet are anymore.  </li>
            <li> The emjoi buffer is fast easy and safe&lt;</li>
            <li> This is an easy product to use and smooths the heel very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this easy to use foot buffer.  </li>
            <li> very convenient, easy to use, and always there when you need it because it is rechargable.</li>
            <li> Does a good job on dry feet.  </li>
            <li> For me, using it the first time, there was a lot!  </li>
            <li> The vender was very helpful in replacing the unit for the one I have now (which works just fine..)</li>
            <li> THIS IS A FABULOUS PRODUCT - IT CAME ALREADY CHARGED AND READY TO GO -</li>
            <li> The primary reason why I&#x27;m giving 4 instead of 5 stars is because of two things: 1) the rotating head isn&#x27;t viewable 360 degrees  (i.e. covered on one side), so it really limits the ability to see what you&#x27;re buffing.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have smooth heels and feet, and also to those who have tender skin because it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely amazing how simple the technology is and how thoroughly it works.</li>
            <li> worth it to purchase.</li>
            <li> The power is good, although I could see that a man with really thick calluses might need more power.</li>
            <li> I chose the Emjoi because it looked sturdier and more comfortable to hold than similar units I saw online.</li>
            <li> This was worth the price.  </li>
            <li> worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> To my pleasant surprise, they actually felt better, even after standing or walking for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> Gentle but VERY powerful.</li>
            <li> I bought myself one and liked it so much that I ordered two more for other people.  </li>
            <li> have tried many other techniques, but none of them equal the great results you get with Micro-Pedi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cindy</li>
            <li> In just one quick easy session my feet or soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> By the time I finished my right foot</li>
            <li> I had a shoulder replacement and the strength in my right arm</li>
            <li> This smooths then right out.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone wanting smooth heels.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and feet are so soft!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the dust factor is considerably less once your feet are in better shape.  </li>
            <li> It works beautifully and the recharging capabilities mean that she can use it anywhere in the house, but not have to fuss with AA or AAA batteries.</li>
            <li> This powered foot sanding buffer works very well and quickly.</li>
            <li> The rollers are easy to replace but so far they have held up well and not needed replacement.</li>
            <li> Since I liked the ped-egg, I hadn&#x27;t  really opened this until recently.  </li>
            <li> Leaves feet very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It left my feet very smooth after just the first use.  </li>
            <li> Works nice and quick, especially when you order the super coarse rollers for this thing.</li>
            <li> Works really well!</li>
            <li> First time user and</li>
            <li> way it leaves their feet; smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I was able to use this buffer for both feet after only charging for 30 minutes, then plugged it in for the recommended time.</li>
            <li> So overall, I would recommend this product based on the batteries saved by recharging, the power, the comfort in your hand, and it&#x27;s effectiveness on most parts of my feet.</li>
            <li> So overall, I would recommend this product based on the batteries saved by recharging, the power, the comfort in your hand, and it&#x27;s effectiveness on most parts of my feet.</li>
            <li> I researched motorized buffers pretty thoroughly before trying the Emjoi.</li>
            <li> but I followed the directions and let it charge overnight before my first use.</li>
            <li> I was mindful during my first session that I didn&#x27;t want to overdo it.</li>
            <li> It was also nice not having my socks get stuck to my rough heels.</li>
            <li> and she told me that she is satisfied, later my mother used it on my stepfather</li>
            <li> It has an easy to change sanding roller, and the replacement&lt;br /&gt;sanding rollers are available in Fine to Extra Coarse Grit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The directions are silent about leaving the product on the charger--I read the instructions carefuilly, and most products allow leaving them on the charger.  </li>
            <li> I use it ever day to keep my feet smooth and soft all the time.</li>
            <li> I was worried that this thing might be under-powered but it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> It makes my feet soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> It performs exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> My first buffer did not work, wouldn&#x27;t even charge.</li>
            <li> Still on the first head.</li>
            <li> It really works!  </li>
            <li> So far everyone with the battery Enjoy is.  </li>
            <li> Love it, I used it several times.</li>
            <li> **, better than the battery only .</li>
            <li> It does exactly what its suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Lost the first one I bought</li>
            <li> It has much more power than the earlier models.  </li>
            <li> It made them soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This product does what I expected it to in an effective way.</li>
            <li> I read reviews of many different models of this type of product.  </li>
            <li> So much so that this comment is for the one I ordered for my mother!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is exactly as described and was timely delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it will do...</li>
            <li> Do over a few days and still use a good moisturizer on your heels.</li>
            <li> The rechargeable stays powerful and I can keep the power strong by using the cord on it at the same time.</li>
            <li> For the first time since I was a child, my feet are decent!  </li>
            <li> No cutting at all, just a nice little pummace stone that gently smooths the feet.  </li>
            <li> This cordless version has plenty of power and holds a charge remarkably long after many uses.</li>
            <li> Also, I got two blue refills (which work great for getting rid of the rough part), but I noticed that I need to get the pink one (in order to achieve super smooth results).</li>
            <li> It has made my other wise rough feet feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> Be sure to place a towel under your feet to catch all the dry skin.</li>
            <li> It works, but it&#x27;s a slow process, and my feet are in pretty good shape.</li>
            <li> and it has been going strong without a second charge for 3 days.  </li>
            <li> I have used the same one for five times and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> The reviews on this unit indicated it was much more powerful and did not bog down as you pressed it into a callous.  </li>
            <li> I have a callous on my foot that hurts when I wear certain shoes.  </li>
            <li> Removes dead skin and callouses with ease and sure does leave your feet silky smooth (new to me).  </li>
            <li> Never do pedicures, very particular about my feet &amp; the foot rasp products really freak me out.</li>
            <li> Just so you know, this comes with 2 regular buffer rollers, which is fine for those who want to do routine maintenance.</li>
            <li> Just wish they had them in bright yellow and the file rollers were a little cheaper and more coarse.  </li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It holds a charge really well.  </li>
            <li> Since I had been raving about how much I like this tool, I brought it along with me</li>
            <li> Very efficient - not aggressive at all.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know a whole lot about foot grinding (my wife just loves that I call it that), but they are all raving about how well they work and</li>
            <li> I love her, but boy she has some rough feet.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li> I really like the fact that it is rechargeable</li>
            <li> It works as advertised and really helps and saves me money</li>
            <li> If you are considering the non-rechargeable battery driven version, understand that it goes though batteries fast and that costs $.</li>
            <li> Bummed out about this, and now I wish I had spent more money and bought the rechargeable verison.</li>
            <li> I had to get my feet beach ready over night and got this tool.</li>
            <li> My heels get really calloused from all that &amp;#34;barefoot&amp;#34; training/running stuff.</li>
            <li> If you have borderline OCD like me, reign that madness in, otherwise you&#x27;re going to take off too much and your feet will be tender.</li>
            <li> The same rollers fit this version.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, much of the advantage disappears.</li>
            <li> Just a sander roll 2 gently sand away the callus.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that it is rechargeable.</li>
            <li> I have others but they use either too much of my strength, time, and ineffective.  </li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> Says &amp;#34;it&#x27;s amazing&amp;#34; and that it really works.</li>
            <li> it works very superficially.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taken awhile, but her feet are much improved with each use.</li>
            <li> My feet really needed work.</li>
            <li> are to gentle.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I really like the Foot Buffer, helps w/ callouses.  </li>
            <li> Confess it takes much longer to give yourself the quality manicure and pedicure</li>
            <li> probably much longer.</li>
            <li> I assume I just have too much callus</li>
            <li> And when I put too much pressure on it, it does not do the job.</li>
            <li> This product works and is much easier than manual buffing.</li>
            <li> I use it every day since I am one of those everyday sandals kind of person and the skin builds up fast on the heels.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product for my own personal use only.</li>
            <li> The first time I pretty much had to sweep and vacuum my bathroom floor right after.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, and the rechargeable battery lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I read horror stories about returns and I wish that Amazon would contact that company and credit me with what I paid for this broken one, would gladly send it back, but want the rechargeable one in my hand first, to see if it is ok, not trusting this company right now, but the one thing I can say, it does work.</li>
            <li> I have used it numerous times since I bought it and still have not had to replace the original head.</li>
            <li> The tool works great but my qualm is with th erefill rollers they just dont last long enough for you to get that bang for the dollar feeling!</li>
            <li> , I would have purchased the more abrasive green roller to use first.  </li>
            <li> I would have liked to have been able to select different rollers to come with it as the blue are not coarse enough for my feet</li>
            <li> The cords on plug-in units were not long enough for my single-outlet bathroom, plus I wanted more convenience, so I opted for a rechargeable unit.</li>
            <li> my feet are so soft and pretty now..</li>
            <li> My heels are very dry and crack easily.</li>
            <li> The blue buffer has lasted 4 uses so far and seems to still work fine, which is</li>
            <li> but the roller is still easily stopped when applying what feels like minimal pressure.  </li>
            <li> This helps buff those rough areas easily and makes my feet smoother all over.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended over the strictly battery operated one.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> , refills are too high.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it, you will not regret getting it</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this item to anyone who wears sandals or flip flops</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Wow!  Purchase this product!  </li>
            <li> It does a smooth job on my rough feet.  </li>
            <li> I am really amazed how soft my feet are by using the Emjoi.  </li>
            <li> pads are holding up much better than we expected lasting very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I must need coarser rollers, because this takes way longer than I expected to smooth your feet.</li>
            <li> The manual says not to wash the refills, so I have been using the included brush after wetting it to clean my refill and then setting aside to air dry.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but this is good product that actually works.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how my feet would feel after a few days of walking around with no callouses to protect them.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the extra money to get the rechargeable as compared to battery one.</li>
            <li> The Microplanes are also a lot cheaper: The one I use, the Microplane Colossal Pedicure Rasp, is currently listed for $9.50 on amazon.</li>
            <li> This seriously works better than any salon I&#x27;ve ever been to!</li>
            <li> Micro-Pedi is second only to the other product at taking dead skin off--it does a good job at taking alot of dead skin off--and has the added benefit of being able to smooth off the skin surface better than the other product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to reach all areas with a portable unit whereas I suspect the corded model would be more difficult to maneuver.  </li>
            <li> and I always plug it right back in to the power line when I am finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it every other day and my feet are always smooth.</li>
            <li> I share other reviewers&#x27; concerns about the charging light never going off</li>
            <li> This way over time you get to the new skin without creating soreness in your feet.  </li>
            <li> There are readily available manual removers for dead skin that work better and cost much, much less.</li>
            <li> : I have super dry feet.</li>
            <li> I gifted this to my husband who has little time to take care of his feet and he loves this!  </li>
            <li> I charged it for the full 16 hours as per the directions and it runs fast and efficiently and has not slowed down during its use.  </li>
            <li> My feet are very soft</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t appear that the &#x27;dust&#x27; gets into any moving parts, so hopefully, it will be easy to maintain/will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I used it the first time with the blue roller that came with the unit.  </li>
            <li> My actual words, partway into my first buffing session, were &amp;#</li>
            <li> That part of my foot hadn&#x27;t felt that soft in decades!</li>
            <li> in fact i ordered a second one for my granddaughter a couple days after my first one arrived.  </li>
            <li> i order 2 extra buffer refills later and did receive them with the second order but never received the original 2 that should have shipped with my first order.  </li>
            <li> I bought the coarse rollers and used that first.</li>
            <li> I was using it about once a day for the first week and now I only uses it about once a week.</li>
            <li> Works quite well and feet so soft!</li>
            <li> I have tried many products (buffer stones for use in and out of bath, creams, various hand-held scrapers, even a different battery operated buffer)and none of them would do the trick.  </li>
            <li> My feet are baby soft!  </li>
            <li> but overall excited to use this far into the future.</li>
            <li> I live alone, so just had it plugged in near where I sit to watch TV.  </li>
            <li> So I did and was amazed at how easy it is to use and how much dead skin it removed.</li>
            <li> I took some hints from earlier reviews and do not push down to &amp;#34;do a better job&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I was completely amazed to see how soft this made my feet!  </li>
            <li> I wear flip flops all year long (live in Arizona where it&#x27;s hot all the time)</li>
            <li> , it has a loud, high-pitched drill sound (think dental office), and the rollers don&#x27;t last very long--</li>
            <li> ALSO PURCHASE THE LITTLE MICRO-PEDI MANICURE PIECES THAT FIT ON IT...</li>
            <li> I got the rechargeable and definitely recommend paying a little more for that model.  </li>
            <li> Just wish the replacement rollers would come in a larger pack size and were a little more cost efficient.</li>
            <li> This thing is pretty much as advertised, but it&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> ; version, as I don&#x27;t like the expense and hassle of frequent battery replacement/disposal.  </li>
            <li> I used this for 1 minute on each toe and the calluses are completely gone.</li>
            <li> Even after a professional pedicure, my feet still looked calloused and unsightly.  </li>
            <li> and they will be soft.  </li>
            <li> I had purchased another brand of this type of unit (nearly identical) that runs on batteries.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I found Amazon had it rechargeable.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to go and get pedicures as frequently as before.</li>
            <li> wow..</li>
            <li> No trouble with it stopping</li>
            <li> I have used it 4 times so far without needing to recharge.</li>
            <li> These uses were not just for a moment or two either, but for a considerable time.</li>
            <li> Thanks to my Micro Pedi his feet no longer pick by bedding and after the initial tickle he was alright with it.</li>
            <li> I contacted this seller who suggested I contact Emjoi directly.</li>
            <li> The job it does on calluses is complete and painless.</li>
            <li> Since I became an adult, my heels have been...</li>
            <li> I use it every night on my feet and it is gentle enough that my kids like to use it, too!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly how long a full charge lasts, because I&#x27;ve never run it all the way down buffing both feet (about 15 min).</li>
            <li> I could tell by all the dead skin dust falling to the floor that the Emjoi was making far better progress than my usual foot file, but it was when I touched the freshly buffed area that I exclaimed out loud.</li>
            <li> the buffer/roller on this Micro-Pedi is inset pretty deeply between the side pieces meaning that you can&#x27;t really buff anything that&#x27;s not convex  </li>
            <li> It really works for getting rid of dry dead skin and making your feet feel smooth.</li>
            <li> There was a big different after just the first use.</li>
            <li> The other one, Microplane Brown Colossal Pedicure Foot Rasp I found on Amazon, is manual, with great blades that take a lot of dead skin off in a hurry but leave your skin a little rough.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend... to recharge or not to recharge, definitely yes</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m pretty pleased with this buffer, but there are a few small things that I think Emjoi could improve on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not often you purchase something online without seeing it that you get exactly what was expected.  </li>
            <li> When charging there&#x27;s a little red light</li>
            <li> is limited, so manual pedi is difficult, and the Micro-Pedi is very effective without applying pressure.  </li>
            <li> I quickly ordered refills and even some extreme course for my husband&#x27;s feet because there&#x27;s no way this is going back to Amazon.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s extremely difficult for me to use the typical tools for dealing with my dry heels, so this is wonderful!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how much lotion I use, they&#x27;re always dry and sometimes cracked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It basically works the same as the foot files you would use except for since it&#x27;s electric you don&#x27;t have to do that whole scrubbing back and forth.  </li>
            <li> After one use you can feel a major difference.  </li>
            <li> Finally - something that keeps my feet soft and presentable!</li>
            <li> (i.e. can&#x27;t really buff flat or concave surfaces on your feet, only things that stick up/out like heels and toes).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a problem for years with dry cracking heels - gross - &amp; only intermittent success with pumice stones etc.  </li>
            <li> This means that I can&#x27;t adequately buff the callus just below my 2nd toe on the ball of my foot, which is a slightly concave area.</li>
            <li> I stand and walk all day at work and my feet have it rough, but with this little appliance they are smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> But I wish the side pieces didn&#x27;t stick so far out beyond the roller limiting usefulness on concave parts of the foot, and I wish the roller wasn&#x27;t covered on the back limiting visibility.fer.</li>
            <li> But I wish the side pieces didn&#x27;t stick so far out beyond the roller limiting usefulness on concave parts of the foot, and I wish the roller wasn&#x27;t covered on the back limiting visibility.</li>
            <li> No regrets on this unplanned purchase</li>
            <li> The charge lasts for several days, even with frequent use.</li>
            <li> gave the second one to my 82 year old mother, who has &amp;#34;dragon feet&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in bare feet quite a bit because I teach yoga classes</li>
            <li> No more long waits at the podiatrist&#x27;s office; I can do this myself and so easily.  </li>
            <li> I also pull the skin tight and start at the edges of thick callouses towards the inside to kind of wear them away.  </li>
            <li> Replacement rollers are very affordable compaired to other brands.</li>
            <li> Much much easier than manually using those other devices.</li>
            <li> for a long time, the rolls seem to last for a good while and the replacements aren&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> It runs for a very long time on a charge which is a big plus as it takes several minutes of use to get the effect one wants.</li>
            <li> I wear sandals as much of the year as I possibly can so my heels are always rough.</li>
            <li> The initial charge got me through my first session with no signs of slowing down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I moved into our new home with wooden floors (which I have never had in my life), my heels dry out from the dehumidification needed to maintain the wood floors.  </li>
            <li> But rollers do wear down fast</li>
            <li> My thanks to the other reviewers and the Q&#x27;s &amp; A&#x27;s for helping me decide to &#x27;splurge&#x27; on this product!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple brief follow-up sessions to buff down the balls of my feet a bit further and remove some new dry skin from my heels, but it looks like less than 5 minutes a week will keep my feet looking and feeling fabulous all through the summer.</li>
            <li> The sanding tubes do not have a very long life, but I do use mine frequently.</li>
            <li> I use it approximately for 15 minutes each time, and it is still going strong.  </li>
            <li> Buy extra rollers from the get go, the extreme ones, because the effectiveness goes down quickly, after about 6 uses.</li>
            <li> Simple, powerful enough for some pretty tough heels!</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this based on other Emjoi products.</li>
            <li> Lightly run the Emjoi over a callused area to take a little dead skin off and then rub your fingers over the area.</li>
            <li> It will no longer accept a full charge, too weak to work correctly.</li>
            <li> It was more expensive, but you get what you pay for and I expect in the long run will pay for itself by not having to buy batteries or get pedicures!</li>
            <li> It is gentle but removes the heavy dry cracked skin..</li>
            <li> He is very sensitive when you try to mess with his feet</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t know for how long, because it has never run out of power when I&#x27;ve used it</li>
            <li> The Microplanes, which work by slicing away a tiny layer at a time, work on skin damp from bath or shower, and that skin is much easier to remove than hard, dry skin.</li>
            <li> Read all directions and was a bit hesitant at first as my heels are seriously thickened and hardened.</li>
            <li> If I turned it off and left it for several minutes and then turn it on, it would still only work for less than 15 seconds.  </li>
            <li> If held properly, with the handle downward, and a trash can under your fee, the movement of air from the rotation of the buffer will push the dust out vents on the back of the micro-pedi into the trash can or other receptacle.</li>
            <li> I am so surprised at how well this little buffer does the job.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t try to do neglected feet all at once and use only on dry dry, not even moist feet.  </li>
            <li> It took me quite a long time - about 45 minutes, to make substantial progress on both of my heals, before the battery started losing power.  </li>
            <li> the ped-egg has a catch all compartment that the powder goes into that you empty later.  </li>
            <li> She has been self-conscious about her feet as long as I have known her.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time,too.</li>
            <li> I plan to use it all year long before a pedicure and in between.</li>
            <li> I spent the extra money to buy the rechargeable unit (compared to the battery operated unit).  </li>
            <li> I am amazed at the long battery life.</li>
            <li> If this thing can grind away my &#x27;long line of hearty farmer kin&#x27; harden heel skin...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on how long the battery lasts because I&#x27;ve now used it a couple of times</li>
            <li> What took me so long to find this type of gadget!</li>
            <li> My feet are the softest they have ever been just don&#x27;t leave it on one spot for too long!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with dry cracked heels for a very long time before I discovered this item.</li>
            <li> general Emoji works, and the roller rotates, but the power is so low, that it is just not able to remove the dry skin from feet.</li>
            <li> cause he has dry feet</li>
            <li> Emjoi works by literally sanding the skin, something that requires the skin be dry at the time, and therein lies the problem.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I am just about to order one of these along with the Precision kit and a few extra sander inserts as a Christmas present for my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if your heels are super-dry, it might take a while to get them to baby-softness, but after the initial use, all you have to do to maintain is to use the device every several days, and just a few passes over each heel should do it.  </li>
            <li> My feet have been very dry for a long time now.  </li>
            <li> You will not have a single regret.</li>
            <li> It works very well, helps remove some very rough spots, especially in those hard to reach places!  </li>
            <li> (Don&#x27;t dampen your feet before using the Emjoi: it has no way to clear any dampened removed skin, so it just fills the nooks and crannies in the sandpaper until the cylinder is perfectly slick.)</li>
            <li> I just found it shocking when, after spending a whole bunch of money on the Emjoi, I discovered an alternate technology that was so much better.</li>
            <li> but he actually let me get him down and work on his feet.</li>
            <li> However, the regular rollers take forever to grind down my calluses.</li>
            <li> Dry skin everywhere!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel the skin on my feet rough and dry anymore.  </li>
            <li> The second time I tried using this Emjoi, Micro-Pedi, it ran for less than 15 seconds and then stopped.  </li>
            <li> ladies if you have problems with rough or dry feet</li>
            <li> There is less dust from this than the traditional foot file I have used for years.</li>
            <li> I tried using pumice stones to remove it, but they never really worked.  </li>
            <li> My mom purchased this unit a few weeks back as she has SEVERE callused feet from psoriasis.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t waste a lot of money buying extra</li>
            <li> I cannot speak to it&#x27;s longevity since I have only had it a few days.</li>
            <li> Opened the package, took battery cover off, and it all fell out, it had broken housing, but because I wanted to see if it really worked, well it did, but as I said I had to duct tape</li>
            <li> you really do not need to.  </li>
            <li> one of the few gadget that actually work.necessity for sandal season.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s feet are so rough he picks my bed cover.</li>
            <li> so my feet get rough at the heels.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has some rough spots on their feet.</li>
            <li> I have a thick layer of dryness around my heels and the inner part of my big toes.  </li>
            <li> Other reviews are correct you do not need to press hard against your feet; just let the roller do the work &amp; a soft toothbrush</li>
            <li> The rollers get hot on thick, hard callouses when constant firm pressure is applied..</li>
            <li> negative is the refill rollers don&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this just doesn&#x27;t have the juice needed to really get the dry skin off.</li>
            <li> Every remedy for rough feet out there, she&#x27;s tried them all!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> And I would do like that other person did and buy and cut sandpaper and place on roller</li>
            <li> I had the battery operated version and other reviews are correct, after 1-2 uses, you lose power.  </li>
            <li> the price is in line of other brands</li>
            <li> I was hopeful, but skeptical, that it would work as described &amp; it really does!  </li>
            <li> On the other hand</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying the other rolls as the ones that come with it</li>
            <li> He uses it for his finger tips too, if they crack at the nail beds due in the Winter months.</li>
            <li> After years of struggling with Pumice, other devices, nail files, those sticks (like shoe horns) with sandpaper on one side and a zester on the other; this is the CURE.  </li>
            <li> The ped-egg also kinda cuts your feet all up so a few days later you can feel the hundreds of little straggly skin snag on your sheets at night or on your socks.  </li>
            <li> I have thick callouses on the ball of my feet, and within a few minutes it was nearly gone.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the rollers are pretty pricey--I&#x27;m hoping some vendor will come up with knock-off replacements at half the cost.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my mom because it&#x27;s hard for her to use traditional foot buffing methods (i.e. pumice stone) due to a disability.</li>
            <li> And when to push it a little bit harder- it</li>
            <li> Now when he feels his feet getting a little rough he comes to me for a smoothing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s particularly hard to use with your non-dominant hand on your opposite foot, because you can&#x27;t see what&#x27;s being buffed unless you&#x27;re looking at the skin from the side.</li>
            <li> Press as hard as I might at different angles</li>
            <li> It would occasionally work for a few seconds but never more than 15 seconds before it would stop.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my feet feel after a pedicure, but hate that feeling of them working on your feet.  </li>
            <li> I have well-calloused guy&#x27;s feet and sometimes they need a bit of sanding down</li>
            <li> If you hold it upside down...</li>
            <li> This cordless model does seem wimpy in that it bogs down in rotation speed with pressure.  </li>
            <li> and hopefully it&#x27;ll come down in price.</li>
            <li> Other reviews mentioned the need to change the refill after one use!</li>
            <li> Like this will happen that they will send me a rechargeable one for half price, and credit for this duct taped monster\\&quot;\\&quot;\\&quot;\\&quot;</li>
            <li> As I said in my review of the previous machine...</li>
            <li> However, for anyone with tough calluses I would recommend adding on the extreme coarse rollers.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s a minor complaint given how well this thing works.  </li>
            <li> I soaked my feet first, don&#x27;t try to use this on dirty feet.</li>
            <li> so no batteries to mess with.</li>
            <li> it does make quite a mess.  </li>
            <li> I do it in the grassy part of my backyard and there&#x27;s no clean up.  </li>
            <li> I wish the motor was a little stronger</li>
            <li> I like this little buffer a lot.</li>
            <li> ..use cautiously if you have little sensation on your feet..</li>
            <li> The micro pedi is a geat little product.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend anyone who gets one of these little babies to go with the rechargeable over the battery-operated.</li>
            <li> However, if you have serious calluses that actually need removal, rather than just minor shaping, you will find the Emjoi to be very, very slow, about 10 times slower than the product I eventually replaced it with, the Microplane foot</li>
            <li> Rough heels and balls of feet are baby smooth now, even during our frigid winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> That was my only disappointment &amp; it was service not product related.</li>
            <li> product is ineffective, so don&#x27;t hope that it will help you to get off callous, and dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> It works well if you use it every few days.</li>
            <li> What you were seeing was dead skin.  </li>
            <li> I received a battery-powered pedicure kit as a gift a few years ago and it was no match for my callouses</li>
            <li> I use it for a few minutes before bed every night.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy- take it outdoors or in the bath.</li>
            <li> Contacted the seller and they responded immediately and sent the missing rollers.  </li>
            <li> A few minutes a couple of times a week keeps me from sticking to the carpet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disabled now &amp;</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t know what you&#x27;ve been missing until you try it.</li>
            <li> Lately I have a lot of cracking on my heels due to dryness, I purchased this item</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any cuts or raw patches.</li>
            <li> you do need to take it slow &amp; be conservative(got a slight &#x27;rug burn&#x27; 1st time)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hate to know how much money I have spent over the years on pedicures.  </li>
            <li> It does slow down a little if you press down really hard, but at least on my feet, pressing that hard hurts.</li>
            <li> I was tired of using a hand file to work on my dry feet during the winter, so I gave this a try!  </li>
            <li> Smoothes the hard dead skin on and around your feet.</li>
            <li> I also purchased the replacement rollers as they will dull after a few weeks usage.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s the reason they are so terrible.  </li>
            <li> No more built up, cracked heels.  </li>
            <li> NO more torture at the Pedisalon.  </li>
            <li> I spend about 5 minutes per foot usually and it has plenty of battery life.  </li>
            <li> The storage bag it came with is convent to store the small item and its charge cord.</li>
            <li> It works unbelievable well.</li>
            <li> Within just a few minutes, I knew that I&#x27;m throwing away all those PedEggs and refills and files and pumice stones!  </li>
            <li> I am a diabetic and it was a wilcome surprise to remove all the dead skin!</li>
            <li> My feet are really bad as far as dead skin and callouses go, and in 10-15 minutes of use with this, my feet were smoother than any pedicure I&#x27;ve ever gotten.</li>
            <li> So far I like the way it works, however the product description failed to mention that this product was not for use for Diabetics or those with poor blood circulation.  </li>
            <li> I am sorry that it took me so long to try it out!  </li>
            <li> but I read all the reviews and do not push to hard</li>
            <li> It smooths the skin and doesn&#x27;t rub too hard or scrape my skin.</li>
            <li> Restraint is needed if feet are in bad shape, so do a little each time and only use once a week.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand what the negative reviews were all about.  </li>
            <li> After cutting too deep a couple times I switched to using files.</li>
            <li> Had to use it at least 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> Charge holds unused for at least three weeks in my experience...</li>
            <li> My daughter came to visit and complained about her feet.  </li>
            <li> makes a little bit of a mess with the dead skin it takes off but nothing bad about this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty nasty thought considering it&#x27;s dead skin cells that are all over.  </li>
            <li> No more cutting myself with blades or working endlessly with pumice stones.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll end up with a dirty roller and dry flakes everywhere.</li>
            <li> Serious.  </li>
            <li> (I am guilty of a lot of barefoot walking) but I ordered an additional heavy duty set.  </li>
            <li> It is meeting my need to remove tough, calloused buildup without harming the skin of my feet.</li>
            <li> For years I have had rough badly cracked heels.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced it stopping when I put pressure on it as some have reported here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seeing as I am a diabetic with poor circulation I might not have bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The electronics are poor as you do not know the battery status or when the unit is recharged.  </li>
            <li> No more filing, or cutting myself.</li>
            <li> Incidentally, I have a very serious cracked heel/foot callous problem because I surf and do laps for exercise.  </li>
            <li> I have recommended the Emjoi to several friends and they plan to order one as well.&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> There were very few bad reviews, and my gamble paid off.</li>
            <li> No more expensive, and sometimes painful, manicures or pedicures.</li>
            <li> She was skeptical of it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I saw this on QVC as battery operated</li>
            <li> I explained what occurred to a skeptical but businesslike person who was persuaded that the product was defective and sent me another one.  </li>
            <li> You wont be sorry on this purchase.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately there&#x27;s no way to know when it&#x27;s fully charged or if it needs charging.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this one fell way short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 34;Holy crap dude!&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t usually talk like that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that a company will not stand behind the quality of their product.  </li>
            <li> This takes the drudgery out of  an unpleasant job.</li>
            <li> If your feet aren&#x27;t that bad off you may not want it.  </li>
            <li> And as someone else wrote, mine were really, really bad.  </li>
            <li> This is a lifesaver with my bad callus problem.</li>
            <li> I hate the feeling, it makes my feet feel dirty.  </li>
            <li> With three kids and two jobs, it is nearly impossible for me to find the time to get a pedicure!  </li>
            <li> As this is my worst callus, that was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> My feet are AWFUL.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it.  It keeps me callous free.  My feet are very soft</li>
            <li> Great product but maybe the plug in model has more torque. It runs for a very long time on a charge which is a big plus as it takes several minutes of use to get the effect one wants.</li>
            <li> This thing is pretty much as advertised, but it&#x27;s not worth the money. There are readily available manual removers for dead skin that work better and cost much, much less. Any pharmacy department will have them. Too, the manual ones do not consume replacement parts. If you don&#x27;t break it, you&#x27;ve got it for life.</li>
            <li> My thanks to the other reviewers and the Q&#x27;s &amp; A&#x27;s for helping me decide to &#x27;splurge&#x27; on this product!  I was looking for quality nail care products so that I can do my own mani/pedis when I prefer to.  I decided on the &amp;#34;Pro&amp;#34; version, as I don&#x27;t like the expense and hassle of frequent battery replacement/disposal.  I wanted something I could use outside, to eliminate added indoor. This definitely generates a lot of dust particles, because it works so well!  I&#x27;m sure the dust factor is considerably less once your feet are in better shape.  For me, using it the first time, there was a lot!  But it was GREAT, as I could see that it was being effective, even though it felt gentle.  In the hopes of helping others evaluate whether or not to purchase this, I&#x27;ll add some tips based on my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Be sure to follow the instructions and charge it for 16 hours before using it the first time.  The battery is very important, and you would not want to compromise its performance.&lt;br /&gt;- I used it the first time with the blue roller that came with the unit.  It took me quite a long time - about 45 minutes, to make substantial progress on both of my heals, before the battery started losing power.  I re-charged it and used it again the next day.  Had I known how this works, I would have purchased the more abrasive green roller to use first.  I&#x27;ve now ordered two of those - one for me; one for my husband, as I am going to have him use this (he doesn&#x27;t know it yet).  I like the fact that the rollers come in plastic containers, so I can keep his separate from mine.&lt;br /&gt;-  I&#x27;ve also ordered the mani/pedi attachments so that I can use them for nail care/prep before polishing my nails.  I hope they work well.&lt;br /&gt;- The unit is compact - easy to store.&lt;br /&gt;- It is easy to clean.  It doesn&#x27;t appear that the &#x27;dust&#x27; gets into any moving parts, so hopefully, it will be easy to maintain/will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant reading reviews before I purchased this item.  The reviews were so mixed I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think.  After looking at it for several days I bought it anyway to give it a try.  I bought the rechargeable one.  I don&#x27;t understand what the negative reviews were all about.  My feet are AWFUL.  I have a thick layer of dryness around my heels and the inner part of my big toes.  This isn&#x27;t something to use one time and then expect your feet to be smooth forever.  You have to use it every couple of weeks or so.  My problem is I do not put lotion on my feet.  I hate the feeling, it makes my feet feel dirty.  I wear flip flops all year long (live in Arizona where it&#x27;s hot all the time) and I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s the reason they are so terrible.  After one use you can feel a major difference.  It basically works the same as the foot files you would use except for since it&#x27;s electric you don&#x27;t have to do that whole scrubbing back and forth.  If your feet aren&#x27;t that bad off you may not want it.  This is a definite great purchase, in my opinion.  I do recommend you do it outside as the powdery stuff that comes off your feet when you use is goes all over the place.  I have a ped-egg and it&#x27;s basically the same except the ped-egg has a catch all compartment that the powder goes into that you empty later.  The ped-egg also kinda cuts your feet all up so a few days later you can feel the hundreds of little straggly skin snag on your sheets at night or on your socks.  I do it in the grassy part of my backyard and there&#x27;s no clean up.  The first time I pretty much had to sweep and vacuum my bathroom floor right after.  It&#x27;s a pretty nasty thought considering it&#x27;s dead skin cells that are all over.  I&#x27;ve had it a couple months now, used it about 5 times and it doesn&#x27;t seem that I&#x27;m close to needing a refill yet.  I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> .does not work well. .not worth it to purchase. .don&#x27;t bother buying it. .waste of time and money.get a pedicure instead.</li>
            <li> MY FEET FEELS LIKE SILK...LOVE THIS PRODUCT, SO DOES MY HUSBAND....</li>
            <li> The product does smooth some of the roughness on my feet; however, it takes a while to smooth the skin, it has a loud, high-pitched drill sound (think dental office), and the rollers don&#x27;t last very long-- thankful I bought the rechargeable one.  I end up roughing my feet first with a foot rasp, then using this product to smooth out my skin.</li>
            <li> Inspired by excellent reviwes, i purchased this marvelous device, hoping that it would help me to cope with callous skin on my feet. It was a dissapointment.&lt;br /&gt;In general Emoji works, and the roller rotates, but the power is so low, that it is just not able to remove the dry skin from feet. And when to push it a little bit harder- it just stops.&lt;br /&gt;This product is ineffective, so don&#x27;t hope that it will help you to get off callous, and dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have always had problems with callus on my feet . Runs in family. Over the years I have&lt;br /&gt;tried everthing that I have found in the market place. The emjoi buffer is fast easy and safe&lt;br /&gt;when used as directed. Well pleased with the ..</li>
            <li> This thing is a MIRACLE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow!  What can I say?  For the first time since I was a child, my feet are decent!  No more built up, cracked heels.  And as someone else wrote, mine were really, really bad.  &amp;#34;Dragon feet&amp;#34; - yep, that is what they were like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only used the blue sander that came with it.  And I had also ordered the &amp;#34;Precision kit&amp;#34; so I could do the toe area and where the toes meet the ball of the foot.  The Precision kit works great also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not do this in one sitting.  I did it a bit at a time, every evening for about a week.  I live alone, so just had it plugged in near where I sit to watch TV.  I got the rechargeable and definitely recommend paying a little more for that model.  You don&#x27;t have to keep replacing batteries and you can &amp;#34;un-tether&amp;#34; the tool from the cord when using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds a charge really well.  I actually don&#x27;t know for how long, because it has never run out of power when I&#x27;ve used it and I always plug it right back in to the power line when I am finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last weekend I stayed at my daughter&#x27;s house.  Since I had been raving about how much I like this tool, I brought it along with me so she could try it.  She loved it!  (And yes, she had actually used her husband&#x27;s dremel tool on her feet at one point!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I am just about to order one of these along with the Precision kit and a few extra sander inserts as a Christmas present for my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the best expenditures I have made in a long time.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful! If your feet need some work - this is the product to buy. There was a big different after just the first use.</li>
            <li> Very efficient - not aggressive at all.  Works really well!</li>
            <li> Worked above and beyond as a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> First time user and and my wife loves it</li>
            <li> Excellent !!!  Love not having to go bi-monthly and pay $55 for a full pedicure.  This takes care of it bi-weekly in just 10 mins.</li>
            <li> I love the Emjoi pedi foot buffer.  It works well if you use it every few days. If the rollers look worn out after a use or two, they aren&#x27;t - just rinse them off and the color is back.  What you were seeing was dead skin.  I highly recommend this product; a good deal for the price.  I use it every other day and my feet are always smooth.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it!!  I have a callous on my foot that hurts when I wear certain shoes.  I tried using pumice stones to remove it, but they never really worked.  I used this Micro-Pedi Foot buffer on it, and it removed the entire callous.  I can wear any shoes I want with no pain at all.  It&#x27;s easy to use, and the rechargeable battery lasts a long time.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> buff those calluses away, leaves foot smooth</li>
            <li> I love this Foot Buffer!  Does what it claims and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase --- very happy with this seller</li>
            <li> Christmas  gift for my wife and she  loves it.</li>
            <li> NO more torture at the Pedisalon.  This thing is a miracle worker. My feet are so smooth  and they are no longer an embarrassment. LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and it works perfect..lovee it</li>
            <li> Easy to use and being able to charge rather than continue to take batteries is a great option.</li>
            <li> Bought one each of these along with a set of spare rollers for Christmas presents for our daughter and daughters-in-law. Don&#x27;t know a whole lot about foot grinding (my wife just loves that I call it that), but they are all raving about how well they work and way it leaves their feet; smooth and soft. Score one for the parents!</li>
            <li> God bless my wife. I love her, but boy she has some rough feet. I should know. I rub her feet almost nightly. She has been self-conscious about her feet as long as I have known her. Every remedy for rough feet out there, she&#x27;s tried them all! When I saw this advertised on TV I knew I wanted to get this for her. She was skeptical of it. Considering all that she has tried, I can understand. I bought it as a Christmas gift, and when she opened it I got a dubious look from her. She eventually opened it and gave it a try. And with one use she became an instant believer. I rubbed her feet later that evening and was amazed at the difference. The title of my review says it all!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with all aspects.</li>
            <li> The Emjoi Micro-Pedi does everything it says it will:  if your heels are super-dry, it might take a while to get them to baby-softness, but after the initial use, all you have to do to maintain is to use the device every several days, and just a few passes over each heel should do it.  I have used it numerous times since I bought it and still have not had to replace the original head. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The Micro-Pedi buffer works just fine for me.  I&#x27;ve had it for a month now and haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet.  It has quite a bit of power and speed, and does a great job on my heels.  I&#x27;ve never experienced it stopping when I put pressure on it as some have reported here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative is the refill rollers don&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like.  I&#x27;m squeezing 3-4 uses out of each, but they&#x27;re most effective with the first two uses.  Unfortunately, the rollers are pretty pricey--I&#x27;m hoping some vendor will come up with knock-off replacements at half the cost.</li>
            <li> This is an easy product to use and smooths the heel very well. The charge lasts a long time,too. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A FABULOUS PRODUCT - IT CAME ALREADY CHARGED AND READY TO GO - IT IS CORDLESS AND RECHARGEABLE --- AND IT REMOVED CALLOUS FROM MY FEET LIKE A $100.00 PEDICURIST DOES ------ I ABSOLUTELY LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> My wife want this. She says it works great.</li>
            <li> What took me so long to find this type of gadget! I&#x27;ve been attacking my calloused feet with scrapers and pumice stones for ages. This takes the drudgery out of  an unpleasant job.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but this is good product that actually works. I was skeptical at first but I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it.  I have recommended the Emjoi to several friends and they plan to order one as well.&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> My mom purchased this unit a few weeks back as she has SEVERE callused feet from psoriasis. She&#x27;s tried the ped egg, buffing pads and stones and those were &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;. She let me use her pedi device as I ger calluses on my big toes and heels and the pads of my feet.. I used this for 1 minute on each toe and the calluses are completely gone. I was so impressed I just ordered one for myself yesterday.</li>
            <li> I wish the motor was a little stronger but overall I&#x27;m happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Abrasive roller has that lasted close to two years and is still in perfect condition.  You just have to wash it until the skin comes off the roller.  Then the life seems To be unlimited</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m pretty pleased with this buffer, but there are a few small things that I think Emjoi could improve on. I was able to use this buffer for both feet after only charging for 30 minutes, then plugged it in for the recommended time. It would be nice if the red light ever went off to let you know when it was charged, but this hasn&#x27;t been an issue since it&#x27;s always charged when I need it. I don&#x27;t know exactly how long a full charge lasts, because I&#x27;ve never run it all the way down buffing both feet (about 15 min). The power is good, although I could see that a man with really thick calluses might need more power. It does slow down a little if you press down really hard, but at least on my feet, pressing that hard hurts. So for my purposes, the power is just perfect. The blue buffer has lasted 4 uses so far and seems to still work fine, which is pretty good considering how much has buffed off my feet during these first uses. The primary reason why I&#x27;m giving 4 instead of 5 stars is because of two things: 1) the rotating head isn&#x27;t viewable 360 degrees  (i.e. covered on one side), so it really limits the ability to see what you&#x27;re buffing. It&#x27;s particularly hard to use with your non-dominant hand on your opposite foot, because you can&#x27;t see what&#x27;s being buffed unless you&#x27;re looking at the skin from the side. I have friends who have the Amope, which allows you to see your foot better, but has insufficient power and isn&#x27;t rechargeable. 2) the buffer/roller on this Micro-Pedi is inset pretty deeply between the side pieces meaning that you can&#x27;t really buff anything that&#x27;s not convex  (i.e. can&#x27;t really buff flat or concave surfaces on your feet, only things that stick up/out like heels and toes). This means that I can&#x27;t adequately buff the callus just below my 2nd toe on the ball of my foot, which is a slightly concave area. As this is my worst callus, that was very disappointing. Press as hard as I might at different angles, I just can&#x27;t get that spot with this buffer. But for my heels, toes, and the rest of my foot, it&#x27;s great. So overall, I would recommend this product based on the batteries saved by recharging, the power, the comfort in your hand, and it&#x27;s effectiveness on most parts of my feet. But I wish the side pieces didn&#x27;t stick so far out beyond the roller limiting usefulness on concave parts of the foot, and I wish the roller wasn&#x27;t covered on the back limiting visibility.fer.

            <li> my wife loves it. works great!</li>
            <li> Works well but takes a lot of time</li>
            <li> Love!!!!  Love this!!</li>
            <li> This Rechargeable Emilio Micro-Pedi is great!  It left my feet very smooth after just the first use.  My feet have been very dry for a long time now.  My lady friend used her mini Pedi Egg on my feet last year and they felt great.  I decided to buy my own and found this rechargeable model and bought it.  I have used it and it&#x27;s amazing.  I don&#x27;t feel the skin on my feet rough and dry anymore.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great product. Gentle but VERY powerful. Easy to refill and quick clean up! No cord -- a big bonus!</li>
            <li> My actual words, partway into my first buffing session, were &amp;#34;Holy crap dude!&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t usually talk like that but it&#x27;s an indication of how amazed I was. I&#x27;ve been dealing with callouses on my feet since I was a teenager in the 70s wearing platform heels. In my twenties, I used to cut them off with scissors. After cutting too deep a couple times I switched to using files. The files helped, but the end result always looked like filed-down callouses and they started becoming unsightly again after a day or two, despite applying lotion and wearing socks overnight. Even after a professional pedicure, my feet still looked calloused and unsightly.  I researched motorized buffers pretty thoroughly before trying the Emjoi. I received a battery-powered pedicure kit as a gift a few years ago and it was no match for my callouses so I knew I wanted more power. The cords on plug-in units were not long enough for my single-outlet bathroom, plus I wanted more convenience, so I opted for a rechargeable unit. I chose the Emjoi because it looked sturdier and more comfortable to hold than similar units I saw online. I share other reviewers&#x27; concerns about the charging light never going off but that&#x27;s a minor complaint given how well this thing works.  I found the Emjoi very easy to use. It had some power when I received it but I followed the directions and let it charge overnight before my first use. When I started buffing the callouses on the ball of my left foot, the results were immediately impressive. I could tell by all the dead skin dust falling to the floor that the Emjoi was making far better progress than my usual foot file, but it was when I touched the freshly buffed area that I exclaimed out loud. That part of my foot hadn&#x27;t felt that soft in decades! I proceeded to buff the heel, the outside edge of the sole, and the callous on the outside of the big toe on my left foot. I wish I had taken before and after photos at that point because it was like taking 20 years off my left foot. By the time I finished my right foot I was wishing it would hurry up and be sandal season already. I had purchased the Emjoi in February, thinking it would take several uses before my feet were presentable enough for spring here in the northwest. I was delighted to see and feel such great results after just the first use.  I was mindful during my first session that I didn&#x27;t want to overdo it. I wasn&#x27;t sure how my feet would feel after a few days of walking around with no callouses to protect them. To my pleasant surprise, they actually felt better, even after standing or walking for long periods of time. It was also nice not having my socks get stuck to my rough heels. Buh-bye lizard feet!  The initial charge got me through my first session with no signs of slowing down. I recharged the unit before putting it away. I&#x27;ve had a couple brief follow-up sessions to buff down the balls of my feet a bit further and remove some new dry skin from my heels, but it looks like less than 5 minutes a week will keep my feet looking and feeling fabulous all through the summer. I am very glad I took the plunge and tried the Emjoi.</li>
            <li> I received this as a birthday gift (at my request!), purchased on Amazon.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier!  For years I have had rough badly cracked heels.  A couple of days of using this and the cracks are gone and my heels are almost soft--few more days and they will be soft.  Love the rechargeable feature, too--that&#x27;s why I asked for this model.  Highly recommend!  Great product.</li>
            <li> lots of power the wife was happy</li>
            <li> It works, but it&#x27;s a slow process, and my feet are in pretty good shape.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  After using it, I purchased another one as a gift for my sister.</li>
            <li> Best at home pedicure, makes your feet very soft with little workâ€¦.the attachments are great too!  Purchased for my sister for her birthday, she loves it!</li>
            <li> reat service daughter in law loved g</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the emjoi micropedi. It is very easy to use and does a great job. I stand and walk all day at work and my feet have it rough, but with this little appliance they are smooth and soft. I use it for a few minutes before bed every night. It&#x27;s addictive, having the feeling of just pedicured feet!</li>
            <li> Item works fantastically.  Highly recommended over the strictly battery operated one.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this purchase. I use it with a light touch and it just goes to work. I did both my feet and my daughters and the unit maintained a really good charge. I soaked my feet first, don&#x27;t try to use this on dirty feet. You&#x27;ll end up with a dirty roller and dry flakes everywhere. After I was done, I used a manual buffer to smooth and then put on a pair of Bliss socks. The results were markedly better than using a manual file. I like this little buffer a lot.</li>
            <li> I had purchased another brand of this type of unit (nearly identical) that runs on batteries.  It was a waste of money.  The reviews on this unit indicated it was much more powerful and did not bog down as you pressed it into a callous.  The reviews were correct!  This unit is very nice and has plenty of power.  Like the othe reviews suggested, I picked up an extra 4-pak of the heaver grit sandpaper rolls and they work just great!</li>
            <li> Best item I ever purchased</li>
            <li> I wear sandals as much of the year as I possibly can so my heels are always rough. I&#x27;ve used this a couple times and love it. I like that it&#x27;s rechargeable instead of battery operated.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for it&#x27;s price! I bought this for my grandmother since she has chaffed feet and she told me that she is satisfied, later my mother used it on my stepfather cause he has dry feet and she liked the way he feet felt soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife.  We had seen it advertised on TV and she mentioned wanting one.  She loves it!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I saw this on QVC as battery operated so I searched for one with a cord.  I was pleasantly surprised when I found Amazon had it rechargeable.  I received it and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out and was more than happy with the results.  My feet are so smooth they slide in my shoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to buy for Christmas presents.</li>
            <li> Nothing works as well as callous shaver with blade...</li>
            <li> Just received the Micro Pedi. Read all directions and was a bit hesitant at first as my heels are seriously thickened and hardened. Dropped by my podiatrist and showed it to him. He said go for it. So I did and was amazed at how easy it is to use and how much dead skin it removed. It took me about 4-5 minutes to do both feet working at a continuous motion. I am very pleased with the product. Just wish the replacement rollers would come in a larger pack size and were a little more cost efficient. However, I plan on ordering the 2 pack as soon as I finish this.</li>
            <li> the Emjoi is great in fact i ordered a second one for my granddaughter a couple days after my first one arrived.  hers arrived with the 2 extra buffer roller but mind did not (the description stated they came with the item).  i order 2 extra buffer refills later and did receive them with the second order but never received the original 2 that should have shipped with my first order.  so make sure you get what you were promised... but i do love the product and will order more for friends for christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> The tool works great but my qualm is with th erefill rollers they just dont last long enough for you to get that bang for the dollar feeling!</li>
            <li> This powered foot sanding buffer works very well and quickly. It&#x27;s well made and&lt;br /&gt;easy to hold/use. It has an easy to change sanding roller, and the replacement&lt;br /&gt;sanding rollers are available in Fine to Extra Coarse Grit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has rechargeable batteries so you don&#x27;t waste a lot of money buying extra batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you thought you wanted an Amope, buy this one instead. You&#x27;ll be glad you did......&lt;br /&gt;and you can save time/money by not going to the Pedi shop.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Easy to use and feet are so soft! Paid for itself in 2 uses compared to a pedi in a salon! Love this!</li>
            <li> I must really love this tool.  I bought myself one and liked it so much that I ordered two more for other people.  I really like the fact that it is rechargeable and I don&#x27;t have to keep buying batteries.  It does a smooth job on my rough feet.  I don&#x27;t even have to get pedicures anymore.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful callus remover; my feet just after one use look &amp; feel great; so wish I would have heard about this years ago. Other reviews are correct you do not need to press hard against your feet; just let the roller do the work &amp; a soft toothbrush works great on cleaning the roller better than that dinky little brush they put in the box.</li>
            <li> A great tool which has fixed a long-term problem.</li>
            <li> Love this foot buffer!  It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to use.  It&#x27;s great for dealing with rough heels in between pedicures!  Wearing flip flops and sandals all summer, I&#x27;m sure that this will be getting a lot of use!</li>
            <li> I bought one before and my kids lost one of the parts for it, do I had to buy another one. My feet are the softest they have ever been just don&#x27;t leave it on one spot for too long!</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my wife.  She is totally happy with the product. Arrived on time and was in original sealed box. What more can I say?</li>
            <li> I love everything about this item except how fast you go through the rollers.  Within 8 uses the roller needed to be changed.</li>
            <li> I love this buffer.  It works as advertised and really helps and saves me money so I don&#x27;t have to go and get pedicures as frequently as before.</li>
            <li> Received the product, charged it up per directions, it worked fine.  I put it back on the charger and didn&#x27;t need it for a couple of weeks.  The directions are silent about leaving the product on the charger--I read the instructions carefuilly, and most products allow leaving them on the charger.  The second time I tried using this Emjoi, Micro-Pedi, it ran for less than 15 seconds and then stopped.  It would occasionally work for a few seconds but never more than 15 seconds before it would stop.  If I turned it off and left it for several minutes and then turn it on, it would still only work for less than 15 seconds.  I tried to return it a month and 5 days after the date of purchace and received notice from Amazon that the seller follows the Amazon policy of not accepting returns more than 30 days after purchase.  This, even though the written Emjoi, Inc. warranty that came with the product states the warranty is for 1 year.  I called the phone number on the warranty and left a message but did not get a call back.  This is a rip off but if you want to try it, recharge it several times within 30 days of purchase so you can return (see policies) if it stops working.&lt;br /&gt;2013-08-25 This is an UPDATE!!!!!!  Micro-Pedi did call back within 48 hours.  I explained what occurred to a skeptical but businesslike person who was persuaded that the product was defective and sent me another one.  The new one works great.  I&#x27;m pretty sure the first one had a defective battery from the get-go.  Incidentally, I have a very serious cracked heel/foot callous problem because I surf and do laps for exercise.  I have tried many, many products and this one is one of the two best I have ever tried.  The other one, Microplane Brown Colossal Pedicure Foot Rasp I found on Amazon, is manual, with great blades that take a lot of dead skin off in a hurry but leave your skin a little rough.  Micro-Pedi is second only to the other product at taking dead skin off--it does a good job at taking alot of dead skin off--and has the added benefit of being able to smooth off the skin surface better than the other product.</li>
            <li> I had no idea this was on the market, ladies if you have problems with rough or dry feet.. YOU HAVE GOT TO BUY THIS.. it is AMAZING.  It is gentle but removes the heavy dry cracked skin.. I did some every day for a week so not to have sore feet.  wow.. don&#x27;t forget to use your foot lotion.. my feet are so soft and pretty now.. I use it once a week and lotion daily to keep my feet that way.. THIS IS A PRODUCT NO WOMAN SHOULD GO WITHOUT...</li>
            <li> My non-rechargeable battery driven Emjoi broke so I debated whether to order the corded or the rechargeable version.  I am glad I chose the rechargeable version.  I charged it for the full 16 hours as per the directions and it runs fast and efficiently and has not slowed down during its use.  I cannot speak to it&#x27;s longevity since I have only had it a few days. If you are considering the non-rechargeable battery driven version, understand that it goes though batteries fast and that costs $. While I cannot compare it to the corded version since I&#x27;ve never had one, I think that the rechargeable one was a good choice.  I use it every day since I am one of those everyday sandals kind of person and the skin builds up fast on the heels.</li>
            <li> I now have smooth feet!</li>
            <li> Love this, works great because I cannot reach my feet myself to rub them anymore!</li>
            <li> Worked beautifully.  Definitely worth the extra money to get the rechargeable as compared to battery one.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!  I use it ever day to keep my feet smooth and soft all the time. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This seriously works better than any salon I&#x27;ve ever been to! I could feel the softness immediately! Better yet...my husband could feel the softness and now I&#x27;m ordering one for him!</li>
            <li> like it , work good not as strong of a motor as i think it should be</li>
            <li> Reading all the reviews, I assumed they&#x27;d been posted by emoji employees.  But, I went for it anyway.  Turns out this product is as good as they say!  Made me feet feel better than a $75 pedicure ever did.</li>
            <li> Well, I sent an e-mail to the company that makes this product. This is my tale of woe. Opened the package, took battery cover off, and it all fell out, it had broken housing, but because I wanted to see if it really worked, well it did, but as I said I had to duct tape it together, the batteries will only allow for one good treatment. Bummed out about this, and now I wish I had spent more money and bought the rechargeable verison. I read horror stories about returns and I wish that Amazon would contact that company and credit me with what I paid for this broken one, would gladly send it back, but want the rechargeable one in my hand first, to see if it is ok, not trusting this company right now, but the one thing I can say, it does work. And I would do like that other person did and buy and cut sandpaper and place on roller, refills are too high. Like this will happen that they will send me a rechargeable one for half price, and credit for this duct taped monster\\&quot;\\&quot;\\&quot;\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s visibly doing the job and it makes your feet feel really nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I had to get my feet beach ready over night and got this tool. My heels get really calloused from all that &amp;#34;barefoot&amp;#34; training/running stuff. I bought the coarse rollers and used that first. It&#x27;s messy- take it outdoors or in the bath. If you have borderline OCD like me, reign that madness in, otherwise you&#x27;re going to take off too much and your feet will be tender. Do over a few days and still use a good moisturizer on your heels. Wash off the rollers to keep them effective.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that bummed me out about this tool is that if it&#x27;s not charged, you can&#x27;t just plug it in and use it. Also, I charged it for what seemed like forever and the indicator light never told me it was done, but it was still pretty effective after a first charge of the recommended time.</li>
            <li> Works surprisingly well.  I have well-calloused guy&#x27;s feet and sometimes they need a bit of sanding down so they don&#x27;t crack.  I was worried that this thing might be under-powered but it works pretty well. If it only had a built-in vacuum cleaner it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> I am really amazed how soft my feet are by using the Emjoi.  I find myself rubbing my feet together while I am sitting not believing these are My feet.  No trouble with it stopping but I read all the reviews and do not push to hard you really do not need to.  It did not remove the cracks in my heels but did remove the dryness - my feet can wear sandals for the summer!  yea!</li>
            <li> Nice design and power.  Easy to clean and change the head.  Very good product.</li>
            <li> Works great. Simple, powerful enough for some pretty tough heels!</li>
            <li> Not as effective as I had hoped, but it does a decent job maintaining smoothness for a while after I&#x27;ve had a pedicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PedEgg works better, but this is easier to maneuver.</li>
            <li> Lately I have a lot of cracking on my heels due to dryness, I purchased this item and I absolutely love it&lt;br /&gt;It is completely above my expectations&lt;br /&gt;It is worth the money and beats going to the salon to pay money for someone to do your feet, then have to go home and redo your own heels because the salon did not do a good job&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it, you will not regret getting it</li>
            <li> I have found tis to be perfect for my callused heels. This is the only product that I have used that works for this purpose. The charge last d&#x3D;for a long time, the rolls seem to last for a good while and the replacements aren&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> I use this item about once every couple of weeks.  I have charged it once, and it is still kickin.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  I had the battery operated version and other reviews are correct, after 1-2 uses, you lose power.  I always felt like I was throwing money away with all those batteries + the pollution.  The same rollers fit this version.  It is always at full power for each use.  I spend about 5 minutes per foot usually and it has plenty of battery life.  The charge light never goes off so you cannot tell if it is fully charged, that kind of bugs me but is not the end of the world.  As I said in my review of the previous machine... it takes several months of regular use (i use it once a week) to see a big change in your feet.  I also pull the skin tight and start at the edges of thick callouses towards the inside to kind of wear them away.  Much more user friendly that a file.  Highly recommend... to recharge or not to recharge, definitely yes</li>
            <li> Love the Micro-Pedi and it has a good amount of power.  I would have liked to have been able to select different rollers to come with it as the blue are not coarse enough for my feet (I am guilty of a lot of barefoot walking) but I ordered an additional heavy duty set.  I have been using it before bed and then applying Vitamin D and sleeping with socks.  No regrets on this unplanned purchase</li>
            <li> If you have calluses that are a few millimeters in thickness that just need to be made smooth, the Emjoi may be the perfect solution for you. However, if you have serious calluses that actually need removal, rather than just minor shaping, you will find the Emjoi to be very, very slow, about 10 times slower than the product I eventually replaced it with, the Microplane foot rasp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Emjoi works by literally sanding the skin, something that requires the skin be dry at the time, and therein lies the problem. The Microplanes, which work by slicing away a tiny layer at a time, work on skin damp from bath or shower, and that skin is much easier to remove than hard, dry skin. Removing my thickest callus on my male feet took close to 20 minutes with the Emjoi. The Microplane eliminates it in fewer than two minutes. The Microplanes are also a lot cheaper: The one I use, the Microplane Colossal Pedicure Rasp, is currently listed for $9.50 on amazon. The more feminine versions start at $8.95.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I have no connection with the Microplane company. I just found it shocking when, after spending a whole bunch of money on the Emjoi, I discovered an alternate technology that was so much better. I just wish I&#x27;d found out sooner. Do make sure you have dampened your feet before using the Microplane. Otherwise, much of the advantage disappears. (Don&#x27;t dampen your feet before using the Emjoi: it has no way to clear any dampened removed skin, so it just fills the nooks and crannies in the sandpaper until the cylinder is perfectly slick.) If you search amazon for &amp;#34;microplane&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;foot,&amp;#34; you&#x27;ll find the full line.</li>
            <li> Best investment in a very, very long time! I&#x27;ve struggled with dry cracked heels for a very long time before I discovered this item. Trust me, it works! If you&#x27;ve ever been ashamed of your feet like I once was, invest in this and a jar of Aquaphor. . .your feet will never be an embarrassment again!</li>
            <li> I really like this easy to use foot buffer.  It makes my feet soft and smooth.  I plan to use it all year long before a pedicure and in between.</li>
            <li> Great machine! So nice to use and  excellent results.&lt;br /&gt; The cone accessories that can be ordered separately, are a wonderful compliment  for hard to reach areas.  My feet have never looked better!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this thing!! It does what it claims and we bought the rechargeable version - so no batteries to mess with. Replacement rollers are very affordable compaired to other brands.</li>
            <li> Never do pedicures, very particular about my feet &amp; the foot rasp products really freak me out. But this is great! No metal/sharp blades. Just a sander roll 2 gently sand away the callus. you do need to take it slow &amp; be conservative(got a slight &#x27;rug burn&#x27; 1st time) but overall excited to use this far into the future.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that it is rechargeable.</li>
            <li> Using this help with the dryness and deep splits I get in my feet. Had to use it at least 3 times a week. Sore feet was gone a month later.</li>
            <li> I am so surprised at how well this little buffer does the job.  My feet look and feel great.  I strongly recommend this Emjoi that is rechargeable.  I didn&#x27;t want to fool around with batteries.  I charged this up as soon as I received it and it has been going strong without a second charge for 3 days.  I use it approximately for 15 minutes each time, and it is still going strong.  LOVE IT!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have others but they use either too much of my strength, time, and ineffective.  I was using it about once a day for the first week and now I only uses it about once a week.</li>
            <li> Excellent buffer but can&#x27;t tell when fully charged as the charging light is red and doesn&#x27;t change colors or turn off when fully charged</li>
            <li> So far I like the way it works, however the product description failed to mention that this product was not for use for Diabetics or those with poor blood circulation.  I did not see that until I read the box...after I had used it.  Seeing as I am a diabetic with poor circulation I might not have bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But seeing as I have it, and have used it....I am keeping it.  I will have to ask my doctor about it.</li>
            <li> Works nice and quick, especially when you order the super coarse rollers for this thing.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was expecting. My feet are smoother now then when I pay $50 for a premium pedicure! I highly recommend this product to anyone wanting smooth heels. I am getting on  for my mom and sister for Christmas!</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  It sure works unlike anything else I have tried.  This was worth the price.  Just wish they had them in bright yellow and the file rollers were a little cheaper and more coarse.  Made my feet really smooth. Really works.</li>
            <li> This product removes foot callus quite nicely w/ good results.  The product description said it came w/ 2 extra rollers but they were not included in the pkg.  Contacted the seller and they responded immediately and sent the missing rollers.  Don&#x27;t know if the product description is in error.  This was another  example of good customer service as they stood by their add.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It performs exactly as advertised. I have used it 4 times so far without needing to recharge. These uses were not just for a moment or two either, but for a considerable time. There are many complaints of dust everywhere. If held properly, with the handle downward, and a trash can under your fee, the movement of air from the rotation of the buffer will push the dust out vents on the back of the micro-pedi into the trash can or other receptacle. If you hold it upside down... you are going to get dust because that air flow will blow it into the room. There is less dust from this than the traditional foot file I have used for years. The rotation of the buffer is such that &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; of the machine is wasting time. Moving the Micro-Pedi in a downward motion is how you will get the greatest buffing action and greatest results in the least amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am finally able to get the callouses on my toes under control and the snaggy bits on my heels gone in one sitting. A few minutes a couple of times a week keeps me from sticking to the carpet. I wish I had this years ago. I was a manicurist for years. This really is a great tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received no compensation for this review. I have purchased this product for my own personal use only.</li>
            <li> I was completely amazed to see how soft this made my feet!  However, the results only lasted about 2 days before I had to do it again.  I just received this last week, so that&#x27;s all of the feedback I can supply at this time.  I do however like that you can plug it in so I don&#x27;t have yet another product to buy batteries for.  It came with a fabric case (drawstring) and one extra pumice roller.</li>
            <li> This item is a pleasure to use. It works remarkably well leaving your feet smooth.. It gives beautiful results very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this item to anyone who wears sandals or flip flops a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many other techniques, but none of them equal the great results you get with Micro-Pedi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cindy</li>
            <li> Easy to use cost was ok for what the product is to be used for.  the price is in line of other brands</li>
            <li> Absolutely great product. My feet have never been so smooth. The operation is flawless, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> one of the few gadget that actually work.necessity for sandal season. worth the investment. just take a minute to use.</li>
            <li> Works great; better than paying for pedicures to get soft feet.</li>
            <li> I have not had a chance to try the product yet so hopefully it will be a great product thanks</li>
            <li> Although this buffer works good, I would suggest it be used on maintained callouses. The rollers get hot on thick, hard callouses when constant firm pressure is applied..(not suggested)..use cautiously if you have little sensation on your feet..&lt;br /&gt;The vender is amazing! My first buffer did not work, wouldn&#x27;t even charge. The vender was very helpful in replacing the unit for the one I have now (which works just fine..)</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law gave me my Micro Pedi for Christmas and I absolutely love it. It has made my other wise rough feet feel so smooth. It is easy and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. My husband&#x27;s feet are so rough he picks my bed cover. He is very sensitive when you try to mess with his feet but he actually let me get him down and work on his feet. Thanks to my Micro Pedi his feet no longer pick by bedding and after the initial tickle he was alright with it. Now when he feels his feet getting a little rough he comes to me for a smoothing. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works quite well and feet so soft!</li>
            <li> This is an incredible, I have never had anything that worked as well as this!  Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> I am beyond happy with this foot buffer!  I was hopeful, but skeptical, that it would work as described &amp; it really does!  I&#x27;ve had a problem for years with dry cracking heels - gross - &amp; only intermittent success with pumice stones etc.  I&#x27;m disabled now &amp; it&#x27;s extremely difficult for me to use the typical tools for dealing with my dry heels, so this is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Love this-  easy to use, does a great job in keeping skin smooth.  Recharge lasts through many times.  Good quality.</li>
            <li> My feet are really bad as far as dead skin and callouses go, and in 10-15 minutes of use with this, my feet were smoother than any pedicure I&#x27;ve ever gotten. Really happy with this product.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product.  It&#x27;s a belt sander for your feet.  Leaves feet very soft and smooth. Still on the first head.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful.  No cutting at all, just a nice little pummace stone that gently smooths the feet.  You will love it, every woman I know who has one, loves it.  Now they are making stronger ones for men.  This just keeps getting better and better.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It really works!  Easy to use, and easy to keep clean.  The roller is good for multiple uses.</li>
            <li> very convenient, easy to use, and always there when you need it because it is rechargable.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife this Christmas and she&#x27;s already used it. Says &amp;#34;it&#x27;s amazing&amp;#34; and that it really works.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this item and would recommend it to any one who is undecided. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> This item was delivered promptly and boxed well. It is meeting my need to remove tough, calloused buildup without harming the skin of my feet. It has held its charge and is easy to clean. The storage bag it came with is convent to store the small item and its charge cord.</li>
            <li> This is a lifesaver with my bad callus problem. However, the regular rollers take forever to grind down my calluses. I think I will try the coarser rollers and see how that works. The footies from hell, LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good quality product and I have had no problems with it. Changing the rollers is really easy. I&#x27;m glad to have it as it helps avoid the huge callus cracks that happen if I don&#x27;t keep on top of the callus status.</li>
            <li> I used the Emjoy and liked it but it will not recharge. I am waiting for the seller to respond. So far everyone with the battery Enjoy is.  Happy.</li>
            <li> Love it, I used it several times.</li>
            <li> just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my mom because it&#x27;s hard for her to use traditional foot buffing methods (i.e. pumice stone) due to a disability. This was the PERFECT alternative. It works beautifully and the recharging capabilities mean that she can use it anywhere in the house, but not have to fuss with AA or AAA batteries. Just so you know, this comes with 2 regular buffer rollers, which is fine for those who want to do routine maintenance. However, for anyone with tough calluses I would recommend adding on the extreme coarse rollers. Also, the charger is not as effective in a surge protector strip. Plug it into an outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, my mom was thrilled. Definitely would purchase again.</li>
            <li> The rechargeable version was a great idea but the roller is still easily stopped when applying what feels like minimal pressure.  The charge light continued blinking even after charging for 24 hours.  During use, the motor can be heard to quickly lose intensity.  I find that I need to use this buffer daily it works very superficially.</li>
            <li> It works unbelievable well. The charge lasts for several days, even with frequent use. The sanding tubes do not have a very long life, but I do use mine frequently.</li>
            <li> This works great and is easy to use.  Tried many manual pumice stones, but this is much better and requires no effort.</li>
            <li> I bought it to give as a christmas present! Got a very happy response, and product works as described! Product arrived timely for the holidays, and seems to be making my wife very happy!</li>
            <li> This tool is incredible!!!  I have a spa pedi about every 6 weeks (except in winter).  I had a shoulder replacement and the strength in my right arm is limited, so manual pedi is difficult, and the Micro-Pedi is very effective without applying pressure.  Rough heels and balls of feet are baby smooth now, even during our frigid winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the second one to my 82 year old mother, who has &amp;#34;dragon feet&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s taken awhile, but her feet are much improved with each use. I purchased extra rollers in course, and they are lasting for approx 4-5 pedis.  Five stars are well-deserved</li>
            <li> Got it for my wife because she is always using something to sand off the skin from her feet and it wasn&#x27;t always something i wouldn&#x27;t see in the dishwasher later. This works great and it will never be used to grate anything else!</li>
            <li> Love it!  But rollers do wear down fast so be prepared to order more!</li>
            <li> This is the best callous remover.  Well worth the money.  The choice is between a cordless model or the corded model.  This cordless model does seem wimpy in that it bogs down in rotation speed with pressure.  So it takes some patients and practice to get the desired result.  On the other hand it&#x27;s easy to reach all areas with a portable unit whereas I suspect the corded model would be more difficult to maneuver.  The rollers are easy to replace but so far they have held up well and not needed replacement.</li>
            <li> the product was very good, had no problems. feet were very smooth.  makes a little bit of a mess with the dead skin it takes off but nothing bad about this product.</li>
            <li> Just got my Rechargeable Emjoi Micro-Pedi Pro Foot Buffer (Special Edition)&lt;br /&gt;In the mail yesterday. I charged it for 24 hours. My feet really needed work. I would recommend buying the other rolls as the ones that come with it are to gentle.</li>
            <li> It works great. Was very pleased at how well it works.</li>
            <li> The Emjoi foot buffer is a wonder. Works great on my rough heals.</li>
            <li> Works just as advertised.</li>
            <li> MY FEET ARE SOOOOO SMOOTH - I&#x27;VE USED IT TWICE NOW  - ALL I HAVE TO DO IS A QUICKY EACH WEEK :)&lt;br /&gt;I ALSO PURCHASE THE LITTLE MICRO-PEDI MANICURE PIECES THAT FIT ON IT...LOVE THEM ALSO!!! IT ALSO HOLDS ITS CHARGE GREAT.  BUY IT...YOU&#x27;LL LOOOOOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product!  I saw it on QVC and found it was cheaper at Amazon. I have thick callouses on the ball of my feet, and within a few minutes it was nearly gone. I am very pleased with the product...a bit pricey and hopefully it&#x27;ll come down in price. I purchased the one that has a battery/plug-in option as I&#x27;m always forgetting where I lay things and figured this was the route to go. One thing I wish the manufacturer would improve on is the option of different widths of the head for smaller areas, but otherwise a great find, and great buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad my girlfriend brought hers when she came to visit. This is wonderful.</li>
            <li> We have been using this product for six months  - it works!  We feel the rechargeable unit is over priced.  The battery is good for about 30 minutes.  The electronics are poor as you do not know the battery status or when the unit is recharged.  Recharging takes many hours and you don&#x27;t know when it is fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We would not purchase this product again but would consider the plug in unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pads are holding up much better than we expected lasting very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does an excellent job removing the dry skin and calluses.  We recommend the technology but not this model.</li>
            <li> great, retains power would recommend</li>
            <li> All I can say is that it actually works. Smoothes the hard dead skin on and around your feet. I also purchased the replacement rollers as they will dull after a few weeks usage.</li>
            <li> Why ever go to a salon again?  I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Good product, would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Does a good job on dry feet.  Restraint is needed if feet are in bad shape, so do a little each time and only use once a week.  This way over time you get to the new skin without creating soreness in your feet.  Probably the best on the market at this time.</li>
            <li> Words cannot describe how great this thing is.  It has removed callouses that have been on my feet for years.  No more long waits at the podiatrist&#x27;s office; I can do this myself and so easily.  It seems to have plenty of power and it is so easy to use and very effective.</li>
            <li> I gifted this to my husband who has little time to take care of his feet and he loves this!  It works very well, helps remove some very rough spots, especially in those hard to reach places!  He uses it for his finger tips too, if they crack at the nail beds due in the Winter months.</li>
            <li> I was given this as a gift from my mother-in-law.  Since I liked the ped-egg, I hadn&#x27;t  really opened this until recently.  I am sorry that it took me so long to try it out!  It works so much quicker and your feet are left feeling nice and smooth!  I love the way my feet feel after a pedicure, but hate that feeling of them working on your feet.  This didn&#x27;t tickle or hurt.  I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Love , love ,love****, better than the battery only .</li>
            <li> Works as described! Quality built!</li>
            <li> So much better then the Ped Egg.  Works great.  So glad I bought this item.  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic! Over time it pays for itself over going to the salon. I will keep this brief. Buy extra rollers from the get go, the extreme ones, because the effectiveness goes down quickly, after about 6 uses. Better to exfoliate weekly, then attempting to remove thicker callouses all at once. There were very few bad reviews, and my gamble paid off. I trusted all the good reviews. You wont be sorry on this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I have used for my feet to remove the callouses. It smooths the skin and doesn&#x27;t rub too hard or scrape my skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave any cuts or raw patches. This is easy to clean and use. I even got my husband to start using it and he loves it. Cleans up quickly and easily. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have smooth heels and feet, and also to those who have tender skin because it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not often you purchase something online without seeing it that you get exactly what was expected.  Well this Pedi is simply amazing!  I&#x27;ve used many foot buffers and never been happy with how they worked or how my feet feel.  In just one quick easy session my feet or soft and silky.  They  haven&#x27;t been this smooth since I can&#x27;t remember when!  I compared this product to similar items I&#x27;d seen in stores and they all felt cheap and most needed batteries.  It was more expensive, but you get what you pay for and I expect in the long run will pay for itself by not having to buy batteries or get pedicures!</li>
            <li> I saw this on QVC but I didn&#x27;t like QVC&#x27;s price so I ordered from amazon.  This works better than anything I have ever used.  I&#x27;m in bare feet quite a bit because I teach yoga classes and I&#x27;m on lots of different surfaces so my feet get rough at the heels.  This smooths then right out.</li>
            <li> Excellent product the battery powered Foot Buffer completely satisfied and it does what it claims to do have two smooth healthy&lt;br /&gt;feet  recommend unit to everybody</li>
            <li> I really like the Foot Buffer, helps w/ callouses.  However it said it came with 2 buffers &amp; I only received 1.  Wrote the company but got no response.  That was my only disappointment &amp; it was service not product related.</li>
            <li> Love love love this thing! No more expensive, and sometimes painful, manicures or pedicures. Confess it takes much longer to give yourself the quality manicure and pedicure you want the world to see, but the money you can save by spending your own time is wildly gratifying... to me! And no need to spend money on batteries... great! Works like a charm to do around all fingernails and both feet all over without any hurry on one full charge. Charge holds unused for at least three weeks in my experience... probably much longer. Go for it!</li>
            <li> Finally - something that keeps my feet soft and presentable! No more cutting myself with blades or working endlessly with pumice stones.&lt;br /&gt;If you have callused feet, I recommend trying this buffer.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what its suppose to do. It is great! I like the fact it came with an extra spool.</li>
            <li> Lost the first one I bought so I had to get another. It does the job effortlessly, only wish you could use it while charging.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  It has much more power than the earlier models.  I think the rechargeable unit was an improvement over the battery operated.</li>
            <li> I must need coarser rollers, because this takes way longer than I expected to smooth your feet.</li>
            <li> I havent gotten the chance to use this but my husband loves this</li>
            <li> you have to use cautiously,  especially at first til you become accustomed to how much skin it removes.  don&#x27;t try to do neglected feet all at once and use only on dry dry, not even moist feet.  love it! does a better job than my pedicurist.  stays charges for many many uses.</li>
            <li> I just received the order today and used it on my feet already!  I have tried so many of the store bought foot scrapers and nothing compares to this. Worth every penny. I can&#x27;t wait for summer to wear my sandals!!</li>
            <li> I am a soccer player and runner. I have constantly callus built up. I just canâ€™t keep up. I thought of the use of this product it gets better. I assume I just have too much callus and I am faster by hand. And when I put too much pressure on it, it does not do the job. I agree you have to make sure you have good brand batteries when using this item. Maybe when I use it every day for 30 Minutes it will work for me. But I do not have that time. So only once a week by hand till I find something that works for me.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has some rough spots on their feet. It made them soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> A friend had this product and loved it. This product does what I expected it to in an effective way. I took some hints from earlier reviews and do not push down to &amp;#34;do a better job&amp;#34;. The product is designed to work like a palm sander (!) and just needs to be placed on the skin and and rolled.</li>
            <li> While this worked, I really loved it. I spent the extra money to buy the rechargeable unit (compared to the battery operated unit).  After about 1 year and 9 months (of using it perhaps 5 times per month), it has stopped working. It will no longer accept a full charge, too weak to work correctly. I contacted this seller who suggested I contact Emjoi directly. When I called Emjoi, they said it was out of warranty and I was out of luck.  When I emailed them I received no reply.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.  I wish now I would have gotten the battery operated unit instead.  I&#x27;m disappointed that a company will not stand behind the quality of their product.  I feel they (either this seller or Emjoi) should have offered to replace this unit with a battery operated unit.</li>
            <li> I read reviews of many different models of this type of product.  I have been very happy with this product and even recommended this to my sister who tried mine and bought one.  I am amazed at the long battery life. I am very happy with the power and especially happy with the flexibility that no attached cord gives me.  The job it does on calluses is complete and painless.</li>
            <li> This product works and is much easier than manual buffing. I only wish it had a plug-in option instead of batteries. Also, I got two blue refills (which work great for getting rid of the rough part), but I noticed that I need to get the pink one (in order to achieve super smooth results). The manual says not to wash the refills, so I have been using the included brush after wetting it to clean my refill and then setting aside to air dry. Other reviews mentioned the need to change the refill after one use! I have used the same one for five times and it is still going strong. This buffer is easy to use, easy to clean, and works as promised. I am happy I got it!</li>
            <li> Since I became an adult, my heels have been... Well, there&#x27;s no words than: dragon-esque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many times I&#x27;ve sawed away with stones and paddles and wands and blah blah blah... In the back of my mind I kept thinking: &#x27;if only I could use that belt sander we learned about in shop class!!&#x27;  Or &#x27; is there a special attachment for the dremel my husband got me for Xmas!!!??&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS THE ANSWER!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let it do the work!!! Don&#x27;t force it.  If this thing can grind away my &#x27;long line of hearty farmer kin&#x27; harden heel skin... DAMN!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it (lightly) for 3 nights now, with the discs recommended for guys (yeah, i&#x27;m not afraid to TAKE ON my feet!!) and it&#x27;s amazing how soft and not frightening the heels of my feet are anymore.  Serious.  My heels don&#x27;t catch on my sheets anymore!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Damn.  It&#x27;s a measure of how impressed I am that I&#x27;ve taken the chance to comment thusly.</li>
            <li> My feet have never been smoother.  This will be great for the summer because I have a concrete deck around my pool and calluses end up drying out and cracking!  Ouch!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any downside to this item yet. This thing works great and it&#x27;s rechargeable.</li>
            <li> Great product bought for my wife and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. It really works for getting rid of dry dead skin and making your feet feel smooth.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it. AND  I must admit â€“ I tried it and it works great!! Removes dead skin and callouses with ease and sure does leave your feet silky smooth (new to me).  This cordless version has plenty of power and holds a charge remarkably long after many uses. In fact, we have only charged it once â€“ the initial charge (have used it 5-6 in the last 30 days, 2 people). We both find it very easy to use and able to reach all over our feet. I purchased spare rollers, 2 different grits (coarse and xtreme coarse). We each have our own rollers and swap them out when using (very easy to do). Wife uses the coarse rollers and I use the xtreme coarse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hate to know how much money I have spent over the years on pedicures.  After charging it overnight, we were about to walk out of the door for the day and I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it!  Oh My!  Within just a few minutes, I knew that I&#x27;m throwing away all those PedEggs and refills and files and pumice stones!  This baby is a KEEPER and I&#x27;m telling all my friends and family and you about it.  I can&#x27;t comment on how long the battery lasts because I&#x27;ve now used it a couple of times and it&#x27;s still going. When charging there&#x27;s a little red light but unfortunately there&#x27;s no way to know when it&#x27;s fully charged or if it needs charging. The rechargeable works anywhere and so well that I don&#x27;t know why anyone would want the corded model.  I quickly ordered refills and even some extreme course for my husband&#x27;s feet because there&#x27;s no way this is going back to Amazon.  It&#x27;s absolutely amazing how simple the technology is and how thoroughly it works. Very light pressure on DRY feet was all that&#x27;s needed to get my feet in better shape than they have been since I was a baby 68 years ago!  Lightly run the Emjoi over a callused area to take a little dead skin off and then rub your fingers over the area. Continue that way in till you get the desired results. Be sure to place a towel under your feet to catch all the dry skin. There will be a lot!  Update:  Since I bought this, 6 of my friends have bought the battery operated unit!  They, too, give this 5 stars and have NEVER gotten this kind of result from a nail salon.  BTW, I&#x27;m the youngest at 68 and the oldest is 83! Seven months later and I&#x27;m loving it even more.</li>
            <li> I love this buffer, I tested the Amope also.  The Amope is better for men or people with large feet.  This buffer is awesome, it is quick and efficient.</li>
            <li> I was tired of using a hand file to work on my dry feet during the winter, so I gave this a try!  I love it.  It is easy to use and does the job!</li>
            <li> I can not say how much I love this device.  So much so that this comment is for the one I ordered for my mother!  Yes, a second one for my mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is exactly as described and was timely delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I moved into our new home with wooden floors (which I have never had in my life), my heels dry out from the dehumidification needed to maintain the wood floors.  After years of struggling with Pumice, other devices, nail files, those sticks (like shoe horns) with sandpaper on one side and a zester on the other; this is the CURE.  My feet feel so good and IT SO EASY TO USE!  Much much easier than manually using those other devices.</li>
            <li> The micro pedi is a geat little product.  It does exactly what it says it will do...buff the bottom of your feet smooth.  I have tried many products (buffer stones for use in and out of bath, creams, various hand-held scrapers, even a different battery operated buffer)and none of them would do the trick.  One use of the Emjoi and all my prayers were answered!  My daughter came to visit and complained about her feet.  I grabbed the Emjoi, she tried it and was amazed at how well it worked.  I will be getting one for her upcoming birthday!  You won&#x27;t know what you&#x27;ve been missing until you try it.</li>
            <li> My mom got me this for my birthday last month.  I am in love!  It is the best gift!  With three kids and two jobs, it is nearly impossible for me to find the time to get a pedicure!  This is better than ANY pedicure I have ever gotten!  My feet are baby soft!  I could not recommend it more!  It is absolutely fabulous!  I use it every night on my feet and it is gentle enough that my kids like to use it, too!  Word of warning- it does make quite a mess.  Dry skin everywhere!</li>
            <li> I love this foot buffer!. I would recommend anyone who gets one of these little babies to go with the rechargeable over the battery-operated. The rechargeable stays powerful and I can keep the power strong by using the cord on it at the same time. My heels are very dry and crack easily. This helps buff those rough areas easily and makes my feet smoother all over. Love it!</li>
            <li> My sister has one and while in florida I brought one.  I am a diabetic and it was a wilcome surprise to remove all the dead skin!</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this based on other Emjoi products. Sadly, this one fell way short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some background: I have super dry feet. It doesn&#x27;t matter how much lotion I use, they&#x27;re always dry and sometimes cracked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this up hoping it would be a quicker solution to pumicing my feet after the shower. Unfortunately, this just doesn&#x27;t have the juice needed to really get the dry skin off. It&#x27;s great for in-between touch ups, but it definitely can&#x27;t replace good old fashioned elbow grease. I&#x27;m keeping it because it&#x27;s not horrible. I just wish it had more strength.</li>
            <li> This item is awesome! No more filing, or cutting myself. This easy rechargeable buffer is the absolute best buy I&#x27;ve made in a longtime.i recommend this product to all who suffer from callouses on their feet. It&#x27;s like magic. So cool and painless now!</li>
            <li> Wow!  Purchase this product!  Best thing ever coming down the pike for feet!  I am so impressed with this.  You will not have a single regret.</li>
