            <li>Excellent item.</li>
            <li>Works great as a soap dish and it is attractive too.</li>
            <li>You do have to keep from dripping water all over them, but otherwise great (and that keeps them clean-looking).</li>
            <li>Great price, great product.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s an attractive design.</li>
            <li>Attractive.  </li>

            <li>Looks and works great in our shower.</li>
            <li>Very nice.  </li>
            <li>Also it looks great :) Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Durability seems good, no bleeding, warping, cracking ...</li>
            <li>Holds soap exceptionally well.  </li>
            <li>and they all are beautiful, functional, and easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this soap dish!</li>
            <li>This is a fairly large cradle for soap....but very attractive and does a nice job of cradling a full-size bar of soap.</li>
            <li>and it looks nice in my kitchen , but</li>
            <li>This is a gorgeous and classy soap dish that works great for keeping the soap from sitting in water.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ordering 3 more.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite items off Amazon.</li>
            <li>Looks to be made with love.  </li>
            <li>If you like beechwood soap holders, dare I say there isn&#x27;t a better one anywhere.</li>
            <li>Most soap dishes leave the soap in a pool of water, but this looked like the water could drain off the bar,  </li>
            <li>Most soap dishes are butt-ugly, but this one seemed to have PANACHE.  </li>
            <li>These are an elegant addition to our bathroom counters.</li>
            <li>Love the wood and the grooves in this soap dish.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more soon.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how much I liked it!</li>
            <li>Very stylish - better for a medium to regular sized bar of soap.  </li>
            <li>I still have to clean up some soap grime, but it reduced it quite a bit.</li>
            <li>It is a tad on the large size and is taller than what I would ideally like, but those are very minor for me.</li>
            <li>soap drys out quickly.</li>
            <li>do I think it was worth $13?</li>
            <li>Fits nicely in the cut out soap box in our shower, and the soap stays dry and not mushy.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous and holds extra large bars (it is quite big).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;We have proofed it against staining from the water with a treatment of walnut oil + beeswax, and it makes our sink look better as well as keeping the bar dry.</li>
            <li>This is a very chunky soap dish...</li>
            <li>Very well made...sits level on surfaces...</li>
            <li>It is very practical, soap doesn&#x27;t collect on it, it is sturdy and aesthetically pleasing.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it and will likely buy more when we move into a larger home.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>but I was surprised how large it is.  </li>
            <li>This soap dish easily dries out the soap, unlike other soap dishes where they sit in a pool of water.</li>
            <li>The color in real life isn&#x27;t as rich or dark ad</li>
            <li>and it still looks new.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s big enough for me to put a few different soaps on and it has great drainage.</li>
            <li>I wanted something with a natural look that wouldn&#x27;t retain water and make my bar of soap soggy.</li>
            <li>this comes in a light wood which is different than the picture which shows dark.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m writing this because I have finally moved into a new place</li>
            <li>I liked the simplistic wood design</li>

            <li> I liked the simplistic wood design</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few weeks now and the wood retains the same color and texture as when I first got it, despite being used in the shower and getting wet daily.</li>
            <li> Unfortunatly I am returning it since it was wobbly and didn&#x27;t sit properly on a flat surface.</li>
            <li> When we camped out in our new house out of suitcases, my bar of soap and this little bugger came with.</li>
            <li> but as far as keeping soap dry and bars in usable condition instead of a spongy mess its 5 star winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s neat and different from other types.</li>
            <li> Sounds silly in hindsight, but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> It looks the same as the day it came and gets sprayed at least a couple several times a day.</li>
            <li> Not really.</li>
            <li> its not perfect (we still have a little bit of soap residue that rolls off the curves to clean up)...</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t waste it.  </li>
            <li> I usually do my homework on the size of items I order online</li>
            <li> Our kitchen sink bar of Ivory soap always got soggy and sloppy, and we wanted a way to set it down where it would drain.  </li>
            <li> so i had to keep outside to let the fumes off gas.. disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use bar soap on my face when I shower but was sick of cleaning up the grimy mess that bar soap leaves.</li>
            <li> Looks expensive!</li>
            <li> so I was disappointed.</li>

            <li> Gorgeous and holds extra large bars (it is quite big).  I&#x27;ve had it in the shower several months now and it still looks new. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it and will likely buy more when we move into a larger home.  [Edit] I&#x27;ve now had it about a year and it has held up perfectly. It looks the same as the day it came and gets sprayed at least a couple several times a day. I&#x27;m writing this because I have finally moved into a new place and I&#x27;m ordering 3 more.  This is one of my favorite items off Amazon. I hope the quality is still up to snuff. When we camped out in our new house out of suitcases, my bar of soap and this little bugger came with.

            <li> this comes in a light wood which is different than the picture which shows dark. it also has a shiny shellac surface so i had to keep outside to let the fumes off gas.. disappointed.</li>

            <li> Excellent item. It is very practical, soap doesn&#x27;t collect on it, it is sturdy and aesthetically pleasing.</li>

            <li> I bought this as a decorative item to hold the soap. It&#x27;s neat and different from other types. I liked the simplistic wood design</li>
            <li> Purchased six of these for the home and they all are beautiful, functional, and easy to maintain.  Just need to rinse the soap off.</li>
