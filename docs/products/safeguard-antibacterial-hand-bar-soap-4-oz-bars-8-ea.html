            <li>I have been using this product for many many years.</li>
            <li>Great to see it at such a good price.</li>

            <li>The name says it all Safe  </li>
            <li>I figured I was paying a couple of dollars more because of fees and shipping, but</li>
            <li>for the product itself, though, it is OK.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s probably because I got used to the overwhelming smell.  </li>
            <li>Will order more when I run out.</li>
            <li>I grew up using this stuff, and for whatever reason, my skin responds best to this type of soap for daily use.</li>
            <li>Its kind of fun to rub it all over and then slide on the linoleum too</li>
            <li>If you absolutely can&#x27;t get it, then I guess getting it here is a good alternative.</li>
            <li>the smell is not as strong.  </li>
            <li>This is a great buy, especially the price.</li>
            <li>Great for those with medical issues.  </li>
            <li>Great smell, antibacterial, very simple.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time and securely packaged.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have it delievered to your door at a nice low price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but it is extremely strong.  </li>
            <li>Smells clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>It just smells clean.</li>
            <li>This soap makes me feel clean</li>
            <li>One feels clean after using this soap.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re clean.  </li>
            <li>nice clean masculine scent</li>
            <li>This is a true man&#x27;s scented soap.</li>
            <li>White or beige good soap.</li>
            <li>Safe guard is a very established brand.</li>
            <li>$8 more is just way too much.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d order it from amazon again as long as the price remains good.</li>
            <li>I have been using this soap for going-on 35 years - works great - you feel and stay feeling fresh all day - getting hard to find at local stores - glad to find a source on the web!!</li>
            <li>This package makes a good product reasonably priced, and it is the only soap my wife will use in the shower.</li>
            <li>Since other reviewers said the price was good, I purchased it on here.  </li>
            <li>the size and price of this is just right.</li>
            <li>It is nice to have a product that has been consistently the same for over 30 years.</li>
            <li>These bars are very large in size.  </li>
            <li>My husband was using a minty soap when we married.</li>
            <li>The first time I went searching for it I couldn&#x27;t find it.  </li>
            <li>we have purchased several times and love the product</li>
            <li>Smells good, prices is right, and enough bars to last you for quite a while.  </li>
            <li>Love the soap, it is the only soap my husband wants to use.</li>
            <li>so I purchased this on Amazon thinking that it was a good price and hard to find.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>or if it really works.  </li>
            <li>Being a slight germaphobe it amazed me that most shower and hand soaps are not antibacterial.  </li>
            <li>aside from Irish Spring, this is probably on my second favorite list of soaps all time.</li>
            <li>but the price is high.  </li>
            <li>Other reviewers have mentioned how strong the smell of the bars are</li>
            <li>Great product, can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li>Just like my old grandmas bathroom!</li>
            <li>This is the same exact soap I have used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After this soap has been in the shower a few days the scent isn&#x27;t very strong so it was a big</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s price was a little better than the last I bought at a retailer.</li>
            <li>I like the deodorant quality of this soap, and it makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>This is for my 94 year old Aunt.  </li>
            <li>As long as it remains the same they don&#x27;t have to worry about having a loyal customer.</li>
            <li>So, being able to purchase it on Amazon is great, but definitely check your local store before paying the outrageous price on here!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Safeguard Beige as far back as I can remember.</li>
            <li>Our store sells this exact item for less than $5.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> People are right in the fact that it can be hard to find especially if you are limited on stores.  </li>
            <li> Given lack of availability of this product in my area, there&#x27;s not much option.</li>
            <li> what a marvel, get this stuff wet and smoosh it all over your skin and WHAMMO!  </li>
            <li> I was misled by other reviewers</li>
            <li> There are other alternatives on the market</li>
            <li> Yes other soaps are cheaper.</li>
            <li> I had been using Irish Spring anti-bacterial soap because it is so ubiquitous and easy to get, but I hated the  over powering smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Safeguard is hard to find in &#x27;bulk\\&quot; packs locally and usually sells here for almost $1 a bar when you can find it.  </li>
            <li> and once you use the bar a little</li>
            <li> and I can tell after a few days of use.</li>
            <li> No rash, no residue, no strong smells.</li>
            <li> is sometimes hard to find.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting hard to find in retail stores now.</li>
            <li> I have small hands and it was very hard for me to hold on to this soap in the shower.  </li>
            <li> No need for ridiculous shower body gel cream lather stuff.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> Only buy it from the \\&quot;Real\\&quot; Amazon, not their surrogate company that charges an outrageous $6 shipping - negating any saving!</li>
            <li> the price ended up being absolutely outrageous when compared to a local store!  </li>
            <li> do not understand why so difficult to find at stores!</li>
            <li> My daughter get this random itchy spots  and this works well to wash away the cooties!</li>
            <li> but I was shocked that I could smell it as soon as I opened the front door to pick up the box.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered this soap thinking that it was the same Safeguard soap I have used since 1968, but this soap was completely different.  These bars are very large in size.  I have small hands and it was very hard for me to hold on to this soap in the shower.  I am going to try to give the rest of the bars away as I can not use them...</li>
            <li> Just like my old grandmas bathroom! Smells clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> Just as described. Thank you. Great shipping A++++</li>
            <li> Only soap I use....love that prime!</li>
            <li> great!  do not understand why so difficult to find at stores!</li>
            <li> great stuff , great price, these were in my mailbox so fast I could not believe it!!</li>
            <li> Excellent bar soap.  have used it for years.</li>
            <li> This is a great buy, especially the price. My daughter get this random itchy spots  and this works well to wash away the cooties!</li>
            <li> It is nice to have a product that has been consistently the same for over 30 years. My husband was using a minty soap when we married. Since he also wore an expensive cologne it was ok on him. I sure didn&#x27;t want to smell like that! When they changed the formula on him he eventually started using mine. It just smells clean. It isn&#x27;t overpowering so my perfume smells great. I don&#x27;t like the white and the beige is sometimes hard to find. When I do I try to &amp;#34;stock up&amp;#34;  By using a soap dish there is no problem with it staining the shower. As long as it remains the same they don&#x27;t have to worry about having a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> Great for those with medical issues.  This soap makes me feel clean and I use a liquid soap afterwards. This is a no scent soap.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many many years. This is a true man&#x27;s scented soap. Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Smells good, prices is right, and enough bars to last you for quite a while.  This is perfect for your sink side bar of soap, and it&#x27;s a tried and true brand from years ago!  Great to see it at such a good price.</li>
            <li> Have used Safeguard soap for years.  Love the antibacterial properties and it has a nice scent.  It is very hard to find in stores.  None of the so called big box store carry it ant longer.  Mostly some drugstore and grocery store carry it but the price is high.  It&#x27;s nice to have it delievered to your door at a nice low price.</li>
            <li> I like this soap. Great smell, antibacterial, very simple. No need for ridiculous shower body gel cream lather stuff. One feels clean after using this soap.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why the stores around here stopped carrying Safeguard. I like the nice light scent that doesn&#x27;t make me smell like I just came out of a perfume factory.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for longer than I can remember. White or beige good soap. No rash, no residue, no strong smells. Good soap.</li>
            <li> Safe guard is a very established brand.I&#x27;ve used it four years, and the price seems to be a very good one. I&#x27;d order it from amazon again as long as the price remains good.</li>
            <li> Awesome !.. I have used this soap for many years and it works great.</li>
            <li> the size and price of this is just right. aside from Irish Spring, this is probably on my second favorite list of soaps all time.</li>
            <li> Love the soap, it is the only soap my husband wants to use.</li>
            <li> nice clean masculine scent</li>
            <li> Great soap.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and love it.  I like the deodorant quality of this soap, and it makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> One of the best soaps on the market</li>
            <li> i like this product and your services was excelent</li>
            <li> My spouse and I love this soap.  It arrived on time and securely packaged.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for going-on 35 years - works great - you feel and stay feeling fresh all day - getting hard to find at local stores - glad to find a source on the web!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Safeguard Beige as far back as I can remember. It&#x27;s getting hard to find in retail stores now. This is the same exact soap I have used. It&#x27;s price was a little better than the last I bought at a retailer. Great product, can&#x27;t go wrong. I would buy this again and from this seller</li>
            <li> The name says it all Safe  Guard it is that indeed!  A great cleansed feeling and a true honest clean</li>
            <li> what a marvel, get this stuff wet and smoosh it all over your skin and WHAMMO!  you&#x27;re clean.  Its kind of fun to rub it all over and then slide on the linoleum too but I am told that is a no no.&lt;br /&gt;OH and BONUS.  it gets rid of that funky smell too.  WHO KNEW</li>
            <li> Safeguard is hard to find in &#x27;bulk\\&quot; packs locally and usually sells here for almost $1 a bar when you can find it.  This package makes a good product reasonably priced, and it is the only soap my wife will use in the shower. CAUTION: Only buy it from the \\&quot;Real\\&quot; Amazon, not their surrogate company that charges an outrageous $6 shipping - negating any saving!</li>
            <li> This is for my 94 year old Aunt.  This is the brand she likes.</li>
            <li> I was misled by other reviewers so I purchased this on Amazon thinking that it was a good price and hard to find.  People are right in the fact that it can be hard to find especially if you are limited on stores.  Our local stores don&#x27;t stock everything regularly and this soap is no exception.  The first time I went searching for it I couldn&#x27;t find it.  Since other reviewers said the price was good, I purchased it on here.  HOWEVER... the price ended up being absolutely outrageous when compared to a local store!  Our store sells this exact item for less than $5.  I think I paid about $13 to have it shipped to me.  I figured I was paying a couple of dollars more because of fees and shipping, but $8 more is just way too much.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t opened the package so I could have returned it.  It ended up in stock at the local store the next time I was in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, though, it is OK.  There are other alternatives on the market and I actually prefer Safeguard now... but it&#x27;s probably because I got used to the overwhelming smell.  Other reviewers have mentioned how strong the smell of the bars are but I was shocked that I could smell it as soon as I opened the front door to pick up the box.  It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but it is extremely strong.  After the bars sat in my bathroom for a while it mellowed out a lot and once you use the bar a little the smell is not as strong.  I also have not seen any stains which someone else also mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say that I honestly feel cleaner after using this bar soap.  However, I can&#x27;t tell you if it is just because I have been told it will help with keeping me cleaner or if it really works.  Being a slight germaphobe it amazed me that most shower and hand soaps are not antibacterial.  I remember the news a while back talking about the need to remove soaps that are antibacterial because the germs were building up a tolerance, but I guess I didn&#x27;t realize that companies just about removed all of them from their shelves.  I like having an option.  So, being able to purchase it on Amazon is great, but definitely check your local store before paying the outrageous price on here!  If you absolutely can&#x27;t get it, then I guess getting it here is a good alternative.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and have always loved the soap.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my doctor. Will order more when I run out. Good soap!</li>
            <li> As advertised and timely delivery.</li>
            <li> we have always liked this this soap, and we have used it for years.  we prefer it over the aloe type which tends to be slimy and leaves a residue on the body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using safeguards for 10 years!</li>
            <li> Given lack of availability of this product in my area, there&#x27;s not much option. Yes other soaps are cheaper. I grew up using this stuff, and for whatever reason, my skin responds best to this type of soap for daily use. Even though there&#x27;s the white version, it isn&#x27;t the same and I can tell after a few days of use.</li>
            <li> Excellent product at a great value!</li>
            <li> I had been using Irish Spring anti-bacterial soap because it is so ubiquitous and easy to get, but I hated the  over powering smell.&lt;br /&gt;After this soap has been in the shower a few days the scent isn&#x27;t very strong so it was a big improvement.&lt;br /&gt;The bonus that surprised me was that it goes and goes, it lasts longer than any other soap I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Always happy to buy this product from your site...we have purchased several times and love the product</li>
