            <li>The price is good for what you get.  </li>

            <li>The lighting and magnification of the mirror are really good.  </li>
            <li>I have used this mirrow for 3 years and my daughter loved it</li>

            <li>A 10x mirror with great light, nice satin nickel finish, no plastic, no batteries or replacement bulb needed.  </li>
            <li>Great light and mirror to help the challenges you face as you age.  </li>
            <li>Then I went to a hotel and they had a nice one.....</li>
            <li>Also, Iâ€™ve owned two make up mirrors before this one and liked them both.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously, it is a nice mirror</li>
            <li>Nice on-off switch on the cord.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the look of this mirror from the beginning.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best for the price highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Says the finish is beautiful, the light is super bright, and the mirror shows EVERYTHING...</li>
            <li>Its large enought, brite enought and very good for close up.</li>
            <li>good magnification, good light, easy to use.</li>
            <li>The light is extremely bright and you can see EVERYTHING with the magnification.</li>
            <li>most amazing thing ever.</li>
            <li>amount of light and the size of the mirror are good, however.  </li>
            <li>The magnification is excellent, so long as you stay really close to the mirror, but for close make up and eye brow plucking etc, it is perfect.  </li>
            <li>I feel more confident when I leave the house knowing</li>
            <li>I wanted a fluorescent mirror because it simulates sunlight and therefore will help you apply your makeup better</li>
            <li>I had to start looking for a better quality mirror....</li>
            <li>I love it and you will too.</li>
            <li>So glad I can see things before others do when I leave the house.</li>
            <li>It is also lit, making it even better.</li>
            <li>Bought this one to replace one I had for many years.</li>
            <li>I am now able to see much better to put my makeup on.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite mirror of all of the 10x magnifying mirrors.</li>
            <li>Most standing vanity mirrors have the hinges on the sides and you flip the mirror.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE that I can see the tiniest details with it</li>
            <li>and I have enjoyed using it</li>
            <li>This mirror would be appealing for ANY vanity.</li>
            <li>I am really satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>thanks to amazon prime :o)  </li>
            <li>Happy with this new mirror.</li>
            <li>The mirror is very good but the stand is quite short.</li>
            <li>On top of that, Conair is still selling this mirror knowing that they won&#x27;t sell you the light bulb for it.</li>
            <li>However, the brightness was the most important thing and this one fills the bill.</li>
            <li>The 10x is good for me but might be too much for some</li>
            <li>The mirror has no flaws and let&#x27;s me correct mine easily.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t easy to find</li>
            <li>Makes putting on makeup so easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to put together.</li>
            <li>The mirror easily spins around so you can see either side.</li>
            <li>I just replaced my bulb and the mirror is working just fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d think that every light bulb will need replacement at some point</li>
            <li>I have glaucoma and needed a lot of light and magnification.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this item for myself and thought it was a great choice after researching same, however, upon receipt the item lite up for a couple of minutes</li>
            <li>It is extremely clear and bright.  </li>
            <li>No replacement bulb available.</li>
            <li>The mirror is smaller than I thought and the lighting isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>It is fabulous..</li>
            <li>Mom asked for a light up mirror for her birthday...</li>
            <li>This mirror has a fluorescent light which give ample illumination.  </li>
            <li>very powerful magnification and lighting works well too.  </li>
            <li>The original bulb has a zip tie on it to keep it secure.  </li>
            <li>The satin nickel finish is stylish and pretty to enhance your vanity in case you want to leave it out.</li>
            <li>The light is bright and WHITE!!</li>
            <li>I also like that the light never gets very hot</li>
            <li>I have to place it on books to get it to be the right height!</li>
            <li>I was completely happy with the mirror --- outstanding lightin, mirror is far more magnified than any other I researched at this reasonalbe price....</li>
            <li>I have looked and looked, but apparently companies no longer make a lighted mirror with a warm light effect.</li>
            <li>and it is completely true.  </li>
            <li>The light was very dim and you needed to add additional lighting in order to be able to put your make-up on.  </li>
            <li>This product worked great until the bulb burned out after less than a year.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little mirror that does it all.  </li>
            <li>The regular side shows a natural version of myself in good light.</li>
            <li>Make sure you cut the zip tie off before you attempt to remove the old bulb.</li>
            <li>Solid construction, looks nice.  </li>
            <li>and you can easily lose track of time getting to areas of your face you normally overlook.  </li>
            <li>and it was fairly inexpensive compared to some of the other ones.  </li>
            <li>The height is just right</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had an older light up mirror for quite a while.  </li>
            <li>Apparently this is a problem with most of the make-up mirrors on the market</li>
            <li>It had apparently been returned and not checked to see if OK.  </li>
            <li>Guess I&#x27;m just a sucker, but the mirror is exceptiona compared to what else is available for the price, so I feel good about it.  </li>
            <li>This mirror does exactly what I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li>replaced an 8x similar product and this is much better and works as advertised</li>
            <li>I received my package in the mail so fast!</li>
            <li>This replaces one that I had and actually prefer over this one as could swivel to each side and turn to more angles to stand or sit when applying my makeup.</li>
            <li>At first she didn&#x27;t like it because it was \\&quot;too thick\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>But after a couple of days, she absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>First of all, the mirror does tilt.  </li>
            <li>I am able to see problems that are undetectable with the naked eye</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for a better application of their makeup with proper lighting.</li>
            <li>Loved every feature if this mirror, great magnification, very stable base and super lighting.  </li>
            <li>Most stores only carry 5X, so this was  a real find.  </li>
            <li>General 45011 - FC12T4/865/LG Circular T4 Fluorescent Tube Light Bulb...</li>
            <li>Apparently Conair thinks the bulb will never need replacement so they don&#x27;t even make them available for sale.</li>
            <li>I need 10X), one used incandescent light bulbs which got pretty hot, and the mirror on the last one was very distorted.  </li>
            <li>The mirror and light are very good, but you can&#x27;t see your face unless you are very short, sit down, or hold the whole mirror us with your other hand.  </li>
            <li>The one downside is you can not move it on its axle forward and backwards as much as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>really couldn&#x27;t see myself.  </li>
            <li>However, the magnifying side is very helpful when putting on shadow, eye liner and mascara.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading</li>
            <li>For me the 10X magnification is just too much.  </li>
            <li>It features about 60 degrees angle tilt, I would prefer 45, hence the 4 star instead of 5, but do I really need to look at the underside of my neck?  </li>
            <li>I tried to put the mirror on a stand to elevate it but unless it is at face height it doesnâ€™t help that much.</li>
            <li>Much cooler operation.  </li>
            <li>Some things that I didn&#x27;t like:  The fluorescent light color is very white (expected)and takes getting used to.  </li>
            <li>but I found it to be too much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sleek and modern looking.  </li>
            <li>The light is a soft light, not stark white.  </li>
            <li>Despite  my 65 year old eyes, I walk out the door looking a lot more &amp;#34;polished&amp;#34; than I did prior to owning this mirror.</li>
            <li>MUCH, brighter than many other mirrors I have tested out there.  </li>
            <li>Here are the positives:  The fluorescent lamp is a nice feature and should last a long time.  </li>
            <li>Since this mirror has no hinges, instead the mirror tilts back and forth if you move it by holding the top of the mirror and gently pushing back or pulling forward.  </li>
            <li>so I find I have to lean down to it, but that is ok with me, but it kept me from giving it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>Shortly thereafter, I contacted the dealer directly to purchase a replacement bulb -- yet I was told the bulb was no longer available.  </li>
            <li>It is of high quality and workmanship.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The mirror head is not pivoted on the left and right</li>
            <li>Because the mirror doesn&#x27;t pivot on the left and right, the mirror head is designed to \\&quot;lean back\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>So, its a good mirror for use on a vanity but not good if you really need a model that will tilt back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m upset because I paid $50 for this mirror and it looks like I&#x27;ll just have to buy a completely new mirror since this bulb can&#x27;t be replaced.</li>
            <li>so I guess you just have to plan on getting a new one every two years or so.</li>
            <li>Buying a new one now but it won&#x27;t be a Conair.</li>
            <li>The 10X mirror is very clear and the fluorescent lights keep it from getting overheated.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t like that I have to twist the mirror around to see the other side, as opposed to being able to flip back and forth.  </li>
            <li>I am a light user and I have had my mirror for less than a year.</li>
            <li>The worst thing about this mirror was that the light was way too dim for my use: 60 years old and need bright light, as well as the 10x magnification.  </li>
            <li>The mirror is at a fixed height - and there&#x27;s not a tilt feature that you can use so that you can adjust the mirror to see your face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely unusable as a vanity mirror.  </li>
            <li>After the initial shock of seeing every wrinkle and blemish on my face, I found that I could indeed still put on my eye make-up when needed and greatly appreciated that ability.  </li>
            <li>But this one tilts upward, and her old one didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>so I gave to my 15 year old granddaughter.</li>
            <li>the completely swivels like my old ones did.</li>
            <li>The mirror does not tilt back much at all</li>
            <li>so you must turn the whole mirror head around when switching from flat to magnifying.  </li>
            <li>I believe there was a short in the switch; returned the item without a problem and ordered a different mirror that also lights up and has a higher magnification.  </li>
            <li>If you really need to, you simply moving your head back a bit, no biggie.  </li>
            <li>However, the mirror itself barely adjusts, so I had to stand at an angle to put on my makeup.  </li>
            <li>I shopped around to other &amp;#34;bed/bath&amp;#34; shops and what was available was poor quality and high priced.</li>
            <li>in other words, throw it away and buy a new one.  </li>

            <li> Purchased this item for myself and thought it was a great choice after researching same, however, upon receipt the item lite up for a couple of minutes</li>
            <li> It is extremely clear and bright.  </li>
            <li> No replacement bulb available.</li>
            <li> The mirror is smaller than I thought and the lighting isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> It is fabulous..</li>
            <li> Mom asked for a light up mirror for her birthday...</li>
            <li> This mirror has a fluorescent light which give ample illumination.  </li>
            <li> very powerful magnification and lighting works well too.  </li>
            <li> The original bulb has a zip tie on it to keep it secure.  </li>
            <li> The satin nickel finish is stylish and pretty to enhance your vanity in case you want to leave it out.</li>
            <li> The light is bright and WHITE!!</li>
            <li> I also like that the light never gets very hot</li>
            <li> I have to place it on books to get it to be the right height!</li>
            <li> I was completely happy with the mirror --- outstanding lightin, mirror is far more magnified than any other I researched at this reasonalbe price....</li>
            <li> I have looked and looked, but apparently companies no longer make a lighted mirror with a warm light effect.</li>
            <li> and it is completely true.  </li>
            <li> The light was very dim and you needed to add additional lighting in order to be able to put your make-up on.  </li>
            <li> This product worked great until the bulb burned out after less than a year.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little mirror that does it all.  </li>
            <li> The regular side shows a natural version of myself in good light.</li>
            <li> Make sure you cut the zip tie off before you attempt to remove the old bulb.</li>
            <li> Solid construction, looks nice.  </li>
            <li> and you can easily lose track of time getting to areas of your face you normally overlook.  </li>
            <li> and it was fairly inexpensive compared to some of the other ones.  </li>
            <li> The height is just right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an older light up mirror for quite a while.  </li>
            <li> Apparently this is a problem with most of the make-up mirrors on the market</li>
            <li> It had apparently been returned and not checked to see if OK.  </li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;m just a sucker, but the mirror is exceptiona compared to what else is available for the price, so I feel good about it.  </li>
            <li> This mirror does exactly what I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li> replaced an 8x similar product and this is much better and works as advertised</li>
            <li> I received my package in the mail so fast!</li>
            <li> This replaces one that I had and actually prefer over this one as could swivel to each side and turn to more angles to stand or sit when applying my makeup.</li>
            <li> At first she didn&#x27;t like it because it was \\&quot;too thick\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> But after a couple of days, she absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li> First of all, the mirror does tilt.  </li>
            <li> I am able to see problems that are undetectable with the naked eye</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone looking for a better application of their makeup with proper lighting.</li>
            <li> Loved every feature if this mirror, great magnification, very stable base and super lighting.  </li>
            <li> Most stores only carry 5X, so this was  a real find.  </li>
            <li> General 45011 - FC12T4/865/LG Circular T4 Fluorescent Tube Light Bulb...</li>
            <li> Apparently Conair thinks the bulb will never need replacement so they don&#x27;t even make them available for sale.</li>
            <li> I need 10X), one used incandescent light bulbs which got pretty hot, and the mirror on the last one was very distorted.  </li>
            <li> The mirror and light are very good, but you can&#x27;t see your face unless you are very short, sit down, or hold the whole mirror us with your other hand.  </li>
            <li> The one downside is you can not move it on its axle forward and backwards as much as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> really couldn&#x27;t see myself.  </li>
            <li> However, the magnifying side is very helpful when putting on shadow, eye liner and mascara.</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading</li>
            <li> For me the 10X magnification is just too much.  </li>
            <li> It features about 60 degrees angle tilt, I would prefer 45, hence the 4 star instead of 5, but do I really need to look at the underside of my neck?  </li>
            <li> I tried to put the mirror on a stand to elevate it but unless it is at face height it doesnâ€™t help that much.</li>
            <li> Much cooler operation.  </li>
            <li> Some things that I didn&#x27;t like:  The fluorescent light color is very white (expected)and takes getting used to.  </li>
            <li> but I found it to be too much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sleek and modern looking.  </li>
            <li> The light is a soft light, not stark white.  </li>
            <li> Despite  my 65 year old eyes, I walk out the door looking a lot more &amp;#34;polished&amp;#34; than I did prior to owning this mirror.</li>
            <li> MUCH, brighter than many other mirrors I have tested out there.  </li>
            <li> Here are the positives:  The fluorescent lamp is a nice feature and should last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Since this mirror has no hinges, instead the mirror tilts back and forth if you move it by holding the top of the mirror and gently pushing back or pulling forward.  </li>
            <li> so I find I have to lean down to it, but that is ok with me, but it kept me from giving it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> Shortly thereafter, I contacted the dealer directly to purchase a replacement bulb -- yet I was told the bulb was no longer available.  </li>
            <li> It is of high quality and workmanship.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The mirror head is not pivoted on the left and right</li>
            <li> Because the mirror doesn&#x27;t pivot on the left and right, the mirror head is designed to \\&quot;lean back\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> So, its a good mirror for use on a vanity but not good if you really need a model that will tilt back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m upset because I paid $50 for this mirror and it looks like I&#x27;ll just have to buy a completely new mirror since this bulb can&#x27;t be replaced.</li>
            <li> so I guess you just have to plan on getting a new one every two years or so.</li>
            <li> Buying a new one now but it won&#x27;t be a Conair.</li>
            <li> The 10X mirror is very clear and the fluorescent lights keep it from getting overheated.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like that I have to twist the mirror around to see the other side, as opposed to being able to flip back and forth.  </li>
            <li> I am a light user and I have had my mirror for less than a year.</li>
            <li> The worst thing about this mirror was that the light was way too dim for my use: 60 years old and need bright light, as well as the 10x magnification.  </li>
            <li> The mirror is at a fixed height - and there&#x27;s not a tilt feature that you can use so that you can adjust the mirror to see your face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely unusable as a vanity mirror.  </li>
            <li> After the initial shock of seeing every wrinkle and blemish on my face, I found that I could indeed still put on my eye make-up when needed and greatly appreciated that ability.  </li>
            <li> But this one tilts upward, and her old one didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> so I gave to my 15 year old granddaughter.</li>
            <li> the completely swivels like my old ones did.</li>
            <li> The mirror does not tilt back much at all</li>
            <li> so you must turn the whole mirror head around when switching from flat to magnifying.  </li>
            <li> I believe there was a short in the switch; returned the item without a problem and ordered a different mirror that also lights up and has a higher magnification.  </li>
            <li> If you really need to, you simply moving your head back a bit, no biggie.  </li>
            <li> However, the mirror itself barely adjusts, so I had to stand at an angle to put on my makeup.  </li>
            <li> I shopped around to other &amp;#34;bed/bath&amp;#34; shops and what was available was poor quality and high priced.</li>
            <li> in other words, throw it away and buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> The mirror in fact does tilt easily (very confused by other review that said it doesn&#x27;t do this) and obviously it also turns so you can change easily from the magnified side to the normal view.</li>
            <li> My objectives were increased brightness, cooler operation and both a flat and magnifying mirror as before.  </li>
            <li> So this means that if you used the mirror for one hour every single day it would last over 27 years.</li>
            <li> I actually bought three other mirrors prior to purchasing the Conair and returned them because one was 7X magnification (which didnâ€™t work for me â€“</li>
            <li> Much brighter than other Conair mirrors that only have two small incandescent bulbs.   </li>
            <li> It is two sided, with magnification on one side and a regular mirror on the other.  </li>
            <li> The magnification side of the mirror is to strong for my taste as you need to be so close that most make up brushes are to long to use and they constantly bang into the mirror causing mistakes, but the big disappointment is after six months the bulb burned out and I along with other people here have found it impossible to find a replacement bulb requiring the purchase of another mirror.  </li>
            <li> She had a similar one but it developed a \\&quot;short\\&quot; in the cord, and it was not as thick.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first because it has an energy saving bulb, but believe me, this sucker does not skimp out on the light.  </li>
            <li> The only way to use it in the place intended for it is to squat down and look into the mirror.  </li>
            <li> My bulb lasted a little less than three years, but I was still annoyed to have to just toss the whole mirror and buy a new one.</li>
            <li> This seemed crazy to me, since they continued to sell the exact SAME PRODUCT WITH THE SAME PRODUCT #</li>
            <li> &quot; Little did he know I found some tiny hairs (embarrassing, but it happens) that I had never noticed before and removed them!  </li>
            <li> The cord is also clear, so that helps conceal the cord or at least look nicer.</li>
            <li> But beware - the mirror tilts up only a few degrees</li>
            <li> Alas, after much research, you can find the bulb here on Amazon for around $16...</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time but was just jammed in the box.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t lean back far enough so doing close up \\&quot;face maintenance\\</li>
            <li> Heavy enough so it doesn&#x27;t topple over.</li>
            <li> The reason I bought this was the poor lighting in my bathroom, which is a soft yellow</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t missed anything that other people might notice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the brightest due to the flourescent bulb.</li>
            <li> Compering to other like it</li>
            <li> and I would walk outside thinking my makeup looked fine only to realize I looked horrible.  </li>
            <li> When I placed the mirror on my vanity - and sat down in front of it, the mirror was at chest level.</li>
            <li> so you must use it sitting down at a vanity.  </li>
            <li> This is a problem since the mirror is set on the bathroom countertop and I have to bend down to look into it.</li>
            <li> The first mirror I received was broken - so it seems a little delicate.</li>
            <li> I prefer 10x to anything less.  </li>
            <li> Faced with buying a &#x27;mediocre&#x27; mirror for less money, I went ahead purchased a new one of these mirrors.  </li>
            <li> The mirror does tilt, but not significantly</li>
            <li> The light quality is very cold and unflattering.</li>
            <li> and it hasnt let me down yet!</li>
            <li> Bought this mirror to replace a broken, earlier version.</li>
            <li> However, as some other reviewers have mentioned, it doesnâ€™t tilt very much- hardly at all on the 10X side.</li>
            <li> but the inability for the manufacturuer to either sell me a new bulb, or at lesat provide me with a supplier where I could purchase the bulb....seems CRAZY.  </li>
            <li> Really unbelievable for a mirror that I paid over $80.</li>
            <li> I have been using the mirror to do my makeup and what not for the past couple months</li>
            <li> it totally works even though the prongs are on the wrong side.</li>
            <li> I have a love hate relationship with this mirror!</li>
            <li> This mirror was purchased for a small bathroom that does not have a built in vanity and seating.  </li>
            <li> but the lighting is still dull.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to reorder same mirror!!!</li>
            <li> So you don&#x27;t have to worry about tangling up the wire or handling the mirror clumsily.  </li>
            <li> Also if you need to use the other side of the mirror, you don&#x27;t have to turn the entire mirror and base around.  </li>
            <li> I even purchased a second mirror for my guest bathroom which also has bad lighting.  </li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know how people could say its not bright some of the others</li>
            <li> Lastly, I also like that the on/off is on the cord and not on the base.  </li>
            <li> Iâ€™m keeping this one because Iâ€™m tired of looking</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t get uncomfortable while using it.</li>
            <li> Stress relief could be improved as the cord wears out with lots of movement of the mirror, causing arcing in the base; not a good thing and caused us to replace it after about a year.</li>
            <li> every dirty pore, every gray hair &amp;#60;&amp;#60;bittersweet</li>
            <li> Bad move for Conair.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with it</li>
            <li> Very awkward.</li>
            <li> Base - 2700K - CFL.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This mirror does exactly what I wanted it to do. The magnified side allows me to see magnified stray hairs for plucking and makeup application flaws. The regular side shows a natural version of myself in good light. I feel more confident when I leave the house knowing I haven&#x27;t missed anything that other people might notice.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror over a year ago and loved it. I wanted a fluorescent mirror because it simulates sunlight and therefore will help you apply your makeup better so the way you look in the mirror will be the way you look outdoors. Last month the bulb blew in my mirror and it&#x27;s been one hassle after another trying to get it replaced. I&#x27;ve called Conair five times and it&#x27;s still not replaced. Apparently Conair thinks the bulb will never need replacement so they don&#x27;t even make them available for sale. I&#x27;d think that every light bulb will need replacement at some point so I don&#x27;t understand this concept. I&#x27;ve been to all the hardware stores around town, the store where I purchased the mirror, and overstock.com and no one sells this type of bulb. I&#x27;m upset because I paid $50 for this mirror and it looks like I&#x27;ll just have to buy a completely new mirror since this bulb can&#x27;t be replaced. On top of that, Conair is still selling this mirror knowing that they won&#x27;t sell you the light bulb for it. My next mirror definitely won&#x27;t be made by Conair.</li>
            <li> The magnification side of the mirror is to strong for my taste as you need to be so close that most make up brushes are to long to use and they constantly bang into the mirror causing mistakes, but the big disappointment is after six months the bulb burned out and I along with other people here have found it impossible to find a replacement bulb requiring the purchase of another mirror.  I will not buy another Conair product.</li>
            <li> I have glaucoma and needed a lot of light and magnification.  This mirror does the trick.  The one downside is you can not move it on its axle forward and backwards as much as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Conair make-up mirror from Macy&#x27;s.  The light was very dim and you needed to add additional lighting in order to be able to put your make-up on.  I ended up returning it.  I noticed this model and decided to try it.  The light is extremely bright and you can see EVERYTHING with the magnification. This make-up mirror is definitely a keeper.</li>
            <li> I use to have a  lighted mirror and I put it up in the closet and forgot about it.  Then I went to a hotel and they had a nice one.....it was so good I had to start looking for a better quality mirror....and this is it.  I love it and you will too.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this one. It is a great mirror WHEN IT LIGHTS UP. The bulb is advertised to last 10,000 hours. It does not. I am a light user and I have had my mirror for less than a year. I too called Conair. They said they are just starting to manufacture replacement bulbs for this lamp and cannot guarantee a delivery date, BUT I can give them $15.99 and WAIT... Really unbelievable for a mirror that I paid over $80. Keep looking this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> good magnification, good light, easy to use. replaced an 8x similar product and this is much better and works as advertised</li>
            <li> i love this! its so bright i don&#x27;t know how people could say its not bright some of the others out there are wayyy dimmer than this one. i use it daily before school. and my mom loved it. most amazing thing ever.</li>
            <li> The mirror is at a fixed height - and there&#x27;s not a tilt feature that you can use so that you can adjust the mirror to see your face.  When I placed the mirror on my vanity - and sat down in front of it, the mirror was at chest level. It&#x27;s completely unusable as a vanity mirror.  I returned it.</li>
            <li> The mirror and light are very good, but you can&#x27;t see your face unless you are very short, sit down, or hold the whole mirror us with your other hand.  I returned it, and am looking for one that will tilt enough or swivel upwards.</li>
            <li> This is a great little mirror that does it all.  I&#x27;ve had it for several weeks now, and want to update my review to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The mirror has no flaws and let&#x27;s me correct mine easily. So glad I can see things before others do when I leave the house.</li>
            <li> Since no 7x magnification was offered I ordered the 10x magnification &amp; it was too much.&lt;br /&gt;I really couldn&#x27;t see myself.  The rest of the stand was find.</li>
            <li> The size is good. but the lighting is still dull. However, the magnifying side is very helpful when putting on shadow, eye liner and mascara.</li>
            <li> I received my package in the mail so fast! thanks to amazon prime :o)  The mirror itself is energy efficient which is always a plus. The packaging was great and well suited to make sure the object would not break. The light is bright and WHITE!! I have been using the mirror to do my makeup and what not for the past couple months and it hasnt let me down yet!</li>
            <li> I was beginning to have difficulty with eye make up when I decided to try this mirror.  After the initial shock of seeing every wrinkle and blemish on my face, I found that I could indeed still put on my eye make-up when needed and greatly appreciated that ability.  Most stores only carry 5X, so this was  a real find.  It is also lit, making it even better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of Conair because they sold this lighted mirror as if the bulb would never go out.  Of course it does!  I found the 13W fluorescent bulb for this mirror!  It isn&#x27;t easy to find but I installed it and it works great.  The bulb you need is PHILIPS-383141 Philips 38314-1 - PL-C 13W/827/ALTO - 13Watt - 2 Pin G24d-1 Base - 2700K - CFL.  The original bulb has a zip tie on it to keep it secure.  Make sure you cut the zip tie off before you attempt to remove the old bulb.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item for myself and thought it was a great choice after researching same, however, upon receipt the item lite up for a couple of minutes and then it would no longer work.  I believe there was a short in the switch; returned the item without a problem and ordered a different mirror that also lights up and has a higher magnification.  I was afraid to reorder same mirror!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this item over two years ago and the bulb went out.  Shortly thereafter, I contacted the dealer directly to purchase a replacement bulb -- yet I was told the bulb was no longer available.  This seemed crazy to me, since they continued to sell the exact SAME PRODUCT WITH THE SAME PRODUCT # BE1166T.  Talk about product obsolescence!  I was completely happy with the mirror --- outstanding lightin, mirror is far more magnified than any other I researched at this reasonalbe price....but the inability for the manufacturuer to either sell me a new bulb, or at lesat provide me with a supplier where I could purchase the bulb....seems CRAZY.  Faced with buying a &#x27;mediocre&#x27; mirror for less money, I went ahead purchased a new one of these mirrors.  Guess I&#x27;m just a sucker, but the mirror is exceptiona compared to what else is available for the price, so I feel good about it.  Thanks for reading, I hope this helps.  Teresa</li>
            <li> Just what I thought it would be. Bought this one to replace one I had for many years. Happy with this new mirror.</li>
            <li> For me the 10X magnification is just too much.  I have to get so close to the mirror that it doesn&#x27;t leave any room for using my makeup brushes.  If I back up at all it&#x27;s just blurry.  I also don&#x27;t like that I have to twist the mirror around to see the other side, as opposed to being able to flip back and forth.  I never realized how often I use both sides.  I also end up getting fingerprints all over the edges of the  mirror when I turn it from side to side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amount of light and the size of the mirror are good, however.  I am still searching for the perfect makeup mirror I guess.</li>
            <li> I am now able to see much better to put my makeup on.  It is extremely clear and bright.  Just wish the mirrow was somewhat bigger</li>
            <li> I bought this thing for my girlfriend in x-mas of last year. Bulb burnt out not even a year later. No replacement bulb available. Called conair and they told me this is not repairable product, basically throw away product after use. For what I paid it should last a lifetime or have replacement parts. Bad move for Conair. Will never spend a dollar on a product of theirs again!</li>
            <li> Stress relief could be improved as the cord wears out with lots of movement of the mirror, causing arcing in the base; not a good thing and caused us to replace it after about a year. But we replaced it with an identical model, so I guess you can say we like it.</li>
            <li> This replaces one that I had and actually prefer over this one as could swivel to each side and turn to more angles to stand or sit when applying my makeup. However, the brightness was the most important thing and this one fills the bill. The bulb cannot be replaced but the hours it is supposed to last seem quite enough.</li>
            <li> At first she didn&#x27;t like it because it was \\&quot;too thick\\&quot;.  But after a couple of days, she absolutely loves it!  She had a similar one but it developed a \\&quot;short\\&quot; in the cord, and it was not as thick.  But this one tilts upward, and her old one didn&#x27;t.  As a result, she REALLY,&lt;br /&gt;REALLY likes this one.</li>
            <li> Great 10X mirror with very good lighting.  But beware - the mirror tilts up only a few degrees so you must use it sitting down at a vanity.  We have no vanity, so my wife has to lean it up against the tile to use it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mirror of all of the 10x magnifying mirrors. It&#x27;s one of the brightest due to the flourescent bulb. The mirror in fact does tilt easily (very confused by other review that said it doesn&#x27;t do this) and obviously it also turns so you can change easily from the magnified side to the normal view. Like everyone else, not having a replacement is a &amp;#34;shame on you moment&amp;#34; for conair. My bulb lasted a little less than three years, but I was still annoyed to have to just toss the whole mirror and buy a new one. Alas, after much research, you can find the bulb here on Amazon for around $16...General 45011 - FC12T4/865/LG Circular T4 Fluorescent Tube Light Bulb...it totally works even though the prongs are on the wrong side. I just replaced my bulb and the mirror is working just fine. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> The first mirror I received was broken - so it seems a little delicate. Now that I have a replacement, I have had no problems. I like that it lights up and I like the 10x magnification side a lot!</li>
            <li> The worst thing about this mirror was that the light was way too dim for my use: 60 years old and need bright light, as well as the 10x magnification.  In addition, the bulb was not sunlight, only daylight.  I took another reviewer&#x27;s advice and bought a Zadro SLV410: Dimmable Sunlight Vanity Mirror.  PERFECT!  One advantage is that with this mirror, you can replace the bulb when it burns out.</li>
            <li> So I decided to write this review simply to counter an incorrect review on here.  First of all, the mirror does tilt.  Most standing vanity mirrors have the hinges on the sides and you flip the mirror.  Since this mirror has no hinges, instead the mirror tilts back and forth if you move it by holding the top of the mirror and gently pushing back or pulling forward.  It features about 60 degrees angle tilt, I would prefer 45, hence the 4 star instead of 5, but do I really need to look at the underside of my neck?  If you really need to, you simply moving your head back a bit, no biggie.  Also if you need to use the other side of the mirror, you don&#x27;t have to turn the entire mirror and base around.  You just swivel the mirror \\&quot;head\\&quot; because it rotates. So you don&#x27;t have to worry about tangling up the wire or handling the mirror clumsily.  The 10x magnification is awesome.  I prefer 10x to anything less.  You can see just about everything on a 10x mirror and you can easily lose track of time getting to areas of your face you normally overlook.  After about an hour of messing with my face in front of this mirror I finally walked out of the bathroom and my fiancÃ© actually said \\&quot;you look cleaner...your chin looks different, what did you do?\\&quot; Little did he know I found some tiny hairs (embarrassing, but it happens) that I had never noticed before and removed them!  Anyway, I don&#x27;t want to gross anyone out, but you get my drift.  Oh, and I also forgot to mention.  This mirror is BRIGHT.  MUCH, brighter than many other mirrors I have tested out there.  I was a little skeptical at first because it has an energy saving bulb, but believe me, this sucker does not skimp out on the light.  It&#x27;s advertised as 30% brighter and it is completely true.  I also like that the light never gets very hot so you don&#x27;t get uncomfortable while using it. So overall, I recommend this mirror.  The price is good for what you get.  A 10x mirror with great light, nice satin nickel finish, no plastic, no batteries or replacement bulb needed.  Oh yea, it needs no replacement bulb.  It&#x27;s advertised to last 10,000 hours.  Being the nerd that I am, I decided to calculate this. So this means that if you used the mirror for one hour every single day it would last over 27 years. Lastly, I also like that the on/off is on the cord and not on the base.  The cord is also clear, so that helps conceal the cord or at least look nicer. That about covers everything I think. The End.</li>
            <li> Boy, does this bring things to light!! You will see things you never knew you had. Just don&#x27;t be too critical because the world is not walking around with magnified eyes!</li>
            <li> Great light and mirror to help the challenges you face as you age.  The satin nickel finish is stylish and pretty to enhance your vanity in case you want to leave it out.</li>
            <li> The mirror is smaller than I thought and the lighting isn&#x27;t great. Very unhappy with it so I gave to my 15 year old granddaughter. I have a 10x mirror that I&#x27;ve used for 8 years and it is starting to short out at times. I am looking for that same one. It is fabulous..</li>
            <li> Mom asked for a light up mirror for her birthday... She bittersweetly loves it! Says the finish is beautiful, the light is super bright, and the mirror shows EVERYTHING... every dirty pore, every gray hair &amp;#60;&amp;#60;bittersweet</li>
            <li> I actually bought three other mirrors prior to purchasing the Conair and returned them because one was 7X magnification (which didnâ€™t work for me â€“ I need 10X), one used incandescent light bulbs which got pretty hot, and the mirror on the last one was very distorted.  Iâ€™m keeping this one because Iâ€™m tired of looking and it was fairly inexpensive compared to some of the other ones.  The 10X mirror is very clear and the fluorescent lights keep it from getting overheated. However, as some other reviewers have mentioned, it doesnâ€™t tilt very much- hardly at all on the 10X side. This is a problem since the mirror is set on the bathroom countertop and I have to bend down to look into it. Very awkward. I tried to put the mirror on a stand to elevate it but unless it is at face height it doesnâ€™t help that much. Next time Iâ€™m getting one the completely swivels like my old ones did. Also, Iâ€™ve owned two make up mirrors before this one and liked them both. However, when the bulbs burnt out the mirrors had to be replaced. Apparently this is a problem with most of the make-up mirrors on the market so I guess you just have to plan on getting a new one every two years or so.</li>
            <li> Magnifies everything. Makes putting on makeup so easy.</li>
            <li> I bought this from an obscure Amazon supplier and received a wakeup.  The item arrived on time but was just jammed in the box.  It had apparently been returned and not checked to see if OK.  It turned out the mirror design leaves a lot to be desired since it does not tilt so I sent it back.  No problem with return or credit.</li>
            <li> I have a love hate relationship with this mirror! I LOVE that I can see the tiniest details with it but I am hating the wrinkles it has helped me find!&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, it is a nice mirror and I have enjoyed using it and it has exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Bought this mirror to replace a broken, earlier version. My objectives were increased brightness, cooler operation and both a flat and magnifying mirror as before.  Here are the positives:  The fluorescent lamp is a nice feature and should last a long time.  Much brighter than other Conair mirrors that only have two small incandescent bulbs.   Much cooler operation.  Nice on-off switch on the cord.  Solid construction, looks nice.  Some things that I didn&#x27;t like:  The fluorescent light color is very white (expected)and takes getting used to.  The mirror head is not pivoted on the left and right so you must turn the whole mirror head around when switching from flat to magnifying.  Because the mirror doesn&#x27;t pivot on the left and right, the mirror head is designed to \\&quot;lean back\\&quot;. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t lean back far enough so doing close up \\&quot;face maintenance\\&quot; requires a bit of body contortion.  The 10x magnification seemed like a good idea but I found it to be too much. 7x is more ideal IMHO.</li>
            <li> This mirror has a fluorescent light which give ample illumination.  The magnification is excellent, so long as you stay really close to the mirror, but for close make up and eye brow plucking etc, it is perfect.  The only downside is, as I bought it for use in UK, I had to buy a transformer separately, as it is a different voltage to UK.</li>
            <li> Misleading. Promised a &amp;#34;warm light,&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s anything but. The light quality is very cold and unflattering. I have looked and looked, but apparently companies no longer make a lighted mirror with a warm light effect.</li>
            <li> This product worked great until the bulb burned out after less than a year.  Looked everywhere for replacement bulb until I found that Conair doesn&#x27;t consider this a \\&quot;serviceable\\&quot; item...in other words, throw it away and buy a new one.  Buying a new one now but it won&#x27;t be a Conair.</li>
            <li> The lighting and magnification of the mirror are really good.  This mirror was purchased for a small bathroom that does not have a built in vanity and seating.  I was looking for a mirror that could be placed on the countertop and my husband wanted the 10X magnification to check his shaving.  The mirror does not tilt back much at all and this one does not tilt back 60 degrees.  The only way to use it in the place intended for it is to squat down and look into the mirror.  So, its a good mirror for use on a vanity but not good if you really need a model that will tilt back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an older light up mirror for quite a while.  There was a big bulky, round plastic bottom that was a real eye sore on my vanity.  I really liked the look of this mirror from the beginning.  It&#x27;s sleek and modern looking.  The light is a soft light, not stark white.  The height is just right and the it swivals to a magnifited side.  Very nice!  This mirror would be appealing for ANY vanity.</li>
            <li> I am really satisfied with this product. It is of high quality and workmanship. Easy to put together. Heavy enough so it doesn&#x27;t topple over. The mirror flips over and swivels on the pedestal. I shopped around to other &amp;#34;bed/bath&amp;#34; shops and what was available was poor quality and high priced. This is a great product and for the money a great buy.</li>
            <li> I have used this mirrow for 3 years and my daughter loved it so I got her one for Christmas.  Its large enought, brite enought and very good for close up. Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Is shows everything on your face, pores, blemishes.  Easier to see the results of a good cleaning, great gift idea.</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase even though I don&#x27;t have a face for 10x magnification.  Works great for me.</li>
            <li> Happy with product  very powerful magnification and lighting works well too.  I am able to see problems that are undetectable with the naked eye</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!! It tilts and easy to change sides, the light it&#x27;s magnificent and 10x just what I needed! Compering to other like it it&#x27;s the best for the price highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to buying this make-up mirror because it claims to have a bulb that never goes out.  However, the mirror itself barely adjusts, so I had to stand at an angle to put on my makeup.  In the end, it found a home in the back of my closet and I purchased a different mirror.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Loved every feature if this mirror, great magnification, very stable base and super lighting.  Despite  my 65 year old eyes, I walk out the door looking a lot more &amp;#34;polished&amp;#34; than I did prior to owning this mirror.</li>
            <li> . I do wish it had a switch on the mirror itself instead of on the cord.  The 10x is good for me but might be too much for some so you should check 10x out at your local store.  The mirror makes a wonderful addition to my makeup table in my bedroom.</li>
            <li> The mirror is very good but the stand is quite short. I have to place it on books to get it to be the right height!</li>
            <li> This mirror is almost perfect.  It is two sided, with magnification on one side and a regular mirror on the other.  The mirror easily spins around so you can see either side. The mirror does tilt, but not significantly so I find I have to lean down to it, but that is ok with me, but it kept me from giving it 5 stars.  The reason I bought this was the poor lighting in my bathroom, which is a soft yellow and I would walk outside thinking my makeup looked fine only to realize I looked horrible.  So the light on this mirror is perfect for applying day-makeup.  I even purchased a second mirror for my guest bathroom which also has bad lighting.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a better application of their makeup with proper lighting.</li>
