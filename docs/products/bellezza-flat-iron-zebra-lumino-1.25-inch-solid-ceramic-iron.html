            <li> My friend bought this flat iron at the mall for 125 dollars. She curled my hair with it with no product just for fun (my hair falls flat no matter how much product is in there) and I went to sleep and woke up and my hair looked like she just did it. I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I had to buy one. I don&#x27;t know what it is but this thing surly surpasses my chi. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel fried, cooked, dead (which it is!) or anything but lively and shiny and beautiful!</li>

            <li> My wife went to the mall and a saleswoman tried to sell her this for $110 on sale. I told her she would be crazy to pay that much and that we should wait and check prices online. We were both pleased to see it on Amazon for the price we paid. Now my wife is as happy as a clam.</li>
