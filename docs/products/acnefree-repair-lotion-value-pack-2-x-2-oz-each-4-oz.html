            <li>This is perfect for me and works great as part of my skin-care regime and keeps me blemish free!!</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>I bought this to see if it was a good replacement..</li>
            <li>really a good product</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping :D</li>
            <li>I am happy to find it out of the kit because this is what I use most along with the face wash.</li>
            <li>The scar treatment products from AcneFree are also amazing.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great price!  </li>
            <li>There is no way of knowing the product I purchase is still good and safe to use.</li>
            <li>Got it quickly and was a great deal.</li>
            <li>My skin also dries out very easily.  </li>
            <li>I use the Acnefree soap because it is a really good mild soap that also exfoliates.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, and was pleased with the vendor.  </li>
            <li>and then I&#x27;ll be able to tell you if there are differences in its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it again.  </li>
            <li>Also it is safe during pregnancy which is helpful.</li>
            <li>Since the cleanser worked well for me, I decided to give the Repair Lotion a try, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>This product is great and work really well on my acne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so.....much better than proactive.</li>
            <li>I used Proactive for many years, then couldn&#x27;t afford it anymore.</li>
            <li>THank you. :)</li>
            <li>This helps a great deal with my adult acne.</li>
            <li>However, when I started using the Acne Free system in college, it worked like magic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure any mild soap will work though.  </li>
            <li>Works great for my teen children!</li>
            <li>My wife uses acne free.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m never disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li>The lotion works nicely to keep my skin clear and lightly hydrate.</li>
            <li>I find that this product helps as much as proactive, and more than some of the prescription acne cream.</li>
            <li>The 10% benzoyl peroxide lotions sold in most stores is way too strong for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I recommend them to anyone with a mild or severe problem and even for maintenance.</li>
            <li>I think this is also what keeps me wrinkle-free, too, because it also contains a mild exfoliating property (in the cleanser).</li>
            <li>After many many years I&#x27;ve finally find something that works.</li>
            <li>What is important is the lotion because it has a good balance of hydration on your skin and active acid to kill bacteria.  </li>
            <li>You will be amazed within the first week!</li>
            <li>Makes me wonder is it really acne free in the bottle.</li>
            <li>I immediately went back to the AcneFree products and have been super satisfied day after day.</li>
            <li>I find the astringent way to much for my sensitive and hurt more than it helped.  </li>
            <li>like i said though my acne is UNDER CONTROL, i still get one pimple here and there, better than 13+ on my face, but this repair lotion only contains 3.7% benzoyl peroxide</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s has been consistent since my 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not buying  any more facial products  online</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>It helps not to have to buy the whole kit every time.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and despite the fact of being in my 50&#x27;s, I still get acne breakouts.</li>
            <li>(salicylic acid does absolutely nothing for me).</li>
            <li>I now have clearer, healthier skin at a much lower cost.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought  numerous acne free products from here</li>
            <li>This stuff really works for me.  </li>
            <li>Because I know how important to get the right product that works for you, it might help you to know that I workout 2-3 times a week and shower every other day.  </li>
            <li>Better than pro active.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for 4 years now and this particular set was noticeably thinner.</li>
            <li>I buy the face wash from Walmart and use a DIFFERENT astringent (Sea Breeze for sensitive skin, not the one included in the prepackaged Acne Free system).. then buy the lotion from Amazon.</li>
            <li>i got it new.</li>
            <li>Product has helped clear up 13 yo acne!</li>
            <li>Following every step of the 3-step system, improvement was noticeable after the first application.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To try to help anyone else out there looking for solutions, I have oily skin that gets worse with most products made for oily skin because my skin tries to compensate for the dryness by producing more oil.</li>
            <li>anyway, the Acne Free line is the only thing that doesn&#x27;t overly dry out or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>I have semi-oily and sensitive skin with medium to large facial pores.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s harder to gauge how much my skin is absorbing.</li>
            <li>With everything I&#x27;ve tried over the years for acne, I found out that I need benzoyl peroxide in my skin care regimen to keep my face clear of acne</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin clear without drying it out.  </li>
            <li>I have tried anything and everything, and this seems to help clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>i really wish it was sold in stores seperate from the other steps because i don&#x27;t really need them but thank god i can buy it here on amazon</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the repair lotion might be just a bit too high on the benzoyl peroxide for me.</li>
            <li>I used ACNEFREE SEVERE for 6 months to clear up my moderate acne that i&#x27;ve had for 4 years.</li>
            <li>Sadly, the old Proactiv lotion is just way, way, way better.</li>
            <li>Tired of paying the high cost for Proactiv, I finally took a chance on the AcneFree Oil Free facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>(when followed with toner from Simple), and left my face soft and without those &amp;#34;just under the skin&amp;#34; bumps that Proactiv left me with.</li>

            <li> and it only has a little less Benzoyal Peroxide than Proactive and my skin took to it very well!</li>
            <li> The ONLY thing that works as a moisturizer to fix dry skin and does not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> I cannot find this individual product in any of our stores here, unless you buy the 3-pack kit that has other facial products.</li>
            <li> ive been using this product for a long time and it helps lessen acne on my face, although once in a while one will appear but</li>
            <li> I initially started this product back in high school, but it burned my skin and made it even worse.</li>
            <li> IM still monitoring my face to see if it&#x27;s too dry</li>
            <li> I combination skin of oily and dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry and rough.</li>
            <li> I still get a blemish here &amp; there, but now it&#x27;s just one rogue blemish and not a whole bunch.</li>
            <li> With my shower every other day and a nightly face wash with very small amount of mild soap and water, I could count on having at least 2 pimples at any one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The active ingredient will bleach your clothes if you get it on them.</li>
            <li> Pro Active is way to expensive and not really any different from this product.  </li>
            <li> it is a little drying</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find the ACNEFREE SEVERE repair lotion sold alone, so i was getting tired of paying $23 at walmart and only using one item out of the 4 products.</li>
            <li> After few days it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> I used Proactiv for years, but was never happy with the way the facial cleanser affected my skin--pimples seemed to become hard and stay just below my skin&#x27;s surface, BEGGING me to try to pop them.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t make my face any worse, it keeps up with the performance of the 10% acnefree severe repair lotion..</li>
            <li> I used to have AWFUL acne-- breakout every day and constant scarring that I thought would NEVER disappear.</li>
            <li> Too bad the Proactiv company itself is terrible and basically an evil marketing sham hellbent on stealing your money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have terrible acne problems</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used Proactive for 1 week and paid for it dearly! My face exploded in acne and blemishes. I immediately went back to the AcneFree products and have been super satisfied day after day. I recommend them to anyone with a mild or severe problem and even for maintenance. The scar treatment products from AcneFree are also amazing. Overall, don&#x27;t spend your money on Proactive or wait for it in the mail. Go to your nearest CVS, RitaAid, Walmart, Target or even grocery store, look for the 3 pack system, and try it. You will be amazed within the first week!</li>
            <li> The ONLY thing that works as a moisturizer to fix dry skin and does not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> It works very well. The active ingredient will bleach your clothes if you get it on them. There is a warning on the package, but I know some people don&#x27;t read the package. This helps a great deal with my adult acne. I still get a blemish here &amp; there, but now it&#x27;s just one rogue blemish and not a whole bunch. Wish I had this when I was a teen.  Works well with the AcneFree toner.</li>
            <li> I used ACNEFREE SEVERE for 6 months to clear up my moderate acne that i&#x27;ve had for 4 years. it didn&#x27;t cure it but my acne is \\&quot;under control\\&quot; i started using the ACNEFREE purifying cleanser, witch hazel, acnefree severe repair lotion (10%benzoylperoxide), and cetaphil moisturizer. I couldn&#x27;t find the ACNEFREE SEVERE repair lotion sold alone, so i was getting tired of paying $23 at walmart and only using one item out of the 4 products. I bought this to see if it was a good replacement.. IT IS!!!! like i said though my acne is UNDER CONTROL, i still get one pimple here and there, better than 13+ on my face, but this repair lotion only contains 3.7% benzoyl peroxide, it doesn&#x27;t make my face any worse, it keeps up with the performance of the 10% acnefree severe repair lotion.. sorry for the ramble :)</li>
            <li> Love this product, and was pleased with the vendor.  Got it quickly and was a great deal.</li>
            <li> i got it new. i used it at night only. it is a little drying so i decided to use this only on the areas where i have a pimple. besides that its awesome</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for 4 years now and this particular set was noticeably thinner. It&#x27;s harder to gauge how much my skin is absorbing. IM still monitoring my face to see if it&#x27;s too dry and then I&#x27;ll be able to tell you if there are differences in its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I have used this forever. I am happy to find it out of the kit because this is what I use most along with the face wash. It helps not to have to buy the whole kit every time. Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping :D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this line of acne products for almost 10 years and I&#x27;m never disappointed with the results. I have very oily skin and despite the fact of being in my 50&#x27;s, I still get acne breakouts. Probably Hormonal related...anyway, the Acne Free line is the only thing that doesn&#x27;t overly dry out or irritate my skin. I think this is also what keeps me wrinkle-free, too, because it also contains a mild exfoliating property (in the cleanser). The lotion works nicely to keep my skin clear and lightly hydrate.</li>
            <li> I use this if i have acne. After few days it&#x27;s gone. This is my go to when it comes to breakouts</li>
            <li> I used this product for 2 years and eventually your skin gets used to it and it just quits working.</li>
            <li> I used to have AWFUL acne-- breakout every day and constant scarring that I thought would NEVER disappear. I initially started this product back in high school, but it burned my skin and made it even worse. However, when I started using the Acne Free system in college, it worked like magic. I&#x27;m glad I tried it again.  I buy the face wash from Walmart and use a DIFFERENT astringent (Sea Breeze for sensitive skin, not the one included in the prepackaged Acne Free system).. then buy the lotion from Amazon. I end up saving a lot of money, because otherwise I was finding myself running out of parts of the set before others (i.e. no more lotion and too much face wash..). This way I can get the lotion and everything else as I need it. I&#x27;ve bought this lotion three times already, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> It works. Not drying, not shiny on the face. Following every step of the 3-step system, improvement was noticeable after the first application.</li>
            <li> I find that this product helps as much as proactive, and more than some of the prescription acne cream. Also it is safe during pregnancy which is helpful.</li>
            <li> Sadly, the old Proactiv lotion is just way, way, way better. Too bad the Proactiv company itself is terrible and basically an evil marketing sham hellbent on stealing your money.</li>
            <li> With everything I&#x27;ve tried over the years for acne, I found out that I need benzoyl peroxide in my skin care regimen to keep my face clear of acne (salicylic acid does absolutely nothing for me). I used Proactiv for years, but was never happy with the way the facial cleanser affected my skin--pimples seemed to become hard and stay just below my skin&#x27;s surface, BEGGING me to try to pop them. So I switched to a milder cleanser but kept using the repairing lotion. Tired of paying the high cost for Proactiv, I finally took a chance on the AcneFree Oil Free facial cleanser. It worked wonders for me--didn&#x27;t overdry my skin (when followed with toner from Simple), and left my face soft and without those &amp;#34;just under the skin&amp;#34; bumps that Proactiv left me with. I have fewer pop-ups as well. Since the cleanser worked well for me, I decided to give the Repair Lotion a try, and I&#x27;m glad I did. I now have clearer, healthier skin at a much lower cost. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the repair lotion might be just a bit too high on the benzoyl peroxide for me. I&#x27;d like to see a &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; version with a lower BP percentage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To try to help anyone else out there looking for solutions, I have oily skin that gets worse with most products made for oily skin because my skin tries to compensate for the dryness by producing more oil. This line of products, while not reducing the oil production (that&#x27;s all in my genes), keeps the acne at bay. I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
            <li> This helps lower chances of break outs on my skin. I combination skin of oily and dry. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I do on occasion will get a pimple.</li>
            <li> ive been using this product for a long time and it helps lessen acne on my face, although once in a while one will appear but really a good product</li>
            <li> This product is great and work really well on my acne. It&#x27;s so.....much better than proactive. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry and rough. After many many years I&#x27;ve finally find something that works.</li>
            <li> Good product.  It keeps my skin clear without drying it out.  I cannot find this individual product in any of our stores here, unless you buy the 3-pack kit that has other facial products.</li>
            <li> The only product that has ever worked for me!  Pro Active is way to expensive and not really any different from this product.  I wish I found it sooner and wondered why they didn&#x27;t have this when I was growing up.  I don&#x27;t have terrible acne problems but I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s and it&#x27;s has been consistent since my 20&#x27;s.  Because I know how important to get the right product that works for you, it might help you to know that I workout 2-3 times a week and shower every other day.  I have semi-oily and sensitive skin with medium to large facial pores.  My skin also dries out very easily.  With my shower every other day and a nightly face wash with very small amount of mild soap and water, I could count on having at least 2 pimples at any one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acnefree has a 3 step process with their soap, astringent and lotion.  I find the astringent way to much for my sensitive and hurt more than it helped.  What worked for me is washing my face and putting on this lotion once in the morning and once in the evening after working out and eating.  I use the Acnefree soap because it is a really good mild soap that also exfoliates.  I&#x27;m sure any mild soap will work though.  What is important is the lotion because it has a good balance of hydration on your skin and active acid to kill bacteria.  Thus, soap to clean skin, lotion to keep pores small and keep skin from over producing oils, and active acid to kill bacteria through a lot of the day.  Hopes this help someone!</li>
            <li> I used Proactive for many years, then couldn&#x27;t afford it anymore. So I found this product online and it only has a little less Benzoyal Peroxide than Proactive and my skin took to it very well! I can actually afford this product. I&#x27;ll be back!!! THank you. :)</li>
            <li> I wish they came in larger bottles! Works great for my teen children!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great price!  Product has helped clear up 13 yo acne!</li>
            <li> This is a must have in my skin care routine. i use it daily. i really wish it was sold in stores seperate from the other steps because i don&#x27;t really need them but thank god i can buy it here on amazon</li>
            <li> I always keep 2% benzoyl peroxide lotion around.  I use it every night before I put on my night moisturizer.  The 10% benzoyl peroxide lotions sold in most stores is way too strong for my sensitive skin. This is perfect for me and works great as part of my skin-care regime and keeps me blemish free!!</li>
            <li> My wife uses acne free. I&#x27;ve bought  numerous acne free products from here but none seems to equal the quality like the ones I buy out of the store. Makes me wonder is it really acne free in the bottle. I&#x27;m not buying  any more facial products  online</li>
            <li> Works great. I have tried anything and everything, and this seems to help clear up my skin. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. This stuff really works for me.  Better than pro active.</li>
            <li> These do not have expiration date on them.  There is no way of knowing the product I purchase is still good and safe to use.</li>
