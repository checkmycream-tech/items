            <li>Such a good product for a very low price!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s really concentrated when you first spray it or if mine is a defect.</li>
            <li>I found this eau de toliet spray while working as a retail manager of large discount store.</li>
            <li>It is my new favorite daily fragrance!</li>
            <li>I only buy adidas products so this may be a little bias (lol)</li>
            <li>It smells very similar to Moves, but a little laughter, more airy and refreshing.</li>
            <li>is what is described in the purchase, thanks</li>
            <li>for not to much money.</li>
            <li>My husband loves it and always wants me to wear it.</li>

            <li>I usually get many compliments when wearing this scent!</li>
            <li>It is such a clean smell which I am finding that Adidas products are.</li>
            <li>I wanted a fragrance for whenever I am just going to do things more or less everyday and this will work fine for me!</li>
            <li>It is light and delicate and was a super value for a large bottle.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this&lt;br /&gt;eau de toliet spray.</li>
            <li>Other reviews are right about the fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>i love the smell but it doesn&#x27;t last long at all....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light scent but last a long time.  </li>
            <li>subtle, clean and fresh smell.</li>
            <li>It is not too heavy or too light.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Probably the product was old...?</li>
            <li>At such a low price, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This perfume smells light and pretty but has a faint whiff of an alcohol scent.</li>
            <li>It also lasts much longer than I expected - all day for me.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint us the scent does not last more than a couple hours, whether it is sprayed on skin or on clothes.</li>
            <li>Plus, the seller threw in some other items - 2 samples of other perfumes, a few coupons and even a pocket-sized mirror :)</li>
            <li>then my nose couldn&#x27;t accept cheap, vinegar-like sour dry down</li>
            <li>This perfume I had high hopes for, but only to be let down.  </li>

            <li> i love the smell but it doesn&#x27;t last long at all....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light scent but last a long time.  </li>
            <li> subtle, clean and fresh smell.</li>
            <li> It is not too heavy or too light.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Probably the product was old...?</li>
            <li> At such a low price, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells light and pretty but has a faint whiff of an alcohol scent.</li>
            <li> It also lasts much longer than I expected - all day for me.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint us the scent does not last more than a couple hours, whether it is sprayed on skin or on clothes.</li>
            <li> Plus, the seller threw in some other items - 2 samples of other perfumes, a few coupons and even a pocket-sized mirror :)</li>
            <li> then my nose couldn&#x27;t accept cheap, vinegar-like sour dry down</li>
            <li> This perfume I had high hopes for, but only to be let down.  </li>
            <li> I usually wear Adidas Moves for Her, but I ran out, and my local store didn&#x27;t have any in stock, so I grabbed this Pure Lightness.</li>
            <li> it leaves a long lasting scent on you...</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has a really hard time with certain scents.  </li>
            <li> She said it didn&#x27;t last as long as her other perfumes.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and not too heavy.</li>
            <li> Arrives as expected.</li>
            <li> I, on the other hand, think it smells harshly of hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li> FIRST I THOUGHT SHE WAS CRAZY</li>
            <li> Not a good fragrance for me, but gave it to a friend who recommended it to me and uses it daily...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this at Walmart for about $20 a few years ago.</li>
            <li> The Fruity Rythm and also the fragrance in the lime green bottle are my favorites!</li>
            <li> It smells like chemicals and not good at all.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong wearing this any time of year!</li>
            <li> I bought these item as a gift i hope the person i got it for likes it if not too bad for them.</li>
            <li> too bad</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> but this is one of the worst ones.</li>

            <li> Lovely! My girls are in love with it</li>
            <li> Great service will order again</li>
            <li> The scent is nice and light - not too overpowering - perfect for warmer months.  I usually get many compliments when wearing this scent!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Adidas Moves, so I decided to try this product and it is now my new favorite.  It is such a clean smell which I am finding that Adidas products are. I highly recommend this product!!  I am fairly picky about the fragrances I wear because I easily get headaches from many scents but Adidas has never been one of them.  Try it, you will like it and if you don&#x27;t you can contact me and sell me what you don&#x27;t like!!!  LOL!!! :)</li>
            <li> For this perfume to so inexpensive it stays with you all day and has a fresh fragrance. Although this isnt my favorite fragrance from Addidas. It still smells wonderful. The Fruity Rythm and also the fragrance in the lime green bottle are my favorites!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m man. So I bought this perfume as a gift. I tried before I give it and I can say that the smell is really good. I recommend it if the women want to draw attention.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is perfect for the spring and summer, really light and fresh, have received many compliments.  It also lasts much longer than I expected - all day for me.  At such a low price, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Smells fresh and clean, does not last though, still nice</li>
            <li> this is the scent I have been looking for. I love it. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume.  It is not too heavy or too light.  It has that nice clean smell to it.  My boyfriend has a really hard time with certain scents.  So I try to always buy perfume that is clean smelling, cause those scents don&#x27;t bug him.  This one fit the bill.</li>
            <li> I got it for my daughter she loves it.</li>
            <li> I bought these item as a gift i hope the person i got it for likes it if not too bad for them.</li>
            <li> Item arrived in perfect condition, I am very satisfied with the purchase. is what is described in the purchase, thanks</li>
            <li> for not to much money. I wear it during the day and its a clean fresh smell which is not over powering.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it and always wants me to wear it. I, on the other hand, think it smells harshly of hydrogen peroxide. The smell always gets me choked up whenever I spray it on. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s really concentrated when you first spray it or if mine is a defect. Then again this is the first perfume I&#x27;ve ever used, so what would I know?</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this fragrance. It is light and delicate and was a super value for a large bottle.</li>
            <li> It is a bit strong for me and it turned really strong after a while.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is AMAZING!! It is so light, tropical fresh and crisp. I have collected nearly all of the Adidas fragrances and this one is my absolute favorite in the Adidas range. The notes are heavenly, I enjoy this scent very much!</li>
            <li> This perfume I had high hopes for, but only to be let down.  It smells like chemicals and not good at all. :( I love perfume and I have tons of it but this is one of the worst ones. it doesn&#x27;t stay on for longer than an hour.  I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Its has a nice fragrance. ..</li>
            <li> OMG!!! This is amaizing...it leaves a long lasting scent on you...i get compliment all the time when wearing this  cologne.. I call everthing cologne I Cant bother to diffrenciate...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this perfume before, and in my country is like three times the price I got it here, so yeah, it&#x27;s a great value.&lt;br /&gt;Very subtle, clean and fresh smell. I love it. :D It does not smell like flowers or fruits. If you&#x27;re looking for a light and fresh body spray, this one&#x27;s perfect. :D</li>
            <li> smells very good. it looks and feels very modern, i got it for my niece and she likes it a lot.!</li>
            <li> Arrives as expected. I like it because it is affordable and has a sweet scent. This is a gift to my cousin and Will recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I wanted a fragrance for whenever I am just going to do things more or less everyday and this will work fine for me!</li>
            <li> Gave to my girlfriend. She always liked the way it smelled. It lasts about 4 hours. That&#x27;s about it. What more can you say about perfume? It smells kind of nice, and lasts kind of a long time.</li>
            <li> Nice and makes one feel fresh. The fragrance isn&#x27;t very strong and yet after wearing it you feel slightly rejuvenated :)</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift. Good price. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I only buy adidas products so this may be a little bias (lol) but this is a wonderful perfume.  It&#x27;s a light scent but last a long time.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It was definitely a good choice, it smells great and can be used daily, it is soft and I&#x27;ve even received compliments.</li>
            <li> Again another light scent that is wonderful from Adidas.</li>
            <li> Love,love, love , love.. Did I say love? So many people sniff in my direction and want to know what I am wearing. Long lasting and not too heavy. It is my new favorite daily fragrance!</li>
            <li> They all smell wonderful. Pure Lightness smells so fresh and clean. You can&#x27;t go wrong wearing this any time of year!</li>
            <li> light and fruity scent, smells nice for any occassion. Bought as a gift and they liked it. Nice size bottle too for the price.</li>
            <li> Wish it was a bit stronger, for those who want VERY light fragrances, this is it.</li>
            <li> Smells ok. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I loved it, my package came quick and it gave me extra samples and coupons!</li>
            <li> Smell like men&#x27;s cologne or more like a bar of Zest soap...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok scent in the beginning... then my nose couldn&#x27;t accept cheap, vinegar-like sour dry down scent.&lt;br /&gt;Probably the product was old...?</li>
            <li> Love the clean fresh scent. Would definitely get again.</li>
            <li> my daughter I loved the fragrance, thank you very much</li>
            <li> Fantastic item, bought it for girl friend for christmas, and she love it. and the best part was it was so cheap and came quick for the holliday</li>
            <li> es rico el aroma es suave, delicado para una mujer pava, recomiendo el producto es ta adaptado a la actualidad.</li>
            <li> Smells just like Ralph Lauren blue ...yumm</li>
            <li> I found this eau de toliet spray while working as a retail manager of large discount store. It is a very light,&lt;br /&gt;unique smell. It does not come on strong or overpower ones ability to breathe. I highly recommend this&lt;br /&gt;eau de toliet spray. Very refreshing. I have had many people ask me what I am wearing and compliment&lt;br /&gt;me. My grandchildren say &amp;#34;that is your smell, Nonna&amp;#34;. Do not be turned off by the last sentence. This eau&lt;br /&gt;de toliet spray is not age specific. My granddaughters sneak and use it as frequently as possible!</li>
            <li> 1.7 ounce size is perfect.  Other reviews are right about the fresh scent.  Perfect to spray on after a shower and dressing and clean cotton or linen.  It reminds me of another Adidas scent I wore many years ago that I can&#x27;t recall name but can&#x27;t find anymore.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I received the product in excellent conditions and on time as expected. It was a really good service. I recommend them!</li>
            <li> i love the smell but it doesn&#x27;t last long at all....too bad cuz its a really clean scent. i get many compliments</li>
            <li> Adidas is all I wear and I receive many compliments on this fragrance as well as the Tropical and Moves Adidas. I received it fast and in great packaging, too.</li>
            <li> MY WIFE LOVES IT. FIRST I THOUGHT SHE WAS CRAZY WANTING THIS FROM ADIDAS.. I GOT IT FOR HER AND SHE WAS RIGHT SMELLS GREAT ON HER..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this at Walmart for about $20 a few years ago. Love the smell but would prefer not to spend all that money if I don&#x27;t really have to so.. found it through Amazon.com and it was on sale for $4.80+$1.95 shipping and handling fees. I&#x27;m one happy camper for finding this product more than HALF off its original price! Plus, the seller threw in some other items - 2 samples of other perfumes, a few coupons and even a pocket-sized mirror :)</li>
            <li> My girlfriend thought it smelled pretty good. She also liked that it sprayed nice and uniformly. She said it didn&#x27;t last as long as her other perfumes.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this perfume. It&#x27;s such a pretty fragrance and so good for every-day use. For a product this inexpensive, you&#x27;re getting great value for your money...and way MORE than what you&#x27;re paying. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone looking for a light every-day fragrance that&#x27;s sporty yet feminine.</li>
            <li> I usually wear Adidas Moves for Her, but I ran out, and my local store didn&#x27;t have any in stock, so I grabbed this Pure Lightness. It smells very similar to Moves, but a little laughter, more airy and refreshing. I really like it, and will probably buy it again. My only complaint us the scent does not last more than a couple hours, whether it is sprayed on skin or on clothes.</li>
            <li> This is so light and fresh!  A perfect springtime scent and who can beat that price.  I love this scent and was so happy to be able to get online.</li>
            <li> Perfume excellent, very good fragrance and lingers in the body and clothes all day also is very economical&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very goob</li>
            <li> A NICE SCENT,MOSTLY LIHGT AND BREEZY ,PRACTICAL IN PRICE.FUN BODY SPRAY FOR AMISTY ALL OVER YOUR BODY FEEL A D SCENT.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance even though when i first bought it i was unaware tht it was for women lol so now im having second thoughts about buying it again.... but i definately got like a zillion compliments about this cologne :) that is why i went looking for more</li>
            <li> i use this as a guy lol, smells great, one of those sweet but not fruity smells that can be used by anyone</li>
            <li> Awesome!!! will buy it over again.</li>
            <li> Lovelovelove this perfume. Smells so clean, like I just got out of the shower! Such a good product for a very low price! Highly recommend!</li>

            <li> Not a good fragrance for me, but gave it to a friend who recommended it to me and uses it daily...she loves it</li>
            <li> This perfume smells light and pretty but has a faint whiff of an alcohol scent. It smells a bit cheap at first.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Great seller, great product as new. 10000% recommend this seller.</li>
