            <li>This formula just feels good for my skin:  not drying, not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I hope this brand gets more recognition &amp; others find confidence in their skin from it as well!</li>
            <li>Exactly as they suggested, the Benzd has worked wonderfully for me.</li>
            <li>I was pretty impressed after 2 weeks of use</li>
            <li>What is amazing is that the company e-mailed me to see how it was going</li>
            <li>I have a tendency to get kind of grody, bumpy blackheads on my cheeks</li>
            <li>Johan has hit the nail on the head with his suite of products, which manage to be non-drying and yet extremely effective acne treatments.</li>
            <li>This softens his skin nicely while still clearing up those problem areas.</li>
            <li>Has worked quickly and very effectively on my blemish-prone, combination skin.  </li>
            <li>More than satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>and it is better than any spot treatment I&#x27;ve tried, and</li>

            <li>This product is in fact pretty amazing</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>*update: I&#x27;ve been using this product every morning and night for 2 months now, and I&#x27;m happy to report that my adult acne is not a problem for me for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li>original review:  </li>
            <li>high quality and a great result so far!!</li>
            <li>Worked quickly too.</li>
            <li>and this product has been great for releaving congestion on my skin and keeping break-outs down.</li>
            <li>Before I started using SALIC, I used the proactiv acne repairing treatment at night and although proactiv has an effective product, I really feel like the ingredients in SALIC are a lot more natural and make it a much healthier choice for just that reason (plus it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing like proactiv does).</li>
            <li>Their stellar customer service earned them a customer for life!</li>
            <li>This is the only thing that has ever worked for me and I am so appreciative.</li>
            <li>With the anti inflammatory action, my skin looks healthy and supple.    </li>
            <li>This has really been effective so far.</li>
            <li>My friends and family have noticed that my acne has largely cleared up and have commented that my skin quality has improved significantly.</li>
            <li>It smells a little funny but works great.</li>
            <li>i use a small amount on problem spots after cleansing and before applying moisturizer and i&#x27;ve been really happy with it.</li>
            <li>always breakout before/during my period and the salic really does work wonders!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it was quite strong enough for acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite certain that the anti-inflammatory properties in SALIC have noticeably improved my skin&#x27;s condition and appearance.</li>
            <li>Non-greasy and applies on very well.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not too much of a problem.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>And thats appreciated.</li>
            <li>This product turned out not to be the right match for my troubled skin, although I&#x27;m sure it would he for many.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used Pombrand&#x27;s other products, including Clns and BenzD, alongside these Salic to achieve even better results.</li>
            <li>My skin felt so good after using, not dry or tight at all.</li>
            <li>+ One pump is good for the whole face (don&#x27;t go overboard, it should last 3 months or so).</li>
            <li>I decided to order this based on a friend highly recommending it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get acne to often normally around my time of the month.</li>
            <li>I am 25 years old and have suffered with acne since I was in junior high.  </li>
            <li>so yes, have been enjoying this product and have not had any skin irritation, just worrying less about breaking out!!</li>
            <li>In particular, I like the fact that there is a really un-scented natural feeling to them and just how brief and to the point the ingredients are - no sulfates, no creepy long chemicals, its clear that its made with extremely high quality food grade style ingredients.</li>
            <li>So it needs to be something that can keep my normally clear skin clear.</li>
            <li>but since I&#x27;ve been using skin by pom products, I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin has cleared up considerably.</li>
            <li>I was worried that she may be too sensitive for the product</li>
            <li>but it is gentle enough and has helped her.</li>
            <li>I used this for my 14yr old son who is a redhead and has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Nothing else has worked as quickly or effectively to made my skin clear without overdrying or irritating.  </li>
            <li>i generally have clear skin but</li>
            <li>A plus, is it really soothes irritated, dry, red, and itchy skin.</li>
            <li>I use this at night after toning and just dab a little heavy moisturizer over my jawline afterwards, where I tend to get dry and its amazing.</li>
            <li>But, days later my forehead felt so soft I started using it on my entire face</li>
            <li>Other acne products I tried were so strong they actually left his skin red and raw.</li>
            <li>also it feels good and is not full of scary chemicals.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Have only been using this a week or so but already have noticed a decrease in the usual clogged pores i have around my cheeks and mouth...</li>
            <li> Within 2-3 weeks of buying this I&#x27;ve had zero active breakouts.   </li>

            <li> This thing has a very strong disgusting smell that makes me feel nauseous.</li>
            <li> In the past I have used a lot of Origins and Kiehls products and I can say I think these are just as quality.</li>
            <li> this stuff sucks.</li>
            <li> and this stuff is thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> - Its not great for under makeup because it is an acne fighter, but I use this before bed</li>
            <li> If this is ever discontinued for some crazy reason please notify me</li>
            <li> so i dont want to use some harsh insane drug store peroxide stuff on my face.</li>

            <li> ok this prevention lotion is awesome. i generally have clear skin but always breakout before/during my period and the salic really does work wonders! i have been using just a little bit on breakouts, as i feel them growing and right before they&#x27;re almost &amp;#34;popped&amp;#34; and it seriously makes the process go way faster. also it feels good and is not full of scary chemicals.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  Has worked quickly and very effectively on my blemish-prone, combination skin.  Noticeable difference in clarity after only a few uses.  Non-irritating.  More than satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy and applies on very well. It smells a lot but it&#x27;s not too much of a problem.</li>
            <li> Way too greasy for me. I have very oily skin and this stuff is thick and greasy. Might work well for those with dry skin.</li>
            <li> this stuff sucks. it didn&#x27;t do anything besides make my skin look a little shinier</li>

            <li> [[VIDEOID:71bbded65fd3c2a36915165e0ea41971]]I have suffered with severe acne for 10+ years. I stumbled on Salic one day and I took a risk ordering it. It was the best decision I&#x27;ve ever made. I use this at night after toning and just dab a little heavy moisturizer over my jawline afterwards, where I tend to get dry and its amazing. Within 2-3 weeks of buying this I&#x27;ve had zero active breakouts.   + It does not over dry me at all! It has the perfect balance of moisture and acne fighting ingredients.  + One pump is good for the whole face (don&#x27;t go overboard, it should last 3 months or so). + I even take it onto my shoulders or neck if I have a minor blemish there and it is better than any spot treatment I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried it all!  + Since buying this product I have NOT used a spot treatment even once! and I&#x27;ve practically lived on them for years. - Its not great for under makeup because it is an acne fighter, but I use this before bed so it doesn&#x27;t matter.  I hope this brand gets more recognition &amp; others find confidence in their skin from it as well! If this is ever discontinued for some crazy reason please notify me so I can order all of it! This is the only thing that has ever worked for me and I am so appreciative. I&#x27;ve already repurchased! I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Nothing else has worked as quickly or effectively to made my skin clear without overdrying or irritating.  A must buy!</li>
            <li> **update: I&#x27;ve been using this product every morning and night for 2 months now, and I&#x27;m happy to report that my adult acne is not a problem for me for the first time in my life. If you check out my other reviews on amazon, I will call it when a product doesn&#x27;t meet my expectations and I will broadcast it when a product is awesome. This product is in fact pretty amazing and I&#x27;m very impressed. With the anti inflammatory action, my skin looks healthy and supple.    original review:  I love this product for the control and prevention of breakouts. Before I started using SALIC, I used the proactiv acne repairing treatment at night and although proactiv has an effective product, I really feel like the ingredients in SALIC are a lot more natural and make it a much healthier choice for just that reason (plus it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing like proactiv does). I find it works just as well, maybe even better.    I have acne prone skin but since I&#x27;ve been using skin by pom products, I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin has cleared up considerably. My friends and family have noticed that my acne has largely cleared up and have commented that my skin quality has improved significantly. I&#x27;m quite certain that the anti-inflammatory properties in SALIC have noticeably improved my skin&#x27;s condition and appearance.</li>
            <li> This product turned out not to be the right match for my troubled skin, although I&#x27;m sure it would he for many. What is amazing is that the company e-mailed me to see how it was going about a week after I purchased it. When I told them it wasn&#x27;t going all that well, they recommended I try the Benzd instead, and sent it to me at no charge. Exactly as they suggested, the Benzd has worked wonderfully for me. Their stellar customer service earned them a customer for life!</li>
            <li> Have only been using this a week or so but already have noticed a decrease in the usual clogged pores i have around my cheeks and mouth... I am not a teen (!!) so i dont want to use some harsh insane drug store peroxide stuff on my face. i need something that is calming, soothing, helps get rid of irritation and blockages and at the same time prevents break-outs. This has really been effective so far. i use a small amount on problem spots after cleansing and before applying moisturizer and i&#x27;ve been really happy with it. there is no reason to use harsh chemicals on your skin... so i think this is a great, all-natural alternative. high quality and a great result so far!!</li>
            <li> This formula just feels good for my skin:  not drying, not greasy.  Yes, there is a &amp;#34;funny smell&amp;#34; as some have commented, but since I have started using it I feel my skin has benefitted.  I have tens of bottles of facial creams languishing unused in a drawer somewhere, but this is one product I know I will continue to use despite the more expensive price tag.  I&#x27;ve also purchased a couple of other products from the same company, and like them too.  I&#x27;ve started following this regimen:  Morning, after shower, Salic;  mid-day, if needed, Benzd;  and at night before bed, Retin.  It has only been a few weeks, but I feel my skin is healthier, with no breakouts and no drying or flaking skin. Very happy I found this line of products!</li>
            <li> It smells a little funny but works great.</li>
            <li> This thing has a very strong disgusting smell that makes me feel nauseous.</li>
            <li> I luv this product, I use daily and I do not break out as I did before. I am also having my teenage daughter use this in conjunction with the  Greentea wash from the same company, and her breakouts has been clearing up. I was worried that she may be too sensitive for the product but it is gentle enough and has helped her. We both will continue to use these products, because it is working.</li>
            <li> I was pretty impressed after 2 weeks of use this product is a GREAT moisturizer. My skin felt so good after using, not dry or tight at all. A plus, is it really soothes irritated, dry, red, and itchy skin. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give this a five is I didn&#x27;t think it was quite strong enough for acne. I don&#x27;t get acne to often normally around my time of the month. So it needs to be something that can keep my normally clear skin clear.</li>
            <li> Amazing!  I only have acne on my forehead and bought it just to apply there.  But, days later my forehead felt so soft I started using it on my entire face and I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> I have a tendency to get kind of grody, bumpy blackheads on my cheeks (SORRY!!) and this product has been great for releaving congestion on my skin and keeping break-outs down. I have been using it along with the other Pombrand products, the cleanser as well as an occasional mask. In the past I have used a lot of Origins and Kiehls products and I can say I think these are just as quality. In particular, I like the fact that there is a really un-scented natural feeling to them and just how brief and to the point the ingredients are - no sulfates, no creepy long chemicals, its clear that its made with extremely high quality food grade style ingredients. And thats appreciated. so yes, have been enjoying this product and have not had any skin irritation, just worrying less about breaking out!!</li>
            <li> Salic is an excellent product! Johan has hit the nail on the head with his suite of products, which manage to be non-drying and yet extremely effective acne treatments. My skin has never looked so great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Pombrand&#x27;s other products, including Clns and BenzD, alongside these Salic to achieve even better results.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. I used this for my 14yr old son who is a redhead and has sensitive skin. Other acne products I tried were so strong they actually left his skin red and raw. This softens his skin nicely while still clearing up those problem areas. Worked quickly too. Will buy again.</li>
