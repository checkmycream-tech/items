            <li>I love it.</li>

            <li>My fingers and nails are fine, and it gives me a better results.</li>
            <li>Very cool and discreet looking.</li>
            <li>Good product fast service a+++</li>
            <li>It’s really useful and is kind of a multipurpose product for me</li>
            <li>Wonderful little prodict for your lady humps :).</li>
            <li>It fits easily together though.</li>
            <li>Easy to use when applying with cream.  </li>
            <li>But it can easily be put together</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I use mine about three&lt;br /&gt;Times a week in the shower with very mild plant fiber based soap or with jojoba oil, And Massage</li>
            <li>I love that his stores easily and the massage tips on it are so soft and massage so good.</li>
            <li>The massager is fine.</li>
            <li>The design is well thought out, light and easy to move and use.</li>
            <li>I’ve read that creams are more effective when applied with a tool, and this particular massager brush mitt is great for helping the cream penetrate deep into my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Your skin is nice and soft when using with your favorite lotion or oils.  </li>
            <li>So far so good after 2 days.</li>
            <li>This cellulite massager is really great, definitely better than the other</li>
            <li>I do also practice clean eating</li>
            <li>I think using this instead of just my hand really helps products penetrate better.</li>
            <li>It broke after two days but not bad</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really sure how well this massager would work, mainly because I didn&#x27;t know what to do with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with how much progress I&#x27;ve seen in a short amount of time</li>
            <li>:)I highly recommend this cellulite massager mitt by Olabeauty.</li>
            <li>The brush is large and fits well in the palm of my hand, and the handles make it easy to grip.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li>But i can definitely see a notable difference in my skin texture and for the first time in my life i was able to wear 5&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I was really excited to use it at first but haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet.</li>
            <li>If you have trouble with cellulite, use with a cellulite soap, (Diva Stuff&#x27;s coffee, juniper, and kelp works really great for me) and leave it on your skin in the shower, while you let your conditioner soak in, and use this to maximize results.</li>
            <li>They give an amazing deep massage in and out of the shower!</li>
            <li>and it really makes my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks and my husband complimented me yesterday on how nice the backs of my thighs are looking,</li>
            <li>Did I mention I can work my body with it all day and not complain cos the touch is cool and the nub looks appealing not only in the eyes but also in the body?</li>
            <li>My sides, I use it very gently on the sides of my breasts to help tighten and lift.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my Cellulite Massager, I have only been using it</li>
            <li>I could see results after my first week.</li>
            <li>Wish the handle would not have the break in the middle, for a better grip.</li>
            <li>Also I have been working out for months now consistently</li>
            <li>I massage my thighs and buttocks twice daily and most times I will massage in a cellulite cream, if I am pushed for time I will just moisturize with my normal lotion which contains Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>I really like the after effect feeling after I massage cream in.</li>
            <li>High quality!</li>
            <li>I really can see a difference .</li>
            <li>Again, results will take time, but my skin looks so much healthier and my thigh dimples are no longer as prominent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this combinated with the gel/cream with caffeine really works</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really looking forward to seeing all of my cellulite gone with continued use.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast.</li>
            <li>This thingy is very comfortable to use and not too harsh on your skin and gently irons away</li>
            <li>and this product is super simple and helpful.</li>
            <li>Mainly on my thighs, arms and legs.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this seller and their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The nubs are really soft and spread evenly throughout the mitt and they really help stimulate blood flow.</li>
            <li>but that is normal,  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought a different cellulite massager but love this one in particular due to its handle let alone for its purpose.</li>
            <li>and although I&#x27;ve gained muscle in my legs, this is the first time I&#x27;m actually seeing the cellulite start to go away.</li>
            <li>If you really want to decrease the apperance of cellulite i think massage is the only way to go</li>
            <li>as much as i&#x27;d like to think you can do something as simple as a massager for cellulite, you can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, soft rubbery material.</li>
            <li>So I started to use this on my 39 yr old skin.</li>
            <li>Results won’t happen overnight, but be patient and consistent and you should absolutely see your skin beginning to look smoother and feeling less lumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I apply a decent amount of pressure and do notice it feels a bit sensitive in the back thigh area, but nothing that would cause me to stop using it.</li>
            <li>The pink part comes off a little to easy, that&#x27;s why I gave 4 stars, but overall I really like it!</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to be painful since I have to apply pressure in order to really rub the cellulite cream in, but this brush mitt is surprisingly tolerable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use is everyday in the shower and right after with cream or oil.</li>
            <li>And you can use it to apply essential oils and lotions the soft nubs are like tiny hands rubbing away my cellulite.</li>
            <li>I have not used the massager for a long time but so far there is improvement in appearance of the affected areas.</li>
            <li>I guess it is made to separate so that you can clean it better, but it&#x27;s annoying when it happens mid-massage.</li>
            <li>My skin seems much healthier, smoother, and my cellulite is so much less noticeable.</li>

            <li> My skin seems much healthier, smoother, and my cellulite is so much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Actually my whole body :/</li>
            <li> wanted to test this product long enough before i reviewed it.</li>
            <li> Works well in the shower as long as you lather on.  </li>
            <li> The cellulite on my hamstrings is not completely gone</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t have one of these a long time</li>
            <li> I have used with lemongrass oil and several other cellulite creams.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I expected</li>
            <li> I have noticed visible results and it&#x27;s been just a few short weeks.</li>
            <li> And the worst that could happen is that you get a nice massage at your shower!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days but wanted to give a few remarks</li>
            <li> but I have noticed a slight improvement.  </li>
            <li> Its less than $10.</li>
            <li> A previous reviewer mentioned that the nubs hurt, I guess it depends on the person&#x27;s sensitivity and amount of pressure applied.</li>
            <li> I still have a little cellulite</li>
            <li> This brush helps with cellulite but must be used everyday to see results.</li>
            <li> I am using this massager everyday for 5 to 10 mintes.</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday and have seen results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll add another review in few weeks.</li>
            <li> Took only one use to get rid out of my cellulite behind my thighs.</li>
            <li> The nubs on this massager are a firm, but flexible rubber or silicone type material.</li>
            <li> Either way I like it and will update this review in a few weeks or so.</li>
            <li> My mom got one too and has been using it on her calves to help her tired legs after a long day.</li>
            <li> This seems to really work and isn&#x27;t painful as it looks.</li>

            <li> This seems to really work and isn&#x27;t painful as it looks. If you have trouble with cellulite, use with a cellulite soap, (Diva Stuff&#x27;s coffee, juniper, and kelp works really great for me) and leave it on your skin in the shower, while you let your conditioner soak in, and use this to maximize results. I was wowed by how great they were.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I expected</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my Cellulite Massager, I have only been using it I believe three weeks but I have noticed a slight improvement.  I massage my thighs and buttocks twice daily and most times I will massage in a cellulite cream, if I am pushed for time I will just moisturize with my normal lotion which contains Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> This brush helps with cellulite but must be used everyday to see results. I have used with lemongrass oil and several other cellulite creams.</li>
            <li> Woow... Great buy! Feels so good when massage on my thighs... love it. I used with a caffeine firming scrub when shower then follow with a collagen body cream... I really like the after effect feeling after I massage cream in. will definitely recommend to a friend</li>
            <li> This is great! After using it for a few days I&#x27;ve noticed dramatic results. I regained my confidence and can wear shorts again!</li>
            <li> Good product fast service a+++</li>
            <li> The massager is fine. I&#x27;ve never used one before. If I move the massager in circles, it tends to come apart. It fits easily together though.</li>
            <li> Easy to use when applying with cream.  Only thing is if not held properly, it comes apart.  But it can easily be put together</li>
            <li> Wonderful little prodict for your lady humps :). High quality! Amazing service from the seller that helped me out grately with delivery issues. Pleasure doing bussines with you! I highly recommend this seller and their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been couple of weeks so i am adding to my review. I am using this massager everyday for 5 to 10 mintes. I could see results after my first week. This thingy is very comfortable to use and not too harsh on your skin and gently irons away bigger and smaller dimples on my thighs.  If you really want to decrease the apperance of cellulite i think massage is the only way to go and this product is super simple and helpful. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great buy!!! Works well in the shower as long as you lather on.  Wish the handle would not have the break in the middle, for a better grip.</li>
            <li> This is great! I use it almost everyday and have seen results. The pink part comes off a little to easy, that&#x27;s why I gave 4 stars, but overall I really like it!</li>
            <li> Work great. I use it on my legs in the shower for my cellulite . I really can see a difference .</li>
            <li> Sorry no changes in cellulite used it every day in shower and just waisted my time</li>
            <li> Great tool that improves the effectiveness of cellulite creams. I use it each night after showering but before drying off, and after a month, have seen definitive results to the cellulite on the back of my thighs. Results won’t happen overnight, but be patient and consistent and you should absolutely see your skin beginning to look smoother and feeling less lumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+ Perfect to pair with a cellulite cream. I’ve read that creams are more effective when applied with a tool, and this particular massager brush mitt is great for helping the cream penetrate deep into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;+ Doesn’t hurt. I was expecting it to be painful since I have to apply pressure in order to really rub the cellulite cream in, but this brush mitt is surprisingly tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;+ Easy to use. The brush is large and fits well in the palm of my hand, and the handles make it easy to grip.&lt;br /&gt;+ Very cool and discreet looking. You can’t tell it is a cellulite massager, which I was concerned about since I keep it out in the open in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:&lt;br /&gt;- Again, results will take time, but my skin looks so much healthier and my thigh dimples are no longer as prominent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this cellulite massager brush mitt for the purposes of testing and reviewing and definitely recommend it as a tool that complements cellulite creams and serums well.</li>
            <li> I have not used the massager for a long time but so far there is improvement in appearance of the affected areas. Did I mention I can work my body with it all day and not complain cos the touch is cool and the nub looks appealing not only in the eyes but also in the body?</li>
            <li> The cellulite massager works wonderfully. I use is everyday in the shower and right after with cream or oil. Some times I use it twice a day. I do also practice clean eating and I do leg strength training workouts 3x a week and do cardio 4x a week on either the bike or tredmill. I have noticed visible results and it&#x27;s been just a few short weeks. The cellulite on my hamstrings is not completely gone but it&#x27;s getting better and also there has been a noticeable difference on the sides of my thighs. I would definitely recommend adding the massager to your daily routine. Also I have been working out for months now consistently and although I&#x27;ve gained muscle in my legs, this is the first time I&#x27;m actually seeing the cellulite start to go away. The massager is working!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really sure how well this massager would work, mainly because I didn&#x27;t know what to do with it. I read up a bit about these Cellulite Massagers brush mits, and then I tried it myself. I had some essential oils at home that I decided to use with it and it felt amazing. The nubs or whatever you want to call them aren&#x27;t painful at all. I know they look like the things in crocs, but they don&#x27;t hurt at all. They give an amazing deep massage in and out of the shower! I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t have one of these a long time ago!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this item at a promotional rate in exchange for an honest &amp; unbiased review*</li>
            <li> **I did NOT recieve this product on promotion. This is an unbiased review.**&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to test this product long enough before i reviewed it. To provide some context, I am a size zero 115 pound woman who used to be size 16 and 185 pounds 4 years ago. I am also a fitness instructor now. But cellulite has been a problem all my life no matter what size i have been. And all the workouts in the world did not help me get rid of it!&lt;br /&gt;This product was amazing. I have used it once a day in the shower fro about a month now. It is no magical miracle product that turned my skin to porcelain. But i can definitely see a notable difference in my skin texture and for the first time in my life i was able to wear 5&amp;#34; shorts!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re wondering if you should get this, I would say definitely give it a try. Its less than $10. And the worst that could happen is that you get a nice massage at your shower!</li>
            <li> This massager by Beauty is fantastic! It is light and the nubs do not hurt you or skin and allows for good blood flow to the areas in which you are using them.  Your skin is nice and soft when using with your favorite lotion or oils.  The nubs allows better penetration of the product you are using. I personally use a cellulite cream and I can honestly see a difference with in a couple of weeks.  I am thoroughly impressed with it!  It fits so nicely in your hand!  I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> probably will update my review later. Ive been using it now for a week and ill see the result in a month and see what it can do.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use! I use it every day in the shower and it is helping reduce the visibility of the cellulites! Love it!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1DE48QOG1N389]]I have had quite noticeable results since I started using this product.  My skin seems much healthier, smoother, and my cellulite is so much less noticeable. Definitely looking forward to see what will happen as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this to use on my dog when I bathe her. It works perfectly and she loves it.</li>
            <li> This cellulite massager is really great, definitely better than the other’s I’ve tried. It’s really useful and is kind of a multipurpose product for me, I use it in the shower as well with an exfoliating body wash and it really makes my skin nice and soft. I think using this instead of just my hand really helps products penetrate better. The nubs are really soft and spread evenly throughout the mitt and they really help stimulate blood flow. My mom got one too and has been using it on her calves to help her tired legs after a long day. The design is well thought out, light and easy to move and use. You can use it with a caffeine/retinol cellulite cream or in the shower with an defoliator or just your favorite lotion. I really like this product and its awesome utility for the price. Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> It fell apart soon as I opened the package.</li>
            <li> I rated it a 3 because I feel I still need time with this product. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for 2 weeks with a skin firming cellulite gel. I was really excited to use it at first but haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet. I&#x27;m going to be using it longer and hopefully notice changes in my cellulite. I&#x27;ll add another review in few weeks. I do like that it&#x27;s easy to use and feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve searched some products for eliminate cellulite too expensive or others didnt work at all, and this combinated with the gel/cream with caffeine really works I&#x27;ve only used it for 10 days and I can see some diference I can wait to see how will it works in a weeks.</li>
            <li> It broke after two days but not bad it&#x27;s helpful  lol</li>
            <li> Every night before I shower I use this to massage coconut oil into my thighs. I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks and my husband complimented me yesterday on how nice the backs of my thighs are looking, so I know it&#x27;s working. I do circular motions for about 10 minutes to massage all of the oil into the skin and then shower to remove any toxins that were released. I&#x27;m really happy with how much progress I&#x27;ve seen in a short amount of time and I&#x27;m really looking forward to seeing all of my cellulite gone with continued use.</li>
            <li> (Using my husband&#x27;s account on here) - I don&#x27;t have cellulite, but I use body scrab 3 times a week after Gym and it was hard for me to use fingers and it ruined my nails. So I use this instead and I am happy with it. My fingers and nails are fine, and it gives me a better results. As mentioned I don&#x27;t have cellulite, so i can&#x27;t comment on that!</li>
            <li> Works well and I use it in the shower after my wirkouts</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t do anything. as much as i&#x27;d like to think you can do something as simple as a massager for cellulite, you can&#x27;t. there is no such thing. it&#x27;s a fact.</li>
            <li> Took only one use to get rid out of my cellulite behind my thighs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a different cellulite massager but love this one in particular due to its handle let alone for its purpose. I use mine about three&lt;br /&gt;Times a week in the shower with very mild plant fiber based soap or with jojoba oil, And Massage Until I Feel A Tingling Sensation, That&#x27;s How I know There&#x27;s Increased Blood flow. I noticed it gives me small bruises but that is normal,  it&#x27;s tightened my skin and helped my problem areas such as My Outer thighs, Waist line, hips, My sides, I use it very gently on the sides of my breasts to help tighten and lift. I still have a little cellulite but it&#x27;s helped my hard to tone areas.</li>
            <li> I purchased this massager to use with a cellulite cream. I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days but wanted to give a few remarks, I will update when I&#x27;ve used it a bit longer. The nubs on this massager are a firm, but flexible rubber or silicone type material. They feel pretty good when rubbing in circular motions on the thighs and stomach. A previous reviewer mentioned that the nubs hurt, I guess it depends on the person&#x27;s sensitivity and amount of pressure applied. I apply a decent amount of pressure and do notice it feels a bit sensitive in the back thigh area, but nothing that would cause me to stop using it. I&#x27;ve only rated it 4 stars because the white handle part keeps separating from the bottom piece. I guess it is made to separate so that you can clean it better, but it&#x27;s annoying when it happens mid-massage. Either way I like it and will update this review in a few weeks or so.</li>
            <li> At last I found the perfect massager brush! Great design and a strong handle. The packaging too is great which is a nice bonus. And you can use it to apply essential oils and lotions the soft nubs are like tiny hands rubbing away my cellulite. :)I highly recommend this cellulite massager mitt by Olabeauty.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast. Didn&#x27;t think mail would be delivered on a Sunday but it was.  I&#x27;m satifisfied with my order  I love the brisels on the brush. Doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, soft rubbery material.</li>
            <li> So I started to use this on my 39 yr old skin. Mainly on my thighs, arms and legs. Actually my whole body :/ lol. I&#x27;ve been going in a circular motion along with cellulite cream that I got through Amazon, that contains retinol and caffeine. So far so good after 2 days. I will update in 2 wks my progress.</li>
            <li> This anti-cellulite massager is so amazing. I love it. I use it every day after I take a shower to help me reduce the chances of getting cellulite on my body. I was given this anti-cellulite massager at a discounted price and he stayed for my honest review. I love that his stores easily and the massage tips on it are so soft and massage so good.</li>
            <li> the wife likes it and says it works well......</li>
