    <ol>
            <li> New and Works very good. Been taking it for about 2 years, ,Dr. Tested, by my Dr. very good. The best.</li>
            <li> I know these pills help. Best of all, they are all natual. I don&#x27;t believe in taking prescription drugs, I prefer to go all natural if I can help it.</li>
            <li> When the Health Fair comes around for another blood analysis next April, I will see if it has helped with my cholestrol!</li>
            <li> Used these religiously for a long time (about 18 months), and had cholesterol tested every 3 months.  Made zero difference.</li>
            <li> A nutritionist recommended that I take this.  I have no way of knowing what would happen if I stopped taking it.  There is no reason for me to give this anything but 5 stars based on the great price  .  The product certainly does not disagree with me.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a few weeks and my doctor ordered a lipid test.  My total cholesterol was below 200.  The HDL was within range but the LDL was a little high.  Also for the first time ever my triglycerides were a little high.</li>
            <li> Doctor recommended Cholest Off  and is satisfied with improvement in cholesterol so a prescription is not required. Have been using continuously for 6 years.</li>
            <li> After trying several &amp;#34;statins&amp;#34; by prescription with adverse side effects my doctor suggested to try this Natural Product.  It dropped my Cholestol with NO side effects</li>
            <li> Doc says keep up the good work and I have been off Lipitor for the last month or so.  Herbal is the way to go.</li>
            <li> So glad to still find these tablets, as all I see at Costo now is the caplets. They can be messy in ones pocket.</li>
            <li> This product hopefully safely allows me to keep cholesterol down, yet not starve off all foods of a normal diet!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and all of a sudden it&#x27;s not available in my area. I was very pleased to find that Amazon carried it and I didn&#x27;t have to go thru the hassle of finding a new product that works for me. I cannot take prescription drugs for Cholesterol and CholestOff works very well for me.</li>
            <li> Killer statins were never an option but our MD thought that a change in lifestyle might be in order to lower cholesterol.  He knew that he did not make our health decisions, but that we do.  This was tried because all we had to lose4 was cholesterol and we liked the idea that it is made from natural plant by-products.  The good doctor was astonished, that after three months cholesterol went from 248 to 216.  Work is continuing to get it below the magic number of 200.  I am not a health provider so cannot definitively &amp;#34;recommend&amp;#34; this for anyone.  It worked for us.  Talk to your provider but you make the decision, not him or her.</li>
            <li> I take other cholesterol-lowering supplements, but these are a great bargain, and I have recently gone off statins.  I get bloodwork in a month -- check back for comments.  Red Rice Yeast has similar properties to statins; not recommended.</li>
            <li> Our Sams Club stopped carrying this product. My husband&#x27;s doctor told him he could use it if it works at keeping his Cholesteral count down. It does work. So, after learning the hard way by not checking Amazon first, I checked and there it was. Exactly what he needed. Thanks, Amazon.</li>
            <li> My opthamologist suggested these ... my cardiologist swears by them!!  My cholesterol numbers dropped a little over 10% - but as the saying goes, &amp;#34;your mileage may vary, season to taste.&amp;#34;  What else need be said?  [;\}</li>
            <li> Although I was not on prescribed medication, I found my cholesterol slowly creeping upward.  After 3 months on CholestOff I was back in the normal range.  I have not experienced any issues that other reviewers reported.  Worth a try.</li>
            <li> I have been taking Cholest Off for a good six months in conjunction with prescription medication for high cholesterol.  My numbers are well within normal.  Therefore I can recommend this product to be used for cholesterol control.</li>
            <li> I have just started using this product and can&#x27;t report on any details yet.  Hopefully by the end of another month I will see some result.</li>
            <li> My wife had very high levels of Cholesterol, according to blood tests the doctor ordered. From continuing blood tests my wife takes yearly, and while she&#x27;s taking cholestoff, her Tryglycerides level had slowly fell to a now acceptable level, according to her doctor. She continues to take cholestoff and will not stop.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  Always bought at the drugstore, but found as a Prime member it is cheaper on Amazon.  I don&#x27;t have high cholesterol, so I use it to help maintain what I have.</li>
            <li> great quality, great delivery</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time for my cholesterol problem and it helps keep the numbers under control.  Thanks will be ordering again on this one.</li>
            <li> I was on statins (try to avoid at all costs) and was having the usual muscular myopathy side effects. Hated them! So I weaned off those and started dosing with this product. On 23 Jan, my cholesterol total was 255 and 90 days later I dropped 20 points to 235! Slow change, but zero side effects! My triglycerides fell from 147 to 119, LDL dropped from 191 to 180 and my VLDL fell from 29 to 23. The only unfortunate thing was that my HDL fell by a small 3 points as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could say that I was dieting better, but I have not been. I have been exercising more consistently, but that is all. I will update on my next lipid panel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMOR- I have been taking this with Natures Way Choline and Inositol, 250 mg.</li>
