            <li>This primer gets RAVE reviews...almost too good to be true, on here and on Makeup Alley.  </li>
            <li>and it goes on  very smooth.</li>

            <li>It makes your makeup look better.  </li>
            <li>This is a most have.  </li>
            <li>All better than this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also found better oil-control primers for all-day wear.</li>
            <li>This is the best Arbonne product and the only one I would purchase from that brand besides the RE9 toner.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s one of my favorite Arbonne</li>
            <li>Aside from that, I love the texture.</li>
            <li>I love this product, and the way my makeup goes on when I use it.</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>

            <li>love the smoothness of this product.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>This is a very wonderful product and I recommend not only this product but all of Arbonne products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to Avon Magix - after trying probably 20 primers it is the best I&#x27;ve found out there.</li>
            <li>One plus this product has that most others don&#x27;t, is the fact that you can use it on your eyelids and your liner and shadow go on like silk.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I will by more.</li>
            <li>People even commented on how lovely my skin was.  </li>
            <li>Works best when allowed to set/dry for a for a while prior to concealer and foundation.</li>
            <li>Helps reduce my shine for most of my work day (5 hrs or so).</li>
            <li>My favorite primer.  </li>
            <li>After trying many primers none compare to this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard many consultants refer to the primer as \\&quot;liquid silk.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>This product is simply fabulous!  </li>
            <li>:  )  </li>
            <li>I am enjoying the make-up primer.</li>
            <li>The primer enhances my foundation, which goes on more evenly.</li>
            <li>It makes my make-up look a 100% better</li>
            <li>I tried this with my mineral makeup and it worked JUST ok.</li>
            <li>i changed to another brand of foundation (liquid) and it seems to work much better with this one.</li>
            <li>Unless it proves to be a superior product with my skin, i probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>I love Arbonne, but I will no longer be spending $40 for something I can get for $7 at the drug store..</li>
            <li>I love this premier.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and I was so glad that I can get it here and not  have to go through Arbonne.</li>
            <li>I love this primer from Arbonne.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok to me.</li>
            <li>Love it,use it all the time,would not put on makeup without it,great product.</li>
            <li>I love the way this product makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>Love this primer.</li>
            <li>My order arrived promptly and the packaging of the product was very well done to assure that the bottles would not break in shipping!!!!  </li>
            <li>Thanks for being consistently the best company with whom&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have bought cheap $7 dollar primer at drug stores that work better.</li>
            <li>Makes my face look smooth and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I love this primer, it creates a smooth face while helping to cover imperfections.</li>
            <li>Arbonne makeup primer feels so good on your face and your foundation goes on so much easier.</li>
            <li>I was so thrilled that I ordered another one right away.</li>

            <li>The primer goes on so easily and my makeup stays on all day.  </li>
            <li>Smooth soft , just great.  </li>
            <li>If you want an average primer, this is your best bet.</li>
            <li>very smooth and absorbs into skin quickly creating a smooth surface for your foundation&#x27;</li>
            <li>I selected the Arbonne product from a list of the top primers available, and I am pleased that I like&lt;br /&gt;it very much.</li>
            <li>Arbonne Primer makes a huge barrier between my skin and makeup so the makeup will not stay on my skin.</li>
            <li>This is  a great product, and the only reason it is a 4 rather than a 5 is because of the cost, but it is Arbonne.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>i have never used a product that makes your makeup glide on so smooth, and leave your skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>It makes my face silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough great things about these products.</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on so smooth.</li>
            <li>it makes my arbonne foundation look so smooth and even</li>
            <li>This product make the makeup go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Helps the make in go on smoothly and stay on longer.</li>
            <li>The Arbonne creates an extremely smooth surface on your skin allowing easier application of anything else that goes on after it.  </li>
            <li>make up goes on smoothly and stays in place</li>
            <li>Arbonne is light, it controls shine on my face with its matte finish, and it has never made me break out.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Fantastic primer.  </li>
            <li>This product is light weight and breathable.</li>
            <li>and I like the &#x27;light weight&#x27; texture of this product.</li>
            <li>This stuff goes on really smooth.</li>
            <li>(  It is so smooth and makes your foundation just glide on.</li>
            <li>Glides on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Makes makeup go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>This primer really works!!!</li>
            <li>Read reviews on this product and was excited to order it.  </li>
            <li>that makes it worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this primer and have been an avid Arbonne user for years...</li>
            <li>they stopped selling at the salon she patronizes, glad we were able to get it on a new year special.</li>
            <li>.Makes my face feel very smooth and soft, love it under makeup</li>
            <li>Arbonne primer is a must to be used with Arbonne foundation, the primer makes it much easier to apply the foundation,but most important it smoothies the skin.</li>
            <li>This primer is nothing special and my face was greasy within an hour.  </li>
            <li>Even though this product worked better than Rimmel at first, it isn&#x27;t worth the buy at 2x the price.</li>
            <li>and so far it has been a nice addition to my make-up kit.</li>
            <li>, my acne has become more aggressive and my pores are really clogged.  </li>
            <li>my make-up went on so much smoother and more evenly.</li>
            <li>Thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li>I like it very much feels smooth</li>
            <li>A bit pricey but worth it to use on special occasions.</li>
            <li>Nice product I like leave the skin feeling fresh and clean .i would definitely buy I again  </li>
            <li>, I always much say something about the fine service that Amazon provides.</li>
            <li>I would recommend Airbonne Primer to anyone who wants their makeup to look smooth</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin silky smooth and ready for foundation.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face smooth and ready to apply make-up.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>This seems really basic and not that effective.</li>
            <li>They have ingredients that are natural and healthy without the worry of toxic substances I hear about on the news.</li>
            <li>The primer at the start was fresh</li>
            <li>Worth every cent.</li>
            <li>I work 12 hour night shifts, and this primer leaves my face looking just as fresh when i leave in the morning, as when i showed up for work the night before.</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s more natural, too.</li>
            <li>Makeup glides right on after this primer.</li>
            <li>Everybody needs this &amp; your price is right.</li>
            <li>I loved it, so I wrote down the name of it</li>
            <li>Best make up primer of the many I&#x27;ve tried the past few years.</li>
            <li>With the primer, my brush seems to glide right over my skin and gives my face almost a smooth appearance (which I am far from having).</li>
            <li>I love this primer, it makes my skin feel smoother and makes applying my daily make-up easier.</li>
            <li>The product does exactly what I needed it to.</li>
            <li>it really helps with oil control!</li>
            <li>and it really keeps it on!</li>
            <li>When I first started using this product (which is somewhat oily)</li>
            <li>Its about $25.00 more than others with the same quality.</li>
            <li>I would not think about putting on my makeup without using primer first.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>i also started using a mattifier as my first application, so maybe that also</li>
            <li>I never used a primer before, so this was my first time using Arbonne and primer.</li>
            <li>Soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>Just exactly as stated.</li>
            <li>Makes skin feel more supple, but doesn&#x27;t do much for fine lines or uneven skin tones, which is why I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>I decided to buy this primer after reading all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Some are mere liquids; this is a lovely gel and provides a smooth surface for any type of makeup to be applied on top.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used primer for a few years now,but this one is by far the best I have tried.</li>
            <li>Its super silky and not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin, and this primer doesn&#x27;t upset it at all</li>
            <li>The Smashbox that I normally use is much better, and you can actually feel the barrier it leaves between your skin and the product.  </li>
            <li>and I was very particular on certain things I would put on my face.</li>
            <li>I will certainly repurchase.</li>
            <li>Very high quality.</li>
            <li>I also will have a HUGE $300+ Giveaway only for my subscribers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes I apply it to my face before the foundation, sometimes I mix it with the foundation depending on how much coverage I want.  </li>
            <li>Its much cheaper, easier, and faster to buy it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>These Arbonne products have really been a stand-out.</li>
            <li>Looks so much better.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>helps my eyeliner to not run as fast</li>
            <li>I earned this product free for hosting an event in February, and I still am using the same bottle!</li>
            <li>My skin is very oily</li>
            <li>and I have tried it on my very oily skin.  </li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T USE TOO MUCH</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>It also made my skin feel very silky and soft!!!</li>
            <li>and I had heard of Arbonne several years ago as being one of the more natural, high end lines</li>
            <li>i had received this product at an airbonne party, ordered it previously and love it.</li>
            <li>the first 3 ingredients in this primer are the EXACT same ingredients in Lanacane Anti-Chafing gel.</li>
            <li>Try some of the highly rated ones instead.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had blemishes since high school.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous facial primers and this is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this was new, came w/o box and primer was all around the rim when I opened it.</li>
            <li>It goes on very soft.  </li>
            <li>This is the first product in my life that controls the oil for the ENTIRE day!</li>
            <li>I got the exact same results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nothing short of a miracle as I&#x27;ve always been self conscious of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used lots of primers and was really surprised by this one.  </li>
            <li>and so I don&#x27;t expect any product to get rid of that completely.</li>
            <li>Definitely the silky feeling everyone raves about which helped my make up once applied so much smoother.</li>
            <li>It just glides across your face, leaving your skin so soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for nearly two years</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin; prone to breakouts and this product does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>Arbonne isn&#x27;t so natural, as they would like us all to believe.</li>
            <li>It is velvetly soft no odor, goes on the skin like a layer of silk.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Kept my makeup on for at least 2-3 more hours.  </li>
            <li>I am a 34 year old woman who has a ton of sun damage and when I put this primer on...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather use a plain light moisturizer than this.</li>
            <li>Usually I use Rimmel primer with success, but the tubes run out fast.  </li>
            <li>well worth it because it lasts such a long time before running out.</li>
            <li>This product is definitely nothing special at all and is a typical, run of the mill silicone feeling based product.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use make up much at all so the only thing I have to compare it to is the Bare Minerals Re-ver Upper.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I also have sensitive skin and have to be wary of new products as many cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>Great product, highly recommend as a base for makeup</li>
            <li>I would say it is almost identical to Smashbox&#x27;s primer (the regular clear one).  </li>
            <li>Light, need only a small amount.  </li>
            <li>Also does not prevent my skin from getting oily and barely changes the look or my pores.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, though, and found that using it regularly, every day for several days, started causing minor break-outs.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s product goes on smooth and you only need a small dot to cover your face!</li>
            <li>One important thing is it only takes a very small drop to go a long way.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is by far, the best primer I have ever tried!</li>
            <li> By far the best primer on the market.  </li>
            <li> this is an awesome product, been using it for several years and it really leaves a flawless look and is not greasy</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on smoothly and stays looking good all day.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best primer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many primers and this is the best by far.</li>
            <li> First time trying this product, happy with it and the timelyness of the shipment.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> This primer gets RAVE reviews...almost too good to be true, on here and on Makeup Alley.  </li>
            <li> and it goes on  very smooth.</li>
            <li> When applying foundation after primer, the end result is a very smooth complexion.  </li>
            <li> It is very light on your skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> It makes your makeup look better.  </li>
            <li> This is a most have.  </li>
            <li> All better than this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found better oil-control primers for all-day wear.</li>
            <li> This is the best Arbonne product and the only one I would purchase from that brand besides the RE9 toner.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s one of my favorite Arbonne</li>
            <li> Aside from that, I love the texture.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and the way my makeup goes on when I use it.</li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> I try out so many products over a months time.</li>
            <li> I just love this makeup primer.</li>
            <li> I have used many primers over the years and just about gave up on them.</li>
            <li> love the smoothness of this product.</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> This is a very wonderful product and I recommend not only this product but all of Arbonne products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to Avon Magix - after trying probably 20 primers it is the best I&#x27;ve found out there.</li>
            <li> One plus this product has that most others don&#x27;t, is the fact that you can use it on your eyelids and your liner and shadow go on like silk.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I will by more.</li>
            <li> People even commented on how lovely my skin was.  </li>
            <li> Works best when allowed to set/dry for a for a while prior to concealer and foundation.</li>
            <li> Helps reduce my shine for most of my work day (5 hrs or so).</li>
            <li> My favorite primer.  </li>
            <li> After trying many primers none compare to this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard many consultants refer to the primer as \\&quot;liquid silk.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This product is simply fabulous!  </li>
            <li> :  )  </li>
            <li> I am enjoying the make-up primer.</li>
            <li> The primer enhances my foundation, which goes on more evenly.</li>
            <li> It makes my make-up look a 100% better</li>
            <li> I tried this with my mineral makeup and it worked JUST ok.</li>
            <li> i changed to another brand of foundation (liquid) and it seems to work much better with this one.</li>
            <li> Unless it proves to be a superior product with my skin, i probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love Arbonne, but I will no longer be spending $40 for something I can get for $7 at the drug store..</li>
            <li> I love this premier.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and I was so glad that I can get it here and not  have to go through Arbonne.</li>
            <li> I love this primer from Arbonne.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok to me.</li>
            <li> Love it,use it all the time,would not put on makeup without it,great product.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Love this primer.</li>
            <li> My order arrived promptly and the packaging of the product was very well done to assure that the bottles would not break in shipping!!!!  </li>
            <li> Thanks for being consistently the best company with whom&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have bought cheap $7 dollar primer at drug stores that work better.</li>
            <li> Makes my face look smooth and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I love this primer, it creates a smooth face while helping to cover imperfections.</li>
            <li> Arbonne makeup primer feels so good on your face and your foundation goes on so much easier.</li>
            <li> I was so thrilled that I ordered another one right away.</li>
            <li> I like the product for special occasions--it makes my skin very smooth and silky.  </li>

            <li> Smooth soft , just great.  </li>
            <li> If you want an average primer, this is your best bet.</li>
            <li> very smooth and absorbs into skin quickly creating a smooth surface for your foundation&#x27;</li>
            <li> I selected the Arbonne product from a list of the top primers available, and I am pleased that I like&lt;br /&gt;it very much.</li>
            <li> Arbonne Primer makes a huge barrier between my skin and makeup so the makeup will not stay on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is  a great product, and the only reason it is a 4 rather than a 5 is because of the cost, but it is Arbonne.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> i have never used a product that makes your makeup glide on so smooth, and leave your skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> It makes my face silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough great things about these products.</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on so smooth.</li>
            <li> it makes my arbonne foundation look so smooth and even</li>
            <li> This product make the makeup go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Helps the make in go on smoothly and stay on longer.</li>
            <li> The Arbonne creates an extremely smooth surface on your skin allowing easier application of anything else that goes on after it.  </li>
            <li> make up goes on smoothly and stays in place</li>
            <li> Arbonne is light, it controls shine on my face with its matte finish, and it has never made me break out.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Fantastic primer.  </li>
            <li> This product is light weight and breathable.</li>
            <li> and I like the &#x27;light weight&#x27; texture of this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff goes on really smooth.</li>
            <li> (  It is so smooth and makes your foundation just glide on.</li>
            <li> Glides on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Makes makeup go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> This primer really works!!!</li>
            <li> Read reviews on this product and was excited to order it.  </li>
            <li> that makes it worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this primer and have been an avid Arbonne user for years...</li>
            <li> they stopped selling at the salon she patronizes, glad we were able to get it on a new year special.</li>
            <li> .Makes my face feel very smooth and soft, love it under makeup</li>
            <li> Arbonne primer is a must to be used with Arbonne foundation, the primer makes it much easier to apply the foundation,but most important it smoothies the skin.</li>
            <li> This primer is nothing special and my face was greasy within an hour.  </li>
            <li> Even though this product worked better than Rimmel at first, it isn&#x27;t worth the buy at 2x the price.</li>
            <li> and so far it has been a nice addition to my make-up kit.</li>
            <li> , my acne has become more aggressive and my pores are really clogged.  </li>
            <li> my make-up went on so much smoother and more evenly.</li>
            <li> Thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li> I like it very much feels smooth</li>
            <li> A bit pricey but worth it to use on special occasions.</li>
            <li> Nice product I like leave the skin feeling fresh and clean .i would definitely buy I again  </li>
            <li> , I always much say something about the fine service that Amazon provides.</li>
            <li> I would recommend Airbonne Primer to anyone who wants their makeup to look smooth</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin silky smooth and ready for foundation.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face smooth and ready to apply make-up.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> This seems really basic and not that effective.</li>
            <li> They have ingredients that are natural and healthy without the worry of toxic substances I hear about on the news.</li>
            <li> The primer at the start was fresh</li>
            <li> Worth every cent.</li>
            <li> I work 12 hour night shifts, and this primer leaves my face looking just as fresh when i leave in the morning, as when i showed up for work the night before.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s more natural, too.</li>
            <li> Makeup glides right on after this primer.</li>
            <li> Everybody needs this &amp; your price is right.</li>
            <li> I loved it, so I wrote down the name of it</li>
            <li> Best make up primer of the many I&#x27;ve tried the past few years.</li>
            <li> With the primer, my brush seems to glide right over my skin and gives my face almost a smooth appearance (which I am far from having).</li>
            <li> I love this primer, it makes my skin feel smoother and makes applying my daily make-up easier.</li>
            <li> The product does exactly what I needed it to.</li>
            <li> it really helps with oil control!</li>
            <li> and it really keeps it on!</li>
            <li> When I first started using this product (which is somewhat oily)</li>
            <li> Its about $25.00 more than others with the same quality.</li>
            <li> I would not think about putting on my makeup without using primer first.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> i also started using a mattifier as my first application, so maybe that also</li>
            <li> I never used a primer before, so this was my first time using Arbonne and primer.</li>
            <li> Soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> Just exactly as stated.</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel more supple, but doesn&#x27;t do much for fine lines or uneven skin tones, which is why I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> I decided to buy this primer after reading all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Some are mere liquids; this is a lovely gel and provides a smooth surface for any type of makeup to be applied on top.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used primer for a few years now,but this one is by far the best I have tried.</li>
            <li> Its super silky and not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin, and this primer doesn&#x27;t upset it at all</li>
            <li> The Smashbox that I normally use is much better, and you can actually feel the barrier it leaves between your skin and the product.  </li>
            <li> and I was very particular on certain things I would put on my face.</li>
            <li> I will certainly repurchase.</li>
            <li> Very high quality.</li>
            <li> I also will have a HUGE $300+ Giveaway only for my subscribers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes I apply it to my face before the foundation, sometimes I mix it with the foundation depending on how much coverage I want.  </li>
            <li> Its much cheaper, easier, and faster to buy it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> These Arbonne products have really been a stand-out.</li>
            <li> Looks so much better.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> helps my eyeliner to not run as fast</li>
            <li> I earned this product free for hosting an event in February, and I still am using the same bottle!</li>
            <li> My skin is very oily</li>
            <li> and I have tried it on my very oily skin.  </li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T USE TOO MUCH</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> It also made my skin feel very silky and soft!!!</li>
            <li> and I had heard of Arbonne several years ago as being one of the more natural, high end lines</li>
            <li> i had received this product at an airbonne party, ordered it previously and love it.</li>
            <li> the first 3 ingredients in this primer are the EXACT same ingredients in Lanacane Anti-Chafing gel.</li>
            <li> Try some of the highly rated ones instead.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had blemishes since high school.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous facial primers and this is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this was new, came w/o box and primer was all around the rim when I opened it.</li>
            <li> It goes on very soft.  </li>
            <li> This is the first product in my life that controls the oil for the ENTIRE day!</li>
            <li> I got the exact same results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nothing short of a miracle as I&#x27;ve always been self conscious of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of primers and was really surprised by this one.  </li>
            <li> and so I don&#x27;t expect any product to get rid of that completely.</li>
            <li> Definitely the silky feeling everyone raves about which helped my make up once applied so much smoother.</li>
            <li> It just glides across your face, leaving your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for nearly two years</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin; prone to breakouts and this product does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Arbonne isn&#x27;t so natural, as they would like us all to believe.</li>
            <li> It is velvetly soft no odor, goes on the skin like a layer of silk.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Kept my makeup on for at least 2-3 more hours.  </li>
            <li> I am a 34 year old woman who has a ton of sun damage and when I put this primer on...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather use a plain light moisturizer than this.</li>
            <li> Usually I use Rimmel primer with success, but the tubes run out fast.  </li>
            <li> well worth it because it lasts such a long time before running out.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely nothing special at all and is a typical, run of the mill silicone feeling based product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use make up much at all so the only thing I have to compare it to is the Bare Minerals Re-ver Upper.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I also have sensitive skin and have to be wary of new products as many cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> Great product, highly recommend as a base for makeup</li>
            <li> I would say it is almost identical to Smashbox&#x27;s primer (the regular clear one).  </li>
            <li> Light, need only a small amount.  </li>
            <li> Also does not prevent my skin from getting oily and barely changes the look or my pores.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, though, and found that using it regularly, every day for several days, started causing minor break-outs.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s product goes on smooth and you only need a small dot to cover your face!</li>
            <li> One important thing is it only takes a very small drop to go a long way.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly because my nose is an oil slick - within 5 minutes of putting on any oil control make up my nose becomes shiny.</li>
            <li> bottle will probably last nearly a year because it just takes a small amount for each application.</li>
            <li> That was a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, so I expected this to help keep the shine away and help keep my makeup from melting off by mid morning....</li>
            <li> I no longer have to worry about my skin getting dry or my foundation cracking after a long day.</li>
            <li> skin is dry, but I do break out on my cheeks occassionally.  </li>
            <li> I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> I do recommend this to everyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Cheesy, yes, but also TRUE.</li>
            <li> I agree with previous reviewers who said the products feels like silk when going on your face and dries instantly.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected.  </li>
            <li> Opened the box and tried to squirt product out of the container...container was empty.</li>
            <li> but if used efficiently, it can last you a few months.</li>
            <li> - I tried this product because it&#x27;s expensive and from a good name, and expensive brand name beauty products supposedly impress.  </li>
            <li> My face no longer feels dry!!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It takes very little to make a big difference in applying makeup.</li>
            <li> It made my combination skin slick within an hour, my makeup on my cheeks streaked, my skin by my nose turned red and irritated.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t cover shine &amp; pores like other reported it did plus after 3hrs of applying it my face</li>
            <li> This product only takes a small pea size and my face absorbs it so well underneath my foundation.</li>
            <li> This stuff made my eyelids and surrounding area so dry and irritated that they cracked and bled for a few days.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time thankfully because I was going without it for a few days and my skin felt so dry</li>
            <li> It is certainly not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love this base.</li>
            <li> This was a reorder based on previous use.  </li>
            <li> but as I got half way thru the bottle it lacked freshness and the glide effect of makeup application</li>
            <li> wish it was a little cheaper .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other primers in the past and this seems like all the others</li>
            <li> A little pricy but</li>
            <li> I was disappointed the round container has been changed to lesser quality and more difficult to dispense.  </li>
            <li> The primer is a little expensive but a little goes a long way and it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> This company contacted me through Twitter and offered to send a few items for me to try.</li>
            <li> The bottle it comes in is bulky/heavy and does not fit in my makeup case.</li>
            <li> so I have trouble with makeup staying on all day.</li>
            <li> Not sure why, but the bottle I ordered had a very runny consistency and made me break out bad.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why the texture of the product changed.  </li>
            <li> It has never been &amp;#34;runny&amp;#34; in the past.  </li>
            <li> Usually my flaws will bleed through about bookish and I have touch up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small bottle</li>
            <li> I have used a number of primers over the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> but I have a hard time finding it:</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, it broke me out in little whiteheads around my nose.  </li>
            <li> Allows make up to be evenly distributed in a thin layer.  </li>
            <li> I was using a $60 primer, which was ridiculously priced!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> MUST HAVE to wear under your makeup.  Without it my makeup feels cakey.  With the primer, my brush seems to glide right over my skin and gives my face almost a smooth appearance (which I am far from having).</li>
            <li> I have tried other primer products and this is the best! It&#x27;s product goes on smooth and you only need a small dot to cover your face!</li>
            <li> This primer dries almost instantly and i can apply my makeup...powder or liquid.  This does not aggravate acne and helps provide great coverage when used with foundation!</li>
            <li> It took forever to get the pump started working. I only got 3 or 4 appliciations out.  Now it is stuck again.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected.  Heard about this product through a coworker who was using the primer.  Decided to give it a try myself and so far it has been a nice addition to my make-up kit.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this was new, came w/o box and primer was all around the rim when I opened it.</li>
            <li> I love this primer, it makes my skin feel smoother and makes applying my daily make-up easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many primers and this is the best by far.</li>
            <li> This is  a great product, and the only reason it is a 4 rather than a 5 is because of the cost, but it is Arbonne.  The product does exactly what I needed it to.</li>
            <li> For some reason this arrived and it is a tad runny.  Not sure why the texture of the product changed.  It has never been &amp;#34;runny&amp;#34; in the past.  Very disappointed with this shipment.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Will not put my makeup on without it.</li>
            <li> This is by far, the best primer I have ever tried!</li>
            <li> By far the best primer on the market.  I have been using for over two years.  It goes on smooth. It feels like silk on your skin.  It makes your makeup look better.  You can tell when I don&#x27;t wear.  It is worth every penny.  This is a most have.  Love my arbonne primer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of primers and was really surprised by this one.  It made my combination skin slick within an hour, my makeup on my cheeks streaked, my skin by my nose turned red and irritated.  Try some of the highly rated ones instead.  Another company makes one with a mattifying agent which I now use only on my nose in the summer; and a well-known makeup-artist brand has a radiance one that gives your skin a lit from within glow.  All better than this.  This seems really basic and not that effective.</li>
            <li> ordered this for my relative. they stopped selling at the salon she patronizes, glad we were able to get it on a new year special.</li>
            <li> I like the product for special occasions--it makes my skin very smooth and silky.  I have very oily skin, though, and found that using it regularly, every day for several days, started causing minor break-outs.  I&#x27;ve also found better oil-control primers for all-day wear.</li>
            <li> this is an awesome product, been using it for several years and it really leaves a flawless look and is not greasy</li>
            <li> I agree with previous reviewers who said the products feels like silk when going on your face and dries instantly. Not a lot is needed. I use it mainly because my nose is an oil slick - within 5 minutes of putting on any oil control make up my nose becomes shiny. I can&#x27;t keep caking on powder and it is tiring to use the blue squares to wipe off the oil. This is the first product in my life that controls the oil for the ENTIRE day! It&#x27;s really nothing short of a miracle as I&#x27;ve always been self conscious of it. Though as soon as I take it off here comes the shine again so no prolonged results unfortunately. It also does keep my make up from sliding in off.This is the best Arbonne product and the only one I would purchase from that brand besides the RE9 toner.</li>
            <li> it really helps with oil control! I would have my makeup on for 7-8 hours a day and it really keeps it on!</li>
            <li> Not sure why, but the bottle I ordered had a very runny consistency and made me break out bad.  I have used this product for years and never had any issue.  I just threw it away and bought another one elsewhere.  Problem solved.</li>
            <li> i had received this product at an airbonne party, ordered it previously and love it. i have never used a product that makes your makeup glide on so smooth, and leave your skin so smooth. it isn&#x27;t greasy and continues to improve the feeling of your skin with use.</li>
            <li> I have been using Arbonne Makeup Primer for about 5 years and it&#x27;s one of my favorite Arbonne products.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I apply it to my face before the foundation, sometimes I mix it with the foundation depending on how much coverage I want.  My makeup goes on smoothly and stays looking good all day.  The primer is a little expensive but a little goes a long way and it lasts a long time.  I have tried going without it to save money but my foundation just doesn&#x27;t go on as well or look as good as it does with this product.  I wear make up 6 days a week and this and this 1 oz. bottle will probably last nearly a year because it just takes a small amount for each application.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from an Airbonne Consultant a couple of years ago. Once I was out she had left the company.&lt;br /&gt;I found it on Amazon.com, said I got the last one...I hope they will keep selling it. I would recommend Airbonne Primer to anyone who wants their makeup to look smooth</li>
            <li> Let me begin by stating I have oily skin and so I don&#x27;t expect any product to get rid of that completely. That being said, I also have sensitive skin and have to be wary of new products as many cause breakouts. This one, however, did not cause any breakouts! Aside from that, I love the texture. Definitely the silky feeling everyone raves about which helped my make up once applied so much smoother. I will certainly repurchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and the way my makeup goes on when I use it. It&#x27;s great to be able to order through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I used to buy it from one of Arbonne distributers. Its much cheaper, easier, and faster to buy it from Amazon. I love the product. It makes my face silky smooth. It fills up the wrinkles and pores, and its invisible. So after I apply foundation and/or powder, my face looks perfect. No parabens either. Love it!</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel more supple, but doesn&#x27;t do much for fine lines or uneven skin tones, which is why I purchased it.  It is certainly not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I review beauty products on my webiste and have companies regularly send me items to review and/or promote. This company contacted me through Twitter and offered to send a few items for me to try. I can&#x27;t say enough great things about these products. I try out so many products over a months time. Some items I like, some I don&#x27;t. These Arbonne products have really been a stand-out. They have ingredients that are natural and healthy without the worry of toxic substances I hear about on the news. It&#x27;s just a win-win in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be doing an in-depth review on Arbonne products on my website soon. I also will have a HUGE $300+ Giveaway only for my subscribers. Uhapi Beauty dot com</li>
            <li> As directed on how to use .&lt;br /&gt;I  need another one if it is possible to send it to me.</li>
            <li> I just love this makeup primer. I have used many primers over the years and just about gave up on them. Someone suggested a gel primer, so I researched them and decided to try Arbonne. This is the best makeup primer I have ever used. It just glides across your face, leaving your skin so soft. My makeup goes on so smooth. I was so thrilled that I ordered another one right away. I do not want to run out!  I have told about five people about this product already.</li>
            <li> Great product. Even greater price!! love the smoothness of this product. it makes my arbonne foundation look so smooth and even</li>
            <li> Nice product I like leave the skin feeling fresh and clean .i would definitely buy I again  .i wish it was a little cheaper .</li>
            <li> This was a reorder based on previous use.  Love the product.</li>
            <li> So nice to feel the makeup is evenly distributed on my face.  Looks so much better.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> This is a very wonderful product and I recommend not only this product but all of Arbonne products.  Very high quality.</li>
            <li> Great product and delivered on time without any problems.</li>
            <li> This product make the makeup go on smoothly.  So easy to use.  Try it you love it too!  I Love it!!</li>
            <li> The primer goes on so easily and my makeup stays on all day.  Also, my makeup doesn&#x27;t rub off on my phone...that is an extra bonus!</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this primer after reading all the positive reviews. I tried it hoping it would work as well for me but it doesn&#x27;t cover shine &amp; pores like other reported it did plus after 3hrs of applying it my face is all oily again. I&#x27;m going back to Avon Magix - after trying probably 20 primers it is the best I&#x27;ve found out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for nearly two years and it just makes your skin feel like silk. Your makeup glides on smoothly and looks great! I&#x27;ve tried others and they just don&#x27;t work for me. One plus this product has that most others don&#x27;t, is the fact that you can use it on your eyelids and your liner and shadow go on like silk.</li>
            <li> Great delivery time. I love this product. It works really well and it goes on  very smooth. Recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> This primer really works!!! It does not keep my face from getting oily but even with the oil it keeps my makeup on.  Usually my flaws will bleed through about bookish and I have touch up. With this primer I do not need to touch up.  It works all day. I will by more.</li>
            <li> Over priced and does not prime well. I have bought cheap $7 dollar primer at drug stores that work better. Arbonne Primer makes a huge barrier between my skin and makeup so the makeup will not stay on my skin. Also does not prevent my skin from getting oily and barely changes the look or my pores. I used it for 2weeks just to give it the benefit of the doubt, hoping it would begin to work. No results so I threw it away. I would not buy this product again. The bottle it comes in is bulky/heavy and does not fit in my makeup case. It did not irritate my skin, which was a plus but it did not deliver primer effects.</li>
            <li> Best primer I have found for oily skin.</li>
            <li> Helps the make in go on smoothly and stay on longer.</li>
            <li> Usually I use Rimmel primer with success, but the tubes run out fast.  I wanted to try something different.  I won&#x27;t lie - I tried this product because it&#x27;s expensive and from a good name, and expensive brand name beauty products supposedly impress.  This said, I am a broke college kid, and have not had the experience of being suckered in to brand name beauty products until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is dry, but I do break out on my cheeks occassionally.  When I first started using this product (which is somewhat oily) my skin felt like velvet.  It was amazing!  People even commented on how lovely my skin was.  However, about two months later (the bottle lasts!), my acne has become more aggressive and my pores are really clogged.  I can see the white buildup under my skin.  Even though this product worked better than Rimmel at first, it isn&#x27;t worth the buy at 2x the price.</li>
            <li> Arbonne primer is a must to be used with Arbonne foundation, the primer makes it much easier to apply the foundation,but most important it smoothies the skin. One important thing is it only takes a very small drop to go a long way. Dorothy</li>
            <li> Amazing in every aspect!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed the round container has been changed to lesser quality and more difficult to dispense.  I was hoping for the same quality as the former container.</li>
            <li> Primer does wonders for your skin, makeup goes on smoother and lasts longer</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff ever! I just have to use a drop of liquid foundation.  The makeup glides on. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works best when allowed to set/dry for a for a while prior to concealer and foundation. Helps reduce my shine for most of my work day (5 hrs or so).</li>
            <li> Opened the box and tried to squirt product out of the container...container was empty.</li>
            <li> .Makes my face feel very smooth and soft, love it under makeup</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use make up much at all so the only thing I have to compare it to is the Bare Minerals Re-ver Upper.  The Arbonne creates an extremely smooth surface on your skin allowing easier application of anything else that goes on after it.  Does well for oily skin.  It&#x27;s a small bottle but if used efficiently, it can last you a few months.</li>
            <li> I like it very much feels smooth helps my eyeliner to not run as fast seeing I have oily skin</li>
            <li> My cousin had me try hers prior to putting my make-up on and I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.  Me my make-up went on so much smoother and more evenly. It also made my skin feel very silky and soft!!! So, I have been hooked ever since!!  My order arrived promptly and the packaging of the product was very well done to assure that the bottles would not break in shipping!!!!  Thanks!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with all Arbonne products, My skin looks healthy and look forward every morning and night to use my products</li>
            <li> The primer at the start was fresh but as I got half way thru the bottle it lacked freshness and the glide effect of makeup application</li>
            <li> I have used a number of primers over the past 5 years. Some are mere liquids; this is a lovely gel and provides a smooth surface for any type of makeup to be applied on top.  I feel it is a wonderful primer.  Worth every cent. It is at least worth a try for yourself. JMO.</li>
            <li> excellent product.  make up goes on smoothly and stays in place</li>
            <li> love this product!! Ran out and forgot to order found it on Amazon.  Very happy</li>
            <li> When applying foundation after primer, the end result is a very smooth complexion.  This look lasts  most of the working day, keeping skin attractive and luxurious .</li>
            <li> Very smooth feel! Makeup glides right on after this primer.</li>
            <li> My favorite primer.  After trying many primers none compare to this one.</li>
            <li> Love my Arbonne Primer!  Never leave the house without it.  I have sensitive skin; prone to breakouts and this product does not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and excellent product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard many consultants refer to the primer as \\&quot;liquid silk.\\&quot; Cheesy, yes, but also TRUE. I&#x27;ve only used primer for a few years now,but this one is by far the best I have tried. It DOES feel like liquid silk,my skin looks (and feels) amazing, it contains no harmful ingredients, and it lasts forever as you only need about 1/2 pump per use. I earned this product free for hosting an event in February, and I still am using the same bottle!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous facial primers and this is my favorite by far. My skin is very oily so I have trouble with makeup staying on all day. This has help extend the lasting of my makeup, but I still have touch up my foundation after 5 hours. Arbonne is light, it controls shine on my face with its matte finish, and it has never made me break out.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It goes on silky smooth and evens out my skin perfectly. I no longer have to worry about my skin getting dry or my foundation cracking after a long day.</li>
            <li> This product is simply fabulous!  Once you put it on your skin feels just like baby skin.  Smooth soft , just great.  I will  never stop using it!</li>
            <li> Read reviews on this product and was excited to order it.  I&#x27;ve used other primers in the past and this seems like all the others&lt;br /&gt;except for the price.  Its about $25.00 more than others with the same quality.</li>
            <li> After using this primer for a week, my skin broke out. I haven&#x27;t had blemishes since high school. Trust me ... That was a long time ago. Cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would not think about putting on my makeup without using primer first.  This makeup primer is wonderful.  I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> It makes your face feel like you are covering it with silk.  :  )  It takes very little to make a big difference in applying makeup.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying the make-up primer. I selected the Arbonne product from a list of the top primers available, and I am pleased that I like&lt;br /&gt;it very much. It goes on smoothly and makes my skin feel so soft. The primer enhances my foundation, which goes on more evenly. Also, I think my makeup stays looking fresher longer than before the use of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, I always much say something about the fine service that Amazon provides. You folks are a wonder! My orders always arrive in&lt;br /&gt;excellent condition  and I am extremely impressed with your promptness. Thanks for being consistently the best company with whom&lt;br /&gt;I do any business.</li>
            <li> I was using a $60 primer, which was ridiculously priced!  Then I ran across this primer and paid $31 for it a couple of weeks ago and now it&#x27;s $44, but I see why the price increased, this product is awesome!!  It makes my make-up look a 100% better and I honestly had co-workers say, you look good today.....that makes it worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I tried this with my mineral makeup and it worked JUST ok. I have oily skin, so I expected this to help keep the shine away and help keep my makeup from melting off by mid morning.... it didn&#x27;t with the mineral powder. i changed to another brand of foundation (liquid) and it seems to work much better with this one. i also started using a mattifier as my first application, so maybe that also helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the dispenser pump doesn&#x27;t work correctly or the gel in the bottle doesn&#x27;t settle enough to surround the pump tube. I have a very difficult time getting it out of the bottle. Unless it proves to be a superior product with my skin, i probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff made my eyelids and surrounding area so dry and irritated that they cracked and bled for a few days. Terrible. Arbonne isn&#x27;t so natural, as they would like us all to believe. When I looked up the ingredients after my reaction, it was loaded with chemicals. It has been 2 weeks since I used it once and my skin still hasn&#x27;t healed.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this primer and have been an avid Arbonne user for years... However.. after some research and information I just learned- the first 3 ingredients in this primer are the EXACT same ingredients in Lanacane Anti-Chafing gel. Which you can get for about $7 at the drug store.. oh and you get a big tube of it. I happened to have some Lancane so I tried it to see how it compared.. I got the exact same results. I love Arbonne, but I will no longer be spending $40 for something I can get for $7 at the drug store.. Just FYI.</li>
            <li> Fantastic primer.  Last step before you apply your foundation or powder.  It is velvetly soft no odor, goes on the skin like a layer of silk.  Allows your foundation to slide on with perfection.  A dot is all you need, so this bottle will last all year and some.</li>
            <li> I never used a primer before, so this was my first time using Arbonne and primer. A friend told me about this product. I have really dry skin and I was very particular on certain things I would put on my face. This product only takes a small pea size and my face absorbs it so well underneath my foundation. You should wait a couple of minutes before applying your make-up. My face no longer feels dry!! A little pricy but well worth it because it lasts such a long time before running out. I do recommend this to everyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love this base. It is very light on your skin.</li>
            <li> I work 12 hour night shifts, and this primer leaves my face looking just as fresh when i leave in the morning, as when i showed up for work the night before. I always have had a problem with my make up moving around my face and not staying put. This primer solved that problem. Its super silky and not heavy at all. This product is light weight and breathable. I have super sensitive skin, and this primer doesn&#x27;t upset it at all</li>
            <li> I tried arbonne makeup primer at my granddaughter&#x27;s.  I loved it, so I wrote down the name of it and when I returned home, I Googled it and ordered it. It&#x27;s the best that I have ever used. Thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li> I love this premier.  I have sensitive skin and I like the &#x27;light weight&#x27; texture of this product. It goes on very soft.  A little goes a long way.  Definitely a staple in my make-up routine.</li>
            <li> This primer gets RAVE reviews...almost too good to be true, on here and on Makeup Alley.  I have tried EVERY primer out there.  Name it and I have tried it on my very oily skin.  This primer is nothing special and my face was greasy within an hour.  My makeup literally slid off my face with it and I only used 1/2-3/4 of a pump on my entire face.  To make matters worse, it broke me out in little whiteheads around my nose.  I would say it is almost identical to Smashbox&#x27;s primer (the regular clear one).  This product is definitely nothing special at all and is a typical, run of the mill silicone feeling based product.  I would not even consider recommending it or repurchasing it.  I&#x27;d rather use a plain light moisturizer than this.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I was so glad that I can get it here and not  have to go through Arbonne. I will be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> This stuff goes on really smooth. It feels like baby powder as you put it on and make-up stays put all day. A bit pricey but worth it to use on special occasions.</li>
            <li> I love this primer from Arbonne.  It works so well.  It keeps the make-up in place.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see why everyone is freaking out over this primer. It&#x27;s just ok to me. Feels like lanacane, I don&#x27;t feel my makeup staying on any better than usual and my pores are as small as with foundation alone.</li>
            <li> First time trying this product, happy with it and the timelyness of the shipment.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Love it,use it all the time,would not put on makeup without it,great product.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best primer but I have a hard time finding it:(  It is so smooth and makes your foundation just glide on.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  I&#x27;ve been useing it for two years now and nothing else compares to the silky flawless perfection of the way your makeup looks after applying this primer..</li>
            <li> I love the way this product makes my skin feel. Soft &amp; smooth. Great product, highly recommend as a base for makeup</li>
            <li> Glides on smoothly.  Fills in any blemishes.  Allows make up to be evenly distributed in a thin layer.  Feels like you are not wearing any makeup.</li>
            <li> I have used several primers, so I had something to compare this to.  I was taken in by the great reviews and I had heard of Arbonne several years ago as being one of the more natural, high end lines but this didn&#x27;t stand a chance next to Smashbox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I regret choosing this primer...it did nothing spectacular at all.  The Smashbox that I normally use is much better, and you can actually feel the barrier it leaves between your skin and the product.  If you want an average primer, this is your best bet.</li>
            <li> Just exactly as stated.</li>
            <li> THIS IS SO GREAT TO USE BEFORE APPLYING MAKE-UP. DON&#x27;T USE TOO MUCH OR IT WON&#x27;T ALLOW THE FOUNDATION TO DO IT&#x27;S WORK!</li>
            <li> Arbonne makeup primer feels so good on your face and your foundation goes on so much easier. Everybody needs this &amp; your price is right.</li>
            <li> Best make up primer of the many I&#x27;ve tried the past few years. I like that it&#x27;s more natural, too.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin silky smooth and ready for foundation. I wouldn&#x27;t start my day without it. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The best primer to wear under you makeup</li>
            <li> very smooth and absorbs into skin quickly creating a smooth surface for your foundation&#x27;</li>
            <li> Never used primer before, but this is perfect.  Light, need only a small amount.  Kept my makeup on for at least 2-3 more hours.  Makes my face look smooth and healthy.  Using for 1 week and no breakouts. Love this primer.</li>
            <li> Product is great.  I will be ordering this again.  Leaves my face smooth and ready to apply make-up.</li>
            <li> I am a 34 year old woman who has a ton of sun damage and when I put this primer on...it decreases the lines in my face! I get compliments all the time on my face now! I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Order for a friend, who loved it.</li>
            <li> Prompt service, good price, and received as advertised.</li>
            <li> I had never tried the primer before. I really like it. Makes makeup go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> HAVED ALWAYS  LIKED PRODUCT LINE, THIS GOES ON VERY SMOOTH AND FEELS GREAT, EVEN FOR VERY SENSITIVE SKIN,THEY HAVE A GREAT MASK!</li>
            <li> This product is the best primer ever!!  It arrived on time thankfully because I was going without it for a few days and my skin felt so dry and my makeup was lifeless.  This makes your makefup and face flawless and feel fabulous.</li>
            <li> I love this primer, it creates a smooth face while helping to cover imperfections. It provides a base for whatever foundation I want to use.</li>
