            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products and this is the best so far.</li>

            <li>skin very matte,</li>
            <li>peach fuzz and really gets stuck on hair, won&#x27;t come off of eyebrows and eyelashes if it gets on em accidentally&lt;</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this a year ago. It is one of my favorites. I am buying it again.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves a nice color in your face. Your face looks more even and fresh. And it last a whole year!</li>
            <li> Sheer, but with the slightest tint to help smooth the complexion in the most natural way, whilst providing SPF protection.</li>
            <li> Not only does Skinceuticals UV Defense work as a sunscreen, it goes on like the finest tinted lotion instead of like a 50 SPF sunscreen.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a sunscreen that didn&#x27;t have all the chemicals in it that might be harmful, and yet don&#x27;t go on like house paint, leaving my face with a bluish tinge from the zinc.  Skinceuticals is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered it through a friend who&#x27;d had it recommended to her by her dermatologist.  While it appears expensive when you first see the tiny bottle, you end using so little that it&#x27;s lasting me all summer and I use it faithfully(on a boat) every day.  It sinks into my skin leaving no greasy sheen, and with it&#x27;s slight tint, I feel like I&#x27;m using one of my expensive foundations.  It goes on natural(my skin is medium to light) and covers while protecting.  I&#x27;m sold on this sunscreen and can&#x27;t imagine using anything better.</li>
            <li> Good protection and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It was not what I wanted.  I did not read the info. enough.  I&#x27;m sure it is a good product, just not what I wanted.  My error</li>
            <li> This product works great. I&#x27;ve tried other products and this is the best so far. It is a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> Just got this. I have been using the one with zinc and without tint - which is very heavy. And, my doctor had me using one I love with zinc and tint, but, is pretty heavy. This one is very light yet covers well and the tint doesn&#x27;t spread on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;So far I am liking it a lot.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. My dermatologist recommended it to me. I use it every day as a moisturizer under my makeup. It&#x27;s very light but most importantly a wonderful sunscreen!</li>
            <li> I have problems with many sunscreens, especially those with high SPF&#x27;s.  They irritate my skin.  The ones that don&#x27;t are usually greasy and pasty white.  This one is not only gentle, but it&#x27;s light, watery, non-greasy and has a perfect light tint that covers minor flaws.  It makes my skin look great!</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion; they just need to get the packaging right.</li>
            <li> everything is great except that coming out of the squeeze tube it is runny and the amount that comes to your finger tips is not well controllable. however, when you apply it the product blends in well with the skin and seems to do its job. 4 stars, and a product i will continue to use.</li>
            <li> The lotion goes on great but being on the face, it&#x27;s kind of important not to smell &#x27;bad&#x27;... which it does.</li>
            <li> Silkiest sunblock I&#x27;ve ever put on my face. The tint is perfect minimal coverage for a day out with no makeup. It also prevents your face from having the ghost cast other titanium or zinc products have. Only 4 stars because it did give me some minor acne but I&#x27;m willing to pop a zit or 2 for this kind of sun protection.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Perfect tinting, requiring no makeup. goes on smoothly. Plus, it&#x27;s a  50 pfc.  I will buy definitely this again.</li>
            <li> The Skin Ceuticals is no longer in eye drop form.  Instead it is a pump, which I do not like as I feel it is wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;Please remove this item from your display.</li>
            <li> Truly protects, stays on for a long time and makes your skin feel like velvet. It works wonders as a foundation primer too!</li>
            <li> this sunscreen was recommended by a client who is a dermatologist.  I have used it for 5 years.  It&#x27;s not greasy, can be used under make-up. I have very sensitive skin.  I can&#x27;t be without this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a physical (mineral) facial sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast and have tried La Roche Posay and a few other drug store brands with no luck. This makes me very pale but doesn&#x27;t leave a white- white cast like others have. My boyfriend has pointed out that it really accentuates any peach fuzz on my face, which is not very desirable. I&#x27;ve found mixing it with a liquid bronzer helps a bit with the paleness but not the peach fuzz issue. I&#x27;m sure it sticks to hair because it is so water resistant, so I know it&#x27;s got that going for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;minimal white cast&lt;br /&gt;pysical SPF that does not breakout my acne prone skin (physical SPFs are known to cause breakouts)&lt;br /&gt;VERY water resistant- stays through 60 minutes of sweating in hot yoga&lt;br /&gt;non-chemical SPF means less skin irritation and has been used successfully forever to protect skin&lt;br /&gt;keeps skin very matte, all day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;VERY drying, even on my oily skin&lt;br /&gt;leaves skin very pale and a little dull looking&lt;br /&gt;accentuates peach fuzz and really gets stuck on hair, won&#x27;t come off of eyebrows and eyelashes if it gets on em accidentally&lt;br /&gt;needs extra moisturizers applied before use, still dries out skin by end of day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this does not cause breakouts and keeps my skin matte all day, I think this product would have been perfect for me when I was a teenager... I would have loved it&#x27;s all day mattifying effect and that it was a physical SPF that did not break me out. If you have young, oily skin prone to breakouts and are wanting a gentler mineral SPF, this one will probably be great for you. Just make sure to pile on the moisturizer prior to use! Because of it&#x27;s very affective water resistance, I will definitely be using this on beach, pool and outdoor sports days cause I can trust it to stay on my skin. The protection is worth a little drying or peach fuzz on those days in the sun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it&#x27;s still great.  Weightless and bends well on African-American skin tones.</li>
            <li> My dad uses this for himself and has been using for a couple months now it works great he says its worth the money</li>
            <li> This is, without a doubt, the very best sunscreen I have ever used.  It is a lotion and absorbs in about 3 minutes.  It leaves an almost imperceptible wash of natural color on your face and neck without a line of demarcation.  Forget the price.  Try it.  You&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife. She loves it.</li>
            <li> super lightweight. love it!</li>
            <li> so smooth when applying</li>
            <li> I am  cyclist and have been using this sunscreen for a number of years.  It gives me a little color as well as protection. I don&#x27;t ride without it.  I had laser done several years ago to remove dark spots.  The spots have not returned.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I was given this by a facialist and now use it regularly. It&#x27;s the lightest sunblock I&#x27;ve ever found and the &amp;#34;universal tint&amp;#34; happens to work really well for me.</li>
            <li> Recommended by the physician, not greasy like other suncreen products and easy to apply and dry fast when in a hurry!</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST sunscreen out there! Nothing compares to it! Simple as that!</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have bad pigmentaion on my face and I&#x27;m always avoiding the sun as well as wearing lots of make-up when going to the beach.  With this product I do not need any make up.  With the tint and the zinc I get prenty of coverage along with SPF50.  I&#x27;ve tried so many products and by far this one is the best!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! One too many times I have bought some sort of tinted foundation with an SPF that always left a white film on my face. Thick, white, greasy...etc. YUCK.... My dermatologist (I have very sensitive skin) told me about this, so I overpaid for a small bottle (1.7 oz) from him.  Best expensive product ever - I&#x27;m happy I did.  It&#x27;s lightweight, slight beige tint that blends into any skin color, and just glides on. You literally need only a dimes worth for coverage.  It goes a loooooong way.  When I saw this size, I jumped on it. This will get me thought the summer, and then some.  It will probably last well through the Fall too. I highly recommend this :)  (If my review was helpful, let me know by clicking &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34; at the end of my review!)</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and so far this sunscreen has been great.  I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts or adverse reactions to this product.  Time will tell!</li>
            <li> Light, non greasy, slight tint, SPF50 and no chemicalsâ€¦what else could you want?!</li>
            <li> I am sensitive for tipical cheep products which includes so many artificial medicine.  The sunscreen is only one which I can continue to use more than one year in Hawaii.  It is also good for base make, so I use powder foundation after I use it.  Please try it from small size.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning.  It has moisturizer, tint and SPF 50.  It&#x27;s lightweight and goes on easily.</li>
    </ol>
