    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I think this is a great product &amp; would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>The price to me is great!</li>
            <li>It worked perfectly for what I needed.  </li>
            <li>HOWEVER, they brilliantly let you retract that part of the blade</li>
            <li>I can still win on this one.  </li>
            <li>This is great, I do not know how it works</li>
            <li>What I do have is an Everblade with the copper part that has since turned a nice blue-green color indicating it has been working flawlessly as the sacrificial cathode for my steel razor blades.  </li>
            <li>So, if you are looking for something to keep your blade from rusting, this Everblade works great.  </li>
            <li>Just amazing!</li>
            <li>I use persona and gillete razors and both fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and its so easy...</li>
            <li>This works AMAZINGLY...</li>
            <li>in order to get any kind of close shave, I have to shave against the growth.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the great product and service!  </li>
            <li>Buy the \\&quot;EverBlade\\&quot; sharpener; then treat yourself to something nice with the money you will save.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying this product, its great!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll save cash and that&#x27;s something very important in this economy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for many years now and still amazed how this product works.  </li>
            <li>Ok, with that being said, I go through blades quite often and the cost is getting astronomical.  </li>
            <li>My Shick Hydro razor did not rest on the stand like in the picture and the blade did not even come close to touching the copper metal surface for the magic to work.  </li>
            <li>Will buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li>Since I started using the EverBlade, I&#x27;ve been able to drastically extend the life of my blades.  </li>
            <li>This will save you money and let you use a great blade for so much longer.</li>
            <li>What more need be said?</li>
            <li>ENJOY!</li>
            <li>it was as good as new!</li>
            <li>this is an easy fix...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m even considering buying a *nice* razor, for the first time in my life, since now</li>
            <li>OK...Like many of us do, I found a product on Amazon (in this case the EverBlade) that I was very interested in.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product to see if I could extend the life of my razors, even by a little bit, and I am so happy with the EverBlade!  </li>
            <li>Admittedly, I use cheap throw-away razors because I eventually, well, throw them away.  </li>
            <li>It worked fantasticly.</li>
            <li>I have experienced a smoother daily shave.</li>
            <li>Just put your razor on the Everblade after every use and it extends its life significantly.  </li>
            <li>hey...if I get twice the life out of these blades it&#x27;ll be worth it!    </li>
            <li>And i&#x27;m pretty satisfied-</li>
            <li>having a nice sharp blade keeps my skin in the best shape possible.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll easily get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had super sensitive skin and have never been able to use shaving creams or lotions (the dreaded soap-and-water shave!), so</li>
            <li>Please take a look at the full review on my site:</li>
            <li>Before using this, a blade would only be good for about 10 days for me.</li>
            <li>I was quickly dissapointed.  </li>
            <li>We are thoroughly impressed and are looking forward to how long he can make this blade last.</li>
            <li>We definitely recommend this product and would love to give an update in the near future on how many more shaves he gets out of this blade!!</li>
            <li>When I first received the item, I was excited.  </li>
            <li>In the first year I got 1 BOX of blades from the store !</li>
            <li>This product paid for itself the first month!</li>
            <li>this is just a razor holder worth $20.</li>
            <li>1 week is absolutely a success in my book.</li>
            <li>I think it is very much worth it for the length of time that the blades last, it does pay for itself very quickly!    </li>
            <li>I guess the lack of corrosion on the blade makes it a more comfortable shave even though the blade isn&#x27;t as sharp.  </li>
            <li>The ONLY thing is many blades now have &amp;#34;lubricating&amp;#34; strips on them.  </li>
            <li>I was able to keep the blade on for an extra three weeks before switching it.</li>
            <li>The first ones lasted for a year I just changed them out .</li>
            <li>I was able to use one Gillette multiblade for 2-3 months before replacement and shaved daily.</li>
            <li>I tried this for about two months, and honestly I could not really tell the difference.</li>
            <li>The seller was great, product arrived quickly and I can&#x27;t fault them for a mediocre product.</li>
            <li>they wear out fast and I&#x27;m spending a LOT of money and wanted something to curb that.    </li>
            <li>I had been using a blade and was almost ready to switch it when my everblade arrived</li>
            <li>Well worth the money, saves a lot on the high price of new razor blades,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why there are so many 5 star reviews, but this did nothing for me!</li>
            <li>pretty sure mine will pay for itself within a few months.  </li>
            <li>Currently I am getting about three times the use out of my fusion blades which will help pay for this quickly.</li>
            <li>This design is particularly suited for most American brands using multiple blades per razor head.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product--</li>
            <li>By use of a strong magnetic field, the metal blade is bent back in shape and ready for the next use.</li>
            <li>If you keep your blade clean and dry you do not need anything else.</li>
            <li>It was never actually dull</li>
            <li>and I have to buy a new one, because razors can be pricey.  </li>
            <li>and then he has to use a new one.</li>
            <li>so it is like a new blade.</li>
            <li>the cost of new blades Fusion&#x27;s are 5 blades for around 28 bucks</li>
            <li>My wife also used her Venus and it works like new.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s maybe 90-95% like new.  </li>
            <li>WOW, talk about making a razor everlasting!</li>
            <li>first 2 weeks, it&#x27;s pretty sharp.</li>
            <li>Let me be concise and to the point: shavers, do you want to save money on razor blades?</li>
            <li>Since he started using the EverBlade, he has been on the same razor and has shaved so far six times!!!  </li>
            <li>By the 4th week, it&#x27;s definitely feeling like an older blade that needs to be tossed soon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly though, a large part of why this may work is that they recommend you dry the razor (which probably prevents oxidation and blade dulling).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just take the blades off the razor after I&#x27;m done shaving, and gently pat them dry and place them in the blade resevoir.  </li>
            <li>My Father in NY (where the water is soft) has kept the same blade 10 times longer.</li>
            <li>Normally, I&#x27;d be on my third or fourth new razor by now.  </li>
            <li>Of course over time, the sharpening power on the blades diminishes, but I think I had my first EverBlade for at least a year before replacing it with a new one.</li>
            <li>Beyond that, not sure it would be useful.  </li>
            <li>The blade just sat on some copper material and became dull just as fast as it normally would.</li>
            <li>Have owned two of the EverBlades over the past few years and have been satisfied with their performance.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, but because I&#x27;m in the military, I HAVE to shave every day.  </li>
            <li>So first of all, i was hesitant to buy this thing because the reviewers with positive feedback all seemed to have only 1 or no other reviews, so it made me skeptical.  </li>
            <li>I feel like i can make it last another week, but i just want a new sharp blade by that point.</li>

            <li> I feel like i can make it last another week, but i just want a new sharp blade by that point.</li>
            <li> What causes them to be &amp;#34;dull&amp;#34; is the thin blades are easily bent by contact with rough beards.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how long each blade lasts with this product because I&#x27;ve been using the same one for almost two months</li>
            <li> my blades last about 3 to 4 times as long.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a minor inconvenence, but</li>
            <li> it helps repel the hair that would normally get stuck inbetween the blades, which I&#x27;ve had problems with in the past.</li>
            <li> Using this thing, they now last just about 4 weeks, at which point i&#x27;m looking for a newly sharp blade.</li>
            <li> pat it dry and place it on the EverBlade.</li>
            <li> If you accomplish the rinse, then the pat dry</li>
            <li> Note that before storing the blade, i pat it dry with a towel, and try to blow out the water between the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t take the time to dry the blades or anything.  </li>
            <li> and I use the Fusion, so I was spending a fortune on new cartridges and now I can stretch one cartridge at least 3 times as long, so I am saving a ton!</li>
            <li> I have to shave twice a day, so needless to say I would be lucky if a razor lasted me a week</li>
            <li> Oh, even works on electric razor blades if you set just the blades, minus the foil, on the copper &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> He has really thick hair and his blades normally only last him about two shaves</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how long this thing keep them sharp!</li>
            <li> Now, I may have some odd skin as I cannot shave in a down stroke only,</li>
            <li> They are so expensive that he tries to make them last for as long as he possibly can, but even with doing that, he still only gets a few shaves out of them.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this product, I read the reviews and one of the user was concerned if other reviews are paid or not.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel as sharp, but it also doesn&#x27;t pull on the hairs.  </li>
            <li> It simply keeps you blade sharper for longer because there is a small ionic field where the blade sits.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s perfectly sharp!  </li>
            <li> so you can shave up close like under your nose to hit the tight spots.  </li>
            <li> This blade extender did little if anything to extend the shelf life of my Gillette blades and corroded after about 2 months.</li>
            <li> In my case, I like to use the Schick Quatro which has some sort of conditioner that oozes out of the blade head.  </li>
            <li> so nothing oozes out.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I hope I&#x27;ve made it plain.</li>
            <li> And since I store said blades under the sink, which is ALL the way across the bathroom from my shower, more often than not I end up shaving with a nasty dull blade and dealing with the aftermath (nicks, razor burn, etc) for a few days afterwards.  </li>
            <li> And thus, it did not fit either!    </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical that this product would actually help preserve the quality if my razor blade, but it did.</li>
            <li> and I was left with a useless razor.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for many years now and still amazed how this product works.  I&#x27;d say conservately my blades will last 6 weeks before I need to change them.  The ONLY thing is many blades now have &amp;#34;lubricating&amp;#34; strips on them.  So therefore, it will guck up the area where the blades lie.  In my case, I like to use the Schick Quatro which has some sort of conditioner that oozes out of the blade head.  HOWEVER, they brilliantly let you retract that part of the blade so you can shave up close like under your nose to hit the tight spots.  So, when I use my everblade, I store it the same way so nothing oozes out.</li>
            <li> As a college student money can be hard to come by.  So, I always dread that day when my razor is too dull to handle and I have to buy a new one, because razors can be pricey.  I was introduced to the Everblade, and thank goodness because its saving me a lot of money!  Just put your razor on the Everblade after every use and it extends its life significantly.  I highly recommend buying this product, its great!</li>
            <li> OK...Like many of us do, I found a product on Amazon (in this case the EverBlade) that I was very interested in.  I have very sensitive skin, but because I&#x27;m in the military, I HAVE to shave every day.  Now, I may have some odd skin as I cannot shave in a down stroke only, in order to get any kind of close shave, I have to shave against the growth.  Ok, with that being said, I go through blades quite often and the cost is getting astronomical.  I have tried several diferent brands, and several different levels within those brands.  The bottom line is wether I&#x27;m using a Gillete,Bic or Schick, 3, 4, or 5 blade, power or non-power...they wear out fast and I&#x27;m spending a LOT of money and wanted something to curb that.    Enter the EverBlade...I read the reviews, did the research, and thought...what the heck, it&#x27;s only $20.      When I first received the item, I was excited.  But as soon as I opened the package and went to the bathroom to begin extending the life of my razor...I was quickly dissapointed.  My Shick Hydro razor did not rest on the stand like in the picture and the blade did not even come close to touching the copper metal surface for the magic to work.  So I thought to myself, \\&quot;Self....this is an easy fix...start using your Gillette Fusion!\\&quot;  So I promptly opened the madeicine cabinet and retrieved my Fusion, place a blade on it, and nestled it into the cradle.  Wait...did I say nestle...I meant wrestle!  And thus, it did not fit either!    Step 2....I can still win on this one.  I&#x27;ll just take the blades off the razor after I&#x27;m done shaving, and gently pat them dry and place them in the blade resevoir.  It&#x27;s a minor inconvenence, but hey...if I get twice the life out of these blades it&#x27;ll be worth it!    I have now had the product for about one month...and guess what.  The blades cut the crap out of me after about 4-5 days.  The same as they were wearing out before.  And again, it doesn&#x27;t matter which brand or style I tried.    Do yourself a favor and just spend the money on another 4-pack of Fusion Blades!</li>
            <li> I had been using a blade and was almost ready to switch it when my everblade arrived so I put it on the everblade for a couple days and tried using it again. I was able to keep the blade on for an extra three weeks before switching it. Currently I am getting about three times the use out of my fusion blades which will help pay for this quickly. Have recommended to my family and friends who use razors to shave.    Thanks for the great product and service!  Ty</li>
            <li> Once you realize how this product doesn&#x27;t work you&#x27;ll be sorry you bought it too. The key is on the packaging where it says to rinse your blade then pat it dry and place it on the EverBlade. If you accomplish the rinse, then the pat dry that&#x27;s all you need to do. You&#x27;ll get the same result by NOT using the EverBlade because water is where the damage comes from. Save your money and use a tissue and you&#x27;ll get the same result.</li>
            <li> everblade extends the life of my razors by 2 or 3 times. I use persona and gillete razors and both fit perfectly. You&#x27;ll easily get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> WOW, talk about making a razor everlasting! I&#x27;ve had the same razor since I starting using the everblade &amp; just decided to throw it away for sanitary reasons last night. I&#x27;ve noticed ANOTHER benefit of everblade being it helps repel the hair that would normally get stuck inbetween the blades, which I&#x27;ve had problems with in the past. I think this is a great product &amp; would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Already ordered 5 of this .(we need them for 3 ppl here)Best thing ever to save on blades! The first ones lasted for a year I just changed them out . In the first year I got 1 BOX of blades from the store ! That&#x27;s how long this thing keep them sharp! Will buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and its so easy...all you do is store your razor on the Evarblade and thats it! I have to shave twice a day, so needless to say I would be lucky if a razor lasted me a week and I use the Fusion, so I was spending a fortune on new cartridges and now I can stretch one cartridge at least 3 times as long, so I am saving a ton! This product paid for itself the first month!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to see if I could extend the life of my razors, even by a little bit, and I am so happy with the EverBlade!  Since I started using the EverBlade, I&#x27;ve been able to drastically extend the life of my blades.  I can&#x27;t say how long each blade lasts with this product because I&#x27;ve been using the same one for almost two months and it&#x27;s perfectly sharp!  Normally, I&#x27;d be on my third or fourth new razor by now.  Admittedly, I use cheap throw-away razors because I eventually, well, throw them away.  And since I store said blades under the sink, which is ALL the way across the bathroom from my shower, more often than not I end up shaving with a nasty dull blade and dealing with the aftermath (nicks, razor burn, etc) for a few days afterwards.  The product&#x27;s design allows me the option to keep the blade upright in the shower and out of the water, which helps a ton.  I&#x27;ve always had super sensitive skin and have never been able to use shaving creams or lotions (the dreaded soap-and-water shave!), so having a nice sharp blade keeps my skin in the best shape possible.  I would highly recommend this product--pretty sure mine will pay for itself within a few months.  I&#x27;m even considering buying a *nice* razor, for the first time in my life, since now I know it&#x27;ll last.   And I&#x27;ll be purchasing an EverBlade for my husband now too!</li>
            <li> This thing saves blades and allows me to shave longer with a blade</li>
            <li> Before I bought this product, I read the reviews and one of the user was concerned if other reviews are paid or not. Let me tell you this product is not working at all! If you keep your blade clean and dry you do not need anything else. this is just a razor holder worth $20. DO NOT RECOMMAND.</li>
            <li> My husband used this product and we were actually in shock! He has really thick hair and his blades normally only last him about two shaves and then he has to use a new one. He uses the Gillette ProGlide razor and the refill blades are about $16 for a pack. They are so expensive that he tries to make them last for as long as he possibly can, but even with doing that, he still only gets a few shaves out of them. Since he started using the EverBlade, he has been on the same razor and has shaved so far six times!!!  That is just insane!! We are thoroughly impressed and are looking forward to how long he can make this blade last. For this one blade to last six times, that is already unheard of for him, so this is a winner to us. We definitely recommend this product and would love to give an update in the near future on how many more shaves he gets out of this blade!! The price to me is great! I think it is very much worth it for the length of time that the blades last, it does pay for itself very quickly!    Please take a look at the full review on my site: [...]</li>
            <li> The seller was great, product arrived quickly and I can&#x27;t fault them for a mediocre product. This blade extender did little if anything to extend the shelf life of my Gillette blades and corroded after about 2 months.</li>
            <li> Purchased this about a year ago and have been using it since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve use it on my proglide and disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely lengthens the life of my razors - but not a &amp;#34;new blade&amp;#34; shave every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly though, a large part of why this may work is that they recommend you dry the razor (which probably prevents oxidation and blade dulling).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I have had a blade magnet, like this which I purchased through Sharper Image. It worked fantasticly. I was able to use one Gillette multiblade for 2-3 months before replacement and shaved daily. The blade never skipped nor seemed dull.&lt;br /&gt;What I discovered is that the blades are made very thin and extremely sharp. What causes them to be &amp;#34;dull&amp;#34; is the thin blades are easily bent by contact with rough beards. By use of a strong magnetic field, the metal blade is bent back in shape and ready for the next use. It was never actually dull so it is like a new blade. You can use it over and again until you feel it is not performing, then simply replace the blade as before. In the meantine, you have saved $5-10 by using only one blade pack and not 5-10.&lt;br /&gt;This design is just like the one I had (and lost) years ago. This design is particularly suited for most American brands using multiple blades per razor head. Check it out...who else hates giving money to manufacturers for planned obsolence of reuseable products?</li>
            <li> No noticeable improvement-waste of $</li>
            <li> This works AMAZINGLY... in Florida the blades last for about a month to six weeks. Before using this, a blade would only be good for about 10 days for me. My Father in NY (where the water is soft) has kept the same blade 10 times longer. This will save you money and let you use a great blade for so much longer.</li>
            <li> Took a used thrown away Gillette Fusion 5 blade cartridge out of the trash pail, washed it, put it on this &amp; the next day it was as good as new! What more need be said? Oh, even works on electric razor blades if you set just the blades, minus the foil, on the copper &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34;. Works on my Gillette Fusion Pro Glide with the thick handle. Just amazing! Saving lots of $$$ as the cartridges are AT LEAST 3.00 each-up to 8.00! ENJOY!</li>
            <li> I tried this for about two months, and honestly I could not really tell the difference. Maybe it worked but so subtly that I could not tell...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why there are so many 5 star reviews, but this did nothing for me! The blade just sat on some copper material and became dull just as fast as it normally would. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I admit it. I was a bit skeptical that this product would actually help preserve the quality if my razor blade, but it did. I use a Gillette Mach 3 razor and usually switch the cartridge once a week because it starts to get dull. After using the EverBlade, I noticed that my blade was still performing well at the one week mark. I now switch my cartridge every two weeks. This product is definitely paying off and I recommend anyone out there to use it. You&#x27;ll save cash and that&#x27;s something very important in this economy.</li>
            <li> Let me be concise and to the point: shavers, do you want to save money on razor blades? Buy the \\&quot;EverBlade\\&quot; sharpener; then treat yourself to something nice with the money you will save. I hope I&#x27;ve made it plain. AMAZON LIVES AND IT ROCKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The link: [...]</li>
            <li> This is great, I do not know how it works BUT IT DOES!With the cost of new blades Fusion&#x27;s are 5 blades for around 28 bucks this is a steal of a deal.You can save a lot of money going this way. My wife also used her Venus and it works like new. Save you self some money and buy this.</li>
            <li> So first of all, i was hesitant to buy this thing because the reviewers with positive feedback all seemed to have only 1 or no other reviews, so it made me skeptical.  However, after googling i found a blog and another random product review that said it worked, so i decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bottom line up front- my blades last about 3 to 4 times as long.  Now the details.  I have a thick beard, stereotypical Greek guy who has a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at 12 noon. I go through my Mach 3 blades about every 6 shaves, or one a week.  Using this thing, they now last just about 4 weeks, at which point i&#x27;m looking for a newly sharp blade. Note that before storing the blade, i pat it dry with a towel, and try to blow out the water between the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first 2 weeks, it&#x27;s pretty sharp. Week 2 it&#x27;s maybe 90-95% like new.  In the 3rd week, it starts to fade. It doesn&#x27;t feel as sharp, but it also doesn&#x27;t pull on the hairs.  I guess the lack of corrosion on the blade makes it a more comfortable shave even though the blade isn&#x27;t as sharp.  By the 4th week, it&#x27;s definitely feeling like an older blade that needs to be tossed soon. I feel like i can make it last another week, but i just want a new sharp blade by that point. And i&#x27;m pretty satisfied- to get 4 weeks out of a blade where before it was only lasting me 1 week is absolutely a success in my book.</li>
            <li> Have owned two of the EverBlades over the past few years and have been satisfied with their performance.  They definitely keep the razorblades sharper than if you don&#x27;t use it.  Of course over time, the sharpening power on the blades diminishes, but I think I had my first EverBlade for at least a year before replacing it with a new one. I do put my razor in it every day.</li>
            <li> I was having a serious issue with my travel bag and my razors.  The blade would get all rusty between trips and I was left with a useless razor.  Even the spare blades would rust in my ditty bag.  I tried putting desiccant in the ditty bag and that didn&#x27;t help.  So I bought 3 different blade saver products to see if I could find a solution.  The one that had a motorized sander was useless.  The one that had a rubber matt thingy to rub the blade on was useless.  I thought Everblade was the dumbest idea of all three but gave it a try last.  I&#x27;ll be darned.  It worked perfectly for what I needed.  I had to use a rubber band to hold it in the tray while traveling.  But after 6 months of use, I no longer have rusty blades.  What I do have is an Everblade with the copper part that has since turned a nice blue-green color indicating it has been working flawlessly as the sacrificial cathode for my steel razor blades.  I don&#x27;t take the time to dry the blades or anything.  I just put the razor in before I leave and or return from a trip.  I used to change blades before every trip and take a spare.  The blade on my razor now has been on there for over a month (and I travel every week).  So, if you are looking for something to keep your blade from rusting, this Everblade works great.  Beyond that, not sure it would be useful.  Tom</li>
            <li> I have no problem with this product. For the time I have had it which is about 2 weeks I have experienced a smoother daily shave. I like this product a lot.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas he loves it. Well worth the money, saves a lot on the high price of new razor blades,</li>
            <li> This product is NOT a sharpener. It simply keeps you blade sharper for longer because there is a small ionic field where the blade sits. That ionic fields prevents rust and build up from dulling the blade. It does not sharpen it.</li>
