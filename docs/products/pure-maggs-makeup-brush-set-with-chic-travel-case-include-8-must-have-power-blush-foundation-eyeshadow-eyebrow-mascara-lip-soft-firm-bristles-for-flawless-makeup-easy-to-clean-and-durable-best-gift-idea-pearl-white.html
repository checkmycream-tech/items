            <li>/&gt;-angled eye brow brush which is also useful when putting on eyeliner&lt;</li>

            <li>I always worry of dust getting in my brushes, but now not so much!</li>
            <li>The brush holder is a nicely designed leather bucket to keep all brushed stored in dry and clean condition.</li>
            <li>Each pen has its own plastic cover, so over time the color powders won&#x27;t mess up the case.</li>
            <li>Very soft ...for the price you won&#x27;t find a better set of luxurious brushes especially that come in a protective, sturdy, leather brush tube!</li>
            <li>what kind of brush each is just in case you&#x27;re not familiar with the purpose of each one.</li>
            <li>I find myself using these brushes on a daily basis now, and have even gotten a few people to order them so they can have a great experience applying their makeup.</li>
            <li>The brushes worked really well to apply my makeup.  </li>
            <li>The worked really well with my blush and eye shadow.  </li>
            <li>I am very picky about my brushes.</li>
            <li>I will be doing a makeup look video using these brushes for my blog, and I will post the link when the video is ready.</li>
            <li>Wow! fast shipment!  </li>
            <li>The handles are white with silver fittings and the bristles are clean and well-made.</li>
            <li>the brushes are very soft and do not feel very synthetic.</li>

            <li>These brushes pleasantly surprised me.  </li>
            <li>needed new brushes because I have a 2 and a 4 year old daughter, so obviously.  </li>
            <li>It makes the brushes a class higher than expected.</li>
            <li>I only give 5 star ratings to those products that I firmly believe are worthy!</li>
            <li>These tells me how soft it is ,and how great or bad it feels against my skin.</li>
            <li>The overall look of the brush is very professional.</li>
            <li>However, there definitely is a difference in low quality brushes and high quality brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>They are very soft, yet sturdy enough to grab enough product to apply.</li>

            <li> I do a lot of makeup, for others and for myself when I do costumes and cosplay, so I&#x27;m always looking for great products to use and to try to make the application easier. When I saw these as part of a promotion, I wanted to try them and I received them at a discount in exchange for a genuine critique of the product. I am happy to report that these brushes are beautiful. The initial packaging is a box with pictures of each brush and what kind of brush each is just in case you&#x27;re not familiar with the purpose of each one. The container for the brushes themselves come in a white faux-leather cylinder, clean and professional looking, with a luxurious feel. The top is easily separated from the bottom of the container and the bottom serves as a stand for easy access to the brushes. There are eight brushes inside, all of them sturdy and attractive. The handles are white with silver fittings and the bristles are clean and well-made. Each brush is contained in its own plastic case except for the lipstick brush which comes in a metal case. There is very little shedding of bristles even in the first few uses. Overall, these are beautiful and functional brushes that are going to give you clean and effective lines and blend like a pro. Overall, very happy with these!</li>
            <li> This brush set is very soft and nice. I love the essential brushes and little extras like the mascara brush and the lip brush. The nice leather like brush holder case is a perfect way to keep your brushes contained and clean. Looks very nice on the counter. This set would make a great gift.&lt;br /&gt;Synthetic brushes that do not shed. Perfect for daily use. This set includes-&lt;br /&gt;-powder brush&lt;br /&gt;-blush brush&lt;br /&gt;-foundation brush&lt;br /&gt;-eye shadow brush for the upper lid&lt;br /&gt;-eye shadow brush for the lower lid&lt;br /&gt;-angled eye brow brush which is also useful when putting on eyeliner&lt;br /&gt;-mascara wand&lt;br /&gt;-lip brush that comes with a nice lid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this set. I got a great discount on this set and agreed to give them a try and give my opinion on how they worked.</li>
            <li> Great product - super fast delivery!</li>
            <li> This is a great value-for-money brush set! I didn&#x27;t expect the quality can be so satisfying when I ordered it condsidering the price is quite reasonable. The brush holder is a nicely designed leather bucket to keep all brushed stored in dry and clean condition. All the brush handles are made in chunky pieces of wood with smooth surface. Very easy to control! Nice texture of the hair to make sure the cosmetics can be evenly dressed on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I have to say this is a brush set for make-up specialists and trendy ladies.  All the brushes are well designed to do very specific make-up procedure.! Great price for designer&#x27;s product indeed!!</li>
            <li> I received this beautiful set today, and I am so glad I bought this product. The make-up brushes are so soft and gentle on the skin. This set came with a leather case which I think is so cool because I&#x27;ll be able to keep them organized &amp; I can take them with me on my travels. This set is just so amazing! Thank you Pure Maggs!</li>
            <li> Wow! fast shipment!  As a make up artist, I like to try different brushes. I find this one to be quite professional in quality, it has soft but dense texture, making it great for application.  I highly recommend these brushes for everybody.  Value and quality extremely on the high side.</li>
            <li> the brushes are very soft and do not feel very synthetic. They are perfectly fluffy and very well made! They are very soft on my skin and I have had no issues with them. The carrying case is included and is a hard leather cylinder. I love this set!</li>
            <li> I bought this product at a discount for an honest feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This order cane in 2 days via Amazon prime. When I opened the box, I was very impressed with the presentation. The product was well-packed. The makeup brush container is definitely a bonus -iit justifies the price. The quality of the brush is great. I love make-up and would invest in quality so, I use mostly high end brands. Having said that, brushes are a key in great makeup application. I gave it a trial run and so far, I am very impressed with it. It is synthetic but it doesn&#x27;t feel like synthetic. I have sensitive skin so I need a brush that will hold up to constant cleaning. This does the job and held up after I washed it. I didn&#x27;t see any hairs fall out. A good quality brush nowadays will cost you a good bit and this set at this price is a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone looking out to a nifty and handy makeup brush set that is well-made and lightweight.</li>
            <li> I brought it for my wife as part of her traveling kits. I like the idea of having all brushes housed in a can tidily. The packaging is fair on that price, but I really like the leather-covered can case. It makes the brushes a class higher than expected. The brushes themselves are pretty good, making is good too. Each pen has its own plastic cover, so over time the color powders won&#x27;t mess up the case. If you have a dark color case surely my wife will buy one more set.</li>
            <li> Great quality. Great shape and very well made</li>
            <li> Very soft ...for the price you won&#x27;t find a better set of luxurious brushes especially that come in a protective, sturdy, leather brush tube! The brush&#x27;s work great! Can&#x27;t wait to recommend to all my girl friends!!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! The whole package looks and feels luxurious, and the brushes are easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Bough these for my wife, these are her words:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed new brushes because I have a 2 and a 4 year old daughter, so obviously.  These brushes pleasantly surprised me.  They come in a nice round box, perfect for keeping the bristles from losing their form.  The brushes worked really well to apply my makeup.  The worked really well with my blush and eye shadow.  If I had one piece of advice for the makers, it would be to add one medium sized brush for applying eye shadow.  I would highly recommend these brushes to anyone looking to add some high quality, soft, and durable make up brushes to their collection. Five Stars!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons and tons of makeup brushes in the last six months. Never before would I have imagined that makeup brushes could be so vastly different. However, there definitely is a difference in low quality brushes and high quality brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set is an absolute great set. Especially for a beginner. I love the packaging and the holder. The bottom of it is a lot shorter than other holders I&#x27;ve tried in the past. This is good because it&#x27;s much easier to see what your reaching for and also allows you to use it for smaller brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes themselves are pretty nice. I think one of my favorite things is the eyelash / eyebrow brush as well as the powder and blush brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, they aren&#x27;t the highest of quality that I&#x27;ve tried, but they are pretty damn close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Sample Provided for Testing &amp; Review.</li>
            <li> Very nice brushes. Great leather case. Really good price. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I am a huge beauty addict, and have tried so many different makeup brushes. I am very picky about my brushes. I am always excited and willing to try any new beauty product. When I saw these on Amazon, I thought it was definitely worth a try. When I got them in the mail, I immediately notices they came in a very nice little package. When you open the package up, you will really be impressed. The brushes come in a great, sturdy container that is very sleek and super useful. It will not take up a lot of space, and it&#x27;s perfect to travel with. The brushes themselves were far better than I ever expected! These are truly a great value! They are very soft, yet sturdy enough to grab enough product to apply. I usually just test a brush out first simply by rubbing it across my face without any makeup. These tells me how soft it is ,and how great or bad it feels against my skin. These brushes felt AMAZING against my skin. I highly recommend them. I will be doing a makeup look video using these brushes for my blog, and I will post the link when the video is ready. They apply makeup so seamlessly and beautifully. I have a $200 set of makeup brushes that are horrible and shed like crazy. This set of brushes are so much better! So don&#x27;t let this great price make you think they aren&#x27;t good quality brushes. This company simply wanted us buyers to have a nice quality set of brushes for an amazing price. I love finding great deals! This set of brushes would also make a great gift, or treat yourself to something that will make you feel beautiful. Every woman needs a good, quality set of brushes and I believe this set will not disappoint you. I did order these at a promotional price in exchange for my honest observation. I only give 5 star ratings to those products that I firmly believe are worthy! I find myself using these brushes on a daily basis now, and have even gotten a few people to order them so they can have a great experience applying their makeup.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes as they are soft and gentle to skin.  Priced reasonable and fabulous customer service!</li>
            <li> These are really nice.  High quality, and a great value for the price.  The case is great too - I use it to travel as well as store them on my vanity.  They hold up nicely to washing as well.</li>
            <li> Before this I only owned 3 brushes: an eyeshadow brush, make up brush, and a blush brush. Brushes were just too expensive for me to buy, at least for the ones that didn&#x27;t feel fake, harsh, or cheap, or just a combination of all 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave these brushes a try after reading about the quality of what they were made with and figured if I ended up not liking them I would at least have an awesome case that I could use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;m glad I gave these a try, they&#x27;re wonderful! They remind me of Smashbox brushes which are ALOT more expensive.  For the price of these 8 you wouldn&#x27;t even be able to buy 1 main cosmetic brand brush (and you get an awesome case too)! The hairs are very high quality, there is no glue anywhere on the brush which you see on brushes that are not done well, the brushes are extremely soft and do an awesome job at applying make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handles are a pearilized white and the brush hair looks like a heather-gray sable color. The overall look of the brush is very professional. And the case is awesome. It has a top if you would like to take it traveling with you, or you could remove the top and leave it on your counter and it looks lovely as it&#x27;s a white leather with white stitching finishing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a promotional price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I bought only the lipstick brush so I don&#x27;t understand this review request.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing! I&#x27;ve purchased all my brushes from Avon over the years individually one at a time as needed. I thought they were terrific brushes until I won the opportunity to purchase these at a promotional discounted price for evaluation and review. All the Avon brushes are now going into the garage sale box. The white leather brush holder is very nice. The bristles on these brushes are extremely soft and fine which I&#x27;ve noticed makes a huge difference in the distribution of my mineral makeup. Blending my eye makeup has never been easier. I always had a hard time getting both eyes even. These brushes make me a makeup artist. I love them!!</li>
            <li> The Pure Maggs Premium Synthetic Makeup Brush Set is Way bigger than I expected! I never read the demensions lol. Anywho. The brushes come smelling of cleaner so I would advise a good cleaning before use just to make sure that the chemicals they use to clean it do not react with you face. After I cleaned my brushes then laid them brush tilting down to prevent water seeping into the metal, I noticed how very, very soft they were. The heads of the brushes are very full of bristles. I did recieve this product for review and I am very pleased that I got the opportunity to review these for you. I highly recommend adding this sleek set and holder to your set. I always worry of dust getting in my brushes, but now not so much!</li>
            <li> Wonderful set of makeup brushes for all your makeup applying . They are high quality and come in a beautiful easy to store case , for travel or home .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are a premium synthetic and natural hair brushes that  hold powder as well as liquid cosmetics beautifully.These are comparable to other professional makeup brush sets.&lt;br /&gt;You will receive powder, blush, foundation, eyeshadow, eyebrow, mascara and lip brushes, with a wonderful case for all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes have special. longer handles and denser, fuller brush heads that release just the right amount of make up onto your skin.These brushes leave your skin smooth and gently and flawlessly distribute the liquid and powder and Mineral based makeup. These brushes leave your skin happy and evenly covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for everyone to have in your makeup kit.</li>
            <li> Wow! This is such an excellent quality makeup brush set. It has its own case and looks expensive. The brushes work great and allow me to apply my makeup with professional precision. I highly recommend them. I bought these at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> The overall appearance of all eight essential brushes housed in a white cylinder is what caught my attention. Most importantly, the brushes are soft, easy to use and price is reasonable. Perfect choice! ^.^</li>
