            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Well, $8 for this kind of mascara(even</li>
            <li>REALLY NICE PRODUCT</li>
            <li>It is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>This is the next best thing to sliced bread.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara in all my years of mascara</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve never had this mascara leak, smudge, or smear, making it my favorite of all time.</li>
            <li>I have tried a myriad of mascaras products only to find that Max Factor is the VERY BEST!  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Never makes my lashes look spidery, and it&#x27;s super easy to put on my stubbly bottom lashes too.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I found my wonderful Max Factor Waterproof Mascara, I was so sad when Max Factor did not sell it anymore in any place, but now that I can buy it.</li>
            <li>I used to live in NYC and was able to buy</li>
            <li>This small wand is great for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I should call it a brush as it looks more like a tiny comb...</li>
            <li>my favorite Max Factor mascara(which is not this one obviously...) from Duane Reade</li>
            <li>I like the product, the price and the fast delivery!</li>
            <li>use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It visibly lengthens and darkens my lashes, and works even better when I use a second coat.</li>
            <li>Besides, I got my package fast and with no problem.</li>
            <li>Have been using this mascara since I was in high school!  </li>
            <li>I came across this particular mascara</li>
            <li>The packaging and applicator are an older style.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>For starters.. I have struggled with very straight short lashes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone that likes a completely smudge-proof, waterproof mascara!&lt;br /&gt;elm</li>
            <li>It makes sense, there would be more control using a tapered small wand.</li>
            <li>I hear that many professional make-up artists like the small wands too.  </li>
            <li>they INSTANTLY become straight.</li>
            <li>Love Max Factor... didn&#x27;t mean to get waterproof though..</li>
            <li>I was soooo sad and was really excited when I found out that Amazon.com has MF mascaras available...</li>
            <li>did not like paid too much for it to be dry.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve used every major brand</li>
            <li>I have those very stubborn lashes that take forever to curl and when I get them wet with water, tears or even mascara</li>
            <li>I wish I could switch out the brush to much fuller one from some other brand</li>

            <li> I have blonde eyelashes and need to get mascara very close to the base of my eyelashes. This small wand is great for that purpose.  I like the black/brown color because it is softer not as harsh. I also like the mascara because it does not clump up like some do.  I can only wear waterproof mascara, others run and it is a big mess.  Unfortunately, this mascara is now discontinued in the US only being sold in Europe now.  I stocked up with a year supply, but all good things seem to come to an end.  Boo hoo for me!  I hear that many professional make-up artists like the small wands too.  It makes sense, there would be more control using a tapered small wand.</li>
            <li> Max factor&#x27;s eyeshadow is excellent quality at a reasonable price.  I  am especially happy it comes in waterproof, since I wear contacts.</li>
            <li> I would have given this mascara 5 stars only I prefer black and that is hard to find. Curl your lashes and put this perfect mascara on..they will stay that way allll day, promise!</li>
            <li> You cannot see this tiny brush in the picture but oh it is tiny... I don&#x27;t know if I should call it a brush as it looks more like a tiny comb... I used to live in NYC and was able to buy my favorite Max Factor mascara(which is not this one obviously...) from Duane Reade but then they stopped carrying Max Factor brand. I was soooo sad and was really excited when I found out that Amazon.com has MF mascaras available... How disappointing... I wish I could switch out the brush to much fuller one from some other brand but that&#x27;s annoying...&lt;br /&gt;Well, $8 for this kind of mascara(even if it&#x27;s MF)is too expensive!!! Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> For starters.. I have struggled with very straight short lashes. I have those very stubborn lashes that take forever to curl and when I get them wet with water, tears or even mascara they INSTANTLY become straight. I have spent money on mascaras that are supposed to keep your lashes curled... They have never worked for me. I came across this particular mascara and I said.. what the heck.. I need something waterproof... so i bought it.. I got it in the mail.. curled my lashes and put the mascara on.. AND YES my Jaw dropped..My lashed STAYED CURLED!! They look great!! I&#x27;m sooo happy with this mascara. I went to a family party that weekend and told my mom, sister and aunts!! Yes.. sounds stupid but I did. This is the next best thing to sliced bread.</li>
            <li> Best waterproof mascara ever!! Tried many mascaras, this is shiny and keeps eyelashes curled! Loved it!! Wish I would have bought more than one!! 👍🏻😉</li>
            <li> REALLY NICE PRODUCT MY FRIEND LOVES THIS  SHE LOVES WHEN I CAN GET THESE FOR HER A GOOD BUY FOR U</li>
            <li> Merchandise received was not as pictured. It is Max  volume couture. The packaging and applicator are an older style.</li>
            <li> I like the product, the price and the fast delivery!</li>
            <li> This product was discontinued at my local pharmacy and I couldn&#x27;t find it elsewhere.  I found it on E-bay/Amazon so I purchased 4. This product is waterproof so it doesn&#x27;t run, the brush is perfect for applying to bottom lashes and separating the top lashes. I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara in all my years of mascara use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It visibly lengthens and darkens my lashes, and works even better when I use a second coat. Never makes my lashes look spidery, and it&#x27;s super easy to put on my stubbly bottom lashes too. It is waterproof, so I use an oil-based makeup remover to remove it at night (takes it off with one swipe, no rubbing needed). Some will come off in the shower too, with plain water, but not all of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had this mascara leak, smudge, or smear, making it my favorite of all time.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I found my wonderful Max Factor Waterproof Mascara, I was so sad when Max Factor did not sell it anymore in any place, but now that I can buy it. Besides, I got my package fast and with no problem.</li>
            <li> Love Max Factor... didn&#x27;t mean to get waterproof though..</li>
            <li> Have been using this mascara since I was in high school!  It has become difficult to find in the U.S.  I highly recommend it to anyone that likes a completely smudge-proof, waterproof mascara!&lt;br /&gt;elm</li>
            <li> I am a 75 years of age woman and accused of stepping out of a band box on a daily basis.  I have endeavored to look my best to please my husband of 57 years.  I have tried a myriad of mascaras products only to find that Max Factor is the VERY BEST!  It doesn&#x27;t flake or smear or run on my face for any reason.  I have learned that Max Factor has retreated to the European market and have had to order it via e-mail through Amazon because it is no longer in our American stores.  This makes me sad, but thankful it is available to me at all.  Max Factor, PLEASE RETURN TO US,</li>
            <li> This stuff never sets, it just stays this awful oily consistency. It smears everywhere. This is not &#x27;The Crow&#x27;. I don&#x27;t need streaks of mascara running down my face.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  It is by far the best.  I just wish I could find the one that has the little comb, not a brush.</li>
            <li> It was dry not happy with it will not order no more..  did not like paid too much for it to be dry.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used. And I&#x27;ve used every major brand, I believe, there is. Goes on smoothly. Hardly clumps at all.  (I know, a lot of them say they don&#x27;t, but they all do at least a little.)  Highly recommend it.</li>
