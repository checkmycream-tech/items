    <ol>
            <li>Awesome.</li>
            <li>this is great for the apperence factor but has a fragrant odor and clashed with my perfume scent gave me a headache</li>
            <li>I like this product, it smells good</li>
            <li>Nice product and spray holds nicely</li>
            <li>Best way to spread lots of glitter all over, really fufilling</li>
            <li>I will order more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing the glitter might have clogged the valve, and let most of the propellant leak out.</li>
            <li>and I love the gold dust on my skin</li>
            <li>I definitely wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li>washes easily    </li>
            <li>it was the gold dust come off my skin very quickly....</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a really fine glittery dust instead of visible pieces.</li>
            <li>It smells too strong but the biggest issue was it sprayed about a good 5 seconds and was empty.</li>
            <li>It washed right out of my hair and clothes with no problem.</li>
            <li>The kids at the party loved it and it was not so bold as to make the mom&#x27;s worried about what their little girls looks like.</li>
            <li>(But, that can be a Pro too ;) )</li>
            <li>So pretty disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Made my hair sparkle, and stuck to my clothes really well (it was intended, before I sprayed it on my clothes they were only lightly dusted with glitter.)</li>
            <li>Not as much sparkle as I was hoping would stick to your body.  </li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s probably a decent glitter spray.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So long and short, if you just want some spray glitter, this might be okay.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be randomly waking up with glitter on your face, or finding glitter on your clothes for a good week or so.</li>

            <li> But the damn can was mostly flat.</li>
            <li> Even after multiple shakes, it had a blast of clear, runny, liquid and a FEW sparkles.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really not much to say  Pros:  </li>
            <li> one was totally empty</li>
            <li> the other had problems.</li>
            <li> cuz my hair is realy dark</li>
            <li> waste of money</li>
            <li> me clairify i got this for my robotics teams competition this past saturday</li>
            <li> staying power not great...</li>
            <li> Bottle was too small but it worked like a charm scent wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> Expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> But, maybe I got a fluke item, but be wary about doing test-runs with it.</li>
            <li> this was really bad</li>
            <li> it didnt leave my hair in anykind of bad condition</li>
            <li> SO DISAPPOINTED!</li>

            <li> Clogged after I used it for one spray.</li>
            <li> Nice product and spray holds nicely</li>
            <li> this is great for the apperence factor but has a fragrant odor and clashed with my perfume scent gave me a headache</li>
            <li> The kids at the party loved it and it was not so bold as to make the mom&#x27;s worried about what their little girls looks like.</li>
            <li> Obviously, like with ANY glitter it will get EVERYWHERE. But it definitely does the job. Made my hair sparkle, and stuck to my clothes really well (it was intended, before I sprayed it on my clothes they were only lightly dusted with glitter.) It washed right out of my hair and clothes with no problem. I like that it&#x27;s a really fine glittery dust instead of visible pieces. It literally just adds a sparkle to you instead of looking like you&#x27;re coated in glitter.     There&#x27;s really not much to say  Pros:  sparkly  sticks well  washes easily    Cons:  You&#x27;ll be randomly waking up with glitter on your face, or finding glitter on your clothes for a good week or so. (But, that can be a Pro too ;) )</li>
            <li> Not as much sparkle as I was hoping would stick to your body.  Spray it outside, it gets all over the place!</li>
            <li> this was really bad it didnt leave my hair in anykind of bad condition but it didnt even show up i couldnt see any sparkle in my hair or my friends&lt;br /&gt;Let me clairify i got this for my robotics teams competition this past saturday and i put it on my hair and my friends and NOTHING SHOWED i tried it on mine earlier and i thought maybe its just me cuz my hair is realy dark but my friends hair is blonde and it didnt show DO NOT GET THIS</li>
            <li> Expensive for what you get. But it did the job</li>
            <li> Awesome. I will order more</li>
            <li> SO DISAPPOINTED! It smells too strong but the biggest issue was it sprayed about a good 5 seconds and was empty. I think I received maybe a faulty can? However I cannot return because its been &amp;#34;opened.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s probably a decent glitter spray. But when I got it, I did a test-shot. Then waited a week to use it for my costume. But the damn can was mostly flat. I&#x27;m guessing the glitter might have clogged the valve, and let most of the propellant leak out. So pretty disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So long and short, if you just want some spray glitter, this might be okay. But, maybe I got a fluke item, but be wary about doing test-runs with it.</li>
            <li> Best way to spread lots of glitter all over, really fufilling</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t spray on as it should have.</li>
            <li> I like this product, it smells good and I love the gold dust on my skin, however what I didn&#x27;t like abt it was the gold dust come off my skin very quickly....staying power not great...</li>
            <li> Bottle was too small but it worked like a charm scent wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> when it arrived had propellent problems and the nozzle clogged up while spraying. bought 2 cans one was totally empty the other had problems. Got one use out of it. waste of money</li>
            <li> This was overall TOO RUNNY. Even after multiple shakes, it had a blast of clear, runny, liquid and a FEW sparkles. I definitely wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
