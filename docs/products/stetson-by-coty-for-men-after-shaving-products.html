            <li> One of my three favorite colognes/aftershave fragrances-- has been hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> As long as it is sold I will be a buyer.</li>
            <li> It has a moderate scent that reminds me of aged wood or leather.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it as long as I can remember!  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to have the same scent of my previous bottle purchased in a store</li>
            <li> I was actually nervous ordering this because it was about 75% less than I was used to paying at CVS.  </li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t ever used Stetson the only way to describe it as a scent is humble.</li>
            <li> If I controlled a small island such as the \\&quot;Catalinas\\&quot;I would probally ban it&#x27;s sales and usage too.</li>
            <li> I HAD A HARD TIME FINDING THIS SIZE IN MY AREA</li>
            <li> i have to have this in at least one form in the B.R. (preferrabley both)</li>
            <li> It is really scary the way they just force themselves on me be very careful not to wear this at church.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Stetson!  </li>
            <li> I think it smells like a stinky crap.</li>

            <li> Excellent product, I use it all the time</li>
            <li> Have used this for years but not at this price.</li>
            <li> Same  scent that Stetson  started with.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t ever used Stetson the only way to describe it as a scent is humble. It has a citrusy, flowery, but still masculine aroma. I began using Stetson when my grandfather passed away and someone gave me his old bottle. I got so many compliments I decided to start using aftershave all the time. Naturally as a younger teen I didn&#x27;t really need it, and I&#x27;m sure I applied too much. I liked it. I have tried lots of other brands, and they are all pretty good. If you, like me, don&#x27;t need an overpowering and bold smelling aftershave then Stetson will make you a very happy customer.</li>
            <li> This is a great fragrance, Very unique and underrated. I  got this a s a gift once, i then got hooked. Its not to sweet nor does it have that real strong cinammon-ish typ fragrance that others have.  i have to have this in at least one form in the B.R. (preferrabley both) The after-shave or the cologne, Nontetheless i cherish it very much!</li>
            <li> Smells like Stetson . What else can be said ?</li>
            <li> My favorite aftershave lotion period!!!!!</li>
            <li> Works as specified. I like the cologne so I ordered this too.  I like this product.</li>
            <li> I always buy this product. I like it.</li>
            <li> I have used Stetson for years, the price is right and fragrance is not over powering. As long as it is sold I will be a buyer.</li>
            <li> husband loves this stuff and Amazon is the best buy</li>
            <li> My wife likes stetson aftershave on me and to get it at a really good price.&lt;br /&gt;  We LIKE it a lot.</li>

            <li> Smells Very Nice. It is a much better price then buying it at a store like a CVS. I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because i like the scent, but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> I like the scent of a real man. You should try this, if you are a macho man.</li>
            <li> Ordering through Amazonia is great, beats even Walmart prices.  I do not advise this product to 1%, you might smell like 99% of USA population.</li>
            <li> My primary after shave.  Soothes without an overpowering scent.  Cheaper on line than at Walmart.  Didn&#x27;t think that was possible but it&#x27;s $3.00 for the 3.5 Oz.</li>
            <li> Very nice, much nicer than I expected.</li>
            <li> Stetson is my favorite aftershave.  This is a large bottle, great value for the size and cost.</li>
            <li> I like the price and the aftersave</li>
            <li> Product arrived as advertised and on time.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and people often ask what brand it is when the smell it on me.  really depends on your likes.</li>
            <li> A good company to do business with. Product was as advertised.  Well priced and timely delivery.</li>
            <li> very good after shave will order again</li>
            <li> I think it smells like a stinky crap.If I controlled a small island such as the \\&quot;Catalinas\\&quot;I would probally ban it&#x27;s sales and usage too.But it wasnt for me,it was for my step-father.My mother said he would like it and she liked it on him \\&quot;just something about it on HIM\\&quot;she said... what-ever.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and if she is happy so am I.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRICE AND CAME ON TIME.</li>
            <li> Makes you smell like a man.</li>
            <li> It has a moderate scent that reminds me of aged wood or leather.  A lot of aftershaves have a floral or sweet smell but this is definitely more subtle and masculine.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Stetson!  I&#x27;ve been using it as long as I can remember!  The ladies love it!</li>
            <li> Christmas present for hubby!</li>
            <li> My favorite after shave</li>
            <li> Nice size - good value.</li>
            <li> One of my three favorite colognes/aftershave fragrances-- has been hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and a perfect soothing sensation after a shave.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to have the same scent of my previous bottle purchased in a store</li>
            <li> Great Aftershave - Good Price for Quantity 3.5 oz</li>
            <li> What can I say oh its a great product been using for years</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe what a deal this was!  Our local CVS no longer carries Stetson, my husband&#x27;s favorite, so as a last measure I checked out Amazon.  I was actually nervous ordering this because it was about 75% less than I was used to paying at CVS.  Well, let&#x27;s just say we&#x27;re never buying Stetson at CVS again!  LOL  This is the real thing, not a knock off, not discontinued, and smells like it should.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband as both he and I love the fragrance.  This was a good price. Just love the scent.</li>
            <li> Ever since I got this and have been wearing it I have to fight off the ladies. It is really scary the way they just force themselves on me be very careful not to wear this at church.</li>
            <li> My father wears this and was pleased to receive this bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m old school and this is one of my favs-the same product from the store so don&#x27;t hesitate.It Is shipped well-packed against breakage.</li>
            <li> This is the only after shave my husband uses and this was a great deal from start to finish!  Would recommend future purchases to anyone!</li>
            <li> I was looking for Stetson cologne for my husband for Valentine&#x27;s Day.  I priced it in the stores and it was a lot higher than what I found it on Amazon for.  It is the same stuff the stores sell, but for a lot better price</li>
            <li> I received it  quite fast and my brother was really happy with the gift.  It is one of his favorites.</li>
            <li> This is the only after shave that smells amazing and the only one I wear.  All the women love it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. The price is very competitive and Amazon delivers quickly. This the third time I&#x27;ve bought this from Amazon and will continue to do so. Thanks, Jim</li>
            <li> Had to return it because I thought I had ordered Stetson pre electric hhave, not aftershave! I thought for sure it said pre electric shave!!!</li>
            <li> Not much to say other than it is exactly what I ordered and a great price.</li>
            <li> MY 13 YEAR OLD SON DISCOVERED THIS AFTERSHAVE AT CHRISTMAS TIME.  I HAD A HARD TIME FINDING THIS SIZE IN MY AREA SO I REVERTED TO THE INTERNET.  THE ITEM CAME PACKAGED VERY WELL AND HE IS VERY MUCH ENJOYING IT.</li>
            <li> Great scent and my husband loves this.</li>
            <li> Is exactly what my Fiance was looking for. Was a smash hit at Christmas</li>
