    <ol>
            <li>as a diffuser it worked great!</li>
            <li>and it works wonderful</li>
            <li>Perfect size.  </li>
            <li>(when you remove the chain) I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s great-</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this pendant.    </li>
            <li>and it works great</li>
            <li>Great quality product.</li>
            <li>Loved the charm...</li>
            <li>Scent lasts 3 or 4 days, which is really good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good quality heavy/sturdy necklace.</li>
            <li>Love this aromatherapy locket!  </li>
            <li>However the chain is really nice</li>
            <li>Love these diffuser pendant&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I love wearing it.  </li>
            <li>Now the oil is the real factor, but the necklace works great to hold the oil.</li>
            <li>There were many times</li>
            <li>High quality and look great too.</li>
            <li>Peppermint, which seems to be a favorite with many people has way too strong a scent for me in this pendant.  </li>
            <li>Easily falls open but perfect for work.  </li>
            <li>even just 2 drops was way too strong for me and it just made my eyes water.</li>
            <li>so I could switch scents more quickly than taking the scent pad out and putting another one in, so I originally ordered the \\&quot;oriental dome\\&quot;.     </li>
            <li>It has the appearance of a cheap carnival giveaway prize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>far as the actual function, as a diffuser, it is superb.  </li>
            <li>I love the pendant part, but I will not be using it more until I find a different chain for it.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I now just have a pretty container sitting on my desk with the aromas I so enjoy.</li>
            <li>My use will likely be primarily with perfumes and very lightly scented oils.</li>
            <li>I own the \\&quot;heart\\&quot; pendant and wanted a 2nd pendant</li>
            <li>I bought these for my daughters and they love using the essential oils to wear around their necks.  </li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Get one of the higher end $30 ones, even if you don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll wear it much.</li>
            <li>I lost my first and missed it so much I ordered another.</li>
            <li>The pendant while easy to open to refill is not &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I like to keep peppermint in it when I travel as the scent really helps with motion sickness.</li>
            <li>I do really like the concept of a diffuser necklace</li>
            <li>It made the aroma in it a little overwhelming for the first hour or so of my day, and I wasn&#x27;t able to wear any other types of necklaces.  </li>
            <li>Keeps aroma a very long time on pad and is easy to refill.</li>
            <li>I knew I wasn&#x27;t getting some high end necklace at $14</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting a different chain, but the locket itself does exactly what it should.</li>
            <li>I got one for my younger daughter who was coveting it and now my older daughter wants one.</li>
            <li>The necklace has nothing that actually snaps closed, so it comes apart rather easily.</li>
            <li>great for those who want the benefits of essential oil aromatherapy without using an expensive diffuser or burning.</li>
            <li>I really like this essential oil necklace diffuser and get compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li>I use Young Living Stress Away in this when I go out shopping</li>
            <li>Not a beautiful piece of jewlery but interesting and functional.</li>
            <li>The chain is very long, which I liked, but it&#x27;s also quite thick and kind of ugly.</li>
            <li>Pretty, but the clasp broke within a few days.</li>
            <li>The chain is really long and gave me a small reaction so I switched it out with a shorter real silver chain I already had on hand and that fixed the issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
    </ol>

            <li> When I am stressed while out, if waiting in line or dealing with rude cashiers or customers or other drivers or my kids throw a fit, I just hold the necklace up to my nose and inhale deeply.</li>
            <li> I decided looking up all natural ways to deal with my allergies because I already have a lot of essential oils on hand for other household stuff.</li>
            <li> It comes with 6 felt pieces so you only have enough for 2 weeks--which should have clued me in on how long the necklace would last.  </li>
            <li> turns back if oil pad left in to long.</li>
            <li> Now I will have to get a second one for me, because my son took my other one I ordered from a different cite.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s long and not cumbersome.</li>
            <li> As you walk it slides open and closed.  </li>
            <li> so what I suggested to him was a few drops on a Q-tip and to just swipe it around just barely inside his nose and that helps too, though it is short term than having a diffuser around all</li>
            <li> My personal opinion is that the chain is a little short for my taste.  </li>
            <li> It came fast and it is a subtle beauty.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m just not completely thrilled with the design of this particular one.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to take the chain a loose.</li>
            <li> I would look down and realize that the pad with the essential oils on it had fallen out.</li>
            <li> but still it only lasted 2 weeks before the chain snapped in half.  </li>
            <li> I tried every over the counter allergy pill I could, they only helped for a few days before they gave up on me.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;ll use a few drops of peppermint in the shower to open up my sinuses in the morning</li>
            <li> There is also no way to keep the necklace closed.  </li>
            <li> The chain is too long and too heavy and has no shine or sparkle.  </li>
            <li> I have bought ones previously that did not stay closed</li>
            <li> The only negative I have is the way it closes, and that could be strictly a preference on my part.</li>
            <li> It is not appropriate for office wear as there is not a professional appearance to it.  </li>
            <li> my husband says I look a bit odd when he sees me sniffing it</li>
            <li> I sent that one back because it was too difficult to add oil to it without having to take the entire thing off the chain.    </li>
            <li> Just use something with a very thin blade like a Widget, pry the pendant open, insert the pad after putting 1 or 2 drops of Essential oil on it, then close it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smaller than I expected and really shallow hard to get a pad in</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d put a few drops on half a cotton ball.  </li>
            <li> It works as it&#x27;s supposed to, I found myself wearing it for a few days, and that was all.</li>
            <li> so I  could have 2 one for work and everyday use.  </li>
            <li> I do have a small child who likes to play with it, so I would not recommend this necklace for someone with a little person who might reach up and grab the necklace.</li>
            <li> and I usually use 2</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had really bad allergies since my husband and I moved to a new area.</li>
            <li> Not happy with it!  </li>
            <li> Definitely a disappointment!</li>
            <li> Even my horrible sterling silver (silver painted granite) made in china necklaces lasted about 2 months before snapping.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Gift for a friend.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> Got as a Christmas present.  Bigger and clunkier looking than in the photo.  Doesn&#x27;t close all the way.  Not happy with it!  Definitely a disappointment!</li>
            <li> It works as it&#x27;s supposed to, I found myself wearing it for a few days, and that was all. The chain is very long, which I liked, but it&#x27;s also quite thick and kind of ugly. I love the pendant part, but I will not be using it more until I find a different chain for it.</li>
            <li> Pretty, but the clasp broke within a few days.</li>
            <li> The only objection to this Diffuser is its unattractiveness.  The chain is too long and too heavy and has no shine or sparkle.  The pendant while easy to open to refill is not &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34;.  It has the appearance of a cheap carnival giveaway prize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the actual function, as a diffuser, it is superb.  I&#x27;ve used it with various oils and scents, and even tried it with Vicks Vapo Rub once (did not work too well).  Peppermint, which seems to be a favorite with many people has way too strong a scent for me in this pendant.  My use will likely be primarily with perfumes and very lightly scented oils.</li>
            <li> turns back if oil pad left in to long.</li>
            <li> Love these diffuser pendant&#x27;s. I bought them for my daughters for Christmas and they wear them daily. I have bought ones previously that did not stay closed and the pad would fall out of - these do not have that problem. High quality and look great too.</li>
            <li> Loved the charm...as a diffuser it worked great! The chain is bigger (thicker diameter) then I was expecting and it tended to grab the hair on my neck so I swapped it out with a different one, otherwise it would have gotten 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I have a tendon problem with my shoulder and I keep Petterment in it to help with the paid and it works wonderful</li>
            <li> Scent lasts 3 or 4 days, which is really good.  Five or six drops does the job and it&#x27;s well made. I got one for each of my daughters too.  We use it for aroma therapy.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to take the chain a loose. Just use something with a very thin blade like a Widget, pry the pendant open, insert the pad after putting 1 or 2 drops of Essential oil on it, then close it. Aroma lasts for hours! I need another one of these!</li>
            <li> Easily falls open but perfect for work.  I love wearing it.  I like the design and since I am not a necklace wearer, this works, it&#x27;s long and not cumbersome.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smaller than I expected and really shallow hard to get a pad in and I usually use 2 but that is just me. I am also not a fan of the way it opens with the chain going through an eye on both halves. However the chain is really nice and I do like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had really bad allergies since my husband and I moved to a new area. I tried every over the counter allergy pill I could, they only helped for a few days before they gave up on me. I decided looking up all natural ways to deal with my allergies because I already have a lot of essential oils on hand for other household stuff. Once I found this I decided to give it a shot with some lavender. Couple drops on the felt square and pop it in and it seems to keep my allergies at bay by opening up my sinuses!&lt;br /&gt;I tried some peppermint but even just 2 drops was way too strong for me and it just made my eyes water. Sometimes I&#x27;ll use a few drops of peppermint in the shower to open up my sinuses in the morning and that&#x27;s great- even my husband likes to do that. Also my husband pointed out that he likes how he sees this working for me but would not wear the pendant himself so what I suggested to him was a few drops on a Q-tip and to just swipe it around just barely inside his nose and that helps too, though it is short term than having a diffuser around all day.&lt;br /&gt;Last thing that is contributing to 1 star off is the necklace chain. The chain is really long and gave me a small reaction so I switched it out with a shorter real silver chain I already had on hand and that fixed the issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t re-purchase those felt squares go buy a bag of those circular makeup pads and cut them up and those will work just fine!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughters and they love using the essential oils to wear around their necks.  It&#x27;s a good quality heavy/sturdy necklace.</li>
            <li> It came fast and it is a subtle beauty. I bought this diffuser so I  could have 2 one for work and everyday use.  Now I will have to get a second one for me, because my son took my other one I ordered from a different cite.</li>
            <li> I knew I wasn&#x27;t getting some high end necklace at $14 but still it only lasted 2 weeks before the chain snapped in half.  Plus the ball is really really tiny.  I figured I&#x27;d put a few drops on half a cotton ball.  It&#x27;s closer to 1/16th of a cotton ball.  It comes with 6 felt pieces so you only have enough for 2 weeks--which should have clued me in on how long the necklace would last.  Even my horrible sterling silver (silver painted granite) made in china necklaces lasted about 2 months before snapping.  There is also no way to keep the necklace closed.  The two pieces have nothing that holds front and back together and keeps them from separating.  Not even a pin or magnet.  Nothing.  As you walk it slides open and closed.  Get one of the higher end $30 ones, even if you don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll wear it much.</li>
            <li> Love this aromatherapy locket!  I lost my first and missed it so much I ordered another. I got one for my younger daughter who was coveting it and now my older daughter wants one. I like to keep peppermint in it when I travel as the scent really helps with motion sickness. My daughter has a stressful job and likes to use calming scents. Not a beautiful piece of jewlery but interesting and functional. Keeps aroma a very long time on pad and is easy to refill. I wear it every day altho my husband says I look a bit odd when he sees me sniffing it lol</li>
            <li> I own the \\&quot;heart\\&quot; pendant and wanted a 2nd pendant so I could switch scents more quickly than taking the scent pad out and putting another one in, so I originally ordered the \\&quot;oriental dome\\&quot;.     I sent that one back because it was too difficult to add oil to it without having to take the entire thing off the chain.    This one is made like the heart in that it is hinged at the bottom and if you slacken the chain you can open the pendant to add oil to it and NOT have to take it off the chain.    I&#x27;m happy with this pendant.    Now if they just made matching aromatherapy earrings ... ;-)</li>
            <li> I really like this essential oil necklace diffuser and get compliments every time I wear it. The design allows the scent to be inhaled throughout the day. The only negative I have is the way it closes, and that could be strictly a preference on my part. Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I use Young Living Stress Away in this when I go out shopping and it works great, I never it open up on me or anything. When I am stressed while out, if waiting in line or dealing with rude cashiers or customers or other drivers or my kids throw a fit, I just hold the necklace up to my nose and inhale deeply. Now the oil is the real factor, but the necklace works great to hold the oil.</li>
            <li> I wear it constantly.  Great quality product.</li>
            <li> Perfect size.  My son loves it!</li>
            <li> it came as described and seems to open and close well (when you remove the chain) I&#x27;m very happy with it. great for those who want the benefits of essential oil aromatherapy without using an expensive diffuser or burning. I&#x27;m giving it as a gift.</li>
            <li> My personal opinion is that the chain is a little short for my taste.  It made the aroma in it a little overwhelming for the first hour or so of my day, and I wasn&#x27;t able to wear any other types of necklaces.  It is not appropriate for office wear as there is not a professional appearance to it.  I don&#x27;t believe you need to have something around your neck to get the benefits of the aroma therapy.  I now just have a pretty container sitting on my desk with the aromas I so enjoy.</li>
            <li> I do really like the concept of a diffuser necklace, I&#x27;m just not completely thrilled with the design of this particular one. The necklace has nothing that actually snaps closed, so it comes apart rather easily. I do have a small child who likes to play with it, so I would not recommend this necklace for someone with a little person who might reach up and grab the necklace. There were many times I would look down and realize that the pad with the essential oils on it had fallen out. This happened several times just from me walking around doing housework.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting a different chain, but the locket itself does exactly what it should.</li>
