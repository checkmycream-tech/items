            <li>Unless you are already bald good luck getting a full head of hair to stay under this one.</li>
            <li>Very beautiful, only it gets tangles every time I wear it.</li>
            <li>That arrived was more of an auburn.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a lot of space between the tracks, so i plan to sew in more hair to fill the gaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice style and cut but cheap plastic looking fibers.</li>
            <li>To top it off the smell of the wig almost made me throw up.</li>
            <li>She already talking about ordering more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long, beautiful, it does tangle easily but running your fingers through it cancels that out, and the best part is it LOOKS LIKE REAL HAIR!</li>
            <li>easy to take care of.</li>
            <li>Looks just like the picture and was easy for me to sew the wire combs in.</li>
            <li>Over all a great success, thanks for everything.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy wearing this.</li>
            <li>Feels and looks real enough, although I tend to find when you put a wig on, you feel kind of overwhelmed and freaked out for the first five seconds, and then it starts to look good.</li>
            <li>but im excited about it.</li>
            <li>it is very nice and long.</li>
            <li>it should last you a good while.</li>
            <li>hair is very pretty.  </li>
            <li>the other wig i got from them is pretty great fits well and the synth.</li>
            <li>cap fit very well, no need for pins or clips.</li>
            <li>I received a straight hair wig, when I ordered a curly full hair wig.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really really close!</li>
            <li>This is a nice wig and very soft but it&#x27;s way to long.</li>
            <li>okay wig not or long term wear</li>
            <li>Kind of an ashy black, it&#x27;s WAY longer than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>very silky.</li>
            <li>keep it on a wig head and don&#x27;t brush it, comb lightly with your fingers and wear it occasionally</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just that this wig is for a fast look for a week</li>
            <li>Thanks again...</li>
            <li>The head piece was kind of small</li>
            <li>Not even remotely realistic.</li>
            <li>It wasnt soft not even really curly.</li>
            <li>The hair was very soft and shiny and had a lot of movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hair does feel very real but just the wig is to long for me.</li>
            <li>The coloring could be a bit darker because it&#x27;s a touch lighter in reality, but the wig does look natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft &amp; a tad bit shinier than the pic</li>
            <li>/&gt;The wig shed tons, so much so that the back has thinned to where you can see the tracks.</li>
            <li>To even wear it I had to braid it into a big braid in order for it to look decent.</li>
            <li>It felt soft and like human hair.</li>
            <li>It got here much faster than Amazon thought it would--one week and a half instead of the predicted one month.</li>

            <li> i bought this for my sister and she just loved it, she said it was perfect for her so good choice!</li>
            <li> okay wig not or long term wear</li>
            <li> The coloring could be a bit darker because it&#x27;s a touch lighter in reality, but the wig does look natural. Its a good buy for the price. As always don&#x27;t forget to trim the bangs to match your face!</li>
            <li> Totally different product when you take it out of the package. It looked like Mannequin hair!!!!!!!! Horrible and I was duped!!</li>
            <li> i havent recived it yet&lt;br /&gt;i need it&lt;br /&gt;convention is on friday&lt;br /&gt;i need it&lt;br /&gt;why dont i  have it?</li>
            <li> I really enjoy wearing this. The color is beautiful, and the length was perfect.  I had to trim the bangs a bit to my liking. It looks great.</li>
            <li> Product got here on the 21st, estimated date was 13th-29th.. It doesn&#x27;t look \\&quot;EXACTLY\\&quot; like the pic does but it&#x27;s really really close! It&#x27;s soft &amp; a tad bit shinier than the pic but that&#x27;s to be expected. I haven&#x27;t tried it on yet but im excited about it. Over all I&#x27;d buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> What I received is not what I ordered. I received a straight hair wig, when I ordered a curly full hair wig.  You won&#x27;t get me again!!!</li>
            <li> This wig looks nothing like the picture. It&#x27;s a tad lighter in person and the hair is very thin. Not even remotely realistic. I gave it to my little sister to play around in. Trash.</li>
            <li> Kind of an ashy black, it&#x27;s WAY longer than I thought it would be. Good quality, and it arrived with a wig cap even!</li>
            <li> This wig is really long and thick. easy to take care of. very silky. The color can&#x27;t be beat for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful, only it gets tangles every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig in August, it came within two days. by the third day all the hair and fallen out of said wig.  just as i contacted them and was about to complain i got a begging letter from them asking me to not write a negative review but they will do their best to help me with my problem.  now i dont mind that, so long as you help me with my problem.  i chose a replacement wig and it was the middle of september, i still had not received it.  i then emailed them, and was told that i didnt reply to them stating which one i wanted ( which i did) so i told them.  another two weeks. finally at the beginning of October they sent the piece.  now this wig is pretty awesome,  its not this one here. it seems that in the storing of the one in the amazon warehouse that the adhesion of the hair has lessened somewhat.  They do help you out, send replacements, but you will have to wait a minute. also this wig was made for tiny chinese heads, be warned.  the other wig i got from them is pretty great fits well and the synth. hair is very pretty.  ppl on here say you get what you pay for well i have bought wigs all my life and while that may be true a good wig can be found at any price. they do have some good ones just read around the reviews to see which ones are best.</li>
            <li> I ordered it i dark brown, and the color. That arrived was more of an auburn. I would suggest to anyone to order a shade darker than what you think you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig shed tons, so much so that the back has thinned to where you can see the tracks. The hair also tangled continuously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cap fit very well, no need for pins or clips. The hair was very soft and shiny and had a lot of movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a lot of space between the tracks, so i plan to sew in more hair to fill the gaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wig could be used as a good base if you would like to add to it to make it what you want.</li>
            <li> I wig was beautiful. It felt soft and like human hair. It did tangle but nothing a wig brush can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> not good said they would send me another one never came don&#x27;t buy this would not recommend lying company !</li>
            <li> The head piece was kind of small but the wig is beautiful. It hasn&#x27;t tangled it is very nice and long.</li>
            <li> my daughter was very happy to receive this for a gift.  she loves that it is human made and she can do things with it</li>
            <li> It got here much faster than Amazon thought it would--one week and a half instead of the predicted one month. The box was a bit beat up, but that doesn&#x27;t matter. The wig is very nice. Feels and looks real enough, although I tend to find when you put a wig on, you feel kind of overwhelmed and freaked out for the first five seconds, and then it starts to look good. It&#x27;s a bit reddish brown, though.</li>
            <li> Nice style and cut but cheap plastic looking fibers. Bought for my daughter. Picture for quality is decieving.. Will not buy this brand again. Returned it.</li>
            <li> This is a truly wonderful wig! It&#x27;s long, beautiful, it does tangle easily but running your fingers through it cancels that out, and the best part is it LOOKS LIKE REAL HAIR! I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li> Looks just like the picture and was easy for me to sew the wire combs in. The cap is a bit small so people with a larger head might not want to order this one. I suggest not wearing this to bed! (who does that???) keep it on a wig head and don&#x27;t brush it, comb lightly with your fingers and wear it occasionally it should last you a good while. They are cheap so order more than one :D</li>
            <li> This is a nice wig and very soft but it&#x27;s way to long. The hair does feel very real but just the wig is to long for me.</li>
            <li> Where to start. The package came on time but the quality of this wig was terrible. To top it off the smell of the wig almost made me throw up. It wasnt soft not even really curly. I wish I could of gotten my money back. I didnt want to waste my money so I wore it for maybe 4 hours then threw it away. To even wear it I had to braid it into a big braid in order for it to look decent. Never will I order something like this again.</li>
            <li> Everything was great . It&#x27;s just that this wig is for a fast look for a week or so then it constantly sheds ,,,,!!</li>
            <li> My daughter was very pleased with the order, product, shipping. Over all a great success, thanks for everything. She already talking about ordering more. Thanks again... Joshua C.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your  mony it&#x27;s to long ohhhh my god i hate i got it for my mum she laughed her ass off.</li>
            <li> It looks so wired on my head and doesn&#x27;t like what it looks in the picture. I will not buy this kind of product from this store.</li>
            <li> It smelled! and this is for someone who has a small head</li>
            <li> The wig cap is way to small. Unless you are already bald good luck getting a full head of hair to stay under this one.</li>
