            <li>The tapered top makes it easy to apply foundation under eyes and around nose.  </li>
            <li>The brush itself it soft and the shape is great for the eye area and doesn&#x27;t make the concealer crease more when you apply it.</li>
            <li>Perfect for concealer , pretty soft !&lt;</li>
            <li>If you want light but precise foundation application, you NEED this brush!  </li>
            <li>I own many higher end brushes but this one outperforms the others.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure she will be thrilled to see this in her stocking ;)</li>
            <li>Hairs are soft and hold up great during washes.</li>
            <li>It is a great brush, no missing or out of place bristles.</li>
            <li>under eyes and around my nose so easy.  </li>

            <li>This is exactly what I wanted, good seller, quick receipt.  </li>
            <li>I tried this brush also with some of my more full coverage foundations and found it did not work as well for me as the F80.  </li>
            <li>My brushes came really fast and the packaging was really nice.</li>
            <li>It picks up all the extra concealer around my eyes and does a great job with blending.</li>
            <li>I need to buy a few more for myself and my makeup freelance kit!!!! .</li>
            <li>Brush quality is fantastic.</li>
            <li>for under my eyes and hour glass ambient light powder.  </li>
            <li>If you want a smooth, even &amp;#34;air brushed&amp;#34; look to your foundation like you see on magazine covers, then this type of brush is how you achieve it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i really enjoy all my sigma brushes, i have been buying them for almost a year already</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved the flat top kabuki for liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li>Definitely will be purchasing more !!</li>
            <li>The brush is large and very easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>This brush is my new favorite foundation brush!</li>
            <li>Love this brush- and lightening fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The sigma tapered face brush is really dense, amazingly soft, and great quality.</li>
            <li>Finally got the complete kabuki set,, this brush is excellent for applying concealer on the go or even contour your face with cream product.</li>
            <li>Beautiful addition to my other sigma brushes.</li>
            <li>Wonderful for blending concealer and getting into hard to reach places in your face.</li>
            <li>Thanks :)</li>
            <li>Since those types of foundations are more liquidy and spread easier, this brush works wonders and really gives my face that &amp;#34;air-brushed&amp;#34; look.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this brush for over a year to apply my full face foundation</li>
            <li>Absolute must have and will buy many times again.</li>
            <li>I really love this brush and since it&#x27;s so dense the brush can really spread the product quickly</li>
            <li>Another Sigma brush that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to live without!  </li>
            <li>The tapered shape of this brush is awesome for getting into curves, such as inner corner of eye.</li>
            <li>Sigma Tapered Kabuki - F86]]&lt;br /&gt;The perfect brush for not only an all over foundation (liquid or powder) application, but for the smaller, hard-to-reach areas of the face too, i.e. around the nose, under the eye.</li>
            <li>shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>LOVE this brush, I won&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li>definitely become one of my favorite brushes to use!</li>
            <li>I have quite a few sigma brushes because I trust their quality and the bristles still look great over time.</li>
            <li>it does really makes a huge difference on your make up</li>
            <li>I have real sigma brushes and the difference is incomparable, the brush purchased here lost hairs the moment I washed it and each time I use it.</li>
            <li>I love the bristles, they are soft and pick up my makeup well.</li>
            <li>I only use it for contouring and it honestly gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Sigma brushes are well worth the $</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I have many MAC brushes but being a budget conscious girl, I decided to try Sigma.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>It is simple to clean, but for the most part doesn&#x27;t need to be cleaned as often as some brushes because it works so well.</li>
            <li>, however I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quite as nice as the flat kabuki brush.  </li>
            <li>it applies just the right amount of product and</li>
            <li>It set in just right and didn&#x27;t slip it around my face.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s definitely  smaller, but I use it for highlighting my cheekbones, cupids bow, and down the bridge of my nose &amp; it does the job perfectly!</li>
            <li>Also is high quality not crap from china- made in U.S.A.</li>
            <li>This brush is ten times better than applying concealer with fingers, it blends quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li>Super great for under eye concealer, it does absorb a lot of product which sucks</li>
            <li>Very soft, doesn&#x27;t shed, shipping was fast. :)</li>
            <li>I normally would use my fingers to apply concealer because the warmth from my hands helped smooth the product in as I patted it on; however, in watching YouTube videos I heard a lot about the F86 brush and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been happy with my small brush for applying concealer</li>
            <li>White tip brush fibers do tend to stain a little with color, so cleaning right after use is probably your best bet.</li>
            <li>Picks up a good amount of powder and lays it down well.</li>
            <li>I much prefer the Sephora Pro Airbrush Concealer Brush followed by the Real Techniques Setting Brush to set my concealer lightly with powder.</li>
            <li>Has to be washed pretty often between uses though.</li>
            <li>the whole kabuki line !</li>
            <li>I still love this brush and would repurchase again as a gift or for myself if I lost my current one.</li>
            <li>I researched this brush and knew exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>first experience with this type of brush [vs the &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34</li>
            <li>i enjoy doing my makeup with these professional brushes.</li>
            <li>A nice sized brush that is neither too big nor too long and is easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>but I use tinted moisturizer and found it better then using my fingers or a flat brush.</li>
            <li>, the brush is nice quality and doesn&#x27;t shed like other brushes that are animal hair even tho</li>
            <li>I also purchased the F80 flat top kabuki and the bristles are coming out.</li>
            <li>Finally got my brushes today and I am so excited to use them tomorrow!  </li>
            <li>I normally use to apply bb or cc cream as well as under eye concealer!!</li>
            <li>The little red bag is really cute and the protection of the bristles was a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>But other than that tiny lil flaw, it&#x27;s a great brush.</li>
            <li>After trying many other brushes without success I decided to give it a try and WAO ... really changed the way my concealer looks</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t shed and its super soft but sturdy.</li>
            <li>It has been very durable.  </li>
            <li>I was very interested in purchasing this brush, however, other brushes I already own do the same job, so I had to return it since I didn&#x27;t really need it.</li>
            <li>I would really recommend either the Sigma or the BCC one.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush to anyone who puts on make-up!</li>
            <li>I was very surprise</li>
            <li>I did buy this specifically for those type of &amp;#34;foundations&amp;#34; and found that this brush works very well at spreading and buffing.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely loveeeeeeeeeeee this brush...</li>
            <li>I use it for undereye concealer and it blends really well into my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>The Sigma F86 solves that problem with its  &amp;#34;tapered &amp; pointed&amp;#34; end, providing smooth even coverage of foundation on the eyelids, inner and outer corners of the eye as well as under the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>bristles are very soft&lt;</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li>Picks up any excess concealer if you apply too much to prevent creasing under the eye.</li>
            <li>priced at less than half of the &amp;#34;other well known brand&amp;#34; it is a very good buy</li>
            <li>I have purchased many other make-up brushes from Sigma and all have exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>It is one of my favorites would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>This brush is soft, carries product well and applies well!!</li>
            <li>The brush is soft bristle but still firm so very easy to work with.</li>
            <li>In my experience, {this is my 2nd Sigma brush, my 1st one being several years old and still going strong}, Sigma brushes hold up very well to cleaning</li>
            <li>High quality brush, so soft.</li>
            <li>Love this brush... use it everyday!</li>
            <li>Blends like no other!!!</li>
            <li>I already own this brush, but it&#x27;s so densely packed with bristles that it takes a long time to dry after cleaning it, so I had to buy a back up</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Shed a bit bit less than the MAC ones I own and far more expensive.</li>
            <li>I have the facial tappered brush from MAC that though great was soooooo expensive.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this brush and keep in mind that these brushes retain water so when you go to wash it do it at night so it&#x27;ll be ready for morning or next day use.</li>
            <li>so the product doesn&#x27;t get all soaked into natural bristles</li>
            <li>So soft and well made.</li>
            <li>Soft and blends makeup</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and non-irritating to the sensitive areas of my face (i.e., under my eyes).  </li>
            <li>: order directly from sigma.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li>This set was recommended to me by a professional make-up artist in the DC area.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dense, and blends out perfectly, no harsh lines.  </li>
            <li>and so far I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>The picture made it look so much bigger, haha.</li>
            <li>Have purchased several and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would have to wet the brush first before i put concealer on.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it to to apply contour in cheek bones and then I blend out with a flat brush or face brush...</li>
            <li>Washed several times and comes out always looking brand new.</li>
            <li>I have only had very minimum shedding but only during washing never during makeup application.</li>
            <li>Such a soft brush!</li>
            <li>It seems large for the under eye area, but the tapered aspect really gets in the small space.</li>
            <li>; brushes generally sold for foundation application] was with a Mac 130 &amp;#34;Flat Topped&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This was not the actual product that sigma offers.</li>
            <li>A makeup stylist recommended similar brushes for less on instagram, said you can purchase them here with better quality and less money.</li>
            <li>It does not loose its hair.  </li>
            <li>Other than real techniques brush line..</li>
            <li>mainly use this brush to pat down my concealer under my eyes, and on blemishes as well.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I tried this brush also with some of my more full coverage foundations and found it did not work as well for me as the F80.  </li>
            <li> My brushes came really fast and the packaging was really nice.</li>
            <li> It picks up all the extra concealer around my eyes and does a great job with blending.</li>
            <li> I need to buy a few more for myself and my makeup freelance kit!!!! .</li>
            <li> Brush quality is fantastic.</li>
            <li> for under my eyes and hour glass ambient light powder.  </li>
            <li> If you want a smooth, even &amp;#34;air brushed&amp;#34; look to your foundation like you see on magazine covers, then this type of brush is how you achieve it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i really enjoy all my sigma brushes, i have been buying them for almost a year already</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved the flat top kabuki for liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li> Definitely will be purchasing more !!</li>
            <li> The brush is large and very easy to work with.  </li>
            <li> This brush is my new favorite foundation brush!</li>
            <li> Love this brush- and lightening fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The sigma tapered face brush is really dense, amazingly soft, and great quality.</li>
            <li> Finally got the complete kabuki set,, this brush is excellent for applying concealer on the go or even contour your face with cream product.</li>
            <li> Beautiful addition to my other sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for blending concealer and getting into hard to reach places in your face.</li>
            <li> Thanks :)</li>
            <li> Since those types of foundations are more liquidy and spread easier, this brush works wonders and really gives my face that &amp;#34;air-brushed&amp;#34; look.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for over a year to apply my full face foundation</li>
            <li> Absolute must have and will buy many times again.</li>
            <li> I really love this brush and since it&#x27;s so dense the brush can really spread the product quickly</li>
            <li> Another Sigma brush that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to live without!  </li>
            <li> The tapered shape of this brush is awesome for getting into curves, such as inner corner of eye.</li>
            <li> Sigma Tapered Kabuki - F86]]&lt;br /&gt;The perfect brush for not only an all over foundation (liquid or powder) application, but for the smaller, hard-to-reach areas of the face too, i.e. around the nose, under the eye.</li>
            <li> shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> LOVE this brush, I won&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> definitely become one of my favorite brushes to use!</li>
            <li> I have quite a few sigma brushes because I trust their quality and the bristles still look great over time.</li>
            <li> it does really makes a huge difference on your make up</li>
            <li> I have real sigma brushes and the difference is incomparable, the brush purchased here lost hairs the moment I washed it and each time I use it.</li>
            <li> I love the bristles, they are soft and pick up my makeup well.</li>
            <li> I only use it for contouring and it honestly gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Sigma brushes are well worth the $</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have many MAC brushes but being a budget conscious girl, I decided to try Sigma.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is simple to clean, but for the most part doesn&#x27;t need to be cleaned as often as some brushes because it works so well.</li>
            <li> , however I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quite as nice as the flat kabuki brush.  </li>
            <li> it applies just the right amount of product and</li>
            <li> It set in just right and didn&#x27;t slip it around my face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely  smaller, but I use it for highlighting my cheekbones, cupids bow, and down the bridge of my nose &amp; it does the job perfectly!</li>
            <li> Also is high quality not crap from china- made in U.S.A.</li>
            <li> This brush is ten times better than applying concealer with fingers, it blends quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li> Super great for under eye concealer, it does absorb a lot of product which sucks</li>
            <li> Very soft, doesn&#x27;t shed, shipping was fast. :)</li>
            <li> I normally would use my fingers to apply concealer because the warmth from my hands helped smooth the product in as I patted it on; however, in watching YouTube videos I heard a lot about the F86 brush and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been happy with my small brush for applying concealer</li>
            <li> White tip brush fibers do tend to stain a little with color, so cleaning right after use is probably your best bet.</li>
            <li> Picks up a good amount of powder and lays it down well.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the Sephora Pro Airbrush Concealer Brush followed by the Real Techniques Setting Brush to set my concealer lightly with powder.</li>
            <li> Has to be washed pretty often between uses though.</li>
            <li> the whole kabuki line !</li>
            <li> I still love this brush and would repurchase again as a gift or for myself if I lost my current one.</li>
            <li> I researched this brush and knew exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> first experience with this type of brush [vs the &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34</li>
            <li> i enjoy doing my makeup with these professional brushes.</li>
            <li> A nice sized brush that is neither too big nor too long and is easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> but I use tinted moisturizer and found it better then using my fingers or a flat brush.</li>
            <li> , the brush is nice quality and doesn&#x27;t shed like other brushes that are animal hair even tho</li>
            <li> I also purchased the F80 flat top kabuki and the bristles are coming out.</li>
            <li> Finally got my brushes today and I am so excited to use them tomorrow!  </li>
            <li> I normally use to apply bb or cc cream as well as under eye concealer!!</li>
            <li> The little red bag is really cute and the protection of the bristles was a nice touch.  </li>
            <li> But other than that tiny lil flaw, it&#x27;s a great brush.</li>
            <li> After trying many other brushes without success I decided to give it a try and WAO ... really changed the way my concealer looks</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t shed and its super soft but sturdy.</li>
            <li> It has been very durable.  </li>
            <li> I was very interested in purchasing this brush, however, other brushes I already own do the same job, so I had to return it since I didn&#x27;t really need it.</li>
            <li> I would really recommend either the Sigma or the BCC one.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush to anyone who puts on make-up!</li>
            <li> I was very surprise</li>
            <li> I did buy this specifically for those type of &amp;#34;foundations&amp;#34; and found that this brush works very well at spreading and buffing.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely loveeeeeeeeeeee this brush...</li>
            <li> I use it for undereye concealer and it blends really well into my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> The Sigma F86 solves that problem with its  &amp;#34;tapered &amp; pointed&amp;#34; end, providing smooth even coverage of foundation on the eyelids, inner and outer corners of the eye as well as under the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> bristles are very soft&lt;</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> Picks up any excess concealer if you apply too much to prevent creasing under the eye.</li>
            <li> priced at less than half of the &amp;#34;other well known brand&amp;#34; it is a very good buy</li>
            <li> I have purchased many other make-up brushes from Sigma and all have exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> It is one of my favorites would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> This brush is soft, carries product well and applies well!!</li>
            <li> The brush is soft bristle but still firm so very easy to work with.</li>
            <li> In my experience, {this is my 2nd Sigma brush, my 1st one being several years old and still going strong}, Sigma brushes hold up very well to cleaning</li>
            <li> High quality brush, so soft.</li>
            <li> Love this brush... use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Blends like no other!!!</li>
            <li> I already own this brush, but it&#x27;s so densely packed with bristles that it takes a long time to dry after cleaning it, so I had to buy a back up</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Shed a bit bit less than the MAC ones I own and far more expensive.</li>
            <li> I have the facial tappered brush from MAC that though great was soooooo expensive.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this brush and keep in mind that these brushes retain water so when you go to wash it do it at night so it&#x27;ll be ready for morning or next day use.</li>
            <li> so the product doesn&#x27;t get all soaked into natural bristles</li>
            <li> So soft and well made.</li>
            <li> Soft and blends makeup</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and non-irritating to the sensitive areas of my face (i.e., under my eyes).  </li>
            <li> : order directly from sigma.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li> This set was recommended to me by a professional make-up artist in the DC area.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dense, and blends out perfectly, no harsh lines.  </li>
            <li> and so far I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> The picture made it look so much bigger, haha.</li>
            <li> Have purchased several and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would have to wet the brush first before i put concealer on.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it to to apply contour in cheek bones and then I blend out with a flat brush or face brush...</li>
            <li> Washed several times and comes out always looking brand new.</li>
            <li> I have only had very minimum shedding but only during washing never during makeup application.</li>
            <li> Such a soft brush!</li>
            <li> It seems large for the under eye area, but the tapered aspect really gets in the small space.</li>
            <li> ; brushes generally sold for foundation application] was with a Mac 130 &amp;#34;Flat Topped&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This was not the actual product that sigma offers.</li>
            <li> A makeup stylist recommended similar brushes for less on instagram, said you can purchase them here with better quality and less money.</li>
            <li> It does not loose its hair.  </li>
            <li> Other than real techniques brush line..</li>
            <li> mainly use this brush to pat down my concealer under my eyes, and on blemishes as well.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> It does take forever to dry after washing but not a big deal to me.</li>
            <li> I have been using make up for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using brushes for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The reason the brushes are smaller than expected is that the picture is of an F86 but the seller shipped some (hopefully not all) P86 brushes.</li>
            <li> Not real sigma, this will be the final time I purchase these brushes on Amazon.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little more difficult to apply makeup</li>
            <li> A little more expensive than some</li>
            <li> IF THE BRUSH IS DRY</li>
            <li> I was rather skeptical about the true utility of this brush for concealer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is one foundation brush I will not live without!</li>
            <li> The softness of the brush hairs gives a silky feel but they&#x27;re tightly packed enough to achieve maximum results.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe it took me soooo long to purchase!!!</li>
            <li> so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product is absolutely necessary to use to put on concealer under the eye when you can use your fingers.</li>
            <li> (Takes a little longer to dry than other brushes, but ok)&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li> I got your synthetic kabuki version today and am not sure how I&#x27;ve lived without it this long.</li>
            <li> I recommend this as a much less pricey alternative from Armani and Chanel..</li>
            <li> sturdy ,soft and thick bristles! !</li>
            <li> Love and was not at all disappointed!</li>
            <li> , not sure why.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t let you go overboard with your concealer, as it helps pick up excess.</li>
            <li> well in all the hard to get areas.  </li>
            <li> so u won&#x27;t pull or beat up delicate face areas..</li>
            <li> and i have nothing negative to say.</li>
            <li> Less expensive  </li>
            <li> I received this brush &amp; had no ideal what to use it for !</li>
            <li> However, they prove to be difficult when trying to blend foundation around the eyes and nose.</li>
            <li> seriously the softest brush ever!!!</li>
            <li> so scratchy now :(</li>
            <li> I wish I got the F86. :(</li>
            <li> Sadly disappointed</li>
            <li> I am seriously OBSESSED with sigma brushes!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This brush is amazing!! I use it for blending out concealer under my eyes!</li>
            <li> The sigma tapered face brush is really dense, amazingly soft, and great quality. it applies just the right amount of product and the tapered end helps me get all around my face! This is a great product and i would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Sigma, I love you. I have the facial tappered brush from MAC that though great was soooooo expensive. I got your synthetic kabuki version today and am not sure how I&#x27;ve lived without it this long. If you want light but precise foundation application, you NEED this brush!  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll use it on powder but I use tinted moisturizer and found it better then using my fingers or a flat brush. Also, I used the tip to conceal, awesome!</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it makes it easy to apply concealer around the eye and nose area.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because I felt like it soaked up a lot of product however, the brush is nice quality and doesn&#x27;t shed like other brushes that are animal hair even tho I like those too. I would recommend this brush and keep in mind that these brushes retain water so when you go to wash it do it at night so it&#x27;ll be ready for morning or next day use.</li>
            <li> amazing brush great for conturing</li>
            <li> This works great for undereye concealer. It is one of my favorites would highly recommend this. I love it much better than the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Oh so sawft and nice. Itz such a beyootiful brush. I will stick with this brand for all my brushes from now on.</li>
            <li> I use this brush for highlighting...works perfect</li>
            <li> I love this brush and am so happy that I got it. I love the bristles, they are soft and pick up my makeup well. It is simple to clean, but for the most part doesn&#x27;t need to be cleaned as often as some brushes because it works so well.</li>
            <li> Sigma is a name you can count on quality brushes at a affordable price. Less expensive  that SIgma web sight.</li>
            <li> Nice brush that I bought for using for concealer around my eyes.  It has been very durable.  Only downside is that I think it&#x27;s a tad too big. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great brush.</li>
            <li> I was very interested in purchasing this brush, however, other brushes I already own do the same job, so I had to return it since I didn&#x27;t really need it. It was a nice brush though.</li>
            <li> Love the shape. Love the bristles. My MAC liquid foundation glides on my face.  I wish the handle was matte instead of a gloss finish though.  But other than that tiny lil flaw, it&#x27;s a great brush.</li>
            <li> Finally got my brushes today and I am so excited to use them tomorrow!  My brushes came really fast and the packaging was really nice. The little red bag is really cute and the protection of the bristles was a nice touch.  Thanks :)</li>
            <li> I have been using make up for a long time.  I&#x27;ve been using brushes for a long time.  I&#x27;ve never used a brush for foundation though, not sure why.  This is the best brush I have now.  It&#x27;s synthetic so the product doesn&#x27;t get all soaked into natural bristles, it&#x27;s soft beyond words and it cleans wonderfully.  The tapered top makes it easy to apply foundation under eyes and around nose.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this brush and wonder why I haven&#x27;t been using a brush to apply foundation all along.</li>
            <li> Such a soft brush! I love Sigma and all of their products! I will be purchasing more brushes! Amazing quality!!</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  I use it to apply my foundation and it gives a flawless finish.  It especially performs well around the inner corner of your eyes and around the nose area.  I own many higher end brushes but this one outperforms the others.</li>
            <li> Excellent for either concealer or foundation, doesn&#x27;t waiste a lot of product and when cleaning makeup runs really fast. Great investment!</li>
            <li> This is the Most awesome brush I have used to set my under eye concealer! Look at Jaclyn hill &#x27;s make up tutorials on YouTube and she explains how to use a lot of sigma brushes</li>
            <li> I use this brush to put on my concealer and it was awesome.  It set in just right and didn&#x27;t slip it around my face.  It is very similar to the blank canvas cosmetics one that I have.  Only difference is that the Sigma one is denser and bigger but same results. I just love this kabuki style brushes!! I would really recommend either the Sigma or the BCC one. Both give you amazing results and good price for the quality.</li>
            <li> Best brush for undereye concealer. Gives a smooth finish under the eye also great for highlighting. Has to be washed pretty often between uses though.</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing a youtube makeup artist rave about this brush. I am happy I got it because I have come to using it every day. It is great for concealer application under the eyes and I also like to use it for powder application around the nose. I have quite a few sigma brushes because I trust their quality and the bristles still look great over time.</li>
            <li> The tapered shape of this brush is awesome for getting into curves, such as inner corner of eye. So soft and well made.</li>
            <li> Awesome for under eye concealer! Blends like no other!!! High quality brush, so soft. I have experience with many brands.</li>
            <li> seriously the softest brush ever!!! I love it. use as concealer brush and it works great! great buy for sure</li>
            <li> This is my favorite makeup brush.  I use this for concealer under my eyes.  I have also used it for setting powder under my eyes.  It would be good for a lot of things.  I might need to buy more of these.</li>
            <li> Regardless what the use of this brush is for, let me invite you to use it to blend your under eye concealer and or brightening. It has the perfect shape and blends the product to your skin rather than moving it from side to side.</li>
            <li> Ok so I do love this brush. It picks up all the extra concealer around my eyes and does a great job with blending. It does take forever to dry after washing but not a big deal to me.</li>
            <li> Love this brush!  Soft and blends makeup well in all the hard to get areas.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS BRUSH!!  It is the absolute BEST for blending in concealer under the eye and on the eyelid!  Using it in a &amp;#34;dabbing&amp;#34; motion will give you a flawless look in those areas!  Another Sigma brush that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to live without!  Love love love Sigma brushes!</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Singlehandedly has saved my 40 something under eye concealer application problem.  Use this instead of my fingers and my concealer does not crease. Its a miracle! Love, love this brush. I am so thankful to the Youtube makeup tutorial that introduced me to it. Get it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This brush maker is my daughter&#x27;s favorite brand! I&#x27;m sure she will be thrilled to see this in her stocking ;)</li>
            <li> I have purchased many other make-up brushes from Sigma and all have exceeded my expectations.  This brush is no exception.  This makes getting foundation, concealer, etc. under eyes and around my nose so easy.  The brush is large and very easy to work with.  The bristles are soft and non-irritating to the sensitive areas of my face (i.e., under my eyes).  I highly recommend this brush to anyone who puts on make-up!</li>
            <li> its so perrrfect! I only use it for contouring and it honestly gets the job done. it doesn&#x27;t shed and its super soft but sturdy.</li>
            <li> This was not the actual product that sigma offers. The brush itself looks similar but the quality of it doesn&#x27;t meet it&#x27;s expectations. I also purchased the F80 flat top kabuki and the bristles are coming out. Note to self: order directly from sigma. The costs aren&#x27;t that different and you get a much better product.</li>
            <li> I was very surprise how often I reach out to this brush, it is a wonderful concealer brush that I can&#x27;t do my makeup without.  I used to use my fingers to apply the concealer, not anymore though.  This brush is ten times better than applying concealer with fingers, it blends quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li> Love this brush for concealer!!!!!!!!  I need to buy a few more for myself and my makeup freelance kit!!!! .</li>
            <li> Perfect for concealer , pretty soft !&lt;br /&gt;Would be also good to apply fondation around the nose ...&lt;br /&gt;Want the whole kabuki line !</li>
            <li> Great brush for blending in concealer around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I am using my husbands account. What else can I say. I love these brushes. My makeup goes on a lot smoother and more effortless since I started buying sigma brushes. I am in the process of replacing all my brushes to sigma brushes. I already have several.  I&#x27;d like to have them all!!! There a bit pricy but worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, amazing quality, LOVE this brush!</li>
            <li> Used for application of tinted moisturizers and BB Creams, it is amazing.  I did buy this specifically for those type of &amp;#34;foundations&amp;#34; and found that this brush works very well at spreading and buffing.  Since those types of foundations are more liquidy and spread easier, this brush works wonders and really gives my face that &amp;#34;air-brushed&amp;#34; look.  I tried this brush also with some of my more full coverage foundations and found it did not work as well for me as the F80.  I still love this brush and would repurchase again as a gift or for myself if I lost my current one.</li>
            <li> LOVE this brush, I won&#x27;t live without it no. Perfect for blending out concealer underneath the eyes. Very soft, doesn&#x27;t shed, shipping was fast. :)</li>
            <li> I normally would use my fingers to apply concealer because the warmth from my hands helped smooth the product in as I patted it on; however, in watching YouTube videos I heard a lot about the F86 brush and decided to try it.  I&#x27;m a believer.  I think it even works better than my beauty blender to achieve the airbrushed look.  Now if I can just find the holy grail concealer....</li>
            <li> Wonderful for blending concealer and getting into hard to reach places in your face. It doesn&#x27;t let you go overboard with your concealer, as it helps pick up excess.</li>
            <li> Quality brush. Will repurchase again!</li>
            <li> Awesome brush! I use this brush for under eye concealer and it is magic! Everybody needs this in their makeup set</li>
            <li> Other than real techniques brush line..I absolutely loveeeeeeeeeeee this brush...it is perfect to get in the hollows of the cheek bones ore use around eye area..it&#x27;s so soft so u won&#x27;t pull or beat up delicate face areas..&lt;br /&gt;Love love this brusH..I mainly use it to to apply contour in cheek bones and then I blend out with a flat brush or face brush...</li>
            <li> Love!! Perfect for applying under eye concealer.</li>
            <li> I already own this brush, but it&#x27;s so densely packed with bristles that it takes a long time to dry after cleaning it, so I had to buy a back up since I can&#x27;t stand to go without using it for one day!  This brush is extremely soft and it&#x27;s excellent for applying concealer under the eyes.  I use it every time I apply makeup.  I&#x27;ve had my current brush for over a year and it&#x27;s still in excellent shape after almost daily use.  I would recommend this brush to anyone who applies undereye concealer!</li>
            <li> Great for under eye area!</li>
            <li> Excellent brush for blending out undereye concealer</li>
            <li> Love this brush. Beautiful addition to my other sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> This brand is the best I have found for the price.  They continue to be my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; brushes.  Great quality.</li>
            <li> This brush is AMAZING and I can&#x27;t believe it took me soooo long to purchase!!! I have been loving it for applying concealer under my eyes!! I am seriously OBSESSED with sigma brushes!!! Definitely a must have for everyone!!!</li>
            <li> I received this brush &amp; had no ideal what to use it for ! After all the helpful reviews I&#x27;ll be using it for cream contouring \\&quot;after Mac changed the style of their brushes...they&#x27;re so scratchy now :( I&#x27;m converting from a Mac girl to a Sigma girl !!!!!</li>
            <li> Fantastic experience! Brush is perfect; shipping was flawless.</li>
            <li> Great brush.  I use it for my concealer under my eyes, and it gives a flawless finish.  It&#x27;s great quality, all Sigma brushes are. I love this brush, and it is super easy to clean at the end of the week!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for blending concealer under the eyes, or foundation all over the face. Brush quality is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I researched this brush and knew exactly what I wanted.  This is exactly what I wanted, good seller, quick receipt.  Couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain.  I use this as a pressed foundation applicator.  It&#x27;s spreads evenly.  It does not loose its hair.  I recommend this as a much less pricey alternative from Armani and Chanel..</li>
            <li> This is a great brush! I use it for undereye concealer and it blends really well into my liquid foundation. The brush is soft bristle but still firm so very easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Finally got the complete kabuki set,, this brush is excellent for applying concealer on the go or even contour your face with cream product.</li>
            <li> ØªØ¬Ø±Ø¨Ø© Ø´Ø±Ø§Ø¡ Ø±Ø§Ø¦Ø¹Ø© ÙˆØ³Ø¹Ø±Ù‡ ÙƒØ§Ù† Ø¬Ù…ÙŠÙ„&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying experience a great price was beautiful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing :) love it â™¡ so glad I bought it</li>
            <li> Great brushes ! Soft,blendable,easy to work with :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush after watching a beauty vlog that recommended using it for under-eye concealer. It is perfect! It seems large for the under eye area, but the tapered aspect really gets in the small space. It is also dense and provides great coverage. It works great around my nose as well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved the flat top kabuki for liquid foundation.  I thought this tapered version would be good for using foundation/concealer under my eyes where I don&#x27;t need a precise-placement concealer brush.  It&#x27;s not that great.  I can get the same effect with my paintbrush version of a foundation brush.  For doing my under eyes I much prefer the Sephora Pro Airbrush Concealer Brush followed by the Real Techniques Setting Brush to set my concealer lightly with powder.</li>
            <li> I use it for my under eye concealer and it works flawlessly! Along with a great brush you get great service using this shop! Definitely will be purchasing more !!</li>
            <li> for under my eyes and hour glass ambient light powder.  Sigma brushes are well worth the $ and I will continue to add to my collection.</li>
            <li> This set was recommended to me by a professional make-up artist in the DC area.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.  Description of contents and thier use included.</li>
            <li> Must have blending brush</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B005V1A05S Sigma Tapered Kabuki - F86]]&lt;br /&gt;The perfect brush for not only an all over foundation (liquid or powder) application, but for the smaller, hard-to-reach areas of the face too, i.e. around the nose, under the eye. Also great for applying concealer and contouring. The softness of the brush hairs gives a silky feel but they&#x27;re tightly packed enough to achieve maximum results. Wonderful product! A+</li>
            <li> Love this brush- and lightening fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Loved it. Use it for foundation and works great. Also use it for powder and again it works great. Yayy</li>
            <li> Great brush. sturdy ,soft and thick bristles! ! I would definitely recommend this brush.! Did I mention the brush was reasonable lol!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product is absolutely necessary to use to put on concealer under the eye when you can use your fingers.</li>
            <li> The reason the brushes are smaller than expected is that the picture is of an F86 but the seller shipped some (hopefully not all) P86 brushes. The P86 is a precision kabuki brush, not a foundation brush. I wish I got the F86. :( I&#x27;ve been happy with my small brush for applying concealer, it&#x27;s just not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without this brush, love for my concealer, works like a gemâ™¡â™¡â™¡â™¡</li>
            <li> Very good brush, ecologic and soft bristles. Excelent size to bring with you every where inside your purse. It&#x27;s also very good for professional use.</li>
            <li> This brush is definitely of better quality than the MAC brushes I own. Shed a bit bit less than the MAC ones I own and far more expensive. The problem is the ferrel fell off the handle. A makeup stylist recommended similar brushes for less on instagram, said you can purchase them here with better quality and less money. I love my Bellus F86 brush. I bought all the Bellus brushes to replace my MAC and this Sigma after this shedding experience and love them.</li>
            <li> I use this brush for applying foundation as well as blending under eye concealer. Great addition to my brushes. Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really liked the brush, its quality is indescribable!!! Gotta looove SIGMA brushes!! It is more than good, &#x27;ve never try a brush like that it does really makes a huge difference on your make up</li>
            <li> This is a xmas gift. I have no idea if it works.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! I use it to blend concealer and cream highlighter under my eyes.  It&#x27;s dense, and blends out perfectly, no harsh lines.  I haven&#x27;t had any shedding, and I&#x27;ve cleaned it several times.  Check Sigma&#x27;s website for authorized retailers before you buy.  I got a dupe once (on the E40) because I didn&#x27;t check.</li>
            <li> I like this brush, however I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quite as nice as the flat kabuki brush.  it&#x27;s a little more difficult to apply makeup (I&#x27;ve been using it for under eye concealer).</li>
            <li> awesome. awesome. awesome. I love sigma brushes. great quality. shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> This Sigma brush is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;I mainly use this brush to pat down my concealer under my eyes, and on blemishes as well.&lt;br /&gt;It blends out the concealer like a dream &amp; makes it look so flawless.&lt;br /&gt;It washes well too. (Takes a little longer to dry than other brushes, but ok)&lt;br /&gt;Has definitely become one of my favorite brushes to use!</li>
            <li> If you want a smooth, even &amp;#34;air brushed&amp;#34; look to your foundation like you see on magazine covers, then this type of brush is how you achieve it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first experience with this type of brush [vs the &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; brushes generally sold for foundation application] was with a Mac 130 &amp;#34;Flat Topped&amp;#34;. Flat topped brushes are great for evenly blending foundation on the forehead, cheeks, sides and chin area and give you a flawless appearance. However, they prove to be difficult when trying to blend foundation around the eyes and nose. The Sigma F86 solves that problem with its  &amp;#34;tapered &amp; pointed&amp;#34; end, providing smooth even coverage of foundation on the eyelids, inner and outer corners of the eye as well as under the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1 A nice sized brush that is neither too big nor too long and is easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;2. bristles are very soft&lt;br /&gt;3. blends foundation evenly with no streaks [which can be a problem with the standard &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; foundation brushes]&lt;br /&gt;4. well made&lt;br /&gt;5. priced at less than half of the &amp;#34;other well known brand&amp;#34; it is a very good buy&lt;br /&gt;6. In my experience, {this is my 2nd Sigma brush, my 1st one being several years old and still going strong}, Sigma brushes hold up very well to cleaning [I wash mine every day with Ivory soap].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one foundation brush I will not live without!</li>
            <li> Love this brush for under the eye make up, specifically concealer under the eyes. It fits perfectly for that area.</li>
            <li> This is another fantastic Sigma brush! I use this to blend in my concealer under my eyes and around my nose. Perfect and airbrushed finish! Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I was rather skeptical about the true utility of this brush for concealer. After trying many other brushes without success I decided to give it a try and WAO ... really changed the way my concealer looks</li>
            <li> My favorite liquid foundation brush! I have been using this brush for over a year to apply my full face foundation and I love it. I have only had very minimum shedding but only during washing never during makeup application. I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite brushes! I normally use to apply bb or cc cream as well as under eye concealer!!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product by Sigma Beaty. Excellent quality! I was travelling in US and it just arrived on time at my friends house.</li>
            <li> Loveeee this brush! Sigma brushes are just such great quality! Love and was not at all disappointed! Great seller as well! Perfect for applying my concealer</li>
            <li> Have used many make up brushes throughout the years - these are the best I&#x27;ve ever found. Have purchased several and highly recommend. A little more expensive than some but you get what you pay for. I use for both powder and liquid foundations and they are excellent for both.</li>
            <li> I thought the brush was going to blend in my concealer but,nobody told me.I would have to wet the brush first before i put concealer on.IF THE BRUSH IS DRY IT WILL NOT BLEND IN THE CONCEALER.I used the brush damp with my Mary Kay concealer.It does blend beautifully.</li>
            <li> love the service and product&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s changed my life!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing brush. Thank you Sigma and Amazon. Lori</li>
            <li> Not real sigma, this will be the final time I purchase these brushes on Amazon. I have real sigma brushes and the difference is incomparable, the brush purchased here lost hairs the moment I washed it and each time I use it. Sadly disappointed</li>
            <li> This brush is beyond words. I love how it applies concealer and foundation and blends so well. It makes all blending and concealer application effortless and makes my makeup look flawless. I would recommend this brush to anyone I can talk to about it.  The brush itself it soft and the shape is great for the eye area and doesn&#x27;t make the concealer crease more when you apply it.</li>
            <li> Love this brush.  Very soft and perfect for putting makeup right where you want it.  I use it to apply highlighter to smaller areas.  Don&#x27;t want to end up looking like the Tin Man from the Wizard of Oz and so far I don&#x27;t.  White tip brush fibers do tend to stain a little with color, so cleaning right after use is probably your best bet.</li>
            <li> Love blending out my concealer/liquid makeup with this brush! Perfect for getting into all the nooks under eye/side of the nose. Washes well, no shedding. One of my fave brushes</li>
            <li> i really enjoy all my sigma brushes, i have been buying them for almost a year already and i have nothing negative to say. i enjoy doing my makeup with these professional brushes.</li>
            <li> Amazing coverage!! This brush is soft, carries product well and applies well!! I would absolutely recommend this brush it works great!! Also is high quality not crap from china- made in U.S.A.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Best brush I&#x27;ve used to blend in my undereye concealer to look flawless! Picks up any excess concealer if you apply too much to prevent creasing under the eye. Hairs are soft and hold up great during washes. Absolute must have and will buy many times again.</li>
            <li> I love the tapered kabuki brush!!</li>
            <li> This brush is great for the under eye area. It easily blends out concealer and they never crease. I really love this brush and since it&#x27;s so dense the brush can really spread the product quickly so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Great brush for tapering and contouring. Good quality.</li>
            <li> Super great for under eye concealer, it does absorb a lot of product which sucks but at the same time it doesn&#x27;t make you look cakey</li>
            <li> Love this brush... use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Love this brush! I use it for my under eye concealer! Bristle&#x27;s don&#x27;t fall out! Washes well! Sigma brushes are awesome!</li>
            <li> Absolutely my favorite Sigma face brush - I use this for setting my under eye area with powder (sometimes for blending out concealer). It is a great brush, no missing or out of place bristles. Washed several times and comes out always looking brand new. Love it!</li>
            <li> Bristles are well packed. Picks up a good amount of powder and lays it down well. No bristle shedding during use or after washing.</li>
            <li> Amazing Blends out my conclearer perfectly.</li>
            <li> Sigma brushes are quickly becoming a favorite of mine. I have many MAC brushes but being a budget conscious girl, I decided to try Sigma. I am so happy that I did. The quality of the brushes are amazing. The Tapered Kabuki F86 is so great for applying foundation around the nose and under the eye. This brush is my new favorite foundation brush!</li>
            <li> The picture made it look so much bigger, haha. When I got it I was kind of like...oh.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely  smaller, but I use it for highlighting my cheekbones, cupids bow, and down the bridge of my nose &amp; it does the job perfectly!</li>
            <li> Love this brush. Gets into the angles and holds up well. Bought a second one for my daughter.  Worth the money.</li>
