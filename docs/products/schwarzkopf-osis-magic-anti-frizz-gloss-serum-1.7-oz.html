            <li>Even fine hair like mine, just a dab will do ya.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super!</li>
            <li>Light and non-greasy; controls frizz.</li>

            <li>It smoothed the wiry hair up on top and overall and it smelled good too.</li>
            <li>This product can go on damp hair, however it seems to primarily be for dry hair with fly always, which is what I will use it for.</li>

            <li>With the hair damp or dry it works great, makes the hair soooo soft, controls the volume and the frizz.</li>
            <li>This stuff is decent, but I found Long N Strong 2-in-1 Anti-frizz and Hair growth serum to be better.</li>
            <li>It works a lot better for me - it takes care of the frizz, adds a bit of shine and a bit of hold, just in a balanced manner, unlike the above product.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time trying this product.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time this morning</li>
            <li>fine, blond hair so most products are too heavy...</li>
            <li>Instant success!!</li>
            <li>Osis Magic leaves my hair soft and no heavy feeling at all.</li>
            <li>Use a very small amount rubbed between your palms and spread mainly all over your ends..using too much ( especially on fine hair will make your hair look greasy)</li>
            <li>It will never weigh down your hair, but if you apply too much you will get a kind of oily look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly certain that this Gloss Serum is not intended for detangling, but it works for me.  </li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way and it smooths and shines beautifully.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It really makes my hair shine and not look frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I really like the results from this product.</li>
            <li>It does feel kind of heavy on your hair and does cause a build up.  </li>
            <li>Not only does my hair have a great shine to it, making the colors pop, it also has a very natural messy, strandy look.  </li>
            <li>No matter how many times you use this, it never weighs down your hair.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it!  </li>
            <li>You only need to use 1 pump, so the bottle should last quite a while, therefor I find this to be a great value, however it not exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>But as they say less is more.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone with unruly curly hair -</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I had my hopes up high when I ordered this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way but it works best on my colored hair than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I use Osis Magic just about everyday..  </li>
            <li>it smoothens the frizziness and makes it look normal.</li>
            <li>and it is a good product, just not great.  </li>
            <li>I live in a humid place and my hair is wavy with a tendency to frizz.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that just a small amount of product does the trick.</li>
            <li>I use hot rollers on my hair and my curls last all day.  </li>
            <li>Will calm the &amp;#34;fly aways&amp;#34; without the greasy, heavy look of that most other products do.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, live in the south, and detest my hair being frizzy.</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair this may not be your product as you may find it too heavy.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>Holds hair&#x27;s body and encourages natural curl, without frizz or weight.</li>
            <li>I was really looking for big results after reading all the online reviews</li>
            <li>and I have tried nearly everything on it to get the tangles out after my shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a frequent buyer.</li>
            <li>and I like it so far.</li>
            <li>I love the texture and smell - just a small amount is needed - I&#x27;ll never switch brands!</li>
            <li>This product will tame flyaways and frizz, as well as texturize and light syling hold.</li>
            <li>It also lasts a long time because you don&#x27;t gotta use too much.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and when I found out I was going to Shanghai last summer which has notoriously humid summers that make the humidity of Florida seem normal, I was worried.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s coarse and tends to frizz easily, but this helps tame it and shine it.</li>
            <li>This serum is light, greaseless and puts life into any dull hair.</li>
            <li>I have course, thick colored(although grey underneath) which can get rather wiry and unruly on top, which was the reason I ordered this  product.</li>
            <li>No more frizz (even in high humidity,) defined curls, and soft silky hair.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a frequent buyer.</li>
            <li> and I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I love the texture and smell - just a small amount is needed - I&#x27;ll never switch brands!</li>

            <li> I live in Michigan where the winters are very dry and the summers are extremely humid.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy (unless I use too much) and it seems to tame my dry ends.</li>

            <li> The bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and this product helps make it shiny and controls the frizz.  </li>
            <li> A lot of anti-frizz products seem to only target younger customers and weigh my hair down.</li>

            <li> I have very curly, very thick hair which has a tendency to be frizzy if not meticulously maintained.</li>

            <li> And a little goes a long way.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the fragrance and it&#x27;s performance. Makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> This product works well. I only use a pea sized amount on my ends and it makes my damaged hair glossy. This tiny bottle will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the product I was looking for.  I have a medium length hair cut.  It&#x27;s died in low-lights and highlights.  I wanted the messy separated strand look, and to make it look natural.  This is that product!  Not only does my hair have a great shine to it, making the colors pop, it also has a very natural messy, strandy look.  Schwarzkopf has not let me down yet, whatever is on the bottle is what the product does!</li>
            <li> I have very curly, very thick hair which has a tendency to be frizzy if not meticulously maintained. I had tried just about every product under the sun when my stylist found this product line and tried it on my hair.  Instant success!! I have used this for about 5 years now and it is the ONLY thing I&#x27;ve found that will work.  No more frizz (even in high humidity,) defined curls, and soft silky hair.  If you have the type of hair I do then you&#x27;ll understand what a miracle that is. I started buying from Amazon because it&#x27;s about $4-6 cheaper here than in stores.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone with unruly curly hair - it works like a charm!</li>
            <li> This stuff is a MUST for me! I have naturally curly hair, live in the south, and detest my hair being frizzy. This product manages the frizz and keeps my hair looking tame and healthy!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I&#x27;ve been using it for years. And they made it more affordable. Very fast service! Great!</li>
            <li> Great for thick, curly hair -- it helps me get through the day after cleaning by taming fly away hairs and reshaping with just one pump</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this serum and I&#x27;ve tried many, many different kinds. I&#x27;ve tried salon brands and store brands and nothing comes close to comparing to this stuff. A little bit goes a long way and it smooths and shines beautifully. I have fine hair but it&#x27;s coarse and tends to frizz easily, but this helps tame it and shine it. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have spent alot of money on many different anti-fizz product and this work the best.  Not greasy and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I have every hair Anti-Frizz on the market, then I found this!!! People tell me I have the best hair IN THE WORLD all the time!! This is great stuff!</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do well with my curly hair,  I gave it to my daughter and she said she liked it.  So I gave it a 4 star because my daughter does not have curly hair and it worked for her. So I feel this product is not good but not for curly hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way but it works best on my colored hair than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. A lot of anti-frizz products seem to only target younger customers and weigh my hair down. This one doesn&#x27;t - it makes my hair glossy and bouncy.</li>
            <li> This serum is the best in the world. Trust me I have used them all they are either to thick and weigh your hair down or they are just too oily. This serum is light, greaseless and puts life into any dull hair. You only need a little bit Especially if your hair is short. I buy it by the dozen to last me the year. I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t get it when I need it. PERFECT PERFECT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I can&#x27;t live without it!  It really makes my hair shine and not look frizzy.  I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Holds hair&#x27;s body and encourages natural curl, without frizz or weight. Good for light scrunching. Have been using it for the last year after being introduced to it at my hair salon.</li>
            <li> I was really looking for big results after reading all the online reviews but I am a little disappointed.  I have very coarse curly hair and it is a good product, just not great.  It does feel kind of heavy on your hair and does cause a build up.  It works best for me as a finishing gloss and tamer on a really good day with low humidity, which is the problem, I live in the South where humidity is something you deal with 12 months of the year.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magical! Smooths flyaways and makes hair beautifully shiny. And a little goes a long way. Love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is decent, but I found Long N Strong 2-in-1 Anti-frizz and Hair growth serum to be better. Its actually the best stuff I ever used. My hair broke a lot less, and grew faster and it NEVER made my hair greasy! Which is great!  It also lasts a long time because you don&#x27;t gotta use too much.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be real effective in humid conditions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product for the past 6 years and I love it. It is a perfect anti-frizz product and it makes my hair shine for an entire day.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it and give it 5 stars</li>
            <li> It gives my hair the right textur and shine that I was looking for.  The product is a little pricey due to the shipping charges.The product does not give it a greasy look.  It is a wonderful shine.</li>
            <li> I use this daily after my shower.  It works great, is not too &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; where you can tell that it&#x27;s on my hair.  Tames the frizz.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to run out of this because it gets rid of the frizz and makes my hair shinny and manageable.</li>
            <li> Best for anti frizz without looking greasy</li>
            <li> This Osis product did not work for me, but it may work for you.  The only thing I noticed after using 1 squirt is that it made hair a bit softer, with 2 squirts (next day), it made it a bit greasy and looking like I put oil in it.  The product did not take care of the frizz as advertised.  I very much disliked how my hair looked after using it.  I&#x27;m a user of another Osis product called Wax.  It works a lot better for me - it takes care of the frizz, adds a bit of shine and a bit of hold, just in a balanced manner, unlike the above product.  I have mid length slightly curly hair.</li>
            <li> With the hair damp or dry it works great, makes the hair soooo soft, controls the volume and the frizz.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and when I found out I was going to Shanghai last summer which has notoriously humid summers that make the humidity of Florida seem normal, I was worried. This, however, works. No question. It makes an enormous difference and a little goes a long way. Seriously worth it. Everything else is a gimmick.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a very long time.  Works wonderful on my hair and really tames my fly aways.</li>
            <li> I dont know what I was expecting for I still have the frizz</li>
            <li> this is by far the best hair product I have used......after hair dries I just put a little through my hair and it gives a high shine, and no grease..&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This works great for my thin, fine, frizzy hair!  I stock up during each order so I never run out!</li>
            <li> I had my hopes up high when I ordered this product.  I live in Michigan where the winters are very dry and the summers are extremely humid.  I have thick wavy hair and after using this product my hair didn&#x27;t feel much different than other products I&#x27;ve used.  I still had frizzy hair.  I&#x27;ll keep using it until it&#x27;s gone but I&#x27;m dissapointed it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair and I have tried nearly everything on it to get the tangles out after my shower. I&#x27;m fairly certain that this Gloss Serum is not intended for detangling, but it works for me.  It also puts a very nice shine to my hair. As for the frizz, my hair is so fine, I don&#x27;t think any product in the world is going to help me with that. I&#x27;ve tried so many products and it still flies everywhere.  I&#x27;m really glad that I stumbled upon this Osis Magic, I will continue to buy it, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This product is great for adding sheen to dry and color-processed hair.  it is light and makes styling easy.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I have used it for several years now, and there is nothing else on the market that can take its place!!</li>
            <li> Great control without stickiness or stiffness. Leaves hair soft and smelling great. Would definitely buy again and recommend to others.</li>
            <li> This product works great for completing a finished look without weighting down your hair.  I have fine, blond hair so most products are too heavy...this isn&#x27;t.  Will calm the &amp;#34;fly aways&amp;#34; without the greasy, heavy look of that most other products do.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 10 years and got my daughter hooked on it, too. Just a teeny amount makes your hair super shiny and smooth. The bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have thick course hair, but can be used for any type of hair.  You just vary the amount!  They took it out of the local beauty supply store and I purchased something else.  Nothing like &amp;#34;Magic&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Light and non-greasy; controls frizz. Smells good without lingering and being too strong. Only a tiny amount is need so product lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I use Osis Magic just about everyday..  It turns my dull old grey hair shiny but not stiff like other products and works well for styling too.  - can&#x27;t do without it!</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair that tends to frizz once it dries.  Tames frizz and leaves hair shining.  This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years (7 or 8) for smoothing and anti-frizz. I live in a humid place and my hair is wavy with a tendency to frizz. OSIS Magic is amazing! I have never found an anti-frizz serum that can match it. Ever. You only need a very small amount. It will never weigh down your hair, but if you apply too much you will get a kind of oily look.</li>
            <li> Okay, nothing special.</li>
            <li> Great product!  It gives my hair a little body and tons of shine!</li>
            <li> I really like the results from this product. It definitely controls my frizz and adds shine.  I&#x27;m a frequent buyer.</li>
            <li> I have used Osis before and like it.  No matter how many times you use this, it never weighs down your hair.  A hairdresser recommended this product to me.  It is easy to purchase through Amazon and the seller was quite prompt in the delivery of the item.</li>
            <li> It just saves me a lot of time. I hardly use my blow dryer. I apply very little to my damp hair, brush it et voila - frizz free shiny hair! I love the fact that just a small amount of product does the trick. Be careful with the amount you apply because a lot of product makes the hair look like it hasn&#x27;t been washed in a while.</li>
            <li> This product &amp;#34;refreshes&amp;#34; your hair do and makes it look better.  Only a drop or two is needed--it will last a long time.  I found this by accident, however, I will use and recommend it as long as the excellent quality is in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand for years and it&#x27;s super! I love the texture and smell - just a small amount is needed - I&#x27;ll never switch brands!</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying this product. I have course, thick colored(although grey underneath) which can get rather wiry and unruly on top, which was the reason I ordered this  product. I used it for the first time this morning and I like it so far. It smoothed the wiry hair up on top and overall and it smelled good too. If you have fine hair this may not be your product as you may find it too heavy.</li>
            <li> Great product for fizzy and straight hair.  Adds shine and relaxes the hair.  Could only find this product in hair salons so very glad I can now get it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and this product helps make it shiny and controls the frizz.  It takes a very small amount.</li>
            <li> Ask me to pick one product I would take on a deserted island, and the answer will always be Schwarzkopf OSIS Magic.  I have used this anti frizz product for fifteen years, and I am never disappointed with the finished results. It&#x27;s literally magic!!!</li>
            <li> I use hot rollers on my hair and my curls last all day.  Since I started using this product my hair does not stay curled, it does control the frizz though.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome...just like the name, it&#x27;s magic for your hair! Even fine hair like mine, just a dab will do ya.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t go out w/o using this product on my hair. it smoothens the frizziness and makes it look normal.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser recommended this product to me for frizz control. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy (unless I use too much) and it seems to tame my dry ends. You only need to use 1 pump, so the bottle should last quite a while, therefor I find this to be a great value, however it not exactly what I was looking for.  I want a product to put on my hair after I&#x27;ve washed it. This product can go on damp hair, however it seems to primarily be for dry hair with fly always, which is what I will use it for.</li>
            <li> I get comments regularly about my &amp;#34;great hair!&amp;#34;  I love this product.  It moisturized without leaving my hair oily.  It washes out with no residue too.  It always makes my hair silky soft and the smell is great too!  One of my daily &amp;#34;must haves!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  No frizzes at the beach.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for more than 5 years now. It was recommended by my hair stylist and cannot go without it.  I flat iron my hair everyday and it helps tame my curly hair.  I tried other anti-frizz and they make my hair hair hard.  Osis Magic leaves my hair soft and no heavy feeling at all.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for straightening hair. Magic serum to calm any fly aways.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. It&#x27;s the perfect finishing touch for frizzies. Calms them without being greasy. It&#x27;s a nice, light gel-like cream. Also, this price was about half the cost you&#x27;ll find it for in beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair. This product will tame flyaways and frizz, as well as texturize and light syling hold. But as they say less is more. Use a very small amount rubbed between your palms and spread mainly all over your ends..using too much ( especially on fine hair will make your hair look greasy) Great product</li>
