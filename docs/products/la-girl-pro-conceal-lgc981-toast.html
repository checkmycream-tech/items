            <li>I love this Concealer .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>but this one works better.</li>
            <li>You have to use a very light hand for it as it can come out too quickly for contour application.</li>
            <li>Concealer glides on smoothly and blends easily.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>I Love it ,I even guessed the right color.</li>
            <li>I am new to this concealer and I must say that it is kind of sticky.</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t use a lot of other products to give out more of a reference</li>
            <li>Highly blendable.</li>
            <li>It seems as the components of the makeup separated, i.e. when I squeeze the tube a clear liquid was came out rather than makeup.  </li>
            <li>the seller sold me a defective or old product.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s hard to fine my shade .</li>

            <li> This product sinks so well into my darker skin!</li>
            <li> To dark If it&#x27;s not to lite than it&#x27;s to dark!!</li>
            <li> You have to work with it quickly, do not allow it to sit on your face or you will have a hard time with it.</li>
            <li> I was totally unable to use it due to the fact that it was defective.  </li>
            <li> Will never purchase products from this seller again because I hate to waste my money.</li>
            <li> I will never buy an expensive concealer agen.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m very disappointed that the product did not work as it should have.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Matches my skin tone perfectly. Lasts all day. Will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Use this as a contour. You have to use a very light hand for it as it can come out too quickly for contour application. Good coverage though and a good ash color.</li>
            <li> the seller sold me a defective or old product.  I purchased the same product from another seller and I did not have the same difficulty I experience from this one.  It seems as the components of the makeup separated, i.e. when I squeeze the tube a clear liquid was came out rather than makeup.  This product is suppose to be very simple to apply so I&#x27;m very disappointed that the product did not work as it should have.  I was totally unable to use it due to the fact that it was defective.  Will never purchase products from this seller again because I hate to waste my money.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite concealers. It provides excellent coverge &amp; it last all day.</li>
            <li> Theses L.A pro girl concealers are AMAZING they are the same quality has the MAC pro long wear concealers hands down!</li>
            <li> Concealer glides on smoothly and blends easily. It also holds up nicely.  I&#x27;ve bought all the shades and mix for colors that I want. I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> To dark If it&#x27;s not to lite than it&#x27;s to dark!! This is a great concealer but it&#x27;s hard to fine my shade ., the colors they put up online don&#x27;t match when you see it in person . I&#x27;m a medium brown with yellow under tone..</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product that I heard every MUA rave about and wanted to try for myself. I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li> Good coverage but not I don&#x27;t care too much for the brush tip</li>
            <li> I like all the shades this concealer, conceals spots but not as good as iman secret cover, it&#x27;s just ok</li>
            <li> LA GIRL Pro Conceal is a great concealer. It is recommend by so many makeup artist . Now I can see why.</li>
            <li> I am new to this concealer and I must say that it is kind of sticky. You have to work with it quickly, do not allow it to sit on your face or you will have a hard time with it.</li>
            <li> I will never buy an expensive concealer agen. Ive been looking for the perfect one with the perfect price and this is beyond a steal for the quality! will be re-purchasing</li>
            <li> I Love it ,I even guessed the right color.</li>
            <li> Gray product shipped fast and was better than I expected it goes well with my skin and gives me a great finish</li>
            <li> This product sinks so well into my darker skin! I used it around my brows to clean up stray hairs and awkward penciled in mistakes while enhancing my brow look. It doesn&#x27;t sweat out later in the day and cast a ghastly yellowish tint on my skin like my last concealer did. I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s so cheap too!! For reference my shade is around nw45 studio fix concealer in mac and bronze 2 for mary kay concealer and powder or 607 in their liquid foundation. I don&#x27;t use a lot of other products to give out more of a reference so I hope that helps.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the color so much,  I like Mac better</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected. Blends nicely</li>
            <li> I love this Concealer . I heard about it from a friend , so I thought i&#x27;d order some and try it out . I&#x27;m so glad I did. awesome for highlighting and cleaning up [your bra area . i&#x27;m a stickler for MAC , but I might switch over to this concealor . it would definitely help my pockets too .</li>
            <li> I was watching a YouTube makeup guru and she used this a lot so I figured I would try it. It conceal very well and it&#x27;s cheap. I have more expensive concealers but this one works better. I will purchase again!!</li>
            <li> Highly blendable. Great for contouring</li>
            <li> Really blends well, and the perfect color for my MAC NC42 skin tone as a contour product, without looking extremely fake. Love!</li>
