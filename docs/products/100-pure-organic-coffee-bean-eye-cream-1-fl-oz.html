    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>works on my bags perfectly</li>
            <li>Good product!</li>
            <li>Great organic product and the coffee bean reduces the puffiness under the eyes</li>
            <li>Very nice moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This is the best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used: effective, not greasy, smells good.</li>
            <li>Not the best eye cream I have tried but its better than not putting any eye cream on at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I cannot use this cosmetic--am loaded with allergies--this cream is a good idea--but not for me.</li>
            <li>it just feels and smells good.</li>
            <li>And I smell good.</li>
            <li>The product arrived on time, and though I cannot speak for what temperatures it traveled through and, thus, the effect on the product, it seemed to be in good condition.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy so many people like this cream</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and I love that too!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle worker and it doesn&#x27;t feel amazing going on like some eye creams do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought it would be better, it smells good and has a nice texture.</li>
            <li>Priced reasonable and works excellent to relieve under the eye puff.</li>
            <li>Soaks in nice, does not irritate.</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on nicely over it</li>
            <li>I love this cream and the smell is soooooo good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good moisturizer, and I love the coffee scent.  </li>
            <li>A nice way to get girls in the process of using eye cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective</li>
            <li>I made those two changes and I also use this eye cream, it&#x27;s the most effective of all that I have.</li>
            <li>Very good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of coffee</li>
            <li>so I love the chocolately, coffee smell of this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Such a wonderful eye cream to wear during the day under make-up.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m going do some more comparison shopping before I make a purchase.</li>
            <li>but so glad I did.</li>
            <li>love this cream.</li>
            <li>I like the tube better than the pump and wish the 1 oz.</li>
            <li>sure will be reordering this</li>
            <li>Eyes look much better.</li>
            <li>I love how this smells.</li>
            <li>will use this seller again:-)</li>
            <li>My eyes looked brighter, fresher and smoother after using it, plus it is GLUTEN FREE!</li>
            <li>but I got 1/2 the size product for more money..</li>
            <li>Great smell, goes on super nice, silk, smooth, feels great, sinks in, everything you want from a daytime eye cream.</li>
            <li>Wonderful eye cream, but limited anti-aging...</li>
            <li>The fragrance is fine with me.  </li>
            <li>Did not have the fine lines disappear.  </li>
            <li>Line of products overall is just great.</li>
            <li>Under my eyes it feels comfortable under concealer.</li>
            <li>a light coffee scent.</li>
            <li>But is glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It smells like strong coffee but the smell dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to hear about this product.</li>
            <li>have used this several times in between more effective eye creams, and would recommend trying it</li>
            <li>I bought this because the brand is gluten free, but this stuff is only good for people in their teens.</li>
            <li>So many positive reviews - how could it be bad?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Smells really good but definitely  not coffee flavor, closer to hazelnut and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Either way, my eyes look more awake, the stuff absorbs fast and smells</li>
            <li>This eye cream feels great- makes my eyes appear brighter and lightens the dark circles</li>
            <li>This is great, I have always had dark purple under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and texture of this product, and it leaves the skin super soft.</li>
            <li>I love this brand and their natural products.</li>
            <li>I am not crazy about this product.</li>
            <li>Still worth it.</li>
            <li>It definitely has a nice yummy smell.</li>
            <li>However, this eye cream feels nice (not too heavy, too light, too oily) and I love that it is natural and vegan.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very reasonably priced</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and I think it really works!</li>
            <li>It has a light (natural, not chemical) scent of coffee bean and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Not only do I not see a difference, but in fact it is so oily, that even with powder on top it causes my mascara to smudge on my area underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li>Sorry, I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this eye cream; didn&#x27;t notice any improvement with the use of added coffee beans.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin super soft and supple and works well under my mineral make-up (Valana Minerals).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I may try some other natural, vegan eye creams as I try to find the best one, but I won&#x27;t be surprised if I come back to 100% Pure.</li>
            <li>According to Dr Oz, a pure caffeine lotion is just the thing for this condition.</li>
            <li>I bought 100% Pure Organic Coffee Bean Eye Cream in order to reduce the puffiness and darkness of my under-eye</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found that 100% Pure Organic Coffee Bean Eye Cream has reduced my under-eye puffiness and darkness noticeably.  </li>
            <li>It is very emollient</li>
            <li>It does absolutely nothing for my shiners.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My eyes tend to be very puffy but this eye cream helps prevent that.</li>
            <li>And it was shipped very promptly.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of eye creams and I&#x27;m very picky.</li>
            <li>Plus this is really oily and smears, does not absorb into skin.</li>
            <li>However, it didn&#x27;t help the puffiness around my eyes as much as I had hoped it would.  </li>
            <li>As with any product like this I&#x27;ve tried, I don&#x27;t really know whether or not it&#x27;s helping hold off some age as I cannot travel back-and-forth through time, testing one life with the product and one life without.</li>
            <li>*, Vitamin E (Tocopherol), Vitamin C (Sodium Ascorbate), Coffee Cherry Seed Extract (Coffea Arabica), Rosemary Leaf Extract (Rosmarinus Officinalis), Oregano Leaf Extract Origanum Vulgare), Thyme Flower/Leaf Extract (Thymus Vulgaris), Goldenseal Extract (Hydrastis Canadensis), Vanilla Fruit Absolute (Vanilla Planifolia), Candelilla Wax (Euphorbia Cerifera Cera)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>*, Rose Hydrosol (Rosa Centifolia)*, Rosehip Seed Oil (Rosa Canina)*, Green Coffee Seed Extract (Coffea Arabica)</li>
            <li>She &amp;#34;swears by it&amp;#34; &amp; says it works better than any other product she&#x27;s used.</li>
            <li>This is a good overall eye cream for everyday and under makeup.</li>
            <li>Great product, this tiny tube lasts me 3 months on average and it actually works!</li>
            <li>I had purchased the larger, regular size of this eye cream through Amazon prior to this purchase, and I was pretty pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>This eye cream smells coffee-ish, But I&#x27;m not sure why that&#x27;s so surprising or assaulting, since it&#x27;s clearly called &amp;#34;Coffee Bean Eye Cream.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve been using this cream twice a day religiously for over a month now</li>
            <li>Also, a little goes a long way, which is always nice.</li>
            <li>It does make your skin feel smooth, but lots of lotions do that, for less money too.</li>
            <li>I still use it once in awhile, but I&#x27;ve pretty much gone back to Neutrogena Anti-aging for regular, every day use.</li>
            <li>Funny how something pure feels worse than something full of chemicals.</li>
            <li>I developed an allergy to it--had to stop using.  </li>
            <li>Product recommended for puffiness under eyes, but so far there has been no improvement.  </li>
            <li>I feel like my eyes look worse, more prominent lines and always feel dried out.</li>
            <li>I have major puffiness under both eyes and after using this eye cream for almost 2 months twice a day, I still have puffiness with NO change.  </li>
            <li>Three months after purchase I still have plenty left as it requires less than a forth of a pea size to feel each eye is adequately covered and moisturized.</li>
            <li>This stuff is like putting water on your face, does not provide long lasting moisture and does not get rid of fine lines or dark circles underneath the eyes.</li>
            <li>The only plus is that it&#x27;s all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>product isnt the panacea I was desperately seeking but it does a fairly good job.</li>
            <li>My puffiness is not any worse, so I guess its safe to say this product is helping me maintain puffiness.</li>
            <li>I have dark circles (allergy shiners) caused by multiple environmental allergies and have also developed alot of puffiness below AND above my eyes-------paints a pretty picture dont</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really seen a difference in anything that it claims other than being a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This does absolutely nothing to get rid of dark circles though.</li>
            <li>It really does help my dark circles.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell if it really helps with dark circles as i have not notice a difference.  </li>
            <li>Once I&#x27;d got used to the slight smell of coffee this really grew on me.  </li>
            <li>This eye cream certainly helps with dark circles!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say if it helps with dark circles or wrinkles because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough.</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t really say if it helps with dark circles or wrinkles because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure if it does much for lightening the skin around the eyes</li>
            <li> I love the product, but didn&#x27;t realize this order contained two very small small containers.  </li>
            <li> I have light blue under eye circles due to thin skin there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a dramatic difference, but my dark circles are much less noticeable</li>
            <li> This eye cream isnt the best Ive used but certainly not the worst, either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Twice daily -- after cleansing, toning and moisturizing -- I apply a very small dab of 100% Pure Organic Coffee Bean Eye Cream to my under eye area.</li>

            <li> Yes, the other reviewers are correct.</li>
            <li> I am going to purchase another small one for travel, and a BIG one.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference with this product than any other I have used.  </li>
            <li> It smells like cheap icing about to go bad</li>

            <li> I cut my caffeine intake in half.</li>
            <li> (I now drink two cups of coffee a day, but each are half decaf) and I was putting eye creams and gels too close to my eyes and while asleep at night stuff would migrate into my eyes making them poof</li>

            <li> the eye I tried it on does look a liiiitle less puffy, but I can&#x27;t take the smell,</li>
            <li> Its been less than a month since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> A teeny little tube lasted me FOUR months --- longer than anything</li>
            <li> I can put a little bit on my eyelid and it&#x27;s not greasy and helps with puffiness.</li>

            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found the puffiness-reducing effects of this cream to be cumulative so if I miss a few days of using it my skin begins to puff again.</li>

            <li> Especially if you are going to drop 11$ already on this stuff which makes your eyes LOOK WORSE!</li>
            <li> But now I hardly even need to put makeup there.</li>
            <li> It helps with puffiness, but not on circles--at least not for me.</li>
            <li> at least once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: you must let it absorb into your skin before apply make-up.</li>
            <li> No more zombie eyes for me, yay!</li>
            <li> First, the scent is terrible!  </li>
            <li> Expensive, however.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the smell of coffee so I love the chocolately, coffee smell of this product. This does absolutely nothing to get rid of dark circles though. I found that it actually made them appear darker after I put the cream on. It does make your skin feel smooth, but lots of lotions do that, for less money too. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference</li>
            <li> I thought it would be better, it smells good and has a nice texture. It helps with puffiness, but not on circles--at least not for me.</li>
            <li> Priced reasonable and works excellent to relieve under the eye puff.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have been using it for over a year. I think it helps with puffiness. But i.slso discovered two other secrets that were causing my eye puffiness before. I cut my caffeine intake in half. (I now drink two cups of coffee a day, but each are half decaf) and I was putting eye creams and gels too close to my eyes and while asleep at night stuff would migrate into my eyes making them poof and I never realized it. I made those two changes and I also use this eye cream, it&#x27;s the most effective of all that I have.</li>
            <li> Such a wonderful eye cream to wear during the day under make-up.  Great smell, goes on super nice, silk, smooth, feels great, sinks in, everything you want from a daytime eye cream.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference until I&#x27;d been using it daily for two weeks. It&#x27;s not a dramatic difference, but my dark circles are much less noticeable and I use much less concealer to cover them than I used to. That said, my dark circles are definitely still there, especially if I&#x27;m lacking sleep. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker and it doesn&#x27;t feel amazing going on like some eye creams do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m undecided on whether to buy again. It&#x27;s very reasonably priced but I&#x27;m going do some more comparison shopping before I make a purchase.</li>
            <li> I developed an allergy to it--had to stop using.  I cannot use this cosmetic--am loaded with allergies--this cream is a good idea--but not for me.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my sister. She &amp;#34;swears by it&amp;#34; &amp; says it works better than any other product she&#x27;s used.</li>
            <li> I came across this line of products accidently but so glad I did. I don&#x27;t have bags becasue of age, just lack of sleep and stress. Not for those that have bags because of age.  Soaks in nice, does not irritate. Line of products overall is just great.</li>
            <li> love this cream. works on my bags perfectly</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait until I got this product home. So many positive reviews - how could it be bad?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;ll tell you.  I have major puffiness under both eyes and after using this eye cream for almost 2 months twice a day, I still have puffiness with NO change.  The fragrance is fine with me.  I like coffee.  I&#x27;m happy so many people like this cream but it&#x27;s not for me and I would never recommend it.</li>
            <li> Yes, the other reviewers are correct. This eye cream smells coffee-ish, But I&#x27;m not sure why that&#x27;s so surprising or assaulting, since it&#x27;s clearly called &amp;#34;Coffee Bean Eye Cream.&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve been using this cream twice a day religiously for over a month now and I like it. My eyes haven&#x27;t lifted or brightened in an earth shattering way, but it&#x27;s an eye cream, not a face lift. It has done what I wanted it to do, it moisturizes my eye area well enough to hide the dry skin that sometimes gets me down in the winter. My makeup goes on nicely over it and I quite like the smell actually. I&#x27;ll definitely keep using it. I love this brand and their natural products. Also, a little goes a long way, which is always nice.</li>
            <li> This eye cream isnt the best Ive used but certainly not the worst, either. I have dark circles (allergy shiners) caused by multiple environmental allergies and have also developed alot of puffiness below AND above my eyes-------paints a pretty picture dont it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product isnt the panacea I was desperately seeking but it does a fairly good job. It smells like strong coffee but the smell dissipates quickly. It is very emollient and I have to wait a few minutes before applying concealer and foundation to allow it to soak in. It does work on puffiness---eventually---so I have learned to be patient with it. It does absolutely nothing for my shiners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found the puffiness-reducing effects of this cream to be cumulative so if I miss a few days of using it my skin begins to puff again.</li>
            <li> My eyes tend to be very puffy but this eye cream helps prevent that. I have a dry under eye area as well but this eye cream prevents hydrates them enough.  I would recommend this to people who have problems with sensitivity. This did not sting my eyes.</li>
            <li> Product recommended for puffiness under eyes, but so far there has been no improvement.  Have used twice a day since receipt with nothing happening.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to hear about this product. I have light blue under eye circles due to thin skin there. According to Dr Oz, a pure caffeine lotion is just the thing for this condition. I love the smell and texture of this product, and it leaves the skin super soft. However, after three weeks of use, there is no difference or reduction of the under eye color. I will finish the tube, but I doubt I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> My eyes no longer feel puffy in the morning</li>
            <li> I both received and threw away this eye cream today.  First, the scent is terrible!  It smells like cheap icing about to go bad, no lie!  Second, it burns.  I washed my face, and I can still smell it, and it still burns!&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say, the eye I tried it on does look a liiiitle less puffy, but I can&#x27;t take the smell, let alone the pain.</li>
            <li> Love it! Especially the coffee scent</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen a difference in anything that it claims other than being a moisturizer. The only plus is that it&#x27;s all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Reduces some puffiness.Did not have the fine lines disappear.  Did not find the odor offensive. Very nice moisturizer.  Very good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Tried a sample of this while in San Jose CA.  Love the product and bought more!! Great organic product and the coffee bean reduces the puffiness under the eyes</li>
            <li> Good product! Smells really good but definitely  not coffee flavor, closer to hazelnut and vanilla. This works well for my eyes&#x27; puffiness and dark circles but not work for my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I am not crazy about this product. It does nothing for the bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Not the best eye cream I have tried but its better than not putting any eye cream on at all.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this several times in between more effective eye creams, and would recommend trying it at least once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: you must let it absorb into your skin before apply make-up.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used: effective, not greasy, smells good. I like the tube better than the pump and wish the 1 oz. size came as a tube. As it is, this tube is only 0.3 oz. rather than the half-ounce I had before. Still worth it.</li>
            <li> Once I&#x27;d got used to the slight smell of coffee this really grew on me.  A teeny little tube lasted me FOUR months --- longer than anything lese I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and I think it really works!</li>
            <li> Wonderful eye cream, but limited anti-aging...it just feels and smells good.</li>
            <li> Great product, this tiny tube lasts me 3 months on average and it actually works! No more zombie eyes for me, yay! Try it for yourself.</li>
            <li> This eye cream feels great- makes my eyes appear brighter and lightens the dark circles underneath.&lt;br /&gt;I sure will be reordering this</li>
            <li> I love the product, but didn&#x27;t realize this order contained two very small small containers.  I ended up paying 2x the usual amount.  I needed it because I ran out and was going away, so I didn&#x27;t return any.  I felt misled.  Don&#x27;t buy from this company.</li>
            <li> This is great, I have always had dark purple under my eyes.  But now I hardly even need to put makeup there. And it was shipped very promptly.  I am going to purchase another small one for travel, and a BIG one.  ALSO it does not keep me awake at night, but everyone is different.</li>
            <li> Seems to work. Eyes look much better. Expensive, however.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of eye creams and I&#x27;m very picky. This is a good overall eye cream for everyday and under makeup. I can put a little bit on my eyelid and it&#x27;s not greasy and helps with puffiness. Under my eyes it feels comfortable under concealer. I can&#x27;t really say if it helps with dark circles or wrinkles because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough. It definitely has a nice yummy smell.</li>
            <li> I love this cream and the smell is soooooo good.  It really does help my dark circles.  And I smell good.</li>
            <li> I love how this smells. I want this in a lotion. As for an eye cream, my eyes are watering &amp; burning. It hurts as an eye cream. Funny how something pure feels worse than something full of chemicals. Plus this is really oily and smears, does not absorb into skin.</li>
            <li> The eye-cream works for me. The caffeine constricts the skin somehow, or boosts circulation. Either way, my eyes look more awake, the stuff absorbs fast and smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use this seller again:-)</li>
            <li> I had purchased the larger, regular size of this eye cream through Amazon prior to this purchase, and I was pretty pleased with it.  It&#x27;s a good moisturizer, and I love the coffee scent.  However, it didn&#x27;t help the puffiness around my eyes as much as I had hoped it would.  I still use it once in awhile, but I&#x27;ve pretty much gone back to Neutrogena Anti-aging for regular, every day use.</li>
            <li> This eye cream certainly helps with dark circles!  I ended up buying one of their kits after trying the eye cream and I love that too!</li>
            <li> DOES NOTHING! MADE WORSE! I feel like my eyes look worse, more prominent lines and always feel dried out. This stuff is like putting water on your face, does not provide long lasting moisture and does not get rid of fine lines or dark circles underneath the eyes. I bought this because the brand is gluten free, but this stuff is only good for people in their teens. A nice way to get girls in the process of using eye cream. I suggest TARTE&#x27;s eye brightening cream. My eyes looked brighter, fresher and smoother after using it, plus it is GLUTEN FREE! It is on the pricey end, but so work it. Especially if you are going to drop 11$ already on this stuff which makes your eyes LOOK WORSE!</li>
            <li> I do like this product but I got 1/2 the size product for more money.. I will not order this again from this company.. They are way overpriced... And took advantage.. Look around you can find a fairer price...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been making the transition from Oil of Olay, etc. to products without fifty potentially cancer-causing ingredients. As with any product like this I&#x27;ve tried, I don&#x27;t really know whether or not it&#x27;s helping hold off some age as I cannot travel back-and-forth through time, testing one life with the product and one life without. I have not noticed a miraculous reversal of eye wrinkles, nor have I shriveled up. However, this eye cream feels nice (not too heavy, too light, too oily) and I love that it is natural and vegan. Three months after purchase I still have plenty left as it requires less than a forth of a pea size to feel each eye is adequately covered and moisturized. It has a light (natural, not chemical) scent of coffee bean and vanilla. The product arrived on time, and though I cannot speak for what temperatures it traveled through and, thus, the effect on the product, it seemed to be in good condition. I may try some other natural, vegan eye creams as I try to find the best one, but I won&#x27;t be surprised if I come back to 100% Pure.</li>
            <li> a light coffee scent. i&#x27;m not sure if it does much for lightening the skin around the eyes but it does have a cooling sensation</li>
            <li> Its been less than a month since I started using this product. My puffiness is not any worse, so I guess its safe to say this product is helping me maintain puffiness.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell if it really helps with dark circles as i have not notice a difference.  But is glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference with this product than any other I have used.  It was touted for reducing eye inflammation.  Not only do I not see a difference, but in fact it is so oily, that even with powder on top it causes my mascara to smudge on my area underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> I bought 100% Pure Organic Coffee Bean Eye Cream in order to reduce the puffiness and darkness of my under-eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twice daily -- after cleansing, toning and moisturizing -- I apply a very small dab of 100% Pure Organic Coffee Bean Eye Cream to my under eye area. It leaves my skin super soft and supple and works well under my mineral make-up (Valana Minerals).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that 100% Pure Organic Coffee Bean Eye Cream has reduced my under-eye puffiness and darkness noticeably.  It&#x27;s effective so I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Aloe Vera Juice (Aloe Barbadensis)*, Rose Hydrosol (Rosa Centifolia)*, Rosehip Seed Oil (Rosa Canina)*, Green Coffee Seed Extract (Coffea Arabica)*, Vitamin E (Tocopherol), Vitamin C (Sodium Ascorbate), Coffee Cherry Seed Extract (Coffea Arabica), Rosemary Leaf Extract (Rosmarinus Officinalis), Oregano Leaf Extract Origanum Vulgare), Thyme Flower/Leaf Extract (Thymus Vulgaris), Goldenseal Extract (Hydrastis Canadensis), Vanilla Fruit Absolute (Vanilla Planifolia), Candelilla Wax (Euphorbia Cerifera Cera)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* &#x3D; organic</li>
            <li> Sorry, I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this eye cream; didn&#x27;t notice any improvement with the use of added coffee beans.  My eyes are still puffy.  S A Little</li>
            <li> Good product. Works well.</li>
