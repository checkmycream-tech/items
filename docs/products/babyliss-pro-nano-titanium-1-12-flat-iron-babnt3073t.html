            <li>None as Spectacular as THIS one !</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY hair straighteners, but this one is the BEST!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for about 2 weeks now, and it makes my hair look so healthy and glossy and straightens perfectly!</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon as always the best pakege best timing and everything</li>
            <li>but with this Iron is easy and results are great!!!</li>
            <li>I have loved this straightener.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ve tried my share of hair straighteners, all fairly low-end.  </li>
            <li>-Aveda&#x27;s smooth infusions line is the best straightening products I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>it has always been a strugle, and results were never as good as going to a hair salon to get it done</li>
            <li>and it breaks for good.  </li>
            <li>You know how to make a good straightener that lasts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Excellent quality and good price.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Excellent for Curling the ends Inward / Under ;)&lt;br /&gt;Chicago , Illinois - MAY 01 , 2011</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>i love it!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>absolutely love this iron!</li>
            <li>this babyliss tatinum is amazing</li>
            <li>It looked amazing</li>
            <li>iron is amazing</li>
            <li>It glides along nicely.</li>
            <li>Really the best product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Figured it was time for me to have my own.</li>
            <li>the plates aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;floating&amp;#34; so it kind of burns your hair and applies the heat</li>
            <li>And even more satisfied with NewvoBeauty!  </li>
            <li>The adjustable temp is great, the plates heat up very quickly, and having the large surface area is great when trying to straighten.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best straightener I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I have medium, naturally wavy hair and 375 is the perfect temperature that I set on my babyliss.</li>
            <li>so on, babyliss is by far the BEST straightener i have used.</li>
            <li>and my daughter has very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love it!  </li>
            <li>It is superb, no other word to describe it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very light weight.</li>
            <li>is much better than chi that i had in many years.</li>
            <li>I would suggest using a heat safe product on it, because my hair did start to look burned, but if I used a cooler temp.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this straightener and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>So much better than the Chi.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember how many Chi&#x27;s I have bought and they stop working.</li>
            <li>After a blowdry now, I just use this iron and it works magic.</li>
            <li>but I wanted to finish watching Glee. :-)  </li>
            <li>but the result is shiny, healthy looking hair with a lot of movement.</li>
            <li>So much better than the CHI.</li>
            <li>and i put it on the appropriate setting for my type</li>
            <li>She has voluminous wavy hair and she loves her bayliss as much as i love mine.</li>
            <li>I love the babyliss.</li>
            <li>It also gives me fly-aways that I&#x27;ve never had before which will not cooperate regardless of how many times I straighten them.  </li>
            <li>for a ceramic plate that mentions &amp;#34;floating&amp;#34; plates, you&#x27;ll get better results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever tried; it&#x27;s wwaaayyyyy better than CHI.  </li>
            <li>but it is still a hot tool, so you NEED to protect your hair no matter what!!!</li>
            <li>Best flat iron I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>For what you&#x27;re getting in this flat iron, it is an excellent deal!</li>
            <li>&quot; and this flat iron is the best I ever had....</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful flat iron.</li>
            <li>I have used a flat iron for almost 10 years, and this babyliss has been the best iron that I have had.</li>
            <li>Best flat iron I have ever had!</li>
            <li>and I think from wear and tear plus my longer hair, it just fizzled out, although to be fair, it never got quite as hot as the BaByliss.     </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and glides through my hair without catching.</li>
            <li>super light, easy to work with, and super great value.</li>
            <li>CHIs are great if your hair is naturally without a lot of body.</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have used to rid myself of my lifelong curls.</li>
            <li>on were you grab it, but other than that is a great product!!</li>
            <li>It does also heat up very quickly.</li>
            <li>Heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>The handle does get pretty warm.</li>
            <li>I have fine and curly hair.</li>
            <li>Super prompt service!  </li>
            <li>Heats up fast, covers more hair and does not pull hair out!</li>
            <li>I just love it, make my job so much easier and faster!!</li>
            <li>You will enjoy.</li>
            <li>I will be attentive to their offerings</li>
            <li>I purchased BabyLiss Pro NaNO Titanium 1 3/4 plate width after reading all reviews available about this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I tried all options of settings of power available up to 450 degrees, it does not do the job it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and it works so well that it is amazing.</li>
            <li>THIS IS A GREAT BUY FOR ANY GAL THAT HAS THE SAME HAIR TYPE</li>
            <li>My hair is really smooth and it doesn&#x27;t feel crunchy as it used to.</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t feel like the plates went through my hair as smoothly.</li>
            <li>hair actually turned out straighter than what I&#x27;ve experienced at the salon, and my stylist is a celebrity stylist.</li>
            <li>The Titanium Iron it is an excelen product, it works properly, so far so good</li>
            <li>That leaves my hands right on top of the on/off button.  </li>
            <li>And fast shipping!!!  </li>
            <li>Wow..I am Highly Impressed with this particular Flat Iron..</li>
            <li>This flat iron was an excellent upgrade from my older drugstore-purchased $30 conair.</li>
            <li>An original babyliss.</li>
            <li>but it is worth every dollar!</li>
            <li>but I just couldn&#x27;t get it to mimic the results I had with the original iron</li>
            <li>but I think I&#x27;ll probably purchase the original one again.</li>
            <li>Buena Placha, original, en perfecto estado, bien sellada, enviada en tiempo oportuno,</li>
            <li>I really like how quickly this iron gets hot and it does a good job straightening hair.  </li>
            <li>heats up quick and gets very hot!</li>
            <li>I have middium length thick,wavy hair and wanted to find a very good and decent price flat iron.  </li>
            <li>and I guess I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing because it didn&#x27;t seem to get my hair as straight as I would have liked at first,</li>
            <li>It stays straight for most of the day and leaves my hair looking shiny.</li>
            <li>The 1 1/2 inch model is great for my long hair, but I have tried it on short hair and it is very challenging.</li>
            <li>It has 5 settings with different temperatures - which is AMAZING because I have fine hair</li>
            <li>The ceramic integrated heaters makes it  heat quickly and keep it longer.  </li>
            <li>Es super c&amp;oacute;moda y no pesa mucho.</li>
            <li>I quickly gave the Chi away.</li>
            <li>I have SUPER curly hair</li>
            <li>Still, I have no complaints as the one i received is still pretty light.</li>
            <li>Gets very hot</li>
            <li>I need it to be VERY hot, but still have a type of material that will protect my hair.  </li>
            <li>This thing gets super hot!</li>
            <li>I can turn it down to 150 and it works great for her hair.</li>
            <li>I love this new straightener.</li>
            <li>great product for black hair.</li>
            <li>No complaints about fast and free shipping-</li>
            <li>Straight your hair smoothly</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have to use it at the max temperature setting for my hair to be perfectly smooth and straight.</li>
            <li>It has been worth every penny.    </li>
            <li>This one has titanium plates and just glides right through.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>this iron straightens my natural hair making it look as if I have a fresh relaxer,it glides through my hair so easily</li>
            <li>I have had this straightener for a year and a half, given to me as a birthday gift by my sister-in-law who has one herself and loved it.</li>
            <li>It heats up very fast and stays that way.</li>
            <li>- what I found out was that the Chi is pretty much a phoney!</li>
            <li>On top of that, it only had one temp it could be - on or off.</li>
            <li>It gets HOT HOT HOT, though, I run it on 375</li>
            <li>and i finished so fast i was amazed!</li>
            <li>and I bought one for my daughter as well, although it was a bit higher priced model.</li>
            <li>THANKS AGAIN!</li>
            <li>It gets really hot and does not pull your hair.</li>
            <li>and it had started to not get as hot as it used to when I received this one, so</li>
            <li>I used it last week on 340 degrees and had the same great results (still straight).</li>
            <li>and I need a hot iron that straightens my hair without frying it, so</li>
            <li>Feels lighter, the wide plates glide smoothly and the 410 F setting worked fine for my hair type.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>So glad I purchased this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I have had many a Flat Irons in my day but</li>
            <li>So I started reading reviews on the MANY flat irons out there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it would also be better to purchase a flat iron in person.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love you my flat iron!</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li>I have long, coarse, kinky hair and this flat iron is fantastic!!!!</li>
            <li>If you have the hair type mentioned in the title, I would not recommend setting the degrees any lower than 340 though, and there&#x27;s really no need to go as high as the 400s, but to each is own.</li>
            <li>: I shopped locally for a good flat iron and called a local salon who recommended BaByliss, being that&#x27;s what they primarily sold.</li>
            <li>i have used many other straighteners like conair, hot tools and</li>
            <li>First - It does NOT pull my hair as others do, The HIGH HEAT makes the Straightening JIFFY &amp; The Hair SUPERBLY STRAIGHT</li>
            <li>Even slept on, my hair is still smooth and straight as a pin when I wake up the next day</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d never seen my hair get so straight so fast.</li>
            <li>It is super-hot and heats up really fast.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>nowww feels like wooooow thanks again</li>
            <li>However, it still doesn&#x27;t look naturally straight afterwards.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t think I received the ultra-thin model at all, mine looks much thicker than what the photo shows.</li>
            <li>but I like it straight.  </li>
            <li>I have very think curly hair</li>
            <li>Thanks to Babyliss and Amazon.</li>
            <li>so you have to be very carefull</li>
            <li>my hair comes out straight and shiny...</li>
            <li>My daughter recommend the babyliss and this really work.  </li>
            <li>I started with the highest setting b/c i have so much hair, but now i use it at 35-40</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this seller and the Babyliss Pro Nano Titanium!</li>
            <li>Actually it looks better than when we had it professionally done.</li>
            <li>I bought this in the hopes that it would be as good as my Hai flat iron, but it seems to be a lot harder on your hair.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>any light  comes through, its not good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;happy iron hunting :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a hair product junkie, i have lots and lots of them, from super cheap to super expensive ones and my favorite so far is REDKEN SMOOTH DOWN HEAT GLIDE.</li>
            <li>Absolutely highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>it has high temps.</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna research a little more</li>
            <li>I highly suggest this iron if you like wearing your natural hair straight.</li>
            <li>, it stays straight and my hair feels soft after using it.</li>
            <li>I ended up with more fluffy and unruly hair after about 20 min of working on it.</li>
            <li>totally new product with all accessories in box.</li>
            <li>Thought it was time for something new and cheaper.</li>
            <li>The flat irons are cool to the touch outside and get my hair as well as my daughters and nieces hair beauty salon straight.</li>
            <li>Im a hairstylist in a very busy hair salon doing a lot of \\&quot;keratine treatments\\</li>
            <li>With the babyliss, it&#x27;s so fast and easy but with other hair products such as suave professionals heat protect,</li>
            <li>my only con would be that the handles can get really hot</li>
            <li>In order to get leverage I hold it as close to the flat iron as possible, which isn&#x27;t very close since it gets very hot.  </li>
            <li>My only concern was that it would stop getting as hot as it could after a year or so of use (like with my Chi), and so far it&#x27;s exactly the same as when I received it.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned and getting it for &lt;$100 seems like a crazy steal.  </li>
            <li>but this is what her local beauty salon uses and is way better than the standard flat iron.</li>
            <li>i have coarse, very thick black hair, this is perfect!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice thus far, setting the heat at 410</li>
            <li>(I have a natural wave).</li>
            <li>and it was still straight the next morning.</li>
            <li>The straight stays until your next wash, too.</li>
            <li>the john freida frizz ease 3-day straight before those other products to help keep my hair straight for days.</li>
            <li>If you want pin straight hair, the Babyliss Pro Nano Titanium flat irons are the way to go.</li>
            <li>After doing significant research online (and deciding I was going to forsake the conventional wisdom that the Chi is the only viable option), I went with the 1 3/4\\&quot; size.  </li>
            <li>but I had to go over sections a couple of times and it didn&#x27;t keep my hair straight for as long.</li>
            <li>Careful it gets really hot.</li>
            <li>I had a CHI 2 inch and 1 inch flat iron and both of them quit on me exactly the same way.</li>
            <li>It never worked correctly and barely got above 258 degrees-despite having a high setting of 358.   </li>
            <li>One thing, the plate is wide, wider than most of the flat irons on the market nowadays, so if you have become accustomed to using 1-inch flat irons, I would recommend purchasing the 1-inch model, especially if your hair is of a shorter length.</li>
            <li>It straightens so quickly, takes me less than 5 minutes to straighten all my hair (and I have a lot of it!).</li>
            <li>when I straighten my hair I like to wear a glove on my left hand (just a cheap plain one from a $2 set).</li>
            <li>I use this flat iron once when I first wash and dry my hair</li>
            <li>If you have long/thick hair, I would suggest getting an iron with the wider dimension - BaByliss offers various sizes.</li>
            <li>First off, I have very thin, fine, oily and curly hair that I have to wash every day &lt;SIGH&gt;.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t super thin but by no means bulky and it heats up fast.</li>
            <li>I have super curly, thick hair and to be straight, I always need to blow it dry.</li>
            <li>I have primarily used other brand flat irons that are supposed to be designed for specifically for african-american hair, and the results were decent; however when humidity hit, it would do a number on my hair, but not with this flat iron (and there have been some very humid days in my area lately).</li>
            <li>I finally relented and googled ad nauseum for a high end straightener, and finally called our local beauty supply store, which told me that they had the Conair/Babyliss 1 1/2\\&quot; titanium straightener</li>
            <li>I am african-american and wear my hair natural, I do not have a relaxer/perm in my hair, but when I want to straighten it, I flat iron it.</li>
            <li>I have long, thick hair and have tried many different straighteners....</li>
            <li>At first I was worried because my product took a little while to ship, but it came on time.</li>
            <li>I use this one occasionally, but I generally still stick to my Hai.</li>
            <li>In the past I had to blow dry my hair straight first, and then use a flat iron.</li>
            <li>I just let it dry naturally and usually only have to go through each section once.</li>

            <li> I use it at the lowest temp which is 300 degrees which works great for me</li>
            <li> This is a great selection.  </li>

            <li> recommended 100% successful transaction.</li>
            <li> None as Spectacular as THIS one !</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY hair straighteners, but this one is the BEST!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about 2 weeks now, and it makes my hair look so healthy and glossy and straightens perfectly!</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon as always the best pakege best timing and everything</li>
            <li> but with this Iron is easy and results are great!!!</li>
            <li> I have loved this straightener.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve tried my share of hair straighteners, all fairly low-end.  </li>
            <li> -Aveda&#x27;s smooth infusions line is the best straightening products I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> it has always been a strugle, and results were never as good as going to a hair salon to get it done</li>
            <li> and it breaks for good.  </li>
            <li> You know how to make a good straightener that lasts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Excellent quality and good price.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Excellent for Curling the ends Inward / Under ;)&lt;br /&gt;Chicago , Illinois - MAY 01 , 2011</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> i love it!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li> absolutely love this iron!</li>
            <li> this babyliss tatinum is amazing</li>
            <li> It looked amazing</li>
            <li> iron is amazing</li>
            <li> It glides along nicely.</li>
            <li> Really the best product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Figured it was time for me to have my own.</li>
            <li> the plates aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;floating&amp;#34; so it kind of burns your hair and applies the heat</li>
            <li> And even more satisfied with NewvoBeauty!  </li>
            <li> The adjustable temp is great, the plates heat up very quickly, and having the large surface area is great when trying to straighten.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best straightener I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have medium, naturally wavy hair and 375 is the perfect temperature that I set on my babyliss.</li>
            <li> so on, babyliss is by far the BEST straightener i have used.</li>
            <li> and my daughter has very fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I love, love, love it!  </li>
            <li> It is superb, no other word to describe it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very light weight.</li>
            <li> is much better than chi that i had in many years.</li>
            <li> I would suggest using a heat safe product on it, because my hair did start to look burned, but if I used a cooler temp.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this straightener and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> So much better than the Chi.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember how many Chi&#x27;s I have bought and they stop working.</li>
            <li> After a blowdry now, I just use this iron and it works magic.</li>
            <li> but I wanted to finish watching Glee. :-)  </li>
            <li> but the result is shiny, healthy looking hair with a lot of movement.</li>
            <li> So much better than the CHI.</li>
            <li> and i put it on the appropriate setting for my type</li>
            <li> She has voluminous wavy hair and she loves her bayliss as much as i love mine.</li>
            <li> I love the babyliss.</li>
            <li> It also gives me fly-aways that I&#x27;ve never had before which will not cooperate regardless of how many times I straighten them.  </li>
            <li> for a ceramic plate that mentions &amp;#34;floating&amp;#34; plates, you&#x27;ll get better results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever tried; it&#x27;s wwaaayyyyy better than CHI.  </li>
            <li> but it is still a hot tool, so you NEED to protect your hair no matter what!!!</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> For what you&#x27;re getting in this flat iron, it is an excellent deal!</li>
            <li> &quot; and this flat iron is the best I ever had....</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have used a flat iron for almost 10 years, and this babyliss has been the best iron that I have had.</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I have ever had!</li>
            <li> and I think from wear and tear plus my longer hair, it just fizzled out, although to be fair, it never got quite as hot as the BaByliss.     </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and glides through my hair without catching.</li>
            <li> super light, easy to work with, and super great value.</li>
            <li> CHIs are great if your hair is naturally without a lot of body.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have used to rid myself of my lifelong curls.</li>
            <li> on were you grab it, but other than that is a great product!!</li>
            <li> It does also heat up very quickly.</li>
            <li> Heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li> The handle does get pretty warm.</li>
            <li> I have fine and curly hair.</li>
            <li> Super prompt service!  </li>
            <li> Heats up fast, covers more hair and does not pull hair out!</li>
            <li> I just love it, make my job so much easier and faster!!</li>
            <li> You will enjoy.</li>
            <li> I will be attentive to their offerings</li>
            <li> I purchased BabyLiss Pro NaNO Titanium 1 3/4 plate width after reading all reviews available about this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I tried all options of settings of power available up to 450 degrees, it does not do the job it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and it works so well that it is amazing.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT BUY FOR ANY GAL THAT HAS THE SAME HAIR TYPE</li>
            <li> My hair is really smooth and it doesn&#x27;t feel crunchy as it used to.</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t feel like the plates went through my hair as smoothly.</li>
            <li> hair actually turned out straighter than what I&#x27;ve experienced at the salon, and my stylist is a celebrity stylist.</li>
            <li> The Titanium Iron it is an excelen product, it works properly, so far so good</li>
            <li> That leaves my hands right on top of the on/off button.  </li>
            <li> And fast shipping!!!  </li>
            <li> Wow..I am Highly Impressed with this particular Flat Iron..</li>
            <li> This flat iron was an excellent upgrade from my older drugstore-purchased $30 conair.</li>
            <li> An original babyliss.</li>
            <li> but it is worth every dollar!</li>
            <li> but I just couldn&#x27;t get it to mimic the results I had with the original iron</li>
            <li> but I think I&#x27;ll probably purchase the original one again.</li>
            <li> Buena Placha, original, en perfecto estado, bien sellada, enviada en tiempo oportuno,</li>
            <li> I really like how quickly this iron gets hot and it does a good job straightening hair.  </li>
            <li> heats up quick and gets very hot!</li>
            <li> I have middium length thick,wavy hair and wanted to find a very good and decent price flat iron.  </li>
            <li> and I guess I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing because it didn&#x27;t seem to get my hair as straight as I would have liked at first,</li>
            <li> It stays straight for most of the day and leaves my hair looking shiny.</li>
            <li> The 1 1/2 inch model is great for my long hair, but I have tried it on short hair and it is very challenging.</li>
            <li> It has 5 settings with different temperatures - which is AMAZING because I have fine hair</li>
            <li> The ceramic integrated heaters makes it  heat quickly and keep it longer.  </li>
            <li> Es super c&amp;oacute;moda y no pesa mucho.</li>
            <li> I quickly gave the Chi away.</li>
            <li> I have SUPER curly hair</li>
            <li> Still, I have no complaints as the one i received is still pretty light.</li>
            <li> Gets very hot</li>
            <li> I need it to be VERY hot, but still have a type of material that will protect my hair.  </li>
            <li> This thing gets super hot!</li>
            <li> I can turn it down to 150 and it works great for her hair.</li>
            <li> I love this new straightener.</li>
            <li> great product for black hair.</li>
            <li> No complaints about fast and free shipping-</li>
            <li> Straight your hair smoothly</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to use it at the max temperature setting for my hair to be perfectly smooth and straight.</li>
            <li> It has been worth every penny.    </li>
            <li> This one has titanium plates and just glides right through.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> this iron straightens my natural hair making it look as if I have a fresh relaxer,it glides through my hair so easily</li>
            <li> I have had this straightener for a year and a half, given to me as a birthday gift by my sister-in-law who has one herself and loved it.</li>
            <li> It heats up very fast and stays that way.</li>
            <li> - what I found out was that the Chi is pretty much a phoney!</li>
            <li> On top of that, it only had one temp it could be - on or off.</li>
            <li> It gets HOT HOT HOT, though, I run it on 375</li>
            <li> and i finished so fast i was amazed!</li>
            <li> and I bought one for my daughter as well, although it was a bit higher priced model.</li>
            <li> THANKS AGAIN!</li>
            <li> It gets really hot and does not pull your hair.</li>
            <li> and it had started to not get as hot as it used to when I received this one, so</li>
            <li> I used it last week on 340 degrees and had the same great results (still straight).</li>
            <li> and I need a hot iron that straightens my hair without frying it, so</li>
            <li> Feels lighter, the wide plates glide smoothly and the 410 F setting worked fine for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> So glad I purchased this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have had many a Flat Irons in my day but</li>
            <li> So I started reading reviews on the MANY flat irons out there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it would also be better to purchase a flat iron in person.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love you my flat iron!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li> I have long, coarse, kinky hair and this flat iron is fantastic!!!!</li>
            <li> If you have the hair type mentioned in the title, I would not recommend setting the degrees any lower than 340 though, and there&#x27;s really no need to go as high as the 400s, but to each is own.</li>
            <li> : I shopped locally for a good flat iron and called a local salon who recommended BaByliss, being that&#x27;s what they primarily sold.</li>
            <li> i have used many other straighteners like conair, hot tools and</li>
            <li> First - It does NOT pull my hair as others do, The HIGH HEAT makes the Straightening JIFFY &amp; The Hair SUPERBLY STRAIGHT</li>
            <li> Even slept on, my hair is still smooth and straight as a pin when I wake up the next day</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d never seen my hair get so straight so fast.</li>
            <li> It is super-hot and heats up really fast.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> nowww feels like wooooow thanks again</li>
            <li> However, it still doesn&#x27;t look naturally straight afterwards.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t think I received the ultra-thin model at all, mine looks much thicker than what the photo shows.</li>
            <li> but I like it straight.  </li>
            <li> I have very think curly hair</li>
            <li> Thanks to Babyliss and Amazon.</li>
            <li> so you have to be very carefull</li>
            <li> my hair comes out straight and shiny...</li>
            <li> My daughter recommend the babyliss and this really work.  </li>
            <li> I started with the highest setting b/c i have so much hair, but now i use it at 35-40</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this seller and the Babyliss Pro Nano Titanium!</li>
            <li> Actually it looks better than when we had it professionally done.</li>
            <li> I bought this in the hopes that it would be as good as my Hai flat iron, but it seems to be a lot harder on your hair.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> any light  comes through, its not good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;happy iron hunting :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hair product junkie, i have lots and lots of them, from super cheap to super expensive ones and my favorite so far is REDKEN SMOOTH DOWN HEAT GLIDE.</li>
            <li> Absolutely highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> it has high temps.</li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna research a little more</li>
            <li> I highly suggest this iron if you like wearing your natural hair straight.</li>
            <li> , it stays straight and my hair feels soft after using it.</li>
            <li> I ended up with more fluffy and unruly hair after about 20 min of working on it.</li>
            <li> totally new product with all accessories in box.</li>
            <li> Thought it was time for something new and cheaper.</li>
            <li> The flat irons are cool to the touch outside and get my hair as well as my daughters and nieces hair beauty salon straight.</li>
            <li> Im a hairstylist in a very busy hair salon doing a lot of \\&quot;keratine treatments\\</li>
            <li> With the babyliss, it&#x27;s so fast and easy but with other hair products such as suave professionals heat protect,</li>
            <li> my only con would be that the handles can get really hot</li>
            <li> In order to get leverage I hold it as close to the flat iron as possible, which isn&#x27;t very close since it gets very hot.  </li>
            <li> My only concern was that it would stop getting as hot as it could after a year or so of use (like with my Chi), and so far it&#x27;s exactly the same as when I received it.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned and getting it for &lt;$100 seems like a crazy steal.  </li>
            <li> but this is what her local beauty salon uses and is way better than the standard flat iron.</li>
            <li> i have coarse, very thick black hair, this is perfect!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice thus far, setting the heat at 410</li>
            <li> (I have a natural wave).</li>
            <li> and it was still straight the next morning.</li>
            <li> The straight stays until your next wash, too.</li>
            <li> the john freida frizz ease 3-day straight before those other products to help keep my hair straight for days.</li>
            <li> If you want pin straight hair, the Babyliss Pro Nano Titanium flat irons are the way to go.</li>
            <li> After doing significant research online (and deciding I was going to forsake the conventional wisdom that the Chi is the only viable option), I went with the 1 3/4\\&quot; size.  </li>
            <li> but I had to go over sections a couple of times and it didn&#x27;t keep my hair straight for as long.</li>
            <li> Careful it gets really hot.</li>
            <li> I had a CHI 2 inch and 1 inch flat iron and both of them quit on me exactly the same way.</li>
            <li> It never worked correctly and barely got above 258 degrees-despite having a high setting of 358.   </li>
            <li> One thing, the plate is wide, wider than most of the flat irons on the market nowadays, so if you have become accustomed to using 1-inch flat irons, I would recommend purchasing the 1-inch model, especially if your hair is of a shorter length.</li>
            <li> It straightens so quickly, takes me less than 5 minutes to straighten all my hair (and I have a lot of it!).</li>
            <li> when I straighten my hair I like to wear a glove on my left hand (just a cheap plain one from a $2 set).</li>
            <li> I use this flat iron once when I first wash and dry my hair</li>
            <li> If you have long/thick hair, I would suggest getting an iron with the wider dimension - BaByliss offers various sizes.</li>
            <li> First off, I have very thin, fine, oily and curly hair that I have to wash every day &lt;SIGH&gt;.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t super thin but by no means bulky and it heats up fast.</li>
            <li> I have super curly, thick hair and to be straight, I always need to blow it dry.</li>
            <li> I have primarily used other brand flat irons that are supposed to be designed for specifically for african-american hair, and the results were decent; however when humidity hit, it would do a number on my hair, but not with this flat iron (and there have been some very humid days in my area lately).</li>
            <li> I finally relented and googled ad nauseum for a high end straightener, and finally called our local beauty supply store, which told me that they had the Conair/Babyliss 1 1/2\\&quot; titanium straightener</li>
            <li> I am african-american and wear my hair natural, I do not have a relaxer/perm in my hair, but when I want to straighten it, I flat iron it.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and have tried many different straighteners....</li>
            <li> At first I was worried because my product took a little while to ship, but it came on time.</li>
            <li> I use this one occasionally, but I generally still stick to my Hai.</li>
            <li> In the past I had to blow dry my hair straight first, and then use a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I just let it dry naturally and usually only have to go through each section once.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li> No more waiting on school mornings for the iron to be ready to use.</li>
            <li> Finding a flat iron that works well on Black/African-American  hair was a necessity for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Cricket flat iron for about 4 years</li>
            <li> But I did not like the flat iron at all.  </li>
            <li> Pro Titanium Nano Ultra-Thin 1 3/4\\&quot; Straightening Flat Iron]]</li>
            <li> I then use this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have a flat iron</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron based on the reviews that I read on here.  </li>
            <li> And even then the result was kind of dull, dry looking hair that hung down all lumped together and stiff.    </li>
            <li> This product is everything it should be, but if You are not smart enough to use heat treatment on your hair first and you turn the iron on to high, don&#x27;t whine about the product, it is your responsibility to read the directions and use a little common sense.  </li>
            <li> UNLESS SHE HAS A FLAT IRON!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to blow dry my hair (unless I&#x27;m looking for extra volume).</li>
            <li> (Sorry, I DO believe in buying local, but in these times, price wins out for me!)  </li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing the Babyliss Pro Nano Titanium, I had spent a fortune on a Hai flat iron.</li>
            <li> My last straightener, a Conair something or other, broke, and not wanting to spend a lot of money on a replacement, I chose a $15 Remington 1 inch deal.  </li>
            <li> After I blow it dry (always use an ionic dryer)</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and very frizzy!</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve been dyeing it (single process) for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> And unlike with the other straightners, the results last until my next wash (I&#x27;ll typically go for three days just using dry shampoo).  </li>
            <li> went to Amazon, and got it for much less, obviously.  </li>
            <li> and this takes half the time to straighten compared to my Chi flat iron.</li>
            <li> It used to take me an hour and a half to flat iron my hair - this fella (</li>
            <li> I went to Target and spent $130 on a CHI, but after I tried babybliss</li>
            <li> I tried it on my 10 years old daughter&#x27;s hair also who has lot of thick, waivy hair but softer than mine, did not work as I expected it to.  </li>
            <li> I have lots of thick hair - I&#x27;ve just gotten my first keratin treatment, and I needed to seriously upgrade my flat iron technology (the drugstore one I had took forever, was half-broken, and took me forever).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only gotten a few minor snags (a lot less than I used to get my with my Cricket).</li>
            <li> It usually takes 3-4 hours to wash dry and flat iron her hair which we do every 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Hair look dull and seems like I have lots of split ends, no expected shine and slickenss.</li>
            <li> so I started looking into straighteners OTHER than Chi</li>
            <li> It retails for over $130 at other places.</li>
            <li> With other straighteners I&#x27;ve used (cheapest one at the store), my hair would practically start curling at the ends w/in the hour.</li>
            <li> The button is also extremely touchy so the slightest pressure and it turns off.    </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even need to section the hair in super small sections, I would say section it at least 1/2 inch thick or a little less.....</li>
            <li> I finish my hair in half the time as I would with other straighteners.</li>
            <li> The price through this seller was also significantly less than what I would have paid through Folica.com and other sellers.</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy-thick and it&#x27;s hard to make straighten with a regular straightener.</li>
            <li> It might work for someone who doesn&#x27;t have as thick and coarse hair as I do.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, frizzy, curly/wavy, and EXTREMELY thick hair.  </li>
            <li> The coating wore off the last cheap flat iron that I purchased and without it, it pulled my hair terribly.</li>
            <li> well Chis need to go half price</li>
            <li> gets it done in about half an hour, and I&#x27;m getting faster all the time.</li>
            <li> It took me up to an hour and half to get it the way I like it.  </li>
            <li> Bought this iron because of price and previous reviews.</li>
            <li> and it takes me half the time to do my hair now.</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED A 1\\&quot; FOR HER PREVIOUSLY</li>
            <li> and it takes less than 10 min.</li>
            <li> I figured it would be less bulky</li>
            <li> I was done in a little less than an hour (with one pass down the hair).</li>
            <li> Like I said, y&#x27;all, I have a TON of hair, and I need something that doesn&#x27;t mess around.     </li>
            <li> even hair that is both thick and long.</li>
            <li> FOR MY GIRL HER HAIR IS THICK CURLY LONG AND JUST UNMANAGABLE</li>
            <li> I have long and thick curly hair and ironing</li>
            <li> So I saw these around at salons and for a little cheaper than a chi...</li>
            <li> With the babyliss, I put it on the highest heat setting and can straighten it after it&#x27;s air dried (curly mess).</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and a lot of it - a double whammy!</li>
            <li> My daughter has waist length, very thick, mixed race hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick and coarse hair</li>
            <li> and I had already prepped my hair with coconut oil and argan oil (and blow dried with heat protectant--please do not forget), and that was that.</li>
            <li> It did straigten but hair seemed stiff.   </li>
            <li> I was thinking of getting an expensive keratin treatment, but now I don&#x27;t think I need it :O)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also growing it out and am a couple inches past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I usually keep it around the 375 mark.</li>
            <li> We did it in under 3 hours this week and it is straighter and smoother than usual.  </li>
            <li> (I cranked it past 400 the first time and promptly burned the crap out of myself like 3 times), and it seriously takes care of business.      </li>
            <li> I have had lots of problems with the chi of late.</li>
            <li> It use to take me at least 30 min to straighten my hair</li>
            <li> and I would have to go over it at least 4 or 5 times</li>
            <li> i purchased the babyliss pro nano titanium for my sister, and she has not any negative comment about this product.</li>
            <li> I bump the button and turn it off at least 10 times every time I straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> &quot; is slightly misleading as the iron is closer to 2\\&quot; wide, so getting my medium-length hair to curl or wave is practically impossible.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair that actually doesn&#x27;t look bad when I just wash and go (sort of a funky look)</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick curly/wavy.</li>
            <li> i recommend the BabylissPro Ultra Thin 3/4</li>
            <li> frizz ease secret weapon, and giovanni frizz control</li>
            <li> WRONG move.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> I know it expensive</li>
            <li> About 3 weeks into using this something went wrong with the circuitry</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;d never heard of anything like that happening in the hundreds of reviews I&#x27;d read, I know something must have gone wrong w/ my unit.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the 1\\&quot; unit did not work as well as this one.</li>
            <li> I am VERY shocked that no one else has mentioned how incredibly difficult it is to actually keep this stupid thing turned on while using it!  </li>
            <li> I was very angry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY frustrating!  </li>
            <li> She used Chi&#x27;s all her life and jsut hated having to straiten her hair all the time.  </li>
            <li> To sum it up this is the worst straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve used. I have very thick curly hair and this takes half the time to straighten compared to my Chi flat iron. Heats up fast, covers more hair and does not pull hair out! Extremely happy with my purchase and this is a great value.</li>
            <li> This product is an excellent buy. The flat irons are cool to the touch outside and get my hair as well as my daughters and nieces hair beauty salon straight. even hair that is both thick and long. I have this item as a must when I travel. You will enjoy.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of FHI and Sedu irons but I must say this Babyliss iron is one of the best I have tried, better than my FHI. this iron straightens my natural hair making it look as if I have a fresh relaxer,it glides through my hair so easily and it does not burn. I just ordered the 1 1/4 size so that I can have a smaller size to use if I want. I highly suggest this iron if you like wearing your natural hair straight.</li>
            <li> If you want pin straight hair, the Babyliss Pro Nano Titanium flat irons are the way to go. Finding a flat iron that works well on Black/African-American  hair was a necessity for me. I had a hair dresser use one on me and I&#x27;d never seen my hair get so straight so fast. Keeps the shine too. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> super light, easy to work with, and super great value. i would by the travel size to use after my work out. is much better than chi that i had in many years.</li>
            <li> I have loved this straightener. I like that I can adjust the temp so it can be used by all the girls in my family. I have very coarse hair and my daughter has very fine hair.  I can turn it down to 150 and it works great for her hair. I turn mine up to 375-400 and it is beautiful. I would suggest using a heat safe product on it, because my hair did start to look burned, but if I used a cooler temp., it did not straighten as well. Great price!</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and a lot of it - a double whammy! I&#x27;m also growing it out and am a couple inches past my shoulders. I have been using a Cricket flat iron for about 4 years and I think from wear and tear plus my longer hair, it just fizzled out, although to be fair, it never got quite as hot as the BaByliss.     I&#x27;ve used it twice thus far, setting the heat at 410 (this iron goes up to 450). A couple swipes on each section of hair and it&#x27;s done. It glides along nicely. I&#x27;ve only gotten a few minor snags (a lot less than I used to get my with my Cricket). Even slept on, my hair is still smooth and straight as a pin when I wake up the next day (I have a natural wave). If you have long/thick hair, I would suggest getting an iron with the wider dimension - BaByliss offers various sizes. In 10 minutes, I&#x27;m done. It does also heat up very quickly. Like the instructions say, don&#x27;t test the heat with your hand - you will get burned!     I am giving this a 5 star rating because of how well it works, but there are a couple of things to beware of:    The handle does get pretty warm. It&#x27;s tolerable, but don&#x27;t expect to feel no heat on the handle. I would also start with a lower heat setting and see how it does. I&#x27;m actually thinking of going to the next lowest heat to see how well it works so I don&#x27;t unintentionally burn my hair.     My last tip is about the price: I shopped locally for a good flat iron and called a local salon who recommended BaByliss, being that&#x27;s what they primarily sold. Their price was around $140, compared to the $87.90 price tag here on Amazon. For what you&#x27;re getting in this flat iron, it is an excellent deal!</li>
            <li> This is a great straightner. Both my daughter and I use this product. I have yet to get it past the first setting. It is super-hot and heats up really fast. No more waiting on school mornings for the iron to be ready to use.</li>
            <li> I want to thank you for providing a quality product at excellent prices, the shipment arrived at the estimated time. I&#x27;m happy to buy it. I will be attentive to their offerings</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter who has a lot of hair, she loves it. She straightened her hair that night and it was still straight the next morning. This product is everything it should be, but if You are not smart enough to use heat treatment on your hair first and you turn the iron on to high, don&#x27;t whine about the product, it is your responsibility to read the directions and use a little common sense.  I would definitely recommend this product, my daughter couldn&#x27;t be happier. It made me the worlds best dad.</li>
            <li> Excelente producto, excelente atención me encanta, ahora en tan solo minutos evito gastar tiempo en peluquerias y dinero, es muy sencillo de usar y practico, para la mujer pos moderna WAOOOOOOOOO facilita tu vida.</li>
            <li> I had a Chi for almost a year and then it broke... it just wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I was very angry so I started looking into straighteners OTHER than Chi - what I found out was that the Chi is pretty much a phoney! They claim to be ceramic when in reality they are METAL with just a ceramic coating! On top of that, it only had one temp it could be - on or off. So I went to a beauty supply store and they told me about the Babyliss. I got to play around with it, feel the titanium/ceramic plates, and see how it worked. It has 5 settings with different temperatures - which is AMAZING because I have fine hair so I do NOT need it at the 450 degrees that the Chi would do. Though it IS an option on the babyliss... I usually keep it around the 375 mark. I LOVE this straightener and would recommend it to anyone. I&#x27;ve already told all three of my sisters about it.</li>
            <li> Very Good!! recommended 100% successful transaction. totally new product with all accessories in box. purchased for use in Venezuela. thanks</li>
            <li> My wife had the curliest of curls in her hair from birth.  She used Chi&#x27;s all her life and jsut hated having to straiten her hair all the time.  So I saw these around at salons and for a little cheaper than a chi... well Chis need to go half price this is the best staightener that my wife has ever seen or used, so good my mother bought one and my friends wife did too!!</li>
            <li> I have had lots of problems with the chi of late. I love this new straightener.</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon as always the best pakege best timing and everything this babyliss tatinum is amazing my hair is like jinnefer anniston nowww feels like wooooow thanks again</li>
            <li> So much better than the Chi. I can&#x27;t remember how many Chi&#x27;s I have bought and they stop working. This one is great and goes the distance. Careful it gets really hot. My hairdresser suggested I not use lower heat levels to not burn my hair. This is the best.</li>
            <li> I really like how quickly this iron gets hot and it does a good job straightening hair.  However 1 1/2\\&quot; is slightly misleading as the iron is closer to 2\\&quot; wide, so getting my medium-length hair to curl or wave is practically impossible.</li>
            <li> I have super curly, thick hair and to be straight, I always need to blow it dry. However, it still doesn&#x27;t look naturally straight afterwards. After a blowdry now, I just use this iron and it works magic. Really the best product I have ever used. I was thinking of getting an expensive keratin treatment, but now I don&#x27;t think I need it :O)</li>
            <li> esta plancha es lo mejor que ha llegado a mis manos, es rapida, efectiva; ya no paso trabajo al secar mi cabello como me sucedia con mi secador puesto que soy de abundante cabello, grueso y muy rizado; ahora no hago la mas mínima fuerza. Recomiendo no pegarlo al cuero cabelludo porque se quemarán como me sucedió a mi, pero ya soy una experta porque su uso es muy sencillo</li>
            <li> The Titanium Iron it is an excelen product, it works properly, so far so good i recommend the BabylissPro Ultra Thin 3/4</li>
            <li> I have lots of thick hair - I&#x27;ve just gotten my first keratin treatment, and I needed to seriously upgrade my flat iron technology (the drugstore one I had took forever, was half-broken, and took me forever).  After doing significant research online (and deciding I was going to forsake the conventional wisdom that the Chi is the only viable option), I went with the 1 3/4\\&quot; size.  Like I said, y&#x27;all, I have a TON of hair, and I need something that doesn&#x27;t mess around.     This flat iron is fantastic.  It used to take me an hour and a half to flat iron my hair - this fella (and probably the keratin treatment helps too) gets it done in about half an hour, and I&#x27;m getting faster all the time. It gets HOT HOT HOT, though, I run it on 375 but it goes to 450 (I cranked it past 400 the first time and promptly burned the crap out of myself like 3 times), and it seriously takes care of business.      Absolutely highly recommend.  This is by far the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned and getting it for &lt;$100 seems like a crazy steal.  I love you my flat iron!</li>
            <li> Im a hairstylist in a very busy hair salon doing a lot of \\&quot;keratine treatments\\&quot; and this flat iron is the best I ever had....I just love it, make my job so much easier and faster!!</li>
            <li> This flat iron was an excellent upgrade from my older drugstore-purchased $30 conair. Feels lighter, the wide plates glide smoothly and the 410 F setting worked fine for my hair type. But I don&#x27;t think I received the ultra-thin model at all, mine looks much thicker than what the photo shows. Maybe a mix-up in pictures? I didn&#x27;t even find an ultra-thin version of the 1 and 3/4 on the babyliss site. Still, I have no complaints as the one i received is still pretty light. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased BabyLiss Pro NaNO Titanium 1 3/4 plate width after reading all reviews available about this product on Amazon. I have middium length thick,wavy hair and wanted to find a very good and decent price flat iron.  No complaints about fast and free shipping- good job Amazon! But I did not like the flat iron at all.  I tried it on my 10 years old daughter&#x27;s hair also who has lot of thick, waivy hair but softer than mine, did not work as I expected it to.  I tried all options of settings of power available up to 450 degrees, it does not do the job it is supposed to. I ended up with more fluffy and unruly hair after about 20 min of working on it. Hair look dull and seems like I have lots of split ends, no expected shine and slickenss. I am shipping it back on Monday.

            <li> COMPRE EL PRODUCTO PARA REGALO DE CUMPLEAÑOS A MI ESPOSA Y ESTA MUY FELIZ YA QUE EL MISMO CUMPLE CON TODAS SUS ESPECIFICACIONES, ES POR ELLO QUE ESTOY MUY CONTENTO Y RECOMIENDO ESTE ARTICULO...</li>
            <li> Very impressed. Gets very hot so the ability to adjust heat is great. Works as well as the Chi but need to adjust to the size.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve tried my share of hair straighteners, all fairly low-end.  I have thick, wavy hair that actually doesn&#x27;t look bad when I just wash and go (sort of a funky look) but I like it straight.  My last straightener, a Conair something or other, broke, and not wanting to spend a lot of money on a replacement, I chose a $15 Remington 1 inch deal.  WRONG move.  It took me up to an hour and half to get it the way I like it.  Exactly enough time to watch one Lifetime movie, ha ha.  I finally relented and googled ad nauseum for a high end straightener, and finally called our local beauty supply store, which told me that they had the Conair/Babyliss 1 1/2\\&quot; titanium straightener - she said it was one of the very best - for between $120-$140.  I said thank you, hung up, went to Amazon, and got it for much less, obviously.  (Sorry, I DO believe in buying local, but in these times, price wins out for me!)  It is superb, no other word to describe it.  I could&#x27;ve been done in 15 minutes but I wanted to finish watching Glee. :-)  One of the best investments I&#x27;ve ever made.  Oh, and it has a 4-year warranty.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> this is a great product,amazon wasgreat no time issues, and the product was on exellent conditions no problems with it</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  My daughter has waist length, very thick, mixed race hair.  It usually takes 3-4 hours to wash dry and flat iron her hair which we do every 2 weeks.  We did it in under 3 hours this week and it is straighter and smoother than usual.  Actually it looks better than when we had it professionally done.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best straightener I have ever used. My roommate brought it home one day as a perk of her job (at Brides magazine) and I&#x27;ve been borrowing it ever since. Figured it was time for me to have my own. So happy I got it for $89 here. It retails for over $130 at other places. I went to Target and spent $130 on a CHI, but after I tried babybliss my CHI went un-used. CHIs are great if your hair is naturally without a lot of body. And hasn&#x27;t been processed with dye, etc.    My hair is very thick curly/wavy. And I&#x27;ve been dyeing it (single process) for over 10 years. In the past I had to blow dry my hair straight first, and then use a flat iron. And even then the result was kind of dull, dry looking hair that hung down all lumped together and stiff.    With the babyliss, I put it on the highest heat setting and can straighten it after it&#x27;s air dried (curly mess). Not only that but the result is shiny, healthy looking hair with a lot of movement. A friend was visiting me recently and could not believe the difference in the before and after...not only that but it only took b/n 10 and 15 minutes.    I&#x27;m not kidding when I say that babybliss changed my hair styling life. And improved the look of my hair X 10.</li>
            <li> I bought mine from \\&quot;NewvoBeauty\\&quot; here on amazon.com.  I am very satisfied with the product!!  And even more satisfied with NewvoBeauty!  Super prompt service!  Excellent customer care!  And fast shipping!!!  They are awesome!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this iron because of price and previous reviews. I had a CHI 2 inch and 1 inch flat iron and both of them quit on me exactly the same way. Thought it was time for something new and cheaper. So glad I purchased this flat iron. So much better than the CHI. It heats up very fast and stays that way. It&#x27;s also very light weight. I have very thick and coarse hair and it takes me half the time to do my hair now. Love it!</li>
            <li> At first I was worried because my product took a little while to ship, but it came on time. I have very think curly hair and i put it on the appropriate setting for my type and i finished my hair in record time! It looked amazing and i finished so fast i was amazed!</li>
            <li> Exceeded my expectations.Its the best hair straightener I have ever used. I bought a CHI before this one. It might work for someone who doesn&#x27;t have as thick and coarse hair as I do.It doesn&#x27;t have heat settings like Babyliss.Thanks to Babyliss and Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, frizzy, curly/wavy, and EXTREMELY thick hair.  This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever tried; it&#x27;s wwaaayyyyy better than CHI.  (Think about it, CHI heats up to only 395 while this puppy is adjustable up to 450).  The adjustable temp is great, the plates heat up very quickly, and having the large surface area is great when trying to straighten.  I finish my hair in half the time as I would with other straighteners. And unlike with the other straightners, the results last until my next wash (I&#x27;ll typically go for three days just using dry shampoo).  Additionally, this product is so durable!  I have had it for years, traveled with it, dropped it countless times, and it still works as well as it did on day one.  It has been worth every penny.    Some tricks/additional recommendations:  -I&#x27;m right-handed, so when I straighten my hair I like to wear a glove on my left hand (just a cheap plain one from a $2 set). It prevents me burning my hands on the outsides of the plates or on the hair that&#x27;s made recent contact with the plates.    -Aveda&#x27;s smooth infusions line is the best straightening products I&#x27;ve found.  I use both the style prep smoother and glossing straightener, putting both products on my damp hair before blow drying.  Both of these act as heat protectants so no additional products need to be used after blow drying/before straightening.  The glossing straightener, while weightless, provides plenty of hold and with this iron I can get my hair stick-straight, no gel or hairspray needed.</li>
            <li> I have fine and curly hair. After I blow it dry (always use an ionic dryer) I then use this flat iron. It heats up fast and it works so well that it is amazing. I am very happy with it and I bought one for my daughter as well, although it was a bit higher priced model. She has voluminous wavy hair and she loves her bayliss as much as i love mine. This is the best product I have used to rid myself of my lifelong curls. I love it!</li>
            <li> Wow..I am Highly Impressed with this particular Flat Iron..I have had many a Flat Irons in my day but None as Spectacular as THIS one ! First - It does NOT pull my hair as others do, The HIGH HEAT makes the Straightening JIFFY &amp; The Hair SUPERBLY STRAIGHT &amp; I am PROUD to Recommend this Item to ANYONE who wishes to have THAT Flawless PERFECT Hairstyle !!!! Excellent for Curling the ends Inward / Under ;)&lt;br /&gt;Chicago , Illinois - MAY 01 , 2011 THANK U Amazon &amp; Thk U Babyliss !!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> An original babyliss. Works great. Straight your hair smoothly and it doesn&#x27;t pull it. The ceramic integrated heaters makes it  heat quickly and keep it longer.  Beautiful color, which I will say it is unisex.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and very frizzy! It use to take me at least 30 min to straighten my hair and I would have to go over it at least 4 or 5 times and then I would walk outside and it would become a big frizz ball because of the humidy. I know take only 15 min to straighten my hair and have not had one problem with frizz. I love it! I know it expensive but it is worth every dollar!</li>
            <li> excelente vendedor, cumplio con los tiempos establecidos y el porducto se llego a su destino en perfectas condiciones, recomendado 100%</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my Wife. She LOVES it. I dont know anything about this but this is what her local beauty salon uses and is way better than the standard flat iron.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY GIRL HER HAIR IS THICK CURLY LONG AND JUST UNMANAGABLE UNLESS SHE HAS A FLAT IRON! I PURCHASED A 1\\&quot; FOR HER PREVIOUSLY WHICH TOOK FOREVER TO STRAIGHTEN HER HAIR. THE BABYLISS PRO WIDTH &amp; TEMP SETTINGS ARE PERFECT! WHAT USED TO TAKE CLOSE TO AN HOUR, NOW TAKES MINUTES. THIS IS A GREAT BUY FOR ANY GAL THAT HAS THE SAME HAIR TYPE THANKS AGAIN!</li>
            <li> I have long and thick curly hair and ironing it has always been a strugle, and results were never as good as going to a hair salon to get it done but with this Iron is easy and results are great!!! and it lasts forever... my only con would be that the handles can get really hot so you have to be very carefull on were you grab it, but other than that is a great product!!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely happy with my purchase! Best flat iron I have ever had! My hair is really smooth and it doesn&#x27;t feel crunchy as it used to.</li>
            <li> i purchased the babyliss pro nano titanium for my sister, and she has not any negative comment about this product. excellent, great price.</li>
            <li> i have coarse, very thick black hair, this is perfect!!! it has high temps. that i NEED to straighten my hair!!!! i  use FC hair straighten serum for heat protanct. my hair comes out straight and shiny...great product for black hair.</li>
            <li> I love the babyliss. I have a flat iron but I wasn&#x27;t happy with the results. My daughter recommend the babyliss and this really work.  English is my second language and I apologize for my writting.   Esta plancha es extraordinaria. Deja tu pelo liso y brillante. La uso en mi pelo antes de secarse completamente, es decir, no uso el secador. El titanio protege mi pelo. Preferi este modelo de 1 3/4\\&quot; porque mi pelo es largo y abundante. Recomiendo esta plancha ciento por ciento.</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY hair straighteners, but this one is the BEST!!!  Even my hair stylist noticed the difference in the texture of my hair!  THe best purchase I ever made!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron! I&#x27;ve used it for about 2 weeks now, and it makes my hair look so healthy and glossy and straightens perfectly! It keeps movement in my hair without it looking like straw. I have medium, naturally wavy hair and 375 is the perfect temperature that I set on my babyliss. It only takes a couple of swipes through each section of hair. The coating wore off the last cheap flat iron that I purchased and without it, it pulled my hair terribly. This one has titanium plates and just glides right through. Heats up very quickly. I would recommend using a heat protectant with it as well; I like Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful flat iron. I am african-american and wear my hair natural, I do not have a relaxer/perm in my hair, but when I want to straighten it, I flat iron it. I have primarily used other brand flat irons that are supposed to be designed for specifically for african-american hair, and the results were decent; however when humidity hit, it would do a number on my hair, but not with this flat iron (and there have been some very humid days in my area lately). I use this flat iron once when I first wash and dry my hair and that&#x27;s it, it stays straight and my hair feels soft after using it. I definitely recommend this flat iron. One thing, the plate is wide, wider than most of the flat irons on the market nowadays, so if you have become accustomed to using 1-inch flat irons, I would recommend purchasing the 1-inch model, especially if your hair is of a shorter length.</li>
            <li> Muy buen producto Muy útil. Fácil de utilizar y portátil, se puede llevar de viaje a todas partes porque no ocupa mucho espacio</li>
            <li> I have used a flat iron for almost 10 years, and this babyliss has been the best iron that I have had.</li>
            <li> i have used many other straighteners like conair, hot tools and so on, babyliss is by far the BEST straightener i have used. heats up quick and gets very hot! i love it! highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Recomiendo este producto 100%. Es genial y el acabado del cabello es excelente. Es super c&amp;oacute;moda y no pesa mucho.</li>
            <li> This is the best straightener I have had. It gets really hot and does not pull your hair. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> First off, I have very thin, fine, oily and curly hair that I have to wash every day &lt;SIGH&gt;. With other straighteners I&#x27;ve used (cheapest one at the store), my hair would practically start curling at the ends w/in the hour. So I started reading reviews on the MANY flat irons out there. I tried a chi but it didn&#x27;t have temp control (set at ~425 degrees I think) and that was literally burning my hair. It did straigten but hair seemed stiff.   So after reading the wonderful reviews on this, I purchased it through Amazon and I love it! I don&#x27;t even have to blow dry my hair (unless I&#x27;m looking for extra volume). I just let it dry naturally and usually only have to go through each section once. I use it at the lowest temp which is 300 degrees which works great for me and it takes less than 10 min. It stays straight for most of the day and leaves my hair looking shiny. This isn&#x27;t super thin but by no means bulky and it heats up fast. I&#x27;m so relieved to finally find something that works well for my hair!  *** UPDATE***:   About 3 weeks into using this something went wrong with the circuitry and it literally burned off a chunk of hair! Since I&#x27;d never heard of anything like that happening in the hundreds of reviews I&#x27;d read, I know something must have gone wrong w/ my unit. So I returned it with no problems.   Now instead of ordering the same thing again, I decided to get the 1\\&quot; unit (BaByliss Pro BABNT3072 Nano Titanium-Plated Ultra-Thin Straightening Iron, 1 Inch) instead b/c I figured it would be less bulky and I could use it as a curler too. Unfortunately, the 1\\&quot; unit did not work as well as this one. It straightened my hair but I had to go over sections a couple of times and it didn&#x27;t keep my hair straight for as long. It also didn&#x27;t feel like the plates went through my hair as smoothly. I don&#x27;t know if I didn&#x27;t adjust the temp right but I just couldn&#x27;t get it to mimic the results I had with the original iron so I returned that one too.   I&#x27;m gonna research a little more but I think I&#x27;ll probably purchase the original one again. Hopefully my incident was just a fluke.</li>
            <li> This is a great selection.  I have long, thick hair and have tried many different straighteners....none can compare.  I love, love, love it!  Great price too!</li>
            <li> I have long, coarse, kinky hair and this flat iron is fantastic!!!! I started with the highest setting b/c i have so much hair, but now i use it at 35-40 and i get the same results.&lt;br /&gt;This iron is amazing but it is still a hot tool, so you NEED to protect your hair no matter what!!! I&#x27;m a hair product junkie, i have lots and lots of them, from super cheap to super expensive ones and my favorite so far is REDKEN SMOOTH DOWN HEAT GLIDE.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron based on the reviews that I read on here.  I am VERY shocked that no one else has mentioned how incredibly difficult it is to actually keep this stupid thing turned on while using it!  In order to get leverage I hold it as close to the flat iron as possible, which isn&#x27;t very close since it gets very hot.  That leaves my hands right on top of the on/off button.  Regardless of which way I hold it I bump the button and turn it off at least 10 times every time I straighten my hair.  It&#x27;s VERY frustrating!  The button is also extremely touchy so the slightest pressure and it turns off.    It also gives me fly-aways that I&#x27;ve never had before which will not cooperate regardless of how many times I straighten them.  To sum it up this is the worst straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned and I loathe using it, but for what I paid for it I guess I&#x27;ll suffer through it until I drop it and it breaks for good.  (I actually look forward to that day!)</li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing the Babyliss Pro Nano Titanium, I had spent a fortune on a Hai flat iron. It never worked correctly and barely got above 258 degrees-despite having a high setting of 358.   The Babyliss Pro irons like a dream. I don&#x27;t even have to use it at the max temperature setting for my hair to be perfectly smooth and straight. It heats up quickly and glides through my hair without catching. I LOVE it!  One thing to consider however is the width of this iron. The 1 1/2 inch model is great for my long hair, but I have tried it on short hair and it is very challenging. I would recommend the 1\\&quot; if you will be using it on shorter length hair.   The price through this seller was also significantly less than what I would have paid through Folica.com and other sellers. I would highly recommend this seller and the Babyliss Pro Nano Titanium!</li>
            <li> Hello world!&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this iron! My hair is wavy-thick and it&#x27;s hard to make straighten with a regular straightener. With the babyliss, it&#x27;s so fast and easy but with other hair products such as suave professionals heat protect, frizz ease secret weapon, and giovanni frizz control and sometimes when my hair is damp, I spray the john freida frizz ease 3-day straight before those other products to help keep my hair straight for days.</li>
            <li> I have had this straightener for a year and a half, given to me as a birthday gift by my sister-in-law who has one herself and loved it. I had the blue 1\\&quot; Chi before this one and it had started to not get as hot as it used to when I received this one, so I quickly gave the Chi away. This thing gets super hot! It straightens so quickly, takes me less than 5 minutes to straighten all my hair (and I have a lot of it!). The straight stays until your next wash, too. My only concern was that it would stop getting as hot as it could after a year or so of use (like with my Chi), and so far it&#x27;s exactly the same as when I received it.  So here&#x27;s to you, Babybliss! You know how to make a good straightener that lasts.</li>
            <li> I bought this in 2011 and I guess I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing because it didn&#x27;t seem to get my hair as straight as I would have liked at first, but after I got the hang of it........OMG! I am never getting my hair straightened at a salon ever again, there&#x27;s just no need. I put it on 375 degrees and I had already prepped my hair with coconut oil and argan oil (and blow dried with heat protectant--please do not forget), and that was that. I didn&#x27;t even need to section the hair in super small sections, I would say section it at least 1/2 inch thick or a little less.....I was done in a little less than an hour (with one pass down the hair). It lasted for about a month with proper care. Prior to using this it would have taken me almost 2 hrs (I have LOTS of hair), and it wouldn&#x27;t have been as straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair actually turned out straighter than what I&#x27;ve experienced at the salon, and my stylist is a celebrity stylist. I used it last week on 340 degrees and had the same great results (still straight). If you have the hair type mentioned in the title, I would not recommend setting the degrees any lower than 340 though, and there&#x27;s really no need to go as high as the 400s, but to each is own.</li>
            <li> the plates aren&#x27;t &amp;#34;floating&amp;#34; so it kind of burns your hair and applies the heat unevenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;look for a ceramic plate that mentions &amp;#34;floating&amp;#34; plates, you&#x27;ll get better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it would also be better to purchase a flat iron in person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;take the iron out of the box and press the plates together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hold it up to the light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if any light  comes through, its not good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;happy iron hunting :)</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product, my wife is fully satisfied, is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made​​.&lt;br /&gt;100% recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent quality and good price.</li>
            <li> Excellent piece, very good quality works perfect one of improves them of the series, 100% recommended, does not have comparison. ccs-vzla</li>
            <li> Excelente quede complacido con el producto, proximamente espero poder seguir realizando compras de este estilo, gracias por todo, Feliz Año</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;caracas Venezuela excelente servicio lo descrito por el vendedor lo recomiendo cien por ciento justo el producto q necesitaba Gracias&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Buena Placha, original, en perfecto estado, bien sellada, enviada en tiempo oportuno, de la grande, muy buena la recomiendo, es excelente</li>
            <li> I bought this in the hopes that it would be as good as my Hai flat iron, but it seems to be a lot harder on your hair.  I have SUPER curly hair and I need a hot iron that straightens my hair without frying it, so I need it to be VERY hot, but still have a type of material that will protect my hair.  I use this one occasionally, but I generally still stick to my Hai.</li>
