            <li>It leaves me with a nice smooth hair cut.</li>
            <li>It could be better but is still pretty good.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s kind of fun</li>
            <li>You can easily 00 gap these blades.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m a barber and thrilled to see Amazon has this available at such a good price.</li>
            <li>They work just fine.</li>
            <li>This blade set was easy to install (I had to reuse the two original screws) and easy to adjust.  </li>

            <li>Awesome product for the price my Fades are extra clean now much needed</li>
            <li>I bought these blades to replace the original set on my Wahl Clip and Trim clippers.  </li>
            <li>The clippers had been drooped and the original blade damaged.  </li>
            <li>Replaced my original blade for this blade.  </li>
            <li>you get a clean cut.</li>
            <li>A good way to improve the potential of a cheap pair of clippers.</li>
            <li>Any professional clipper needs a low profile blade to fade perfectly</li>
            <li>Blades fit my super tapper clipper.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>Luckily I still had the original screws.</li>
            <li>All my factory blade guards don&#x27;t fit as snug so the problem isn&#x27;t with one blade guard but the replacement blade itself.&lt;br /&gt;The screws that came with the blade set weren&#x27;t the right size.</li>
            <li>They trim hair more easily and quickly than the old blades.</li>
            <li>Clippers cut better than new now.</li>
            <li>Better than buying a new clipper set...</li>
            <li>Very nice...thank you!!</li>
            <li>Great clippers and this replacement blade brought it back to like new performance.</li>
            <li>Easy to replace, fast shipping, and back to shaving my own head.</li>
            <li>While these blades are marked as being Wahl&#x27;s &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; blades, and the originals were stamped &amp;#34;premium,&amp;#34; these blades are better.  </li>
            <li>These were easy to install and it cuts like new.</li>
            <li>The main replacement blade, which is held in place with two Torx 20 screws is identical to the original blade.</li>
            <li>So far these blades are working just fine.</li>
            <li>Worked just as good as the original blades if not better!</li>
            <li>I actually think they are a lot better then</li>
            <li>/&gt;Comparing my fastfeeds ($50) set of clippers to a wahl $20 with a $10 blade on, i actually like the wahl combo a lot more.</li>
            <li>So make sure to save and REUSE your old screws with the new blades.</li>
            <li>The title pretty much sums it up</li>
            <li>long as your Wahl is USA made, and has two screws in the blade head, then these should be okay.</li>
            <li>with easy to follow instructions and extra screws&lt;</li>
            <li>The item purchased has met all my expectations, and I would gladly purchase this item again in the very near future.</li>
            <li>This blade works very well.</li>
            <li>Fades are so much smoother and easier to blend, cuts so much easier.</li>
            <li>Fits my clippers great but the size of the blade is a tiny bit smaller than the original causing the blade guards to not clip on as tight.</li>
            <li>The magnetic motors in the cheap clippers move the blade very fast, paired with a sharp blade</li>
            <li>after I received and installed this new blade, it turned my clipper brand new and even sharper than when it was first purchased.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the only thing that did not fit was the bolts that came with the blades.other than that good buy.</li>
            <li>The smaller driven replacement blade (it is larger than the original) just needs a little more space to be able to move left and right to cut hair properly, since it is slightly wider than the original blade.</li>
            <li>I was able to assemble the blade, but it would not fit inside the tool.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the cost, as opposed to buying an entire new clipper</li>
            <li>I had ordered a new clipper but after checking the review of this blade, I cancelled my order&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>fades with regular blade first then upgrade to this one.</li>
            <li>The smaller blade replacement (which is driven off the tool&#x27;s motor) is very different to the original blade.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well for grooming my Standard Poodle.</li>
            <li>However, it is far from rocket science.</li>
            <li>and this is what this blade does for Wahl professional clippers.</li>
            <li>The Gist of it: This replacement blade set (2-hole) revitalized my Wahl adjustable clippers purchased at a certain big chain box store back in 2000.</li>
            <li>extra screws did not fit my shaver, even so the package said it fit my shaver</li>
            <li>I bought it to work with the Wahl Icon Professional clipper and it allows this clipper to work to its potential.</li>
            <li>Used these blades to replace my old dull ones on my Wahl Super Taper clipper.</li>
            <li>fast delivery was here before due date thank you again</li>
            <li>I did however used my older screws because the ones that came with theses weren&#x27;t wide</li>
            <li>Well worth the money, be careful they come very sharp and pointy.</li>
            <li>The original blade worked well for a few years, but after giving a new summer hair style to one of the cats, it dulled the blade and this year it was painfully slow to trim the cat&#x27;s hair again.</li>

            <li> , it&#x27;s from the manufacture who built the trimmer, seems well-made and very sharp.</li>
            <li> Very sharp.</li>
            <li> I cut my hair at least twice a month, so I look forward to seeing how long the blades maintain their edge.</li>
            <li> My trusty Wahl was getting a little slow.</li>

            <li> ...if these last as long as the originals.... i&#x27;ll be dead before I need another replacement.</li>
            <li> I have a set of Wahl clippers that I use to buzz my own hair. Great clippers and this replacement blade brought it back to like new performance.</li>
            <li> Used these blades to replace my old dull ones on my Wahl Super Taper clipper. They trim hair more easily and quickly than the old blades. However, as others have mentioned, the screws that come with the blades are the wrong size (too narrow and therefore fall out of the holes). So make sure to save and REUSE your old screws with the new blades.</li>
            <li> Awesome product for the price my Fades are extra clean now much needed but they are very sharp when zero gapped so I advise for beginners to practice fades with regular blade first then upgrade to this one.</li>
            <li> Great purchase. Well worth the money, be careful they come very sharp and pointy.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before.  You can easily 00 gap these blades.  I use them with my Taper 2000 to blend in my bald fades.  I use a set of trimmers adjusted to cut a step below a razor blade to cut the sides when fading.  These blades are the only blades I have used that can completely remove the line from my razor sharp trimmers when I am cutting a bald fade.</li>
            <li> The blade on my cheaper set of wahl clippers became dull ( the precision marked ones), so I decided to replace them with the ones found on the wahl seniors. Comes with oil, screws and two well lubed blades (stationary blade, and moving blade). I did however used my older screws because the ones that came with theses weren&#x27;t wide enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades love to grab a hold of hair, and cut it off. I noticed the difference in the cut quite easily. I actually think they are a lot better then the one on my oster fastfeeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing my fastfeeds ($50) set of clippers to a wahl $20 with a $10 blade on, i actually like the wahl combo a lot more. The magnetic motors in the cheap clippers move the blade very fast, paired with a sharp blade you get a clean cut. A good way to improve the potential of a cheap pair of clippers.</li>

            <li> It didnt even cut close</li>

The original blade worked well for a few years, but after giving a new summer hair style to one of the cats, it dulled the blade and this year it was painfully slow to trim the cat&#x27;s hair again. The main replacement blade, which is held in place with two Torx 20 screws is identical to the original blade. The smaller blade replacement (which is driven off the tool&#x27;s motor) is very different to the original blade. However, the registration holes are in the same position. I was able to assemble the blade, but it would not fit inside the tool. A quick snip of the plastic housing made the new blade set fit perfectly. The smaller driven replacement blade (it is larger than the original) just needs a little more space to be able to move left and right to cut hair properly, since it is slightly wider than the original blade.</li>
            <li> I had ordered a new clipper but after checking the review of this blade, I cancelled my order&lt;br /&gt;But after I received and installed this new blade, it turned my clipper brand new and even sharper than when it was first purchased.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy about this order</li>
            <li> Nice Blade and came just in time!</li>
            <li> These blades work perfectly and cut great.</li>
            <li> Fit my Wahl Chrome Pro clipper set perfectly.  The clippers had been drooped and the original blade damaged.  This blade set was easy to install (I had to reuse the two original screws) and easy to adjust.  Clippers cut better than new now.</li>
            <li> Accurate,fast,great product.</li>
            <li> The title pretty much sums it up, it&#x27;s from the manufacture who built the trimmer, seems well-made and very sharp.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well for grooming my Standard Poodle. It could be better but is still pretty good. Better than buying a new clipper set...</li>
            <li> Great tool ! i am using it since i started hair shop for more than 15 years,never change Brand.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit and easily replacable.</li>
            <li> This blade works very well. It was easy to put on my clippers, plus my clients enjoy how smooth it feels. I have no problems with it at all.</li>
            <li> Packaging is good because it displays both blades---------Fit perfect</li>
            <li> So far these blades are working just fine.</li>
            <li> perfect fit and cuts like a champ once again,one thing the provided screws wew just a tick shorter than the ones that came with my clippers. not a big deal,just reused the existing screws</li>
            <li> The item purchased has met all my expectations, and I would gladly purchase this item again in the very near future.</li>
            <li> The Gist of it: This replacement blade set (2-hole) revitalized my Wahl adjustable clippers purchased at a certain big chain box store back in 2000. Definitely worth the cost, as opposed to buying an entire new clipper set.&lt;br /&gt;As other customers have noted, it does take a bit of patience to align the blades and keep them that way while tightening the screws. However, it is far from rocket science. As at least one other customer noted, I also had to use my old screws as the new ones would not thread properly.&lt;br /&gt;As long as your Wahl is USA made, and has two screws in the blade head, then these should be okay. I dare you to try it. It&#x27;s kind of fun and you may just find yourself adjusting your blades routinely. I know I do now.</li>
            <li> Very sharp. Very nice...thank you!!</li>
            <li> This blade is perfect for fading out a &amp;#34;line&amp;#34;. It merges one level of hair into the next. I bought it to work with the Wahl Icon Professional clipper and it allows this clipper to work to its potential. Any professional clipper needs a low profile blade to fade perfectly and this is what this blade does for Wahl professional clippers.</li>
            <li> This is a stock blade replacement for my 5 star Seniors.  I&#x27;m a barber and thrilled to see Amazon has this available at such a good price.</li>
            <li> Fit perfect and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Fits my clippers great but the size of the blade is a tiny bit smaller than the original causing the blade guards to not clip on as tight. I cut my own hair and as I was about to make a pass the guard fell off! All my factory blade guards don&#x27;t fit as snug so the problem isn&#x27;t with one blade guard but the replacement blade itself.&lt;br /&gt;The screws that came with the blade set weren&#x27;t the right size. Luckily I still had the original screws.</li>
            <li> My trusty Wahl was getting a little slow. These were easy to install and it cuts like new.</li>
            <li> I bought these to put on my Wahl 5 Star Senior clippers.  They work great.  I cut my hair often so I like to change the blades about twice a year.</li>
            <li> Replaced my original blade for this blade.  Good for close bald fades.</li>
            <li> blades are sharp. Blades fit my super tapper clipper. the only thing that did not fit was the bolts that came with the blades.other than that good buy.</li>
            <li> They work good. Nothing special.</li>
            <li> thank you from my dog and 2 cats and me they look great works real wonderful&lt;br /&gt;i love it to death. fast delivery was here before due date thank you again</li>
            <li> As soon as I changed the blade my five star seniors cut so much better.  Fades are so much smoother and easier to blend, cuts so much easier.</li>
            <li> Worked just as good as the original blades if not better!</li>
            <li> Even though I used the same model number off my current clipper blade, I was disappointed when it arrived being the wrong size.</li>
            <li> great shipper and product</li>
            <li> Great product great price</li>
            <li> I have the Wahl 5-star Senior Clippers/I replaced the blades. They work just fine. They are sharp and they come with some oil too.</li>
            <li> This blade was a perfect fit to my wahl hair cuttting clips. It leaves me with a nice smooth hair cut.</li>
            <li> Nothing beats fresh blades on cutting hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to put in and work great. What can I say, My clippers have been working great for 14 years and I just need to replace the blades once in a while. I have literally saved thousands on haircuts with these. I also use them on the dog.</li>
