            <li>, this paste smells awesome in a very masculine and sophisticated way!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>Very clean looking and feeling.  </li>
            <li>It does not have very strong control, light weight, easy rinse</li>
            <li>This stuff smells amazing, citrusy &amp; fresh.</li>
            <li>This stuff actually makes my hair look better (love the texture) and it&#x27;s got a great hold.</li>
            <li>well and washes out easily.</li>
            <li>I have shorter hair, and have always used a strong spray or gel/glue.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair shinny and healthy and the best part, it never gets hard or sticky.</li>
            <li>Overall a great and well formulated product to bring all day hold and style.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how much I liked the citrus smell.</li>
            <li>It is good for a textured look though that is a little more conservative.</li>
            <li>it glides on smooth and it leaves a light crisp to your hair, much lighter than anything else ive tried.</li>
            <li>I have short hair that curls up pretty quickly after I take a shower and this product is fantastic!!</li>
            <li>Its well worth it.</li>
            <li>This stuff leaves your hair spiky while giving it a natural look, I&#x27;m 100% satisfied, not to mention I&#x27;ve never had ladies complement the smell of my hair until I used Pete and Pedro.</li>
            <li>It has great holding power while leaving you hair soft all day long.</li>
            <li>It looks completely natural and makes it easy to shape your hair.</li>
            <li>This is the first product that I&#x27;ve found that allows me to manage my hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks Pete and Pedro!</li>
            <li>From the moment you receive the package, which by the way was like a present wrapped in black tissue paper, to the first smell of the product, you know its gonna be good!</li>
            <li>I recommend this anyone with thick hair who wants a hair gel/paste that works great.</li>
            <li>Holds well, and works into hair pretty easily (much easier than crew fiber for instance).</li>
            <li>So overall I would say it is a fine product for that textured style.</li>
            <li>Talking about the smell, i assumed it wouldnt really smell</li>
            <li>You may need to take your time with this product and really work the product in to your hands before placing into your hair</li>
            <li>The description of this product is absolutely correct.</li>
            <li>It holds gently, so my hair doesn&#x27;t look pasted.  </li>
            <li>If you want something more extreme then go to axe or maybe the aveda.</li>
            <li>I can touch my hair, run my fingers through it, let the wind blow it, and a quick swipe of the hand, we&#x27;re back in business.  </li>
            <li>I like the axe messy look to get a more spiked look.</li>
            <li>The product smells nice, works in to dry or wet hair</li>
            <li>Sure its $20 for a small container</li>
            <li>You can purchase it straight from their website at same price.</li>
            <li>Soft yet still somewhat hand shape-able throughout the day.</li>
            <li>but you only use a pea size amount each time, it will last you a while and its totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Just make sure your hands are dry and your hair is slightly damp before applying the product.</li>
            <li>Run your hands or comb through it and its back to a normal look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For a little more wet look using the paste, add a little water to hair before or after applying paste.</li>

            <li> There&#x27;s enough of it to last a long time as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll wet my hand and just run it through some parts for some extra mold-ability.</li>
            <li> I had long hair for years but chopped it all off and needed something to get a textured look.</li>
            <li> This stuff will be in my rotation for as long as I can get it.</li>
            <li> frankly - this isn&#x27;t THAT much better than less expensive products.</li>
            <li> It provides all day stay but never feels stiff - always soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is really thick, and thus I cut it really short, so I like to have it a little spiky, and every product I&#x27;ve ever used required so much and left my hair looking oily.</li>
            <li> Nothing different from any other paste</li>
            <li> I have tried gels that flaked,spays that would dry up your hair...</li>
            <li> Best of all my wife can run her fingers through my hair and not get trapped or come out a sticky, nasty mess.</li>
            <li> The only downfall would be the way it spreads into your hair it can leave a little or maybe even a lot of residue on your hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can get a wet slicker type look from this product</li>
            <li> use it almost daily in one way or another and the small container lasts for months,not weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky like all other products.</li>
            <li> My only criticism is that it comes in small container, but as the directions say a small finger scoop works for your entire head of hair.</li>
            <li> I usually do it after putting the paste in mostly dry hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Downsides: pretty expensive for the small 2oz portion &amp;</li>
            <li> For this I apply a dime sized dab on my finger, rub into my hands, and work it through slightly damp hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is extemely dry, thick and course.</li>
            <li> A little bit, about dime to nickel size, is all you need.</li>
            <li> cant wait to try the other products!!</li>
            <li> Even when it dries after applied to wet hair it wont get too hard.</li>
            <li> I rub into my hands and then work into toweled dried hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many putty and paste products, and have hated them all.</li>
            <li> Ehh i like the smell but wears off after like 30 mins :/</li>
            <li> I have always had wavy, hard to control hair and this stuff tops every product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> i always had problems with greasy dirty feeling hair and scalp with my other brand</li>
            <li> So dont be afraid of the price or container size.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this because of the price, twice as expensive as what i was using before but its 10x better. i always had problems with greasy dirty feeling hair and scalp with my other brand but this feels amazing. it glides on smooth and it leaves a light crisp to your hair, much lighter than anything else ive tried. Talking about the smell, i assumed it wouldnt really smell THAT great but i actually received complements at work about the smell. Sure its $20 for a small container but you only use a pea size amount each time, it will last you a while and its totally worth it.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt, the best hair styling product that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product for men bar none. I have short hair that curls up pretty quickly after I take a shower and this product is fantastic!! I have tried gels that flaked,spays that would dry up your hair...you name it I have tried it.Just make sure your hands are dry and your hair is slightly damp before applying the product. Final note, this paste smells awesome in a very masculine and sophisticated way!!&lt;br /&gt;I cant wait to try the other products!! Aaron you rock!!</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how much I liked the citrus smell. Holds well, and works into hair pretty easily (much easier than crew fiber for instance). Leaves hair feeling clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downsides: pretty expensive for the small 2oz portion &amp; frankly - this isn&#x27;t THAT much better than less expensive products.</li>
            <li> It looks completely natural and makes it easy to shape your hair. There&#x27;s enough of it to last a long time as well. I just re-ordered 5 so I only have to pay the shipping once</li>
            <li> From the moment you receive the package, which by the way was like a present wrapped in black tissue paper, to the first smell of the product, you know its gonna be good! This stuff smells amazing, citrusy &amp; fresh. A little bit, about dime to nickel size, is all you need. I rub into my hands and then work into toweled dried hair. Then a brush to finalize the style. It&#x27;s not greasy, doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy, and holds the style all day. Best of all my wife can run her fingers through my hair and not get trapped or come out a sticky, nasty mess. Treat yourself. You&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li> Pete and Pedro Paste is great stuff.  Very clean looking and feeling.  Bueno Hair indeed!  Thank you Pete and Pedro!</li>
            <li> Nothing different from any other paste</li>
            <li> Leaves hair shinny and healthy and the best part, it never gets hard or sticky. It&#x27;sworth its money. I bought it here just because i buy everthing here but i did not get a deal at all. You can purchase it straight from their website at same price.</li>
            <li> Been using Pete&amp;Pedro products for about a year. The paste is awesome. The best I&#x27;ve ever used for styling without that overstyled wet/hard look. For this I apply a dime sized dab on my finger, rub into my hands, and work it through slightly damp hair. Soft yet still somewhat hand shape-able throughout the day. Like a citrus smelling conditioner for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get a wet slicker type look from this product but youre better off using their pomade for that style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a little more wet look using the paste, add a little water to hair before or after applying paste. I usually do it after putting the paste in mostly dry hair. I&#x27;ll wet my hand and just run it through some parts for some extra mold-ability. Even when it dries after applied to wet hair it wont get too hard. Run your hands or comb through it and its back to a normal look. Or leave it in and it&#x27;ll stay that way for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it almost daily in one way or another and the small container lasts for months,not weeks. So dont be afraid of the price or container size. Its well worth it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!!! My hair is extemely dry, thick and course. This is the first product that I&#x27;ve found that allows me to manage my hair. It provides all day stay but never feels stiff - always soft. I think it&#x27;s actually conditioning my hair. My hair looks heathier and softer. I would recommend it to anyone time and time again.</li>
            <li> It does not have very strong control, light weight, easy rinse out.&lt;br /&gt;Makes hair manageable for hours, You can run your fingers through with out&lt;br /&gt;killing your hair style. I like it and recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention that it smells GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Met my expectations.</li>
            <li> One of the best putty products I&#x27;ve tried so far, and one of the best P&amp;P! Love the mango smell and the semi-matt, great texture for longer hair styles and a nice grippy feeling to the product adds more hold. Overall a great and well formulated product to bring all day hold and style. The only downfall would be the way it spreads into your hair it can leave a little or maybe even a lot of residue on your hair. You may need to take your time with this product and really work the product in to your hands before placing into your hair</li>
            <li> Love the smell. It&#x27;s not sticky like all other products. It&#x27;s just what you need.</li>
            <li> The description of this product is absolutely correct. This paste holds great, doesn&#x27;t leave your hair all flaky at the end of the day, and smells great. My hair is really thick, and thus I cut it really short, so I like to have it a little spiky, and every product I&#x27;ve ever used required so much and left my hair looking oily. This stuff leaves your hair spiky while giving it a natural look, I&#x27;m 100% satisfied, not to mention I&#x27;ve never had ladies complement the smell of my hair until I used Pete and Pedro. I recommend this anyone with thick hair who wants a hair gel/paste that works great. My only criticism is that it comes in small container, but as the directions say a small finger scoop works for your entire head of hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  I have always had wavy, hard to control hair and this stuff tops every product I&#x27;ve tried.  It holds gently, so my hair doesn&#x27;t look pasted.  I can touch my hair, run my fingers through it, let the wind blow it, and a quick swipe of the hand, we&#x27;re back in business.  Great stuff.  Thanks Pete and Pedro!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product to style my short hair. I had long hair for years but chopped it all off and needed something to get a textured look. I have used aveda and axe products as well. I like the axe messy look to get a more spiked look. The pete and pedro is good though for a textured conservative look. If you really want to spike it up or go for the messy look I would not recommend this product. It is good for a textured look though that is a little more conservative. The product smells nice, works in to dry or wet hair well and washes out easily. It has great holding power while leaving you hair soft all day long. It held up great during a workout full of sweat too. My hair stayed in position etc. So overall I would say it is a fine product for that textured style. If you want something more extreme then go to axe or maybe the aveda.</li>
            <li> Amazing hair product for men. I have shorter hair, and have always used a strong spray or gel/glue. I don&#x27;t like fussing with my hair... I just want to go. This stuff actually makes my hair look better (love the texture) and it&#x27;s got a great hold. I&#x27;ve tried many putty and paste products, and have hated them all. This stuff will be in my rotation for as long as I can get it. It smells great, too.</li>
            <li> Ehh i like the smell but wears off after like 30 mins :/</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Finally found a hair product that I want to keep using.</li>
