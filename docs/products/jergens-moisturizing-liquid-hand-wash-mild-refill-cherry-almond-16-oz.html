            <li>All family members enjoy the refreshing smell of Jergens Moisturizing Liquid Hand Wash!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in any supermarket or drug store</li>
            <li>I now know where to get this when I need more.</li>
            <li>I love this soap, it is all I use for hands</li>
            <li>I was so glad to find the refill for my kitchen dispenser</li>
            <li>if that&#x27;s an adjective that&#x27;s appropriate for a scent -  </li>
            <li>is more pronounced</li>
            <li>Love the texture, the aroma and the results.</li>
            <li>I also love this product.</li>
            <li>And I love the scent.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hand wash.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a moisturizing hand soap for my master bath where there&#x27;s lots of hand washing and was reminded of my experiences seeing this in public restrooms in the industrial soap dispensers where the scent was lingeringly awesome.</li>
            <li>smell is so pleasant and gentle -</li>
            <li>It came fast and in good conditon.  </li>
            <li>I love Jergens original Cherry Almond aroma.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why this Jergens hand wash has nearly disappeared from most stores, &#x27;cause it&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li>The lotion is a far superior product in this scent.</li>
            <li>An old favorite after many years of use.</li>
            <li>so you smell clean, not like a bunch of chemicals.</li>
            <li>so far it seems pretty good.</li>
            <li>The soap itself is good at cleaning and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, but leaves it smooth.</li>
            <li>The scent is far from overwhelming and dissapates an hour or so after washing...</li>
            <li>I generally trust Amazon to offer fair prices, and in this case didn&#x27;t notice how little of my favorite liquid soap I was getting in this $7.16 refill -- just 16 oz!    </li>
            <li>Only way to get more was to shop online and buy in quantity to save on shipping.</li>
            <li>Saved me a whole lot of searching around town!</li>
            <li>my hands smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>LOVE Jergens lotion in this same scent.</li>
            <li>It smells better than any of the others available in large sizes and doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive (and frequently scrubbed) hands.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- reasonable price &lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the cherry and almond scent</li>
            <li>Really wish they would make a larger size because I enjoy washing my hands more than usual now.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;- decent moisturizer</li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, especially at the price I splurged for this thinking it would be worth it.</li>
            <li>: &lt;br /&gt;- natural fragrance</li>
            <li>That will be my source from now on, naturally.</li>

            <li> An old favorite after many years of use. It does the job; face wash, body wash, etc. No negatives except may be hard to find in the liquid soap forest.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this Jergens hand wash has nearly disappeared from most stores, &#x27;cause it&#x27;s good stuff. Only way to get more was to shop online and buy in quantity to save on shipping.</li>
            <li> but not smelly enough. I bought this for my mom and she loves it, but her only comment is that the soap is not smelly enough. Personally, I think the smell of soap shouldn&#x27;t stay on your hands because it&#x27;s a little odd, but that&#x27;s what my mom said.</li>
            <li> I have been using Jergens liquid hand wash for years, partly because of the almond scent, but equally because it never chaps or cracks my skin, which I find with some brands.  Sadly, it has become harder and harder for me to find in local stores, so I was delighted to find it through Amazon and replenish my supply.</li>
            <li> This Jergens wash is the mildest, best smelling hand wash I&#x27;ve ever used. There is no itching or dryness from it at all. I recommend this product highly. I have used the Cherry, Almond scented wash for well over 15 years and will use it til I die, as long as Jergens doesn&#x27; t change or discontinue it!</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling scent and really moisturizes the hands. Really wish they would make a larger size because I enjoy washing my hands more than usual now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this liquid soap for years.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in any supermarket or drug store so I ordered it on line from Amazon.  I was really happy that I could get this product.  It came fast and in good conditon.  I now know where to get this when I need more.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, it is all I use for hands but it is very hard to find in my area.  I was so glad to find the refill for my kitchen dispenser and it arrived on time and in perfect condition. Saved me a whole lot of searching around town!</li>
            <li> This Jergens liquid soap hits all my targets for what I want next to my sink: &lt;br /&gt;- natural fragrance (almond with a hint of cherry) &lt;br /&gt;- decent moisturizer &lt;br /&gt;- NOT antibacterial, because that just selects for bacteria which are tougher than average &lt;br /&gt;- reasonable price &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to artificial scents and being around someone with strong perfume can sometimes spark off a sinus infection, if not a day-long migraine. Even soft soaps can get to me if the perfume is some artificial smell.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is so pleasant and gentle - if that&#x27;s an adjective that&#x27;s appropriate for a scent -  it&#x27;s a joy to smell.  I wish they had a body spray with this fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;The almond smell is more pronounced - I don&#x27;t think of cherries while smelling this soap, nor does it evoke an &amp;quot;I&#x27;m hungry&amp;quot; reaction... it&#x27;s just a wonderful non-hunger-inducing aroma.  The scent is far from overwhelming and dissapates an hour or so after washing... so you smell clean, not like a bunch of chemicals. The soap itself is good at cleaning and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, but leaves it smooth. I love this soap!</li>
            <li> My review title says it all.  I generally trust Amazon to offer fair prices, and in this case didn&#x27;t notice how little of my favorite liquid soap I was getting in this $7.16 refill -- just 16 oz!    A few days after its arrival I comforted myself by ordering 3 identical bottles for $2.99 each from a website from which I often get such items.  That will be my source from now on, naturally.</li>
            <li> I have always hated using moisturizing lotion because of the greasy feel and thus I always have exceptionally dry hands. I wanted to try this soap for its moisturizing properties during the cold winter months and so far it seems pretty good. The soap feels silky when it comes out of the bottle and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling excessively tight and dry after washing. It leaves no residue nor does it leave your hands feeling greasy at all. It was also a great value at the price.</li>
            <li> hard to find item thank you amaon fragrance is just as expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching stores all over my area to find refills of this soap. It smells better than any of the others available in large sizes and doesn&#x27;t dry out my sensitive (and frequently scrubbed) hands. It is a relief to find it here.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL ALMOND SCENT</li>
            <li> as always this is a product i can&#x27;t wait to get my handfs into. always a good price here and found a seller that keeps it that way  another purchase coming soon.</li>
            <li> I love Jergens original Cherry Almond aroma. This hand soap can double as a body soap in the shower. You come away smelling heavenly. Love the texture, the aroma and the results.</li>
            <li> All family members enjoy the refreshing smell of Jergens Moisturizing Liquid Hand Wash!</li>
            <li> I also love this product. I use to buy it at Wal-Mart, but of course they stopped carrying it. I can&#x27;t use antibacterial soaps because of the type of septic system I have. I love this product and hate I can&#x27;t buy it locally anymore. I hope they don&#x27;t stop making it. And I love the scent.</li>
            <li> I have always loved the scent of jergens.  It rehydrates the skin great too.</li>
            <li> Wonderful hand soap. Great product. I purchase this often</li>
            <li> I have been using Jergens Moisturizing Liquid Hand Wash for years.  It has a pleasant scent andkeeps my hands smooth and soft.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it on my kitchen countertop.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hand wash. I use this all the time. I really like the cherry and almond scent and it doesn&#x27;t dry your hands out.</li>
            <li> LOVE Jergens lotion in this same scent. I was looking for a moisturizing hand soap for my master bath where there&#x27;s lots of hand washing and was reminded of my experiences seeing this in public restrooms in the industrial soap dispensers where the scent was lingeringly awesome. But for whatever reason, translating the industrial into this at-home refill is just not the same. The scent is very faint. The lotion is a far superior product in this scent. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, especially at the price I splurged for this thinking it would be worth it.</li>
