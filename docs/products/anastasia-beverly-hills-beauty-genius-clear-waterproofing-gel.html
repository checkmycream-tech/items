            <li>Omg.. this stuff is awesome! !  </li>
            <li>Wonderful eyelid primer for those of us with oily lids.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seriously impressed.</li>
            <li>After eating and drinking,  its still perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to use as a &#x27;setter&#x27; of sorts.</li>
            <li>Works great, keeps brows in place.</li>
            <li>and they still looked great with no raccoon issues.</li>
            <li>Works great -</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re amazingly pigmented but don&#x27;t stand a chance against eating, drinking, etc.</li>
            <li>I used this on top of my MAC matte lipstick to stop it from transferring when I eat and drink.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s for sure</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve yet to use it again for lips, but I did use it on top of my eyeliner--and this worked--</li>
            <li>This waterproofing gel really does hold your makeup well and is a good accompaniment to the lash product.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s easy to put on, doesn&#x27;t budge and doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
            <li>Easy to put over eyeliner though.</li>
            <li>It makes my lipstick last longer survives through eating and drinking I can top it off with some lip gloss will buy more</li>
            <li>Definitely will buy more!</li>
            <li>Maybe I just don&#x27;t get it yet, but I can&#x27;t figure out why it&#x27;s worth $18.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sticky at first, but apply it to whatever (eyebrows, eyeshadow, lipstick) and hold still for a minute.</li>
            <li>I not only use this for my eyebrows, but it works fantastic to keep your eyeliner in place ALL day!</li>
            <li>I read on reddit&#x27;s /r/makeupaddiction that it would seal on my lipstick, which is why I bought it in the first place, but</li>
            <li>While I really wanted this product to be the solution to my beauty needs, it&#x27;s just...not.</li>
            <li>works well to keep my make up on in the intense heat and the sun.</li>
            <li>All in all, this stuff is so worth it and goes far beyond my expectations.  </li>
            <li>even after giving it 10 minutes to dry on top of the lipstick, I still ended up with major feathering when I used a straw.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make my lips feel any drier than normal</li>
            <li>Be careful about putting it over a full lid, it will smear your powder makeup.</li>
            <li>It definitely requires a waterproof eye remover at the end of the day, but this is a great secret for those who suffer from drippy lids!</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>but it drys out your lips so completely and clumps, weirdly enough.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll dry and feel normal.</li>
            <li>It leaves a slightly sticky feeling on your lips after drying,  but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li>Worth spending $20 because a little goes a very long way!</li>

            <li> Will last me for a long time.</li>
            <li> This works, but it did not last very long and at $30</li>
            <li> A trip to the mirror revealed my lipstick was actually flaking off due to how it dried.</li>
            <li> I bought this specifically for OCC Lip tars (I have  black, dark blue, and black dahlia).</li>
            <li> Its very difficult to clean out of a brush also.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint I have is that when applying it on your lips, placing a lot on it can cause your lipstick to move around on your lips slightly,  but after drying its locked down well.</li>
            <li> I tried this waterproofer with the black lip tar and for a while it was alright until it became a little too sticky.</li>
            <li> and it dried matte.</li>
            <li> except it made my eyeliner look a little dull.</li>
            <li> Small price to pay</li>
            <li> I bought this to use w my eyeliner because I am tired of raccoon eyes.  </li>
            <li> I apply it on my brows and lids after I powder them (eyeshadow and liner before that of course and urban decay base before that!)</li>

    <ol>
            <li> While I really wanted this product to be the solution to my beauty needs, it&#x27;s just...not. I&#x27;m one of those people that can&#x27;t remember to freshen their makeup to save their lives, so I was looking for something to help my lipstick (especially) stay put. It does do that...but it drys out your lips so completely and clumps, weirdly enough. Unfortunately, putting a lip balm over top removes the waterproofing aspect and the makeup&#x27;s back to being...mobile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely not an item I&#x27;d purchase again.</li>
            <li> I used this on top of my MAC matte lipstick to stop it from transferring when I eat and drink. It pass the drinking test but didn&#x27;t pass the eating test. If your food isn&#x27;t oily, it would pass but if you are eating something oily, the lipstick will still come off. There was no smell or taste to it and it dried matte. It didn&#x27;t make my lips feel any drier than normal but I used lip primer before the lipstick and Beauty Genius Gel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to use as a &#x27;setter&#x27; of sorts. I was directed to it to use to set lipstick. It&#x27;s sticky at first, but apply it to whatever (eyebrows, eyeshadow, lipstick) and hold still for a minute. It&#x27;ll dry and feel normal.</li>
            <li> This product works GREAT,love it!!!</li>
            <li> I not only use this for my eyebrows, but it works fantastic to keep your eyeliner in place ALL day!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use w my eyeliner because I am tired of raccoon eyes.  This works, but it did not last very long and at $30, it did not perform well enough for the price.  Its very difficult to clean out of a brush also.  Still looking for eyeliner that&#x27;s easy to put on, doesn&#x27;t budge and doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
            <li> Omg.. this stuff is awesome! !  Keeps my brows in place,  even using a pencil ..love it!  Definitely will buy more!</li>
            <li> works well to keep my make up on in the intense heat and the sun. Before, I felt as if my make up sweated off</li>
            <li> Wonderful eyelid primer for those of us with oily lids. It definitely requires a waterproof eye remover at the end of the day, but this is a great secret for those who suffer from drippy lids! Worth spending $20 because a little goes a very long way!</li>
            <li> It makes my lipstick last longer survives through eating and drinking I can top it off with some lip gloss will buy more that&#x27;s for sure</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know I&#x27;ve tried it on to make lipstick last longer meh it didn&#x27;t I gave it 3 stars only since I want to try it on eyeliner it might work</li>
            <li> I use this with all my brow products. Makes brow color stay put all day and night. Last until you wash it off.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff after reading that putting it over lipstick would make it last. WOW. I&#x27;m seriously impressed. After eating and drinking,  its still perfect. Only complaint I have is that when applying it on your lips, placing a lot on it can cause your lipstick to move around on your lips slightly,  but after drying its locked down well. It leaves a slightly sticky feeling on your lips after drying,  but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me. All in all, this stuff is so worth it and goes far beyond my expectations.  I have yet to use it on my brows or eyes, but I am definitely going to be using it a lot.</li>
            <li> Works great, keeps brows in place.</li>
            <li> I bought this specifically for OCC Lip tars (I have  black, dark blue, and black dahlia). They&#x27;re amazingly pigmented but don&#x27;t stand a chance against eating, drinking, etc. I tried this waterproofer with the black lip tar and for a while it was alright until it became a little too sticky. A trip to the mirror revealed my lipstick was actually flaking off due to how it dried. I&#x27;ve yet to use it again for lips, but I did use it on top of my eyeliner--and this worked--except it made my eyeliner look a little dull. Almost matte-ish. Small price to pay I suppose. Maybe it&#x27;s just the composition of the lip tar that doesn&#x27;t work well with this product.</li>
            <li> Definitely waterproofs your makeup, I used it on my smoky eyes one night and woke up the next morning and they still looked great with no raccoon issues. Be careful about putting it over a full lid, it will smear your powder makeup. Easy to put over eyeliner though. Will last me for a long time.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just don&#x27;t get it yet, but I can&#x27;t figure out why it&#x27;s worth $18. I tried to use it to waterproof my eye makeup, but it just left my lids sticky and gross. I read on reddit&#x27;s /r/makeupaddiction that it would seal on my lipstick, which is why I bought it in the first place, but even after giving it 10 minutes to dry on top of the lipstick, I still ended up with major feathering when I used a straw.</li>
            <li> Works great - I apply it on my brows and lids after I powder them (eyeshadow and liner before that of course and urban decay base before that!)</li>
            <li> This waterproofing gel really does hold your makeup well and is a good accompaniment to the lash product.</li>
