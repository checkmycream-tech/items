            <li>Good quality, item as described</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good scent, not chemically or overpowering.</li>
            <li>I would have loved to be the one to have used the product as opposed to just smelling the bottle afterwards, which smelled good and probably would have made my brushes smell just as good.</li>
            <li>It works beautifully to spot clean my brushes!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase and have zero complaints.</li>
            <li>It does a good job removing makeup &amp; disinfecting, honestly I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, it smells like vanilla, but it has a very strong chemical solvent smell.</li>

            <li>Love this product!</li>

            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>AMAZING for brush cleaning.</li>
            <li>bought this product with my own money and of my own volition.</li>
            <li>My review is honest and unbiased.</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>Nice vanilla scent after it dries.</li>
            <li>Added plus in the nice vanilla scent, which doesn&#x27;t stick to the brushes.</li>
            <li>smells good, drys fast and cleans great on the spot</li>
            <li>The liquid its self is very strong and alcohol smelling.</li>
            <li>It cleaned my brushes and it smelled really nice:-)</li>
            <li>Cleaning wise, it is ok but not super impressive.</li>
            <li>I ordered more.</li>
            <li>Smells great and dries fast.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>but you think for the price of this stuff they could package it better.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>Love this for spot cleaning my brushes.</li>
            <li>(But I personally love vanilla, so that&#x27;s ok.)</li>
            <li>, I LOVE the vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s a guess, because I for sure don&#x27;t know what roach spray smells like.</li>
            <li>Love the product, easy clean wipe on my brushes - love, love - BUT!</li>
            <li>Cleaned my makeup brushes very well and smells nice too!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only one that gets my foundation brushes truly clean and it smells great!</li>
            <li>This easy removes color from eyeshadow brushes and foundation or blush from face brushes.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong vanilla odor but that doesn&#x27;t bother me</li>
            <li>The scent is intolerable; the vanilla scent is followed by strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li>It is slightly strong when in use, but will fade in a day or two, not offensive at all.</li>
            <li>The vanilla smell is lovely &amp; not sickly at all.</li>
            <li>The cleaning solution itself works fine, though the vanilla scent is quite strong and may be a hit or miss for you.</li>
            <li>This product does a great job of cleaning my brushes on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>Once it dries however, it leaves a light vanilla scent on the brushes.</li>
            <li>but otherwise it was fantastic</li>
            <li>great cleaner for ur brushes wish i could grab this at local stores</li>
            <li>I dipped one of my cheap brushes in it and ruined it.</li>
            <li>and they actually enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li>really cheap manufacturing on the bottle.</li>
            <li>I love this brush cleaner, quick, clean brushes in no time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy finally found a right brush cleaner to sanitize and clean all my makeup brushes!</li>
            <li>The most recent one I purchased will not spray at all no matter how many times I pump the spray top.</li>
            <li>This little brush cleaner is great because it gets most of the product out of the brushes.</li>
            <li>, it gets brushes so clean and dries almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>I spray and spot clean.</li>
            <li>but it dissipates quickly leaving this fabulous vanilla smell.</li>
            <li>I like to clean my makeup brushes every day.  </li>
            <li>but I needed something to just spot clean</li>
            <li>The odor is pretty strong until it dries.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong smell at first</li>
            <li>goodness amazon is super quick at shipping stuff .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quick drying and not time consuming at all.</li>
            <li>I spray this on my brushes right after use and then wipe my brushes on a paper towel until they brush clean.</li>
            <li>good brush cleaner and dry quick</li>
            <li>Easy and fast.</li>
            <li>This is very convenient and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Cleans well, smells heavenly, and leaves brushes soft and good as new.</li>
            <li>Brushes developed a flaky buildup after more than one use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a professional, but I DO love this product!</li>
            <li>and it is hands down the most effective, FAST cleaner</li>
            <li>The majority of the reviews were right...</li>
            <li>It cleans quickly and dries fast.</li>
            <li>Just my opinion, I deducted a star because of the smell, but again - it does work very very well.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need very much and it cleans your brush so well so fast!</li>
            <li>It works exactly as the company describes.</li>
            <li>dry quickly rather then deep cleaning them that can take hours to dry this is a great quick alternative with getting the JOB done</li>
            <li>Love how I no longer have to wait for my brushes to dry.</li>
            <li>She has a whole video about the product and how to use it.</li>
            <li>You would think if they are charging this much for this product that they would package it in a quality bottle.  </li>
            <li>The brush cleaner works very well.</li>
            <li>My bathroom stank for a whole day afterwards even though I sprayed against the sink</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This stuff seems to work really well.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I wash my brushes with a gentle face cleaner.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>Has a pleasant subtle vanilla-esque scent.</li>
            <li>The makeup comes off quickly and my brushes are left clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re using it to clean up a larger face brush, you definitely need to use more to get the old product out of the bristles.</li>
            <li>then your brushes are clean, dry and ready to go!</li>
            <li>This products works well to clean and freshen brushes in between deep monthly cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I could use the same eyeshadow brush in different eyeshadows without having to full on clean</li>
            <li>I tried this out but will go back to my tried and true.</li>
            <li>This does quick clean your brushes, but it leaves a little residue.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent brush cleaner</li>
            <li>It cleans your brushes quickly, dries SUPER FAST, and leaves the brushes soft and ready to use again within a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Exceeded my high expectations</li>
            <li>A deep cleaning is definitely still necessary about every week or so for bacterial purposes (this is not anti-bacterial) but is great for maintaining your deep cleaning!</li>
            <li>The product is good but the pulverizer (spray) is broken.</li>
            <li>It cleans my brushes very well and they are dry to use right away.</li>
            <li>you can be working on clients back to back to back and cleaning in between with this leaving your brushes spotless, smell good and fresh scented and dry instantly.</li>
            <li>It seems to just dissolve away even the most messy caked on foundation brushes!</li>
            <li>Just leaves a faint smell that is so nice!</li>
            <li>There is a huge product label covering half of the bottle</li>
            <li>The bottle, on the other hand, does not work very well (as other reviewers have mentioned), but I bought this in order to see if I liked the product (which I do) before purchasing the full size.&lt;br /&gt;Strong cleaning supply scent when wet, vanilla-ish when dry, which does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to purchase empty bottles with better spritz and empty the solution in those.</li>
            <li>and they are ready for next week of use.</li>
            <li>I was looking for brush cleaner recently - something that is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>I had professional</li>
            <li>Got one use out of this before the spray part just broke completely.</li>
            <li>I also, sometimes, spray it directly onto the brush, then swirl it on the paper towel.  </li>
            <li>It seems to get all the makeup off and the brushes are kept soft.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend purchasing the 2oz size spray bottle as I have purchased 3 so far and each one has had issues spraying the solution.</li>
            <li>I left them to dry over night but they would have been ready to use after just an hour.</li>
            <li>I cleaned my brushes before bed and the next morning they were dry and ready for use.</li>
            <li>At least for my sensitive nose, it smells like solvent with a little vanilla on top.</li>
            <li>No more thick sticky cream on my brush any more!</li>

            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> This stuff seems to work really well.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I wash my brushes with a gentle face cleaner.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> Has a pleasant subtle vanilla-esque scent.</li>
            <li> The makeup comes off quickly and my brushes are left clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re using it to clean up a larger face brush, you definitely need to use more to get the old product out of the bristles.</li>
            <li> then your brushes are clean, dry and ready to go!</li>
            <li> This products works well to clean and freshen brushes in between deep monthly cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I could use the same eyeshadow brush in different eyeshadows without having to full on clean</li>
            <li> I tried this out but will go back to my tried and true.</li>
            <li> This does quick clean your brushes, but it leaves a little residue.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent brush cleaner</li>
            <li> It cleans your brushes quickly, dries SUPER FAST, and leaves the brushes soft and ready to use again within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Exceeded my high expectations</li>
            <li> A deep cleaning is definitely still necessary about every week or so for bacterial purposes (this is not anti-bacterial) but is great for maintaining your deep cleaning!</li>
            <li> The product is good but the pulverizer (spray) is broken.</li>
            <li> It cleans my brushes very well and they are dry to use right away.</li>
            <li> you can be working on clients back to back to back and cleaning in between with this leaving your brushes spotless, smell good and fresh scented and dry instantly.</li>
            <li> It seems to just dissolve away even the most messy caked on foundation brushes!</li>
            <li> Just leaves a faint smell that is so nice!</li>
            <li> There is a huge product label covering half of the bottle</li>
            <li> The bottle, on the other hand, does not work very well (as other reviewers have mentioned), but I bought this in order to see if I liked the product (which I do) before purchasing the full size.&lt;br /&gt;Strong cleaning supply scent when wet, vanilla-ish when dry, which does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to purchase empty bottles with better spritz and empty the solution in those.</li>
            <li> and they are ready for next week of use.</li>
            <li> I was looking for brush cleaner recently - something that is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> I had professional</li>
            <li> Got one use out of this before the spray part just broke completely.</li>
            <li> I also, sometimes, spray it directly onto the brush, then swirl it on the paper towel.  </li>
            <li> It seems to get all the makeup off and the brushes are kept soft.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend purchasing the 2oz size spray bottle as I have purchased 3 so far and each one has had issues spraying the solution.</li>
            <li> I left them to dry over night but they would have been ready to use after just an hour.</li>
            <li> I cleaned my brushes before bed and the next morning they were dry and ready for use.</li>
            <li> At least for my sensitive nose, it smells like solvent with a little vanilla on top.</li>
            <li> No more thick sticky cream on my brush any more!</li>
            <li> It is fast drying on the brushes and leaves them in a condition where you can use, let&#x27;s say, an electric blue eyeshadow one day and then use a pale neutral the next day without any blue residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think that if you&#x27;re not very sensitive to smell, you will have no issues with it.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re in a hurry and need your brushes to use for another product and they are currently dirty with the previous product, use this spray on it and dab it on a paper towel until the brush is clean and it is ready to go in seconds for its next use.</li>
            <li> how long did you go without cleaning your brushes?</li>
            <li> Let me answer this politely: too long.</li>
            <li> Once a week I spray my brushes then pad dry them</li>
            <li> However, the sprayer broke down after a short time for me.  </li>
            <li> The cleaner itself works great and cleans my brushes well, but the packaging has been terrible.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars was because I feel like you waste a lot of product when you spray it.</li>
            <li> The box it came in was all mashed up and the bottle itself was empty.</li>
            <li> Cleans makeup brushes like any other cleaner, and requires alot of product.</li>
            <li> The pump doesn&#x27;t work well at all and either shoots a small stream out or just dribbles after pumping several times.  </li>
            <li> Brushes dry in a few seconds.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the bottle stopped spraying after a couple uses</li>
            <li> Not worth the one star required</li>
            <li> Because it is a weird scent and while it doesn&#x27;t really stay on the brushes, it stays in the room for a while.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just cleaning small brushes (eye, concealer, detailer brushes, etc etc) only a small amount is needed.</li>
            <li> But after having used it myself, I will never clean my brushes any other way!</li>
            <li> I found the brushes sucked up a lot of product and was a little slimey if u didnt use a lot of product</li>
            <li> I spray a little (about two to three spays) onto a paper towel, then swirl my brush across it.  </li>
            <li> A little pricy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice it until my roommate complained about the weird scent.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It was definitely a waste of money.</li>
            <li> No more fussing with hand washing and drying all day.</li>
            <li> but the bottle is so small that I used it in one cleaning of my brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleaner for the past 5years</li>
            <li> The small piece that spritz the solution keeps popping out.</li>
            <li> My brushes are dry within minutes and have a faint vanilla scent.  </li>
            <li> The spray bottle doesn&#x27;t hardly spray at all.</li>
            <li> It does the job if you can get past the migraines from the scent!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize until I got this product that it is so very small, it looks like a travel size.  </li>
            <li> And I tried to peel it off and it doesn&#x27;t come off without leaving residue and part of the label behind.</li>
            <li> Item arrived poorly.</li>
            <li> However, it does leave a vanilla fragrance behind.</li>
            <li> I have never experienced anything like this before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite frustrating.</li>
            <li> Chemical smell is so bad that I rather stop using it after two trials and repurchase the previous cleaner I used (Japonesque).</li>
            <li> I bought the Professional Brush Cleaner and it smells so awful</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t spray at all and leaves my brushes smelling weird</li>
            <li> but it was really difficult to get any to spray out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product yet but am very unhappy with how it came packaged.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really annoying.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This brush cleaner is perfect! Just spray on and wipe off on a towel then your brushes are clean, dry and ready to go! Love how I no longer have to wait for my brushes to dry. It does have a strong vanilla odor but that doesn&#x27;t bother me</li>
            <li> Great for spot cleaning. Smells like vanilla.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product yet but am very unhappy with how it came packaged. There is a huge product label covering half of the bottle and you can&#x27;t even read the instructions.  I was going to give this as part of a Christmas gift. How can I give this to anyone? It&#x27;s horrendous. And I tried to peel it off and it doesn&#x27;t come off without leaving residue and part of the label behind. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have to say over and over, GET THIS PRODUCT! It works perfectly for cleaning and sanitizing make-up brushes. Plus, it dries in a second. So if you&#x27;re in a hurry and need your brushes to use for another product and they are currently dirty with the previous product, use this spray on it and dab it on a paper towel until the brush is clean and it is ready to go in seconds for its next use. This is my third time purchasing this product, I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. Takes the annoyance of having to wash your brushes constantly for different uses at one time. The seller and transaction was excellent!!</li>
            <li> Cleans brushes spotless instantly. Smells great! I ordered more. No more fussing with hand washing and drying all day.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It works exactly as the company describes. Would say great product and price!</li>
            <li> I love this brush cleaner, quick, clean brushes in no time.</li>
            <li> Good cleaner but the bottle is so small that I used it in one cleaning of my brushes. Def just get the big bottle</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! It smells wonderful and cleans my brushes great!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t spray at all and leaves my brushes smelling weird</li>
            <li> Best Brush cleaner out there!!!  It seems to just dissolve away even the most messy caked on foundation brushes!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing invention. If you use a lot of makeup brushes. Get this!</li>
            <li> The stuff is great for cleaning your make up brushes</li>
            <li> This is truly a remarkable product. I have three sets of sigma brushes and the 2oz container cleaned all but three of them! I left them to dry over night but they would have been ready to use after just an hour. Has a pleasant subtle vanilla-esque scent. I heard about this product from a youtuber by the name of Nicole Geurriero. She has a whole video about the product and how to use it. But after having used it myself, I will never clean my brushes any other way!</li>
            <li> The spray bottle doesn&#x27;t hardly spray at all. When I finally got some product on the brush it worked well but it was really difficult to get any to spray out.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Exceeded my high expectations</li>
            <li> Smells great and dries fast. My only complaint is that the bottle stopped spraying after a couple uses</li>
            <li> I am no make up pro but I can tell this works great for my brushes. Easy and fast. Once a week I spray my brushes then pad dry them and they are ready for next week of use.</li>
            <li> Love the product. It cleaned my brushes and it smelled really nice:-)</li>
            <li> Good quality, item as described</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING!!!! It cleans your brushes quickly, dries SUPER FAST, and leaves the brushes soft and ready to use again within a few minutes. The scent is not over powering, but does smell very good. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars was because I feel like you waste a lot of product when you spray it. I have been pouring some into a shot glass and dipping my brushes in that way. If you&#x27;re just cleaning small brushes (eye, concealer, detailer brushes, etc etc) only a small amount is needed. But if you&#x27;re using it to clean up a larger face brush, you definitely need to use more to get the old product out of the bristles. I will 100% be repurchasing, but next time I&#x27;ll get a bigger bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product with my own money and of my own volition. My review is honest and unbiased. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I was looking for brush cleaner recently - something that is reasonably priced.  I didn&#x27;t realize until I got this product that it is so very small, it looks like a travel size.  You would think if they are charging this much for this product that they would package it in a quality bottle.  However, the sprayer broke down after a short time for me.  It dribbles instead of spraying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and find something else!</li>
            <li> Amazing! Purchased after Sephora changed theirs and I love it, it gets brushes so clean and dries almost immediately.  Definitely will repurchase.</li>
            <li> The brush cleaner works very well. I&#x27;m happy finally found a right brush cleaner to sanitize and clean all my makeup brushes! No more thick sticky cream on my brush any more!</li>
            <li> The pump didn&#x27;t work on it.  Couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush cleaner. I had professional tell me not to buy anything else, and she was right!!!!!! It cleans quickly and dries fast.</li>
            <li> Great product. smells good, drys fast and cleans great on the spot</li>
            <li> I bought the Professional Brush Cleaner and it smells so awful I only used it once. My bathroom stank for a whole day afterwards even though I sprayed against the sink and I had to wash my make up brush several times before the smell went away. I could smell it on my face for days afterwards, whenever I would use my brushes. Thanks but I think I&#x27;ll stick with cleaning them with shampoo.</li>
            <li> The product is good but the pulverizer (spray) is broken.</li>
            <li> This product does a great job of cleaning my brushes on a daily basis. The odor is pretty strong until it dries. Like another reviewer said it does smell like roach spray. Once it dries however, it leaves a light vanilla scent on the brushes.</li>
            <li> This does quick clean your brushes, but it leaves a little residue.</li>
            <li> One if my favorite brush cleaners! Love this product!! I&#x27;ve been using this cleaner for the past 5years wouldn&#x27;t change it</li>
            <li> Got one use out of this before the spray part just broke completely. It also got knocked over on my vanity and it was screwed on all the way but leaked all over my white vanity and stained it, I&#x27;ll have to repaint it. It&#x27;s a decent brush cleaner but you think for the price of this stuff they could package it better.</li>
            <li> Cleans well. Nice vanilla scent after it dries. The liquid its self is very strong and alcohol smelling.</li>
            <li> This product is great for spot cleaning! I got it on a whim and have to pick up a bigger bottle! You don&#x27;t need very much and it cleans your brush so well so fast!</li>
            <li> It was awesome! I found the brushes sucked up a lot of product and was a little slimey if u didnt use a lot of product but otherwise it was fantastic</li>
            <li> great cleaner for ur brushes wish i could grab this at local stores thank goodness amazon is super quick at shipping stuff .&lt;br /&gt;brushes dry quickly rather then deep cleaning them that can take hours to dry this is a great quick alternative with getting the JOB done</li>
            <li> Item arrived poorly. The bottle was leaking. Never again!</li>
            <li> Cleaned my makeup brushes very well and smells nice too!</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush cleaner for years and it is hands down the most effective, FAST cleaner ever-- and all of my clients tell me &amp;#34;Your brushes smell amazing!&amp;#34;--- you can be working on clients back to back to back and cleaning in between with this leaving your brushes spotless, smell good and fresh scented and dry instantly. Amazing. It&#x27;s expensive but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Should have purchased it years ago.</li>
            <li> It works beautifully to spot clean my brushes! I would recommend for anyone, especially those who use brushes ever day</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff! It cleans my brushes very well and they are dry to use right away. My brushes even feel softer than before.</li>
            <li> This stuff seems to work really well.  I spray a little (about two to three spays) onto a paper towel, then swirl my brush across it.  I also, sometimes, spray it directly onto the brush, then swirl it on the paper towel.  The makeup comes off quickly and my brushes are left clean and soft.  My brushes are dry within minutes and have a faint vanilla scent.  It&#x27;s a good scent, not chemically or overpowering.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush cleaner I have ever bought! It&#x27;s the only one that gets my foundation brushes truly clean and it smells great!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! I cleaned my brushes before bed and the next morning they were dry and ready for use. This product is not oily and does not harm the brushes. I am very pleased with my purchase and have zero complaints.</li>
            <li> The scent is intolerable; the vanilla scent is followed by strong chemical smell. Chemical smell is so bad that I rather stop using it after two trials and repurchase the previous cleaner I used (Japonesque). Cleaning wise, it is ok but not super impressive.</li>
            <li> Love this for spot cleaning my brushes. You wouldn&#x27;t believe the amount of stuff it instantly takes off. Brushes dry in a few seconds. However, it does leave a vanilla fragrance behind. (But I personally love vanilla, so that&#x27;s ok.) It can be overpowering if you use a lot of it at once. I wil definitely be repurchasing the bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> This is so handy! I adore this product for spot cleaning makeup brushes. The vanilla smell is lovely &amp; not sickly at all. It is slightly strong when in use, but will fade in a day or two, not offensive at all. This easy removes color from eyeshadow brushes and foundation or blush from face brushes. A deep cleaning is definitely still necessary about every week or so for bacterial purposes (this is not anti-bacterial) but is great for maintaining your deep cleaning! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Does not meet the hype. Cleans makeup brushes like any other cleaner, and requires alot of product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t dip it like it says to. I spray and spot clean. I dipped one of my cheap brushes in it and ruined it. I wash my brushes with a gentle face cleaner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, it smells like vanilla, but it has a very strong chemical solvent smell. At least for my sensitive nose, it smells like solvent with a little vanilla on top. It does a good job removing makeup &amp; disinfecting, honestly I don&#x27;t like the smell. I know a lot of people that use this as their #1 brush cleaner and they actually enjoy the smell. Just my opinion, I deducted a star because of the smell, but again - it does work very very well.</li>
            <li> The box it came in was all mashed up and the bottle itself was empty. Do not buy this product. It was definitely a waste of money. I have never experienced anything like this before. This company dropped the ball big time. I would have loved to be the one to have used the product as opposed to just smelling the bottle afterwards, which smelled good and probably would have made my brushes smell just as good. Not worth the one star required</li>
            <li> I bought this 2 ounce spray bottle in case it wasn&#x27;t as great as all the reviews claimed it to be. The majority of the reviews were right... this stuff is GREAT! I&#x27;ve already placed an order for the 32 ounce bottle. It cleans so well! Plus, it sanitizes your brushes too! Some reviewers complain about the smell. It does have a strong smell at first but it dissipates quickly leaving this fabulous vanilla smell. If you&#x27;re looking for a product that cleans your makeup brushes well and also sanitizes... this is your product!</li>
            <li> This products works well to clean and freshen brushes in between deep monthly cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;And, I LOVE the vanilla scent. Just leaves a faint smell that is so nice!</li>
            <li> The cleaner itself works great and cleans my brushes well, but the packaging has been terrible.  The pump doesn&#x27;t work well at all and either shoots a small stream out or just dribbles after pumping several times.  It also leaked all over my makeup tray.  Could just be a faulty bottle so I would try it again because the cleaner itself works well.</li>
            <li> Love the product, easy clean wipe on my brushes - love, love - BUT! really cheap manufacturing on the bottle. The small piece that spritz the solution keeps popping out. I purchased two bottles and both so the same thing. It&#x27;s really annoying. I&#x27;ve had to purchase empty bottles with better spritz and empty the solution in those.</li>
            <li> Excellent to do bussiness with.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and easy to use -- not to mention inexpensive considering the market. Added plus in the nice vanilla scent, which doesn&#x27;t stick to the brushes.</li>
            <li> I like to clean my makeup brushes every day.  This is very convenient and easy to use.  It seems to get all the makeup off and the brushes are kept soft.</li>
            <li> Brushes developed a flaky buildup after more than one use. And it smells like roach spray.  But that&#x27;s a guess, because I for sure don&#x27;t know what roach spray smells like.</li>
            <li> I love it!!! Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I recently realized the importance of cleaning makeup brushes. I know what you&#x27;re thinking ... how long did you go without cleaning your brushes? Let me answer this politely: too long. Which means since I recently made this realization, I&#x27;ve been going all out on the cleaning. I have a method for deep cleaning the brushes but I needed something to just spot clean so I could use the same eyeshadow brush in different eyeshadows without having to full on clean the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s where this comes in. This little brush cleaner is great because it gets most of the product out of the brushes. I spray this on my brushes right after use and then wipe my brushes on a paper towel until they brush clean. It is fast drying on the brushes and leaves them in a condition where you can use, let&#x27;s say, an electric blue eyeshadow one day and then use a pale neutral the next day without any blue residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing about this product is that it has a scent. It&#x27;s a sweetish smelling scent but it&#x27;s not a scent you&#x27;re probably going to be familar with. I didn&#x27;t really notice it until my roommate complained about the weird scent. Because it is a weird scent and while it doesn&#x27;t really stay on the brushes, it stays in the room for a while.</li>
            <li> It does the job if you can get past the migraines from the scent! Omg! Parian Spirit will still be my go to. I tried this out but will go back to my tried and true.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional, but I DO love this product! Cleans well, smells heavenly, and leaves brushes soft and good as new.</li>
            <li> The cleaning solution itself works fine, though the vanilla scent is quite strong and may be a hit or miss for you. The reason for my lower rating for this product is the packaging for the 2oz size. I do not recommend purchasing the 2oz size spray bottle as I have purchased 3 so far and each one has had issues spraying the solution. The most recent one I purchased will not spray at all no matter how many times I pump the spray top. It&#x27;s quite frustrating.</li>
            <li> Product itself is great. The bottle, on the other hand, does not work very well (as other reviewers have mentioned), but I bought this in order to see if I liked the product (which I do) before purchasing the full size.&lt;br /&gt;Strong cleaning supply scent when wet, vanilla-ish when dry, which does not bother me at all. I think that if you&#x27;re not very sensitive to smell, you will have no issues with it.</li>
            <li> good brush cleaner and dry quick</li>
            <li> AMAZING for brush cleaning. Quick drying and not time consuming at all.</li>
            <li> Works really well.  Makeup just disappears off brushes.  A little pricy.</li>
