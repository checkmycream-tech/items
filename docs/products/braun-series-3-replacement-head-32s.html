            <li>Great price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the cost of this item and have always liked the value of doing business with AMAZON.com</li>
            <li>Braun is a great product and worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this razor and happy that I can get replacement heads at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s very impressive considering that the 3 series is far below the cost of a 7 series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good, perfectly fit for my Braun Series 3-340s Shaver (B004UQ6Q62).</li>

            <li>the head works as good as the original</li>
            <li>Original was good and lasted for two years.</li>
            <li>It is just as good as the original that came with the shaver.</li>
            <li>well worth every cent for a real nice clean shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the original product, fast delivery, would recommend to anyone very, very good original spare parts braun taken Amazon</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband and he is very happy - still weeks later.</li>
            <li>What more do you want?</li>
            <li>I thought if I bought them on line, maybe they were better then walmart (sometimes they have a cheaper product).</li>
            <li>I love this place.</li>
            <li>Third time I bought these and as always they work great!!</li>
            <li>The pack fits my razor and work well making shaving much more bareable.</li>
            <li>The Braun Series 3 380 takes the 32S (or 32B I believe, but who the heck can really be sure?)</li>
            <li>They work well when matched up, but come on people, you can do waaay better than this.</li>
            <li>I ordered one so that after 18 months I would be sure to have the replacement.  </li>
            <li>The Braun does a much better job than most.   </li>
            <li>After awhile though it seemed more like a dermatitis.</li>
            <li>I brought these when I bought my shaver and tested one to make sure it works OK.  </li>
            <li>reviews - too many rules.</li>
            <li>Comfortable and effective to shave with.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Pleased with product as advertised and</li>
            <li>I HAVE USED ELECTRIC SHAVERS MOST OF MY LIFE OF 74 YEARS.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it contained the blades as well</li>
            <li>What more do I need to say to meet the minimum wood count.</li>
            <li>Have used this shaver for about a year and am pleased with the closeness and smoothness of the shave.</li>
            <li>The replacement blade was reasonably priced and works great.</li>
            <li>Item was just what I needed at a better than competitive price.  </li>
            <li>Glad it is still around.</li>
            <li>I realize that it is a Series 3 and the latest model is a Series 7</li>
            <li>however, it&#x27;s still a BRAUN product which I feel is a top of the line razor and should provide many years of service.</li>
            <li>Only thing that fits my Braun&lt;br /&gt;Works Great will check prices  when time for another one&lt;br /&gt;Cheap price !</li>
            <li>I priced the replacement heads at four different stores and found  Amazons the best.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave!</li>
            <li>my shaver now works better than the head that came on it from wally world.</li>
            <li>love love love</li>
            <li>It is better than the replacement without the chrome.</li>
            <li>I have to change the head way more often than the manufactuer recommed, However it is still cheaper than buying blades</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize you were supposed to change these more often.</li>
            <li>I am happily satisfied.</li>
            <li>It fit!  </li>
            <li>If you buy a Braun electric shaver, make sure to get a replacement head.  </li>
            <li>The shaver works so much better.  </li>
            <li>Better price than Walmart</li>
            <li>love my Braun.</li>
            <li>The newer, the better, because it&#x27;s sharper and can handle even a load of hair that&#x27;s been growing for three or four days.</li>
            <li>But thats ok.</li>
            <li>We had purchased another razor before this one, but he likes this one much better, and he&#x27;s 60.  </li>
            <li>Braun saving products is all that I have used for many years.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I paid a fraction of what Target was selling these for and you have to love that.</li>
            <li>For his favorite razor.</li>
            <li>I still think rotaries are a better value provided they work.</li>
            <li>The product is just OK...</li>
            <li>We may still have to order more if we want to continue to use the shaver</li>
            <li>Exactly what I asked for a new shaving  right part for the best shaver compliments my razor perfectly great job braun</li>
            <li>I found a right match at good price at amazon.</li>
            <li>From the first shave, I was very impressed about what a good clean shave it gave me, and it made me realize how worn out the old one was.  </li>
            <li>Great new replacement screens.  </li>
            <li>Great as always...makes it like a new razor every time.</li>
            <li>Finally a clean shave again!</li>
            <li>The Amazon price is very good, and I also order the cleaning solution with the 15% discount for a regular delivery.</li>
            <li>very good element ten points</li>
            <li>Just like original - I change more often that they recommend (18 months) because a new cutter feels great.</li>
            <li>Many times a replacement blade seems cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Excellent product as expected.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly, great shave compared to old worn head.</li>
            <li>Replacement head fit my razor and works better than the one I dropped.</li>
            <li>Good quality and reasonable prices.</li>
            <li>Even better than the original</li>
            <li>Better than the original head.</li>
            <li>It shaves much better than my original shaving head.</li>
            <li>Makes shaving easy again.</li>
            <li>It was the correct fit and my shaver cuts my whiskers much more smoothly, closer and leanly now thanit did before replacing the head.</li>
            <li>Easy to find.  </li>
            <li>Easy to switch in and out.</li>
            <li>The replacement head is easy to install.  </li>
            <li>This brand is easy for him to use.</li>
            <li>He was glad to have a clean cut again.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li>The replacement fit perfectly and works as expected.</li>
            <li>and he said it&#x27;s as good as the one it came with when new.</li>
            <li>It also looks good too, and it works just as well as a brand new one would.</li>
            <li>Buying this saved a good bit of money over buying a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>It shaves as good as when it was new.</li>
            <li>Made it work as good as new.</li>
            <li>New life to an old shaver - excellent!</li>
            <li>Much more cost effective than having to purchase a new shaver.</li>
            <li>awesome even if it is a little pricey.</li>
            <li>What a huge difference it made.</li>
            <li>This is the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendation and it was accurate for me.  </li>
            <li>Accurate replacement.</li>
            <li>Quick,clean an smooth says it all.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price anywhere ($16.24 plus qualifies for Amazon free delivery).  </li>
            <li>I have a light beard</li>
            <li>It just takes a lot of effort to shave as smoothly as I wanted.</li>
            <li>A drop of their supplied oil after it dries keeps it running smooth.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent predictable product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li>When was the last time a retailer called you to see if you were happy with your purchases?  </li>
            <li>Great price and find on Amazon ...will definitely buy again from these guys.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as good as the old fashion razor but still does what it needs to.</li>
            <li>Items were as advertised and a good replacements for my old shaver heads</li>
            <li>more can you say about getting the right replacement part</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been happy with the original shaver and look forward to getting back to getting a close shave.</li>
            <li>This fit and looked like the original OEM to my razor.</li>
            <li>short, highly recommended, and yes I DID shop around and this was the best bargain I could find.  </li>
            <li>Clean and comfortable shave even in the shower.</li>
            <li>I have not used the new replacement pack yet but do like the razor and am sure I will be satisfied with this replacement.</li>
            <li>The replacement head performs as well as the original.</li>
            <li>and they emailed me the return label and refunded the original purchase</li>
            <li>The shipment was received in time and the assembly was an original replacent item.   </li>
            <li>I was not disappointed....</li>
            <li>I have not yet exchanged it for the original head</li>
            <li>but I am confidant it will work as well as the original.</li>
            <li>The replacement was an improved model from the one that came with the original shaver.</li>
            <li>Used the original shaving head for well over 18 mos..</li>
            <li>This was an original replacement part for my shaver</li>
            <li>It generally does a good job.  </li>
            <li>No difference whatsoever from the original shaving head.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric razor and I love it.</li>
            <li>The 32S is an exact fitting part for my Braun 330 Type 5776.  </li>
            <li>the replacement blades did not shave as closely as the original blades.  </li>
            <li>After a year, it&#x27;s amazing what a difference a new shaver head makes.</li>
            <li>I followed the advice and effectively now have a brand new shaver for the price of the replacement head.  </li>
            <li>NICE PRICE LIVE SAVER</li>
            <li>nice to have on hand with my new razor purchase instead of waiting for the foil to break and scrambling to get another one.</li>
            <li>I Clean it every day when done using.</li>
            <li>Great replacement head, worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>Its a clean close shave.</li>
            <li>Just keep it clean</li>
            <li>On the series 3, the foil assembly comes off in one piece - you know this as you do this all the time to clean your razor.</li>
            <li>So happy I got this, I was beginning to think I needed a new razor, but this replacement head made it work like new.</li>
            <li>At this price the smart thing to do is to order two, I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li>The hair just glides right off!</li>
            <li>Great product, nice to have a new sharp head.</li>
            <li>Shipping is reasonable (mine was free!)</li>
            <li>but it does do a nice job shaving thus far.</li>
            <li>product gets my FULL GADGET ACCESSORY APPROVAL.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely order more when needed.</li>
            <li>We are well pleased, Thanks</li>
            <li>Seems to be good with close enough shaves.</li>
            <li>But if it is the same head as the one on the shaver, then it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>It is a good upgrade over the standard head.</li>
            <li>Many wanted more (some wanted a LOT more), so choose carefully.  </li>
            <li>Glad I ordered 2 of them since it was the real deal.</li>
            <li>Works out good wish they were cheaper or last longer</li>
            <li>This product offer good advantages to low price.</li>
            <li>new replacement head made my razor work like new good fit clean shave</li>
            <li>It was packaged securely and was in the right size box.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to fit or work quite right.  </li>
            <li>This shaver always took way to long to get a good clean shave with.</li>
            <li>I was getting the heads at walmart and they only would last a couple months at best.</li>
            <li>The replacement pack was shipped quickly and was as advertised.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly as well.    </li>
            <li>Do not expect quick delivery.</li>
            <li>and I received it quickly.  </li>
            <li>The entire process was exceptional.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly as promised.  </li>
            <li>This is my second replacement shaver head I have purchased, and I could not be more satisfied.</li>
            <li>Seems to work all right, though a bit flimsier than the original.  </li>
            <li>Good, only thing not quite right.....</li>
            <li>Exact fit and arrived quickly</li>
            <li>Replacement head is definitely a plus to have as the old head was not cutting very good.  </li>
            <li>How much does the rechargeable battery replacement cost or is it more cost effective to buy a whole new Braun rechargeable razor?  </li>
            <li>My Braun shaver is now almost back to its original condition when I bought it, I&#x27;m really loving once again.</li>
            <li>It is not working since the very first day</li>
            <li>After installing the new head the shaver was as good as new.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s not hard to find replacement parts.</li>
            <li>buying this kept me from having to sink more money into a brand new Braun.</li>
            <li>Glad I thought to try the cartridge replacement before buying a new razor.</li>
            <li>Much better alternative to a new shaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad we didn&#x27;t have to invest in a new razor.</li>
            <li>The Braun shaver cuts better than the one that came on the unit when it was new.</li>
            <li>It worked well, but the new version is MUCH better.</li>
            <li>I love the Braun shavers and when I needed a new head, I ordered this one.  </li>
            <li>works good, fit the razor that it was supposed to fit, not sure what else i can say about it.</li>
            <li>I think my shaver signals it needs a new cutter set a bit early, but I figured it was a good idea to have a spare around.  </li>
            <li>the shaves have been consistently close and clean with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>I guess I forgot how good it used to be versus the apparent steady decline in efficiency over a 2 year period.</li>
            <li>original shave head cover/protector doesn&#x27;t quite fit on this new replacement head, continues to &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; off.</li>
            <li>It came exactly when the order said it would; it snapped right on--fitting beautifully--without having to push, pull, or make a fuss!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth doing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Replace it when it says its worth it</li>
            <li>It was good and as I expected.</li>
            <li>The problem was that even with the knowledge that I own a Braun Series 3 370 electric razor I did not have enough information to get the correct replacement foil and blades.  </li>
            <li>It does LOOK better than my old one though.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to replace nice to have sharp new blades.</li>
            <li>Received quickly and it was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>But after a quick visit to the Braun site I knew exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>and if you don&#x27;t use the combo cleaner/charger stand to make sure and clean it regularly with some soap and water to disinfect it.</li>
            <li>Have had very good luck getting close, and long lasting shaves with this product.</li>
            <li>I get an eight-pack of carts for that razor every couple of years, right here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>and they are probably right on about that.</li>
            <li>i ordered one right away what a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;They say you should change them out every 6 months, so that&#x27;s about right.</li>
            <li>and I would say that is about right.</li>
            <li>I was looking for the right head to replace my husband&#x27;s shaver.</li>
            <li>Not knowing anything about shavers, I looked on the Braun website and figured out the right model..</li>
            <li>it is for the right razor.</li>
            <li>It is easy to install and makes it a new shaver</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to install and makes it a new shaver again</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the few dollars to no longer have razor burn and a nice close shave!</li>
            <li>That makes is much easier to clean everything,</li>
            <li>So a head for the particular series may fit one model and not another.  </li>
            <li>Sure saved us having to pay for a whole new shaver.  </li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s razor was long overdue for a new razor head for his Braun, and the new head made his razor like new, and he&#x27;s very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I have a tough beard and can&#x27;t get a good shave with many electric razors.   </li>
            <li>With this replacement, I get as close and comfortable shave as I did when the shaver was new.</li>
            <li>I was using another well recommended product and couldn&#x27;t find it available here where I live, so I decided to try this one</li>
            <li>Shipped in a large box to prevent damage!</li>
            <li>I have a Braun series 3, which I like very much.</li>
            <li>Great price- hard to find these at the drug store anymore.</li>
            <li>once a week, which works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>My razor is now working like it did when I first bought it.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a customer for several years and love your customer service.       </li>
            <li>I was not sure of the quality of the product when I ordered as the price was excellent compared to local Meijer and WallMart centers.  </li>
            <li>Now it feels just like it did when I first purchased it.  </li>
            <li>My first Braun shaver (actually my first electric shaver) and had it for two years.</li>
            <li>This is the first replacement head I have purchased after 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and more stubble in the middle of the day</li>
            <li>It gives a pretty close shave</li>
            <li>It made shaving so much faster!</li>
            <li>We couldn&#x27;t believe that all went so very smoothly--without even having to drive an hour to find a store that MIGHT sell them!  </li>
            <li>The replacement shaver head was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>The first was bought in Germany.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve had a similar problem with many people: buying a shaver head that appears to work for Braun series 3, then finding out that it&#x27;s just the cutter and will not work.</li>
            <li>This shaver head is the first one I found that is exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seemed to cut well at first.</li>
            <li>hubby likes it, says it shaves smoothly enough, and it doesn&#x27;t sound like a lawn mower!</li>
            <li>From this point on, the massive confusion about WHAT is the appropriate part number to order to replace my Braun Series 3 - 350cc shaver head.  </li>
            <li>Braun says that there are many different Series 3 razors and heads</li>
            <li>The reason for this is that many resellers buy smaller items in bulk to save on cost from the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>like the first day I bought the razor.  </li>
            <li>I was so surprised at how smoothly it worked.</li>
            <li>Exactly what was required.</li>
            <li>Too many different 3 series shavers.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price for an exact  replacement.</li>
            <li>These were exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>These are different for all Braun series get the right one for you razor and change it more often and you will be much happier with the shave.</li>
            <li>was exactly the right replacement part absolutely what we wanted no complaints</li>
            <li>This replacement far exceeds the original part that came with the Braun</li>
            <li>But when it starts to get dull, you welcome the opportunity to buy a new one and it&#x27;s worth the money just to do what I did</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s well worth replacing it with this even if the foil and blades are still in decent shape.</li>
            <li>Braun razors are the best especially for thick stubble.  </li>
            <li>It cut the facial hair much faster and my skin felt so much better afterwards.</li>
            <li>Check the model number carefully to make sure you get the right head.</li>
            <li>i use the cleaning station to keep it clean and lubricated, If i did not keep it clean and oiled it would have not lasted that long.</li>
            <li>But the only way to make sure it fit or not was to cut open the packaging.  </li>
            <li>Amazon on the other hand wins top scores for ease of ordering AND return.  </li>
            <li>Great made the razor like new again, fitted as hoped, not much more that I can say really, that&#x27;s it .</li>
            <li>Read the other reviews and make sure you have the right razor...</li>
            <li>Another problem is that my razor came with a big plastic contraption into which you insert the razor for easy cleaning.  </li>
            <li>My shaver not only works like new but the replacement head is chrome and has a better appearance.</li>
            <li>Changed out my old cartridge for my new one, now &amp;#34;my face is as smooth as an Androids bottom!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I was waiting for the little light to light up and indicate it was time to replace my blade cartridge.</li>
            <li>AS GOOD AS MY DULL BRAUN.  </li>
            <li>The old shaver head was not giving clean cuts but with this new one</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>and the unit is packaged well and shipped fast.</li>
            <li>I had assurances from two different department managers that they would order the items but they have never been available in 1 1/2 years.  </li>
            <li>Very reliable.  </li>
            <li>Came fast.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I received the item fast and intact.</li>
            <li>very well-spent.  </li>
            <li>I really like my shaver and this replacement part was made for and</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much I can say about this.</li>
            <li>This Braun replacement head is working really well, and I would recommend it to family and friend.</li>
            <li>They really need to fix the trimmer problem though.</li>
            <li>Would readily buy again.</li>
            <li>This shaver provides a very close shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li>My beard destroys electric shaver cutters fast.  </li>
            <li>Fast shippment</li>
            <li>This is a real problem with this razor system.</li>
            <li>is very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>So I ordered the 32s and waited with much trepidation, hoping I had ordered the correct shaver head.  </li>
            <li>This item delivered on schedule and the package was very good.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I should really have changed the head a year ago.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Not only was it cheaper but it was super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It was time to replace existing shaver head - and the first use with this new one proved it.</li>
            <li>This was an exact replacement for my shaver head and is way cheaper than a new shaver.</li>
            <li>Great product, it&#x27;s like having  new shaver and the price was allot less than the same head on the Braun website.</li>
            <li>easy to install and lasts a long time</li>
            <li>Make sure you order the correct head as they apparently change models frequently and many are similar in appearance but not the same.  </li>
            <li>I only shave every other day or so, so this lasts me a good year, if not longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have an extra replacement cutter head, and always have one clean and ready to change out.  </li>
            <li>This replacement head is actually nicer than the original head.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have stated, you should be able to read \\&quot;32S\\&quot; molded into the plastic beneath the trimmer attachment.</li>
            <li>The only issue is that I the cutters and/or foil may be sub-standard to the original parts.  </li>
            <li>I also recommend the clean and renew 4 pack solution also from Amazon which I set on auto ship for the extra discount.</li>
            <li>It has irregular shaped holes that really make a difference in catching all the hairs, especially when shaving dry.</li>
            <li>I rated this product with two stars because the foils don&#x27;t seem to last as long or cut smoothly as when I originally purchased the razor.</li>
            <li>Plus, with a new shaver you actually get improved features and can rethink what&#x27;s important to you in a shaver.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the full head and simply attached to the shaver body and works</li>
            <li>I replaced the head on my Braun 370 with this and it shaves like a new razor!</li>
            <li>Everything works just like new!</li>
            <li>Put it on and had a basically new razor, would recommend to anyone looking for one!</li>
            <li>Delivery was really fast, popped it on the shaver, and voila, it works like new.  </li>
            <li>(I noticed after 1.5 years of use it does not move the cutter as fast as when new.)</li>
            <li>The Panasonic  is a much older shaver but with the replacement head and blades I just purchased for it also</li>
            <li>The razor doesn&#x27;t give a good shave, even with new head, but it&#x27;s lasting, so I won&#x27;t mess with what&#x27;s working.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this quality replacement shaving head.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this seller</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll highly reccommend it to any customer.</li>
            <li>And why would you need new blades for a new shaver already unless you are a real plan-aheader?  </li>
            <li>It cleans easily, stays sharp</li>
            <li>and it had just broken off a piece of the foil on the head, hence, a good way to slice up your face.  </li>
            <li>The part easily replaced the other part and cuts like new.</li>
            <li>After six months of good but not great shaves, I bought a new head to see if that would  be an improvement.</li>

            <li>This was an inexpensive alternative to a new shaver.</li>
            <li>Just  saying for new shoppers.</li>
            <li>BOUGHT A NEW ROTARY RAZOR AND TRIED FOR A WEEK.  </li>
            <li>sometimes they are not in a \\&quot;Braun\\&quot; retail package, but they come new wrapped in bubble wrap.  </li>

            <li>and i Get a new one.</li>
            <li>three weeks before i bought the new head.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy a new head to see if it would help.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like bran new again.</li>
            <li>- you place the new foil assembly on and you shave.</li>
            <li>made my razor work like new again</li>
            <li>I have been using my electric razor with dull blades for so long that this was amazing!</li>
            <li>Not more complaining for a while :)</li>
            <li>better than Baun products bought in past.</li>
            <li>32S and 32B are exactly the same in terms of the foil and cutters.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t do it on my first order, but will on my next.  </li>
            <li>We had to find our first replacement head  and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere locally, so I was so relieved to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>(so they don&#x27;t understand the whole point of making something a particular series and something else a different series).  </li>
            <li>Replacing my old head with this new head made it shave just like the day I bought it.</li>
            <li>After noticing that the performance of my razor was not it used to be, I went ahead and bought the new blade cartridge early.</li>
            <li>It takes about 1 minute to replace - remove from packaging, throw the old one out, and snap the new one into place.  </li>
            <li>works as designed; brought new life to my years old electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>Did not realize the difference in shave until I replaced my old worn out head with this new replacemnet head.</li>
            <li>That being said, I must have misread the description of this product (easy to do when you are missing your eyeballs, ocular nerves, and brain).  </li>
            <li>Hopefully this replacement will last as long as the original.</li>
            <li>I kept ignoring the little flashing light to replace the blades on my Braun 370 shaver.  </li>
            <li>Actually even a little better.</li>
            <li>When it arrived, the housing was silver, vs. the original black.  </li>
            <li>I had to have my son that has had one of these for many years that got me to buy one and after about 2 years it was dull</li>
            <li>It seems that my original head did not last very long.</li>
            <li>He had been using an old, old, old head and is the type to just complain but not do anything about the problem.</li>
            <li>I thought because the head was over 18 months old that replacing it might help.</li>
            <li>This replacement pack seems to be much sharper and hopefully last awhile.</li>
            <li>I have had my shaver for over a year and the old head had a hole in it.</li>
            <li>Just snap it in like the old one.  </li>
            <li>I replaced the head in my shaver, as the old one was about 18 months old.</li>
            <li>My old razor head was worn out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Didn&#x27;t realize how worn out my old head was.&lt;br /&gt;After replacing it my shave improved dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>; Haha (Star Trek, Next gen, #1 to Data)</li>
            <li>I used my old series 3 head once a week for 3 years.</li>
            <li>Naturally I freaked.  </li>
            <li>shaves from this that are nearly as close and complete as I get from my Series 7.  </li>
            <li>you have the old style foil</li>
            <li>That is how they can sell to you at such a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I had been using my old razor head for about 3 years.</li>
            <li>I was totally surprised.</li>
            <li>Also, this \\&quot;pack\\&quot; includes just one complete replacement head, so you may need another eventually.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize until I did that the old one was blunt.  </li>
            <li>Now with this replacement, it seems to me that I have considerable stubble in the evening.</li>
            <li>With this kit, you take the old foil assembly off -</li>
            <li>The price was good, somewhat less than I&#x27;ve paid for comparable merchandise in the past five to seven years.</li>
            <li>It was amazing, i now love this razor as much as i hated it before the new head was purchased.</li>
            <li>Take off the old head (with the foil and blades, which do wear out over time), open the package, mount the new head.</li>
            <li>This replacement head was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>these replaced the original heads that developed a small tear in the screen.  </li>
            <li>A new set of blades restored my shaver and the battery seems to now last longer; suggest you follow the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendation and replace blades every 2 years or so.</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;m getting a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Simple snap on and my razor is new.  </li>
            <li>I can use this razor until the mechanisms break instead of having to upgrade to a new one just because my local store no longer carries the replacement foil.</li>
            <li>I have wor out 2 of the Braun shavers in the last 10 years or so and they do need a new head ever 18mo or so.</li>
            <li>The Braun shaver is such high quality, that it will last far longer than the head.  </li>
            <li>Lasted 1.5 years, worked fine, just got dull eventually</li>
            <li>The foil mesh cover seems to be a little thicker than the original but overall, works well.</li>
            <li>Complex holes pattern, worked fine for nearly two years, then the foil chipped away causing potential face lacerations.&lt;br /&gt;-Replacement cartridge #2 from Amazon:</li>
            <li>The instruction booklet clearly stated &#x27;32S&#x27; was the proper replacement cassette, so there was no problem getting the correct one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>well it still barely cuts.  </li>
            <li>My Braun 380S came with the old style foil that had a regular pattern of holes.</li>
            <li>My last head splunked into the toilet, so I decided to get a new head!</li>
            <li>It really did the job for the time.&lt;br /&gt;After using is everyday its time to change it and get a new one.</li>
            <li>I have ordered replacement parts for my razors in the past only to find they fit differently.</li>
            <li>Restored performance to near new level as others have said in other reviews.  </li>
            <li>As with all shavers, the replacement blades are overpriced, about half the cost of a brand new shaver w/blades, charger, travel case and everything else that comes new.</li>
            <li>The price was half that of a large chain department store.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m due for a new one of these!  </li>
            <li>It is necessary to replace the shaving head about every 18 months due to normal wear.  </li>
            <li>New and sharp.</li>
            <li>This a stupid requirement to insist on 9 more words required when all you need to know is th first 4 words!</li>

            <li> so I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have always been very satisfied with my Braun shaver and replacement parts.</li>
            <li> These guys even called me to make sure I got the item and that I was happy.  </li>
            <li> It works great and the price is better than Wal-Mart.  </li>
            <li> This was a repeat buy, and am very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> This is a great devise, just make sure that you do kit drop it on the head if the razor.</li>
            <li> I love my shaver and was happy when I got the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> The Series 3 Braun shavers are the best, and this replacement head is very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed and it&#x27;s working great!  </li>

            <li> I get a nice close shave with this razor</li>
            <li> I liked the product and will recommend it to everyone.  </li>
            <li> Amazon had the best price and fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> In my own case it meant having to extend the trimmer up so that you can see the imprint.  </li>
            <li> I am glad to see a GOOD deal here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I kind of messed up here.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a functioning razor again.</li>
            <li> What is really nice is not having to go to the store and shop and shop to find this.</li>
            <li> Dennis loved that I was able to find this on line.  </li>
            <li> It was so nice to find the replacement head instead of rebuying another razor.</li>
            <li> good product easy installation very satisfied</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment, good price, perfect fit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s new and cuts and shaves wonderfully ...</li>
            <li> Great price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the cost of this item and have always liked the value of doing business with AMAZON.com</li>
            <li> Braun is a great product and worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this razor and happy that I can get replacement heads at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s very impressive considering that the 3 series is far below the cost of a 7 series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good, perfectly fit for my Braun Series 3-340s Shaver (B004UQ6Q62).</li>
            <li> Exactly  as advertised and perfect fit</li>
            <li> Easy to attach and provides a very smooth and close shave!</li>
            <li> the head works as good as the original</li>
            <li> Original was good and lasted for two years.</li>
            <li> It is just as good as the original that came with the shaver.</li>
            <li> well worth every cent for a real nice clean shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the original product, fast delivery, would recommend to anyone very, very good original spare parts braun taken Amazon</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he is very happy - still weeks later.</li>
            <li> What more do you want?</li>
            <li> I thought if I bought them on line, maybe they were better then walmart (sometimes they have a cheaper product).</li>
            <li> I love this place.</li>
            <li> Third time I bought these and as always they work great!!</li>
            <li> The pack fits my razor and work well making shaving much more bareable.</li>
            <li> The Braun Series 3 380 takes the 32S (or 32B I believe, but who the heck can really be sure?)</li>
            <li> They work well when matched up, but come on people, you can do waaay better than this.</li>
            <li> I ordered one so that after 18 months I would be sure to have the replacement.  </li>
            <li> The Braun does a much better job than most.   </li>
            <li> After awhile though it seemed more like a dermatitis.</li>
            <li> I brought these when I bought my shaver and tested one to make sure it works OK.  </li>
            <li> reviews - too many rules.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and effective to shave with.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Pleased with product as advertised and</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED ELECTRIC SHAVERS MOST OF MY LIFE OF 74 YEARS.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it contained the blades as well</li>
            <li> What more do I need to say to meet the minimum wood count.</li>
            <li> Have used this shaver for about a year and am pleased with the closeness and smoothness of the shave.</li>
            <li> The replacement blade was reasonably priced and works great.</li>
            <li> Item was just what I needed at a better than competitive price.  </li>
            <li> Glad it is still around.</li>
            <li> I realize that it is a Series 3 and the latest model is a Series 7</li>
            <li> however, it&#x27;s still a BRAUN product which I feel is a top of the line razor and should provide many years of service.</li>
            <li> Only thing that fits my Braun&lt;br /&gt;Works Great will check prices  when time for another one&lt;br /&gt;Cheap price !</li>
            <li> I priced the replacement heads at four different stores and found  Amazons the best.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave!</li>
            <li> my shaver now works better than the head that came on it from wally world.</li>
            <li> love love love</li>
            <li> It is better than the replacement without the chrome.</li>
            <li> I have to change the head way more often than the manufactuer recommed, However it is still cheaper than buying blades</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize you were supposed to change these more often.</li>
            <li> I am happily satisfied.</li>
            <li> It fit!  </li>
            <li> If you buy a Braun electric shaver, make sure to get a replacement head.  </li>
            <li> The shaver works so much better.  </li>
            <li> Better price than Walmart</li>
            <li> love my Braun.</li>
            <li> The newer, the better, because it&#x27;s sharper and can handle even a load of hair that&#x27;s been growing for three or four days.</li>
            <li> But thats ok.</li>
            <li> We had purchased another razor before this one, but he likes this one much better, and he&#x27;s 60.  </li>
            <li> Braun saving products is all that I have used for many years.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I paid a fraction of what Target was selling these for and you have to love that.</li>
            <li> For his favorite razor.</li>
            <li> I still think rotaries are a better value provided they work.</li>
            <li> The product is just OK...</li>
            <li> We may still have to order more if we want to continue to use the shaver</li>
            <li> Exactly what I asked for a new shaving  right part for the best shaver compliments my razor perfectly great job braun</li>
            <li> I found a right match at good price at amazon.</li>
            <li> From the first shave, I was very impressed about what a good clean shave it gave me, and it made me realize how worn out the old one was.  </li>
            <li> Great new replacement screens.  </li>
            <li> Great as always...makes it like a new razor every time.</li>
            <li> Finally a clean shave again!</li>
            <li> The Amazon price is very good, and I also order the cleaning solution with the 15% discount for a regular delivery.</li>
            <li> very good element ten points</li>
            <li> Just like original - I change more often that they recommend (18 months) because a new cutter feels great.</li>
            <li> Many times a replacement blade seems cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Excellent product as expected.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, great shave compared to old worn head.</li>
            <li> Replacement head fit my razor and works better than the one I dropped.</li>
            <li> Good quality and reasonable prices.</li>
            <li> Even better than the original</li>
            <li> Better than the original head.</li>
            <li> It shaves much better than my original shaving head.</li>
            <li> Makes shaving easy again.</li>
            <li> It was the correct fit and my shaver cuts my whiskers much more smoothly, closer and leanly now thanit did before replacing the head.</li>
            <li> Easy to find.  </li>
            <li> Easy to switch in and out.</li>
            <li> The replacement head is easy to install.  </li>
            <li> This brand is easy for him to use.</li>
            <li> He was glad to have a clean cut again.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> The replacement fit perfectly and works as expected.</li>
            <li> and he said it&#x27;s as good as the one it came with when new.</li>
            <li> It also looks good too, and it works just as well as a brand new one would.</li>
            <li> Buying this saved a good bit of money over buying a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> It shaves as good as when it was new.</li>
            <li> Made it work as good as new.</li>
            <li> New life to an old shaver - excellent!</li>
            <li> Much more cost effective than having to purchase a new shaver.</li>
            <li> awesome even if it is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> What a huge difference it made.</li>
            <li> This is the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendation and it was accurate for me.  </li>
            <li> Accurate replacement.</li>
            <li> Quick,clean an smooth says it all.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price anywhere ($16.24 plus qualifies for Amazon free delivery).  </li>
            <li> I have a light beard</li>
            <li> It just takes a lot of effort to shave as smoothly as I wanted.</li>
            <li> A drop of their supplied oil after it dries keeps it running smooth.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent predictable product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li> When was the last time a retailer called you to see if you were happy with your purchases?  </li>
            <li> Great price and find on Amazon ...will definitely buy again from these guys.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as good as the old fashion razor but still does what it needs to.</li>
            <li> Items were as advertised and a good replacements for my old shaver heads</li>
            <li> more can you say about getting the right replacement part</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been happy with the original shaver and look forward to getting back to getting a close shave.</li>
            <li> This fit and looked like the original OEM to my razor.</li>
            <li> short, highly recommended, and yes I DID shop around and this was the best bargain I could find.  </li>
            <li> Clean and comfortable shave even in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have not used the new replacement pack yet but do like the razor and am sure I will be satisfied with this replacement.</li>
            <li> The replacement head performs as well as the original.</li>
            <li> and they emailed me the return label and refunded the original purchase</li>
            <li> The shipment was received in time and the assembly was an original replacent item.   </li>
            <li> I was not disappointed....</li>
            <li> I have not yet exchanged it for the original head</li>
            <li> but I am confidant it will work as well as the original.</li>
            <li> The replacement was an improved model from the one that came with the original shaver.</li>
            <li> Used the original shaving head for well over 18 mos..</li>
            <li> This was an original replacement part for my shaver</li>
            <li> It generally does a good job.  </li>
            <li> No difference whatsoever from the original shaving head.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor and I love it.</li>
            <li> The 32S is an exact fitting part for my Braun 330 Type 5776.  </li>
            <li> the replacement blades did not shave as closely as the original blades.  </li>
            <li> After a year, it&#x27;s amazing what a difference a new shaver head makes.</li>
            <li> I followed the advice and effectively now have a brand new shaver for the price of the replacement head.  </li>
            <li> NICE PRICE LIVE SAVER</li>
            <li> nice to have on hand with my new razor purchase instead of waiting for the foil to break and scrambling to get another one.</li>
            <li> I Clean it every day when done using.</li>
            <li> Great replacement head, worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Its a clean close shave.</li>
            <li> Just keep it clean</li>
            <li> On the series 3, the foil assembly comes off in one piece - you know this as you do this all the time to clean your razor.</li>
            <li> So happy I got this, I was beginning to think I needed a new razor, but this replacement head made it work like new.</li>
            <li> At this price the smart thing to do is to order two, I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li> The hair just glides right off!</li>
            <li> Great product, nice to have a new sharp head.</li>
            <li> Shipping is reasonable (mine was free!)</li>
            <li> but it does do a nice job shaving thus far.</li>
            <li> product gets my FULL GADGET ACCESSORY APPROVAL.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely order more when needed.</li>
            <li> We are well pleased, Thanks</li>
            <li> Seems to be good with close enough shaves.</li>
            <li> But if it is the same head as the one on the shaver, then it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> It is a good upgrade over the standard head.</li>
            <li> Many wanted more (some wanted a LOT more), so choose carefully.  </li>
            <li> Glad I ordered 2 of them since it was the real deal.</li>
            <li> Works out good wish they were cheaper or last longer</li>
            <li> This product offer good advantages to low price.</li>
            <li> new replacement head made my razor work like new good fit clean shave</li>
            <li> It was packaged securely and was in the right size box.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to fit or work quite right.  </li>
            <li> This shaver always took way to long to get a good clean shave with.</li>
            <li> I was getting the heads at walmart and they only would last a couple months at best.</li>
            <li> The replacement pack was shipped quickly and was as advertised.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly as well.    </li>
            <li> Do not expect quick delivery.</li>
            <li> and I received it quickly.  </li>
            <li> The entire process was exceptional.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly as promised.  </li>
            <li> This is my second replacement shaver head I have purchased, and I could not be more satisfied.</li>
            <li> Seems to work all right, though a bit flimsier than the original.  </li>
            <li> Good, only thing not quite right.....</li>
            <li> Exact fit and arrived quickly</li>
            <li> Replacement head is definitely a plus to have as the old head was not cutting very good.  </li>
            <li> How much does the rechargeable battery replacement cost or is it more cost effective to buy a whole new Braun rechargeable razor?  </li>
            <li> My Braun shaver is now almost back to its original condition when I bought it, I&#x27;m really loving once again.</li>
            <li> It is not working since the very first day</li>
            <li> After installing the new head the shaver was as good as new.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s not hard to find replacement parts.</li>
            <li> buying this kept me from having to sink more money into a brand new Braun.</li>
            <li> Glad I thought to try the cartridge replacement before buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> Much better alternative to a new shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad we didn&#x27;t have to invest in a new razor.</li>
            <li> The Braun shaver cuts better than the one that came on the unit when it was new.</li>
            <li> It worked well, but the new version is MUCH better.</li>
            <li> I love the Braun shavers and when I needed a new head, I ordered this one.  </li>
            <li> works good, fit the razor that it was supposed to fit, not sure what else i can say about it.</li>
            <li> I think my shaver signals it needs a new cutter set a bit early, but I figured it was a good idea to have a spare around.  </li>
            <li> the shaves have been consistently close and clean with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> I guess I forgot how good it used to be versus the apparent steady decline in efficiency over a 2 year period.</li>
            <li> original shave head cover/protector doesn&#x27;t quite fit on this new replacement head, continues to &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; off.</li>
            <li> It came exactly when the order said it would; it snapped right on--fitting beautifully--without having to push, pull, or make a fuss!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth doing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Replace it when it says its worth it</li>
            <li> It was good and as I expected.</li>
            <li> The problem was that even with the knowledge that I own a Braun Series 3 370 electric razor I did not have enough information to get the correct replacement foil and blades.  </li>
            <li> It does LOOK better than my old one though.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to replace nice to have sharp new blades.</li>
            <li> Received quickly and it was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> But after a quick visit to the Braun site I knew exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> and if you don&#x27;t use the combo cleaner/charger stand to make sure and clean it regularly with some soap and water to disinfect it.</li>
            <li> Have had very good luck getting close, and long lasting shaves with this product.</li>
            <li> I get an eight-pack of carts for that razor every couple of years, right here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> and they are probably right on about that.</li>
            <li> i ordered one right away what a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;They say you should change them out every 6 months, so that&#x27;s about right.</li>
            <li> and I would say that is about right.</li>
            <li> I was looking for the right head to replace my husband&#x27;s shaver.</li>
            <li> Not knowing anything about shavers, I looked on the Braun website and figured out the right model..</li>
            <li> it is for the right razor.</li>
            <li> It is easy to install and makes it a new shaver</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to install and makes it a new shaver again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the few dollars to no longer have razor burn and a nice close shave!</li>
            <li> That makes is much easier to clean everything,</li>
            <li> So a head for the particular series may fit one model and not another.  </li>
            <li> Sure saved us having to pay for a whole new shaver.  </li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s razor was long overdue for a new razor head for his Braun, and the new head made his razor like new, and he&#x27;s very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard and can&#x27;t get a good shave with many electric razors.   </li>
            <li> With this replacement, I get as close and comfortable shave as I did when the shaver was new.</li>
            <li> I was using another well recommended product and couldn&#x27;t find it available here where I live, so I decided to try this one</li>
            <li> Shipped in a large box to prevent damage!</li>
            <li> I have a Braun series 3, which I like very much.</li>
            <li> Great price- hard to find these at the drug store anymore.</li>
            <li> once a week, which works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> My razor is now working like it did when I first bought it.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a customer for several years and love your customer service.       </li>
            <li> I was not sure of the quality of the product when I ordered as the price was excellent compared to local Meijer and WallMart centers.  </li>
            <li> Now it feels just like it did when I first purchased it.  </li>
            <li> My first Braun shaver (actually my first electric shaver) and had it for two years.</li>
            <li> This is the first replacement head I have purchased after 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and more stubble in the middle of the day</li>
            <li> It gives a pretty close shave</li>
            <li> It made shaving so much faster!</li>
            <li> We couldn&#x27;t believe that all went so very smoothly--without even having to drive an hour to find a store that MIGHT sell them!  </li>
            <li> The replacement shaver head was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> The first was bought in Germany.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve had a similar problem with many people: buying a shaver head that appears to work for Braun series 3, then finding out that it&#x27;s just the cutter and will not work.</li>
            <li> This shaver head is the first one I found that is exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seemed to cut well at first.</li>
            <li> hubby likes it, says it shaves smoothly enough, and it doesn&#x27;t sound like a lawn mower!</li>
            <li> From this point on, the massive confusion about WHAT is the appropriate part number to order to replace my Braun Series 3 - 350cc shaver head.  </li>
            <li> Braun says that there are many different Series 3 razors and heads</li>
            <li> The reason for this is that many resellers buy smaller items in bulk to save on cost from the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> like the first day I bought the razor.  </li>
            <li> I was so surprised at how smoothly it worked.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was required.</li>
            <li> Too many different 3 series shavers.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price for an exact  replacement.</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> These are different for all Braun series get the right one for you razor and change it more often and you will be much happier with the shave.</li>
            <li> was exactly the right replacement part absolutely what we wanted no complaints</li>
            <li> This replacement far exceeds the original part that came with the Braun</li>
            <li> But when it starts to get dull, you welcome the opportunity to buy a new one and it&#x27;s worth the money just to do what I did</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s well worth replacing it with this even if the foil and blades are still in decent shape.</li>
            <li> Braun razors are the best especially for thick stubble.  </li>
            <li> It cut the facial hair much faster and my skin felt so much better afterwards.</li>
            <li> Check the model number carefully to make sure you get the right head.</li>
            <li> i use the cleaning station to keep it clean and lubricated, If i did not keep it clean and oiled it would have not lasted that long.</li>
            <li> But the only way to make sure it fit or not was to cut open the packaging.  </li>
            <li> Amazon on the other hand wins top scores for ease of ordering AND return.  </li>
            <li> Great made the razor like new again, fitted as hoped, not much more that I can say really, that&#x27;s it .</li>
            <li> Read the other reviews and make sure you have the right razor...</li>
            <li> Another problem is that my razor came with a big plastic contraption into which you insert the razor for easy cleaning.  </li>
            <li> My shaver not only works like new but the replacement head is chrome and has a better appearance.</li>
            <li> Changed out my old cartridge for my new one, now &amp;#34;my face is as smooth as an Androids bottom!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I was waiting for the little light to light up and indicate it was time to replace my blade cartridge.</li>
            <li> AS GOOD AS MY DULL BRAUN.  </li>
            <li> The old shaver head was not giving clean cuts but with this new one</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> and the unit is packaged well and shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I had assurances from two different department managers that they would order the items but they have never been available in 1 1/2 years.  </li>
            <li> Very reliable.  </li>
            <li> Came fast.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I received the item fast and intact.</li>
            <li> very well-spent.  </li>
            <li> I really like my shaver and this replacement part was made for and</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much I can say about this.</li>
            <li> This Braun replacement head is working really well, and I would recommend it to family and friend.</li>
            <li> They really need to fix the trimmer problem though.</li>
            <li> Would readily buy again.</li>
            <li> This shaver provides a very close shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li> My beard destroys electric shaver cutters fast.  </li>
            <li> Fast shippment</li>
            <li> This is a real problem with this razor system.</li>
            <li> is very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> So I ordered the 32s and waited with much trepidation, hoping I had ordered the correct shaver head.  </li>
            <li> This item delivered on schedule and the package was very good.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I should really have changed the head a year ago.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Not only was it cheaper but it was super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It was time to replace existing shaver head - and the first use with this new one proved it.</li>
            <li> This was an exact replacement for my shaver head and is way cheaper than a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Great product, it&#x27;s like having  new shaver and the price was allot less than the same head on the Braun website.</li>
            <li> easy to install and lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Make sure you order the correct head as they apparently change models frequently and many are similar in appearance but not the same.  </li>
            <li> I only shave every other day or so, so this lasts me a good year, if not longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have an extra replacement cutter head, and always have one clean and ready to change out.  </li>
            <li> This replacement head is actually nicer than the original head.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, you should be able to read \\&quot;32S\\&quot; molded into the plastic beneath the trimmer attachment.</li>
            <li> The only issue is that I the cutters and/or foil may be sub-standard to the original parts.  </li>
            <li> I also recommend the clean and renew 4 pack solution also from Amazon which I set on auto ship for the extra discount.</li>
            <li> It has irregular shaped holes that really make a difference in catching all the hairs, especially when shaving dry.</li>
            <li> I rated this product with two stars because the foils don&#x27;t seem to last as long or cut smoothly as when I originally purchased the razor.</li>
            <li> Plus, with a new shaver you actually get improved features and can rethink what&#x27;s important to you in a shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the full head and simply attached to the shaver body and works</li>
            <li> I replaced the head on my Braun 370 with this and it shaves like a new razor!</li>
            <li> Everything works just like new!</li>
            <li> Put it on and had a basically new razor, would recommend to anyone looking for one!</li>
            <li> Delivery was really fast, popped it on the shaver, and voila, it works like new.  </li>
            <li> (I noticed after 1.5 years of use it does not move the cutter as fast as when new.)</li>
            <li> The Panasonic  is a much older shaver but with the replacement head and blades I just purchased for it also</li>
            <li> The razor doesn&#x27;t give a good shave, even with new head, but it&#x27;s lasting, so I won&#x27;t mess with what&#x27;s working.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this quality replacement shaving head.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this seller</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll highly reccommend it to any customer.</li>
            <li> And why would you need new blades for a new shaver already unless you are a real plan-aheader?  </li>
            <li> It cleans easily, stays sharp</li>
            <li> and it had just broken off a piece of the foil on the head, hence, a good way to slice up your face.  </li>
            <li> The part easily replaced the other part and cuts like new.</li>
            <li> After six months of good but not great shaves, I bought a new head to see if that would  be an improvement.</li>
            <li> My beard is on the coarse side, but the Series 3 goes right through it without any pulls or yanks.</li>
            <li> These new blades cut my shaving time more than in half from the old, worn blades.  </li>
            <li> The quality of the item was of the usual high standard you expect from Braun, and worked beautifully was easy to fit and restored my shaver to as new cutting performance Would use this trader again .</li>
            <li> My Braun razor is now like brand new-----</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to the \\&quot;longevity\\&quot; of the head/cutters because the shaver is fairly new</li>
            <li> My shaver is now performing like new</li>

            <li> Made my razor shave like new.  </li>
            <li> This was an inexpensive alternative to a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Just  saying for new shoppers.</li>
            <li> BOUGHT A NEW ROTARY RAZOR AND TRIED FOR A WEEK.  </li>
            <li> sometimes they are not in a \\&quot;Braun\\&quot; retail package, but they come new wrapped in bubble wrap.  </li>
            <li> Just like new again</li>

            <li> work like new.  </li>
            <li> and i Get a new one.</li>
            <li> three weeks before i bought the new head.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy a new head to see if it would help.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like bran new again.</li>
            <li> - you place the new foil assembly on and you shave.</li>
            <li> made my razor work like new again</li>
            <li> I have been using my electric razor with dull blades for so long that this was amazing!</li>
            <li> Not more complaining for a while :)</li>
            <li> better than Baun products bought in past.</li>
            <li> 32S and 32B are exactly the same in terms of the foil and cutters.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t do it on my first order, but will on my next.  </li>
            <li> We had to find our first replacement head  and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere locally, so I was so relieved to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> (so they don&#x27;t understand the whole point of making something a particular series and something else a different series).  </li>
            <li> Replacing my old head with this new head made it shave just like the day I bought it.</li>
            <li> After noticing that the performance of my razor was not it used to be, I went ahead and bought the new blade cartridge early.</li>
            <li> It takes about 1 minute to replace - remove from packaging, throw the old one out, and snap the new one into place.  </li>
            <li> works as designed; brought new life to my years old electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> Did not realize the difference in shave until I replaced my old worn out head with this new replacemnet head.</li>
            <li> That being said, I must have misread the description of this product (easy to do when you are missing your eyeballs, ocular nerves, and brain).  </li>
            <li> Hopefully this replacement will last as long as the original.</li>
            <li> I kept ignoring the little flashing light to replace the blades on my Braun 370 shaver.  </li>
            <li> Actually even a little better.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, the housing was silver, vs. the original black.  </li>
            <li> I had to have my son that has had one of these for many years that got me to buy one and after about 2 years it was dull</li>
            <li> It seems that my original head did not last very long.</li>
            <li> He had been using an old, old, old head and is the type to just complain but not do anything about the problem.</li>
            <li> I thought because the head was over 18 months old that replacing it might help.</li>
            <li> This replacement pack seems to be much sharper and hopefully last awhile.</li>
            <li> I have had my shaver for over a year and the old head had a hole in it.</li>
            <li> Just snap it in like the old one.  </li>
            <li> I replaced the head in my shaver, as the old one was about 18 months old.</li>
            <li> My old razor head was worn out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Didn&#x27;t realize how worn out my old head was.&lt;br /&gt;After replacing it my shave improved dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> ; Haha (Star Trek, Next gen, #1 to Data)</li>
            <li> I used my old series 3 head once a week for 3 years.</li>
            <li> Naturally I freaked.  </li>
            <li> shaves from this that are nearly as close and complete as I get from my Series 7.  </li>
            <li> you have the old style foil</li>
            <li> That is how they can sell to you at such a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I had been using my old razor head for about 3 years.</li>
            <li> I was totally surprised.</li>
            <li> Also, this \\&quot;pack\\&quot; includes just one complete replacement head, so you may need another eventually.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize until I did that the old one was blunt.  </li>
            <li> Now with this replacement, it seems to me that I have considerable stubble in the evening.</li>
            <li> With this kit, you take the old foil assembly off -</li>
            <li> The price was good, somewhat less than I&#x27;ve paid for comparable merchandise in the past five to seven years.</li>
            <li> It was amazing, i now love this razor as much as i hated it before the new head was purchased.</li>
            <li> Take off the old head (with the foil and blades, which do wear out over time), open the package, mount the new head.</li>
            <li> This replacement head was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> these replaced the original heads that developed a small tear in the screen.  </li>
            <li> A new set of blades restored my shaver and the battery seems to now last longer; suggest you follow the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendation and replace blades every 2 years or so.</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;m getting a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Simple snap on and my razor is new.  </li>
            <li> I can use this razor until the mechanisms break instead of having to upgrade to a new one just because my local store no longer carries the replacement foil.</li>
            <li> I have wor out 2 of the Braun shavers in the last 10 years or so and they do need a new head ever 18mo or so.</li>
            <li> The Braun shaver is such high quality, that it will last far longer than the head.  </li>
            <li> Lasted 1.5 years, worked fine, just got dull eventually</li>
            <li> The foil mesh cover seems to be a little thicker than the original but overall, works well.</li>
            <li> Complex holes pattern, worked fine for nearly two years, then the foil chipped away causing potential face lacerations.&lt;br /&gt;-Replacement cartridge #2 from Amazon:</li>
            <li> The instruction booklet clearly stated &#x27;32S&#x27; was the proper replacement cassette, so there was no problem getting the correct one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> well it still barely cuts.  </li>
            <li> My Braun 380S came with the old style foil that had a regular pattern of holes.</li>
            <li> My last head splunked into the toilet, so I decided to get a new head!</li>
            <li> It really did the job for the time.&lt;br /&gt;After using is everyday its time to change it and get a new one.</li>
            <li> I have ordered replacement parts for my razors in the past only to find they fit differently.</li>
            <li> Restored performance to near new level as others have said in other reviews.  </li>
            <li> As with all shavers, the replacement blades are overpriced, about half the cost of a brand new shaver w/blades, charger, travel case and everything else that comes new.</li>
            <li> The price was half that of a large chain department store.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m due for a new one of these!  </li>
            <li> It is necessary to replace the shaving head about every 18 months due to normal wear.  </li>
            <li> New and sharp.</li>
            <li> This a stupid requirement to insist on 9 more words required when all you need to know is th first 4 words!</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s right (at least at the time I ordered</li>
            <li> I hope to make this baby last as long as possible.</li>
            <li> The problem is that  the head does not last long enough.</li>
            <li> We like the Braun replacement heads but wish they would last as long as they say.  </li>
            <li> Still takes a long time to shave, going over the same areas 3-4 times.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t wait so long next time!</li>
            <li> Forgot how well my shaver once worked - will try not to wait as long to replace the head next time</li>
            <li> The price on a subscribe and save order is (when I ordered it) about 15 bucks - a minor cost for such an enhanced shaving performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One caution is that there do seem to be a number of slightly different replacement cutter heads that purport to fit the same razor - not sure whether there is any difference between them or just in the packaging, but it&#x27;s certainly confusing.</li>
            <li> With this replacement my Braun shaver works like new for a few months.</li>
            <li> these things last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Now I rinse it out instead of tapping it over the toilet!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is the regular replacement schedule because it feels quite frequent for me.</li>
            <li> I found out (after a few google searches) that my old foil was nickel coated with palladium and platinum.</li>
            <li> I went too long to purchase a replacement head for my Braun shaver.  </li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than expected</li>
            <li> As long as I have this shaver, I will order this unit again&lt;</li>
            <li> Disposable razors slice me up on occasion and I can&#x27;t stand the other screens in the past like the three headed ones which left many hairs behind.</li>
            <li> The newer complex pattern is MUCH better at cutting hair than the older, straight-line holes pattern.  </li>
            <li> It seems there are 3 versions of this model, each with replacement foil and blades very different from the other two.  </li>
            <li> But outside the USA be very careful with those.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting dry</li>
            <li> First I thought I was getting ingrown hairs from the new blade cutting too close.</li>
            <li> heads are essentially the same except that one has silver trim and the other has black trim (I just buy the cheaper one).</li>
            <li> In this age of multiple dozens of different types of items that all do the same thing, it is hard for a brick and mortar store to carry all the replacement parts.</li>
            <li> Ultimately, Braun is probably at fault for making this all so confusing with different replacement heads for various shavers all called  &amp;#34;Series 3&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This block and foil is only average.  </li>
            <li> I let my old razor go until the screen was worn and had a small piece of metal scratching me when I shaved.</li>
            <li> When you buy some item from another country you will loose a lot of money if you have to return it.</li>
            <li> Simple \\&quot;older\\&quot; holes pattern, foil chipped away and black plastic on side of cartridge split apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my third blade replacement in a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> They carry several other Braun and other brand replacement assemblies.   </li>
            <li> This last replacment head lasted less than two months before it almost disingerated on my face while shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wet shave is also improved, but not as much as a dry shave.  </li>
            <li> The only difference is that the trim on the 32S is silver; it&#x27;s black on the 32B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In the past the same series all used the same cutter head, no longer.</li>
            <li> They last about half the expected time.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how dull my old head had become.</li>
            <li> OLD BRAUN RAZOR WAS DULL.  </li>
            <li> The quality of shave degrades to where I start saying bad words, and I check Amazon, and sure enuf</li>
            <li> Braun makes at least 3 different \\&quot;Series 3\\&quot; model lines with very different and incompatible replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I spent alot of money on this razor....</li>
            <li> /&gt;So be careful.</li>
            <li> The shipping was faster than expected.</li>
            <li> The shaver has not really lived up to expectations.</li>
            <li> Ironically, I no longer had a beard to shave, so my shaving needs were minimal.  </li>
            <li> not much to say, it works</li>
            <li> As expected, prompt shipping.</li>
            <li> It worked as expected.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li> Performed as expected.</li>
            <li> after a wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to let it slide a few months longer between replacements since these are built so well and last longer than expected.</li>
            <li> - not sure about 18 months, but 5 years is definitely too long to wait!</li>
            <li> Perhaps I had developed a lazy shaving style - &amp;#34;its not you its me!!&amp;#34; Cheers!</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;s been sharp for two weeks now.</li>
            <li> The 32s and 32b heads have the cutters and foils integrated into one unit, unlike some other Braun Series 3 heads that are 2 separate</li>
            <li> I got two heads for the price of one compared to the other stores.</li>
            <li> Other than replacing the foils every 18 months, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> But the cleaning fluid takes the thin metal wrap off the razor so you are left with a peeling razor.  </li>
            <li> I learned the hard way as there are other kits that say they are but come in multiple pieces that require you to disassemble the foil and blades.</li>
            <li> My other blades were so warn down it took me 20 mins to shave.</li>
            <li> Mine wore out in less than a year (compared to 2 years for other Braun shavers that I have owned).</li>
            <li> my razor is black other than that it works well</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my Dad because he was having a hard time finding them in our local stores.  </li>
            <li> Just a bad choice of a replacement foil it gave out at the same spot as the first one did , then started to chew itself up</li>
            <li> it  beats the Braun Series 3 hands down.</li>
            <li> I hope the prices come down to around $14 or $15.</li>
            <li> This was a dramatic improvement over the old one.</li>
            <li> (less than one year).</li>
            <li> LESS</li>
            <li> The head I bought on Amazon was half that price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it costs half what Bed Bath &amp; Beyond charge.</li>
            <li> It takes about half the time to shave now.</li>
            <li> Silver is exactly as previous.  </li>
            <li> but after the first rinsing it looses its cutting efficiency.</li>
            <li> That flimsy grating bends and breaks stupid easy.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t be idiots, put the replacement number on the piece itself for easy ordering.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s little to say about this item.</li>
            <li> Of course, I save every manual for every little appliance, doesn&#x27;t everyone?  </li>
            <li> Works well took a little time to get.</li>
            <li> BUT, it did not seem as sharp as past cutters I have purchased in brick and mortar stores.  </li>
            <li> but it just added a little style.</li>
            <li> The part numbers can be a little tricky</li>
            <li> It takes only a few weeks before I observe a noticeable reduction in effectiveness and it slowly gets dull.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It must work as expected because he hasn&#x27;t complained about it.</li>
            <li> Was having trouble finding this item in a store, so I purchased it online.  </li>
            <li> I found this out by ordering the replacement parts then finding out that the parts did not fit my razor.  </li>
            <li> The difference was stark.</li>
            <li> about 40 -50% less than you would pay in a retail store!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just not worth it for the less efficient cutting, and apparently poorer quality</li>
            <li> I bought the one the razor had from new, Silver, No better after only using 2-3 weeks they are dull and it is painful to shave....</li>
            <li> Replacing the cutting block and screen is like getting a new razor.</li>
            <li> The product description was a little confusing.</li>
            <li> I need a new head every 6 mos, or so, and they work; but BOY, are they expensive !  </li>
            <li> I usually shave with a blade (Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual)</li>
            <li> Needless to say this will be my last Braun shaver replacement purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if there is</li>
            <li> No more ingrowing hairs...</li>
            <li> Braun fails in their model numbering and/or necessary information on their replacement part information.  </li>
            <li> Husband loves this Braun Replacement Head after we were unable to locate one locally.  </li>
            <li> It usually lasts about 1 year.</li>
            <li> I guess since the razor gets dull gradually, we don&#x27;t really realize how bad it is untill</li>
            <li> I was having a hard time figuring out which replacement head to buy.</li>
            <li> It is hard to fathom a reason why Wal-Mart would not want to sell the replacement assembly for a shaver they have sold and continue to sell.  </li>
            <li> You never know how dull your razor is until you replace it.  </li>
            <li> and I was having a hard time finding the silver finish.</li>
            <li> This replacement is hard for me to find for my husband&#x27;s razor.  </li>
            <li> I will buy another one when this one is dull.</li>
            <li> (circa 2010), complex holes pattern.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The stock photo shows the complex holes pattern.</li>
            <li> Confusing.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the foil is not very durable.</li>
            <li> Braun makes it quite confusing to figure out which replacement to order.</li>
            <li> This supplier is &amp;#34;really&amp;#34; slow to fill order on a common item.</li>
            <li> Too bad I spent $70.00 on other kit to learn this.</li>
            <li> The other reviews saved me from ordering the wrong replacement head.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased this at a retail store but the wrong one.</li>
            <li> They were chrome in color instead of black which was weird</li>
            <li> I was interested in the prospect of a &amp;#34;replacement head&amp;#34; after a terrible accident involving a forklift, some chewing gum, and an adolescent hyena.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if it was me or there was something wrong with the cutter.  </li>
            <li> Poor Quality.</li>
            <li> Was broken when we received the replacement head.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t broken or anything.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for a unit that got broken.</li>
            <li> It is very bad and not good, Doesn&#x27;t shave properly.</li>
            <li> I had a very hard time trying to find this replacement for my son&#x27;s Braun razor.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!  </li>
            <li> The 32S assembly is silver (S) and the 32B head has a black base.</li>
            <li> It was unreal on the cutting of my tough to shave areas on my neck.  </li>
            <li> Returned item because I ordered the wrong item.  </li>
            <li> so I picked the wrong number.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong part.</li>
            <li> leaves uncut hair and takes lot of time.</li>
            <li> How difficult is it to screw up heads like these.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I may have ordered the wrong one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It renewed the perfomance of an expensive shaver.</li>
            <li> Although Braun states you must replace the head every 18 months, it has been just shy of a year that I bought my razor</li>
            <li> WRONG.  </li>
            <li> I almost ordered the wrong part.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with the brand name product at a discounted price.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find this replacement head at any of the stores in my area.  </li>
            <li> The foil is very thin and gives you a close shave.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a bad one.</li>
            <li> Weren&#x27;t disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am very unhappy..</li>
            <li> The problem is they added the wrong model head!!</li>
            <li> WRONG!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he is very happy - still weeks later. Good product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working accordion to my spectations.</li>
            <li> Fits my Braun device perfectly and does its work as supposed to. However, I must say that I need to change my replacement head every 6 months or so. I&#x27;m not sure if this is the regular replacement schedule because it feels quite frequent for me.</li>
            <li> Works great just like it should.</li>
            <li> A good replacement at a good price.&lt;br /&gt;It lasted a couple of years before this one and shaves well.&lt;br /&gt;Approved!</li>
            <li> This is the second set of heads I&#x27;ve bought for this razor.  The razor doesn&#x27;t give a good shave, even with new head, but it&#x27;s lasting, so I won&#x27;t mess with what&#x27;s working.  As suggested, I replace the head about every 18 months. The quality of shave degrades to where I start saying bad words, and I check Amazon, and sure enuf, I&#x27;m due for a new one of these!  I usually shave with a blade (Gillette Fusion Proglide Manual) once a week, which works pretty well.  I get an eight-pack of carts for that razor every couple of years, right here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I replaced the head on my Braun 370 with this and it shaves like a new razor!</li>
            <li> Quick,clean an smooth says it all.</li>
            <li> good product&lt;br /&gt;good time&lt;br /&gt;excellent shave</li>
            <li> My Braun razor is now like brand new-----</li>
            <li> came on time &amp; I can get a close shave</li>
            <li> I purchased the shaver Oct.7,2013.  The trim part came apart on my face and cut me.  I could not find a replacement part.  The replacement head only lasted 14 months.  You claim that is should last 18 months.  I also found that the cleaning charger was not as good as you claimed.  Poor Quality.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping. Razor works like new.</li>
            <li> Makes shaving easy again.</li>
            <li> Exactly  as advertised and perfect fit</li>
            <li> GTG.  Works need a new one soon.</li>
            <li> I have a Braun Series 3 model 330, and this replacement head fits perfectly and works great. The price is excellent and the best I found. The 32S assembly is silver (S) and the 32B head has a black base. Shipping is reasonable (mine was free!) and the unit is packaged well and shipped fast.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Braun recommends replacing the head and cutters once a year.  I followed the advice and effectively now have a brand new shaver for the price of the replacement head.  It&#x27;s worth doing.</li>
            <li> My husband wanted to replace his shaver blades and this product was at a great price and works well.  I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I wanted a replacement cassette for my braun shaver n I found a right match at good price at amazon. Product is good.</li>
            <li> Braun razors are the best especially for thick stubble.  Replacing the cutting block and screen is like getting a new razor.</li>
            <li> This replacement head was exactly what I expected.  It works just like when the shaver was new.  What more do you want?</li>
            <li> This product was as described, 32S replacement head/cutters for Braun Series 3, model 370.  Can&#x27;t beat the price anywhere ($16.24 plus qualifies for Amazon free delivery).  This is a spare head for the shaver so that when the time comes I&#x27;ll have one on hand.  I can&#x27;t speak to the \\&quot;longevity\\&quot; of the head/cutters because the shaver is fairly new but it does do a nice job shaving thus far.</li>
            <li> This pack arrived and snapped into place, no problems. My shaver is now performing like new and so I should get 18 months use. All smiles here.</li>
            <li> Received quickly and it was exactly what I needed. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great product, nice to have a new sharp head.</li>
            <li> This shaver always took way to long to get a good clean shave with. I thought because the head was over 18 months old that replacing it might help. No luck! The Braun Series 3 shaver that this is on still takes forever to get a good close shave with. This shaver and foil has been relegated to being a backup to my Panasonic WES9161CL. The Panasonic  is a much older shaver but with the replacement head and blades I just purchased for it also it  beats the Braun Series 3 hands down. Needless to say this will be my last Braun shaver replacement purchase.</li>
            <li> I spent alot of money on this razor.... The head is said to last up to 18 months,It doesn&#x27;t even come close....I was getting the heads at walmart and they only would last a couple months at best.I thought if I bought them on line, maybe they were better then walmart (sometimes they have a cheaper product). I bought the one the razor had from new, Silver, No better after only using 2-3 weeks they are dull and it is painful to shave....I am very unhappy..I had bought 2 at the same time. Wish the product came close to the manufactures statements... I Clean it every day when done using. This is alot of money for a product that doesnt come close to the performance it should have......never again...........................</li>
            <li> Very happy! I couldn&#x27;t find them in any of the stores and found them online.  A day after I found them online, I seen them in the store, 1 was almost the same price as the combo pack.</li>
            <li> It was the correct fit and my shaver cuts my whiskers much more smoothly, closer and leanly now thanit did before replacing the head.</li>
            <li> What can I say.  It&#x27;s a shaver blade.  It works.  But you cannot but these in a store, they only sell parts for the current models that are on the shelves.  And why would you need new blades for a new shaver already unless you are a real plan-aheader?  So Amazon is the best place to get them when you do need them.  Great price, great delivery.  I love this place.</li>
            <li> A new set of blades restored my shaver and the battery seems to now last longer; suggest you follow the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendation and replace blades every 2 years or so.</li>
            <li> Good product.  I have an extra replacement cutter head, and always have one clean and ready to change out.  I have a light beard so these work well with my facial hair.  I like the trimer as well.  Battery is holding up well.</li>
            <li> good replacement heads</li>
            <li> Returned item because I ordered the wrong item.  They changed the number of the item so I picked the wrong number.  Returned and received my funds back except for postage.</li>
            <li> Had this plate for a while and it&#x27;s still a good place</li>
            <li> if you have to shave.</li>
            <li> I have ordered replacement parts for my razors in the past only to find they fit differently. This fit and looked like the original OEM to my razor. Braun Series 3, model 390cc.</li>
            <li> the head works as good as the original but after the first rinsing it looses its cutting efficiency.</li>
            <li> New life to an old shaver - excellent!</li>
            <li> This is a great replacement product and it arrived as promised. They are the retail product, so you do not have to worry about their quality. I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Closest shave I&#x27;ve ever experienced by electric razor with this replacement element. This was a dramatic improvement over the old one.</li>
            <li> I had a very hard time trying to find this replacement for my son&#x27;s Braun razor.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon!  Easy to find.  Perfect fit. Exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> It really did the job for the time.&lt;br /&gt;After using is everyday its time to change it and get a new one.</li>
            <li> This is just what it&#x27;s advertised to be work great and I should order another for a spare. when needed.</li>
            <li> Blades work GREAT. Third time I bought these and as always they work great!! Would recomend these to all that use Braun razors</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Works Excellent.  Very good shave.</li>
            <li> It works good for me. I bought a Braun shaver a couple years ago and these are the refills for it.</li>
            <li> Seems to work all right, though a bit flimsier than the original.  would give 3.5 stars if I could.</li>
            <li> I had to do some extra shopping after I got the Braun Series 3 370 Shaver to find the necessary replacement cassettes. Thes weren&#x27;t offer as a possible needed product when I bought the shaver. The [[ASIN:B002S8NS24 Braun 32S/32B Series 3 Shaver Foil and Cutter Head Cassette]]Combi 315 was.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying I&#x27;ve had the Series 3 shaver for quite a while now, and I like it.  This review is about the cartridges, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Stock cartridge, came with shaver: Lasted 1.5 years, worked fine, just got dull eventually (circa 2010), complex holes pattern.&lt;br /&gt;-Replacement cartridge #1 from Amazon:  Lasted 4/2011 - 2/2013. Complex holes pattern, worked fine for nearly two years, then the foil chipped away causing potential face lacerations.&lt;br /&gt;-Replacement cartridge #2 from Amazon: Lasted 2/2013 - 9/2013. Simple \\&quot;older\\&quot; holes pattern, foil chipped away and black plastic on side of cartridge split apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it seems they aren&#x27;t getting their stock from the same supplier all the time, otherwise I&#x27;d of had the newer holes pattern all the time. The newer complex pattern is MUCH better at cutting hair than the older, straight-line holes pattern.  I&#x27;ve ordered from the same Amazon page all three times, so you never know which style you&#x27;re going to get.  The stock photo shows the complex holes pattern. I&#x27;m about to receive replacement #3 today, and if it&#x27;s the simple holes style I&#x27;m sending it back - it&#x27;s just not worth it for the less efficient cutting, and apparently poorer quality design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So be careful.</li>
            <li> Very good price. The new head is a must have for a close shave.</li>
            <li> My husband said it&#x27;s just perfect!</li>
            <li> I received the replacement head for my 390cc and it works great. Just like brand new. I didn&#x27;t realize how dull my old head had become. It&#x27;s a good idea to replace this head every two years.</li>
            <li> Braun is the best choice</li>
            <li> But I guess the larger question is.. with it being over $20 for purchase... and $2-$3 for shipping. Is it not cheaper to just get a new shaver? Plus, with a new shaver you actually get improved features and can rethink what&#x27;s important to you in a shaver. Just my two cents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it works and is holding up for now. I hope to make this baby last as long as possible. Next time I&#x27;m getting a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gets my FULL GADGET ACCESSORY APPROVAL.</li>
            <li> I was having a hard time figuring out which replacement head to buy. But after a quick visit to the Braun site I knew exactly what I needed. This replacement head is actually nicer than the original head. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is how things are supposed to work in e-commerce.  Dropped my shaver. Searched for replacement head. Found it. Ordered it. Got it. Used it.  Everything works just like new!</li>
            <li> The replacement pack was shipped quickly and was as advertised. The pack fits my razor and work well making shaving much more bareable.</li>
            <li> Great product, it&#x27;s like having  new shaver and the price was allot less than the same head on the Braun website.</li>
            <li> I had ordered the Braun Series 3 380s-4 electric shaver, and Amazon listed a package deal where if I bought a replacement cutter/foil, it would save money. The problem is they added the wrong model head!! The Braun Series 3 380 takes the 32S (or 32B I believe, but who the heck can really be sure?) replacement cutter/foil, not the 30B that was listed and included with the deal. Ultimately, Braun is probably at fault for making this all so confusing with different replacement heads for various shavers all called  &amp;#34;Series 3&amp;#34;. They work well when matched up, but come on people, you can do waaay better than this. Confusing.</li>
            <li> these work great - just do wear out...</li>
            <li> Even better than the original</li>
            <li> The Series 3 Braun shavers are the best, and this replacement head is very reasonably priced.  Personally I can get from 18-24 months out of it.  Replacing my old head with this new head made it shave just like the day I bought it.</li>
            <li> I was waiting for the little light to light up and indicate it was time to replace my blade cartridge. After noticing that the performance of my razor was not it used to be, I went ahead and bought the new blade cartridge early. I now wish I would have done so a month or two earlier. My razor is now working like it did when I first bought it. The manual says to replace every 18 months, I will replace mine after about 12 months.</li>
            <li> The replacement head performs as well as the original. Much more cost effective than having to purchase a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Works great and for a bargain price.  I would buy it again in a heartbeat and recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great made the razor like new again, fitted as hoped, not much more that I can say really, that&#x27;s it .</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed and it&#x27;s working great!  Delighted to find it on Amazon, good selection and great prices.</li>
            <li> I bought a Braun Series 3, Model 370 shaver.  Listed with that shaver indicated that people also buy the 31S foil and cutter replacement pack ($22.99).  I ordered one so that after 18 months I would be sure to have the replacement.  When it arrived with the shaver it was obvious that it was not the correct one. I then looked inside (by sliding out the trimmer blade) the shaver and found that I had received Type 5771 shaver and the replacement pack was suppose to be part 32S, not 31S.  I then checked the 32S part on Amazon.com and found that it was the correct one for my Model 370 Braun shaver.  It is more expensive ($28.90) but contains in one unit the blades and flexible foil cover.  I called Amazon.com and they emailed me the return label and refunded the original purchase and I ordered the correct replacement.</li>
            <li> The part easily replaced the other part and cuts like new. I would use this product again the next time.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husbands razor and he said it&#x27;s as good as the one it came with when new. Many times a replacement blade seems cheaply made. Not this one... My husband is very pleased.    I also ordered one for my father after my husband told him how well it worked.    It arrived quickly as well.    I will absolutely order more when needed.</li>
            <li> We are well pleased, Thanks</li>
            <li> My order met my expectations.</li>
            <li> My Braun shaver is now almost back to its original condition when I bought it, I&#x27;m really loving once again.</li>
            <li> have gotten several orders</li>
            <li> BraAun cuts like a razor blade.</li>
            <li> This is my third blade replacement in a year and a half.  I have a tough beard and can&#x27;t get a good shave with many electric razors.   The Braun does a much better job than most.   The shipment was received in time and the assembly was an original replacent item.   I bought the shaver at Wal-Mart and have asked them repeatedly to carry the replacement cutter assembly.  I had assurances from two different department managers that they would order the items but they have never been available in 1 1/2 years.  They still sell this model shaver.   It is hard to fathom a reason why Wal-Mart would not want to sell the replacement assembly for a shaver they have sold and continue to sell.  They carry several other Braun and other brand replacement assemblies.   This is akin to selling a camera and not carrying the size film required.    Thanks, Amazon!  You&#x27;ve come to the rescue again.  I&#x27;ve been a customer for several years and love your customer service.       Koalakid</li>
            <li> The only reason that I gave this one star is to serve as a warning to anyone with a nickel allergy. I used my Braun for years with no problems at all. when it came time to change the head, I started getting a rash. First I thought I was getting ingrown hairs from the new blade cutting too close. After awhile though it seemed more like a dermatitis. I found out (after a few google searches) that my old foil was nickel coated with palladium and platinum. The new foil isn&#x27;t. It still cuts well, but now unusable for me.&lt;br /&gt;Wahl makes a &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; gold foil razor. I just hope it cuts as well as my Braun used to.</li>
            <li> It seems that my original head did not last very long. (less than one year). This replacement pack seems to be much sharper and hopefully last awhile. I was pleased with the cost of this item and have always liked the value of doing business with AMAZON.com</li>
            <li> I was not sure of the quality of the product when I ordered as the price was excellent compared to local Meijer and WallMart centers.  I was not disappointed....excellent quality at an excellent price.</li>
            <li> Made shaver operate like new.....</li>
            <li> Good price and prompt shipment</li>
            <li> We like the Braun replacement heads but wish they would last as long as they say.  They last about half the expected time.</li>
            <li> Like getting a brand new shaver. Great price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly and works well</li>
            <li> buying this kept me from having to sink more money into a brand new Braun. Glad I thought to try the cartridge replacement before buying a new razor. Woo-Hoo!</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong part. We like ordering through Amazon. We can always count on them to come through for us. They let us return the part and sent us the correct one and even credited us back the shipping costs!</li>
            <li> I brought these when I bought my shaver and tested one to make sure it works OK.  Seems to be good with close enough shaves.</li>
            <li> Son-in-law uses.  Very reliable.  Braun is a great product and worth the money.  Will order again for him in future.</li>
            <li> Becasue this item didnt last two months.  I&#x27;ve had to replace this head appriximately three times over the two year life of the razor.  This last replacment head lasted less than two months before it almost disingerated on my face while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m wondering if it was refurbished.</li>
            <li> This replacement far exceeds the original part that came with the Braun product.&lt;br /&gt; At this price the smart thing to do is to order two, I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li> Was broken when we received the replacement head. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Just like original - I change more often that they recommend (18 months) because a new cutter feels great. I will not be making anymore reviews - too many rules.</li>
            <li> Shaver is like new again.  I have had my shaver for over a year and the old head had a hole in it.</li>
            <li> The old shaver head was not giving clean cuts but with this new one the shaves have been consistently close and clean with no irritation.  Shipped in a large box to prevent damage!</li>
            <li> I went too long to purchase a replacement head for my Braun shaver.  It started pulling.  Now it feels just like it did when I first purchased it.  Waited over three years and they recommend replacing every 18 months and they are probably right on about that.</li>
            <li> Years ago I had a Braun that had a patterned foil (505).  It was unreal on the cutting of my tough to shave areas on my neck.  This block and foil is only average.  I didn&#x27;t pay enough attention to the razor that I purchased to see what the replacements could be.  It just takes a lot of effort to shave as smoothly as I wanted.</li>
            <li> Fits and works as advertised. Easy to switch in and out. Came fast. Reasonably priced. Comfortable and effective to shave with.</li>
            <li> My first Braun shaver (actually my first electric shaver) and had it for two years. This Braun 32s Series 3 Combi Replacement Pack is the perfect replacement for the original foil &amp; cutter block. With this replacement, I get as close and comfortable shave as I did when the shaver was new. I received the item fast and intact. I will purchase additional Replacement Packs when needed and from the same source. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.  This is the first replacement head I have purchased after 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;I was a Remington fan until I tried this Braun.</li>
            <li> Pleased with product as advertised and delivery was good also</li>
            <li> Good price, excellent shaving. This a stupid requirement to insist on 9 more words required when all you need to know is th first 4 words!</li>
            <li> was exactly the right replacement part absolutely what we wanted no complaints&lt;br /&gt;what more can you say about getting the right replacement part</li>
            <li> Just a bad choice of a replacement foil it gave out at the same spot as the first one did , then started to chew itself up I will take som of the blame for sure ! And I used the protective cover at all times</li>
            <li> My shaver is new again. The shipping was faster than expected. Much better alternative to a new shaver. I would recomend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> The shaver has not really lived up to expectations. After six months of good but not great shaves, I bought a new head to see if that would  be an improvement. This did not improve the cut at all. Still takes a long time to shave, going over the same areas 3-4 times. and more stubble in the middle of the day</li>
            <li> Read the other reviews and make sure you have the right razor... The other reviews saved me from ordering the wrong replacement head.</li>
            <li> Good item. This is my second replacement blade set for my Braun Series 3. The shaver now works like new again.</li>
            <li> I have not yet exchanged it for the original head but I am confidant it will work as well as the original.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED ELECTRIC SHAVERS MOST OF MY LIFE OF 74 YEARS. I RATE BRAUN THE BEST I HAVE EVER USED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  GEORGE</li>
            <li> The recommendation is to replace the cutter head every 18 months, but I treated this as marketing hype.  WRONG!!! - not sure about 18 months, but 5 years is definitely too long to wait! Like having a new razor, $30 very well-spent.  One caution is that there do seem to be a number of slightly different replacement cutter heads that purport to fit the same razor - not sure whether there is any difference between them or just in the packaging, but it&#x27;s certainly confusing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if there is but I think its the same head.  Only visible difference is the color.  The S model(which I bought) is silver in color.  It gives a pretty close shave so I like it a lot!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Xmas. He had been using an old, old, old head and is the type to just complain but not do anything about the problem. So - he&#x27;s happier and I&#x27;m happier. Not more complaining for a while :)</li>
            <li> I really like my shaver and this replacement part was made for and the price was made for me. Thanks</li>
            <li> This is a great razor to begin with.  The replacement head is easy to install.  Just snap it in like the old one.  Great value.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this razor and happy that I can get replacement heads at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;s been sharp for two weeks now. I hope that lasts.</li>
            <li> I have been using my electric razor with dull blades for so long that this was amazing! It made shaving so much faster!</li>
            <li> I have the Braun 360 and the one I received was for  a different razor. I didn&#x27;t realize it until I took it out of the package.</li>
            <li> My husbands razor still works perfectly after 15 years.  He needed a new replacement head and although we were hesitant about ordering it online, we gave it a try.  Weren&#x27;t disappointed.  It arrived earlier than expected and it&#x27;s in perfect condition.  Great shave. This is the reason why we continue to stick with Braun products.  Good quality and reasonable prices.</li>
            <li> I replaced the head in my shaver, as the old one was about 18 months old. My razor now works just as well as the day I bought it. It takes about 1 minute to replace - remove from packaging, throw the old one out, and snap the new one into place.  It&#x27;s worth the few dollars to no longer have razor burn and a nice close shave!</li>
            <li> Excellent product as expected. The replacement was an improved model from the one that came with the original shaver.</li>
            <li> I was interested in the prospect of a &amp;#34;replacement head&amp;#34; after a terrible accident involving a forklift, some chewing gum, and an adolescent hyena.  Ironically, I no longer had a beard to shave, so my shaving needs were minimal.  That being said, I must have misread the description of this product (easy to do when you are missing your eyeballs, ocular nerves, and brain).  That&#x27;s okay.  I&#x27;ll keep searching for another solution to my problem.  In the meantime, my legs look great!</li>
            <li> These new blades cut my shaving time more than in half from the old, worn blades.  I will order again when needed.</li>
            <li> My old razor head was worn out.  Ordered this, it came 2 days later.  From the first shave, I was very impressed about what a good clean shave it gave me, and it made me realize how worn out the old one was.  Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> This supplier is &amp;#34;really&amp;#34; slow to fill order on a common item. One month and still waiting! Do not expect quick delivery.</li>
            <li> The rapid receipt of the Braun replacement head for my husband&#x27;s shaver was a blessing!  It came exactly when the order said it would; it snapped right on--fitting beautifully--without having to push, pull, or make a fuss!  We couldn&#x27;t believe that all went so very smoothly--without even having to drive an hour to find a store that MIGHT sell them!  Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!  Amazon is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> My last head splunked into the toilet, so I decided to get a new head! Now I rinse it out instead of tapping it over the toilet! A drop of their supplied oil after it dries keeps it running smooth.</li>
            <li> new replacement head made my razor work like new good fit clean shave I will buy a nother one when needed</li>
            <li> This product made my Braun shaver work like it was brand new. Actually even a little better. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it contained the blades as well but it does. Just pop this in place and start shaving. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much I can say about this. It was a replacement blade for my husbands Braun. It must work as expected because he hasn&#x27;t complained about it.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT FACTORY REPLACEMENT HEAD</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all about price.  And this was the cheapest price I could find.  What more do I need to say to meet the minimum wood count.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement part for one that was worn out. These heads seam to last about 6 months before needing to be replaced. Have used this shaver for about a year and am pleased with the closeness and smoothness of the shave.</li>
            <li> Better than the original head.</li>
            <li> My cousin has a Braun shaver and after shaving, he would still have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, It occurred to me that maybe the shaver head needed to be replaced so i bought one from amazon. It&#x27;s night and day. It looks like he shaves with a straight-edge shaver.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, great price. I had bought  an off brand earlier, item didn&#x27;t last any time. This Braun replacement head is working really well, and I would recommend it to family and friend.</li>
            <li> Simple snap on and my razor is new.  It also looks good too, and it works just as well as a brand new one would.</li>
            <li> Need it for my every day shaved.</li>
            <li> I bought this refill for my father and he really liked the way it cuts his beard and had a great price</li>
            <li> The Braun shaver is such high quality, that it will last far longer than the head.  Buying this saved a good bit of money over buying a new shaver.  My shaver now works like it is brand new again.</li>
            <li> It is very bad and not good, Doesn&#x27;t shave properly. leaves uncut hair and takes lot of time. Original was good and lasted for two years. It is not working since the very first day i bought it</li>
            <li> Works perfectly! awesome even if it is a little pricey. They really need to fix the trimmer problem though. mine broke</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this replacement for my Braun electric razor; the delivery, packaging, an accuracy of the order placed was excellent.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> NICE PRICE LIVE SAVER</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t changed the shaver head in about 3 years, took the opportunity - awesome replacement at a great price.  Would readily buy again.</li>
            <li> The replacement blade was reasonably priced and works great. I&#x27;m glad we didn&#x27;t have to invest in a new razor.</li>
            <li> Replacing the head was like a face lift for my shaver! It shaves as good as when it was new.</li>
            <li> not much to say, it works</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I need a new head every 6 mos, or so, and they work; but BOY, are they expensive !  Still, Amazon is the best deal around.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I asked for a new shaving  right part for the best shaver compliments my razor perfectly great job braun</li>
            <li> The replacement shaver head was exactly as described.  My shaver not only works like new but the replacement head is chrome and has a better appearance.</li>
            <li> FITS PERFECT, ITS BRAUN&#x27;S SERIES 3, I WOULD RECOMMEND IT, COST LESS THEN WALMART.&lt;br /&gt;WE ARE SET UP FOR ONE EVERY FIVE MONTHS. GREAT IDEA.</li>
            <li> Fits my Braun 390cc-4 Razor.  I followed the 18 month replacement timeline and the new replacement head works quite well.  A very smooth shave.  I am happy with my purchase of this product.</li>
            <li> I think my shaver signals it needs a new cutter set a bit early, but I figured it was a good idea to have a spare around.  The Amazon price is very good, and I also order the cleaning solution with the 15% discount for a regular delivery.</li>
            <li> Was having trouble finding this item in a store, so I purchased it online.  I got a good price and I received it quickly.  I later found one in a store which was more expensive than what I paid so I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Braun makes at least 3 different \\&quot;Series 3\\&quot; model lines with very different and incompatible replacement heads. Check the model number carefully to make sure you get the right head. The model number should be printed on the shaver body. The 32s and 32b heads are essentially the same except that one has silver trim and the other has black trim (I just buy the cheaper one). The 32s and 32b heads have the cutters and foils integrated into one unit, unlike some other Braun Series 3 heads that are 2 separate pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This head works well. The foil is very thin and gives you a close shave. Unfortunately, the foil is not very durable. Mine wore out in less than a year (compared to 2 years for other Braun shavers that I have owned).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been happy with the original shaver and look forward to getting back to getting a close shave. Should&#x27;ve ordered this replacement 4-5 months ago...</li>
            <li> Shaves for one year, for sure/</li>
            <li> I have always been very satisfied with my Braun shaver and replacement parts. This shaver provides a very close shave with no irritation. The replacement heads are wonderful.</li>
            <li> Item was just what I needed at a better than competitive price.  This is the second time I have ordered this item.  Thanx</li>
            <li> Fast shipment, good price, perfect fit. Can&#x27;t ask for more than that!</li>
            <li> This is a great electric shaver head.  I have used it for years with my Braun shaver.</li>
            <li> This is the second replacement head I&#x27;ve installed. The first was bought in Germany. I dropped the razor and crunched the foil. Oops! The cost? About $35 US! The head I bought on Amazon was half that price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s little to say about this item. Take off the old head (with the foil and blades, which do wear out over time), open the package, mount the new head. End of story. My beard is on the coarse side, but the Series 3 goes right through it without any pulls or yanks. My skin feels smooth afterward - there&#x27;s no stubble left behind.</li>
            <li> They do the job and seem to last about 6 - 8 months. The first several shaves are unbelievable, cut close and in a fraction of the time. If I win the lotto I&#x27;m going to start changing it twice a week. As with all shavers, the replacement blades are overpriced, about half the cost of a brand new shaver w/blades, charger, travel case and everything else that comes new.</li>
            <li> I had to have my son that has had one of these for many years that got me to buy one and after about 2 years it was dull but you don&#x27;t notice it.&lt;br /&gt;Then our son was up visiting and used mine. And said this is so dull.&lt;br /&gt;So i ordered one right away what a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And i use the cleaning station to keep it clean and lubricated, If i did not keep it clean and oiled it would have not lasted that long. well worth every cent for a real nice clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;Replace it when it says its worth it the shave you get.</li>
            <li> So happy I got this, I was beginning to think I needed a new razor, but this replacement head made it work like new.</li>
            <li> New shaving head for my Braun electric shaver. I been using it for a couple of weeks and it does a good job. It shaves much better than my original shaving head. Great price from Amazon.com. Would recommend purchase.</li>
            <li> As expected, prompt shipping.</li>
            <li> Made it work as good as new.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve had a similar problem with many people: buying a shaver head that appears to work for Braun series 3, then finding out that it&#x27;s just the cutter and will not work. This shaver head is the first one I found that is exactly what I need. It&#x27;s the full head and simply attached to the shaver body and works great.&lt;br /&gt;Some questions I had:&lt;br /&gt;The difference between B and S is simply silver and black.&lt;br /&gt;When I push up the side burn shaver, my shaver says &amp;#34;use 32B&amp;#34; and it worked great for me.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend because it&#x27;s a good price and works great.</li>
            <li> Delivery was really fast, popped it on the shaver, and voila, it works like new.  Sure saved us having to pay for a whole new shaver.  Glad it is still around.</li>
            <li> My husband says it works perfectly.  Delivery as promised.  I am signed up for the &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save&amp;#34; Program.  We thank you!</li>
            <li> I rated this product with two stars because the foils don&#x27;t seem to last as long or cut smoothly as when I originally purchased the razor. I realize that it is a Series 3 and the latest model is a Series 7 however, it&#x27;s still a BRAUN product which I feel is a top of the line razor and should provide many years of service. J.

            <li> very happy with this. You never know how dull your razor is until you replace it.  Should have done this a year ago</li>
            <li> Amazon Web site for Braun part 32s says: \\&quot;Fits the following braun shavers model no. series 3 ranges (340, 370, 390.\\&quot;  This is incorrect, I have a 340 and this part does not work for it.  Part 30B is needed not 32S for the 340. However, Amazon gave me a refund and paid for snail mail to return, hopefully they will correct the Web site verbiage.</li>
            <li> Best method to purchase this item for sure!</li>
            <li> The Braun Series 3 replacement head/screen was of good quality and arrived on time.  It was packaged securely and was in the right size box.</li>
            <li> It worked as expected.</li>
            <li> Braun product always good</li>
            <li> Fit perfect! No hassle.</li>
            <li> An excellent replacement shaver head.  Used the original shaving head for well over 18 mos..</li>
            <li> Great Razor but works a good as the sharpness of the head.  I find that these last about 6 months.</li>
            <li> The cheapest I could find anywhere and it was brand new.</li>
            <li> good product easy installation very satisfied</li>
            <li> Like a good customer, at 18 months I heeded the call to replace the foil/cutter cassette on the Braun Series 3, 390cc shaver. The instruction booklet clearly stated &#x27;32S&#x27; was the proper replacement cassette, so there was no problem getting the correct one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seemed to cut well at first. The problem came after about three months when the shaver began requiring longer and longer to accomplish the task. (Mind you, each day after use the shaver goes into the clean/renew unit. Every six months the shaver gets discharged as recommended to prolong battery life.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t received a response from Braun, yet. Maybe I just got a bad one.</li>
            <li> My beard destroys electric shaver cutters fast.  With this replacement my Braun shaver works like new for a few months.</li>
            <li> This was an original replacement part for my shaver and I was having a hard time finding the silver finish.Price was a value also.</li>
            <li> Cant find these replacement heads anywhere locally.  They worked perfectly on Braun 320S shaver!!</li>
            <li> I think this shaver and the replacement head were not the greatest.</li>
            <li> This was the perfect replacement for my Braun which I dropped and cracked the foil.  Works just like a new razor now.</li>
            <li> I have a Braun series 3, which I like very much. I get a nice close shave with this razor</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected.  Works great.  How difficult is it to screw up heads like these.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a Braun razor, I would recommend these.</li>
            <li> No more ingrowing hairs...</li>
            <li> My razor is working like new again.</li>
            <li> Exact fit and arrived quickly</li>
            <li> What can I say, it works.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t realize how worn out my old head was.&lt;br /&gt;After replacing it my shave improved dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely begin replacing the heads on my Braun shaver every 18 months.</li>
            <li> Only thing that fits my Braun&lt;br /&gt;Works Great will check prices  when time for another one&lt;br /&gt;Cheap price ! Fast shippment</li>
            <li> Great new replacement screens.  They were shipped timely and met all my expectations.  The price was half that of a large chain department store.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s razor was long overdue for a new razor head for his Braun, and the new head made his razor like new, and he&#x27;s very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I like my Braun Seres 3 electric razor.  It generally does a good job.  The problem is that  the head does not last long enough. It takes only a few weeks before I observe a noticeable reduction in effectiveness and it slowly gets dull.  I seem to go through up to 3 a year.  This is a real problem with this razor system.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> very good element ten points</li>
            <li> I priced the replacement heads at four different stores and found  Amazons the best. I got two heads for the price of one compared to the other stores.</li>
            <li> Made the razor like new.</li>
            <li> Changed out my old cartridge for my new one, now &amp;#34;my face is as smooth as an Androids bottom!&amp;#34; Haha (Star Trek, Next gen, #1 to Data)</li>
            <li> the braun shaver i bought never did work well after 3 months so i bought the replacement head thinking that was the problem.  well it still barely cuts.  its a piece of junk don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> Works great. New life for my Braun shaver. And it costs half what Bed Bath &amp; Beyond charge. Don&#x27;t buy a new shaver when you can change just the head and get close shaves.</li>
            <li> close shave as recommended by Braun</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the original product, fast delivery, would recommend to anyone very, very good original spare parts braun taken Amazon</li>
            <li> Replacement shaver head for a disable man&#x27;s shaver. This brand is easy for him to use. He was glad to have a clean cut again.&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery, received what was promised.</li>
            <li> I had my Braun for about 3 years without changing the blades. When these were installed, the shave quality improved substantially. I won&#x27;t wait so long next time!</li>
            <li> No difference whatsoever from the original shaving head. Smooth shave! Good value. I highly recommend this quality replacement shaving head.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to fit or work quite right.  I may have ordered the wrong one.  That would be my fault, not yours.</li>
            <li> Have had very good luck getting close, and long lasting shaves with this product. It cleans easily, stays sharp&lt;br /&gt;And is very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much better than Baun products bought in past. I recommend highly.recommend.</li>
            <li> Oops. Meant to write this &gt; \\&quot;my hubby likes it, says it shaves smoothly enough, and it doesn&#x27;t sound like a lawn mower! Great for the price.\\&quot; &gt; for the shaver. But if it is the same head as the one on the shaver, then it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Perfect... That&#x27;s all need to be said...</li>
            <li> I was using another well recommended product and couldn&#x27;t find it available here where I live, so I decided to try this one and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great replacement head, worth the extra money. It is a good upgrade over the standard head.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace the razor head on my shaver i bought at walmart. my shaver now works better than the head that came on it from wally world. love love love</li>
            <li> This item is a great product at a really good price!</li>
            <li> Awesome. Thank You for the great product and service.</li>
            <li> It was good and as I expected. Thanks</li>
            <li> Sharp--economical--buy it--good for one year</li>
            <li> Great replacement with the chrome finish. It is better than the replacement without the chrome. It is a great value.</li>
            <li> Works as it&#x27;s suppose to...</li>
            <li> I have to change the head way more often than the manufactuer recommed, However it is still cheaper than buying blades and so I have a subscription on Amazon to sent them to me every 6 months so I will change them and get abetter shave.  These are different for all Braun series get the right one for you razor and change it more often and you will be much happier with the shave.</li>
            <li> This is the correct foil and cutter for Braun  Series 3  370. I purchased two replacement packs. These arrived on time and in great shape.</li>
            <li> I let my old razor go until the screen was worn and had a small piece of metal scratching me when I shaved. I didn&#x27;t realize you were supposed to change these more often. What a huge difference it made. I forgot what a great razor I had.</li>
            <li> I liked the product and will recommend it to everyone.  Made my razor shave like new.  I am happily satisfied.</li>
            <li> For the best shave, replace the head each year.  Make sure you order the correct head as they apparently change models frequently and many are similar in appearance but not the same.  Amazon had the best price and fast shipping.  I also recommend the clean and renew 4 pack solution also from Amazon which I set on auto ship for the extra discount.</li>
            <li> Product was priced lower than department store and easier to find than going all over town.&lt;br /&gt;It renewed the perfomance of an expensive shaver.</li>
            <li> Performed as expected. New and sharp.</li>
            <li> easy to install and lasts a long time</li>
            <li> This is an excellent predictable product.&lt;br /&gt;I buy two shavers at a time; and this system is used on alternate days.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts for three years, when used in this manner.</li>
            <li> works as designed; brought new life to my years old electric shaver.  This was an inexpensive alternative to a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Very happy. Excellent quality. Highly recommend! I so another one cheaper on amazon as well But outside the USA be very careful with those. Just  saying for new shoppers. When you buy some item from another country you will loose a lot of money if you have to return it. I only buy from US sellers for that reason. Hope it helped. Highly recommend this seller</li>
            <li> It is a perfect replacement head for my razor. Put it on and had a basically new razor, would recommend to anyone looking for one!</li>
            <li> I used my old series 3 head once a week for 3 years. I don&#x27;t think you need to replace this every 18 months as suggested -- perhaps if you use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get closer shaves now. It&#x27;s not a revolutionary difference, but noticeable.</li>
            <li> Forgot how well my shaver once worked - will try not to wait as long to replace the head next time</li>
            <li> Although Braun states you must replace the head every 18 months, it has been just shy of a year that I bought my razor and it had just broken off a piece of the foil on the head, hence, a good way to slice up your face.  From this point on, the massive confusion about WHAT is the appropriate part number to order to replace my Braun Series 3 - 350cc shaver head.  Several conflicting part numbers is what I found.  Finally after reading user reviews here on Amazon, someone pointed out you MUST check the recommended part number imprinted on the back of your shaver.  In my own case it meant having to extend the trimmer up so that you can see the imprint.  So I ordered the 32s and waited with much trepidation, hoping I had ordered the correct shaver head.  When it arrived, the housing was silver, vs. the original black.  Naturally I freaked.  But the only way to make sure it fit or not was to cut open the packaging.  I did so and voila!  It fit!  And boy oh boy, a shave just like when the shaver was new!&lt;br /&gt;In short, highly recommended, and yes I DID shop around and this was the best bargain I could find.  Many wanted more (some wanted a LOT more), so choose carefully.  I am glad to see a GOOD deal here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Satisfactory.I will order again as necessary.</li>
            <li> OLD BRAUN RAZOR WAS DULL.  BOUGHT A NEW ROTARY RAZOR AND TRIED FOR A WEEK.  WASN&amp;#34;T AS GOOD AS MY DULL BRAUN.  RETURNED THE ROTARY AND BOUGHT A BRAUN REPLACEMENT HEAD..  i&#x27;M SMOOTH AGAIN!!</li>
            <li> The Braun shaver cuts better than the one that came on the unit when it was new.I&#x27;ll highly reccommend it to any customer.</li>
            <li> The item was easy to replace and works great. It is just as good as the original that came with the shaver.</li>
            <li> Just as described &amp; it works perfectly again.  Glad I ordered 2 of them since it was the real deal.</li>
            <li> I bought a Series 3, 390cc Braun razor.  When it came time to replace the head, I found no markings on the head.  I read the razor label, Series 3, and bought a Series 3 head replacement.  WRONG.  It didn&#x27;t fit.  Braun says that there are many different Series 3 razors and heads (so they don&#x27;t understand the whole point of making something a particular series and something else a different series).  I had to call Braun and be told to buy a 32S or 32B for the razor.  I was told &amp;#34;it&#x27;s in the manual.&amp;#34;  Of course, I save every manual for every little appliance, doesn&#x27;t everyone?  So, here&#x27;s my tip for Braun:  don&#x27;t be idiots, put the replacement number on the piece itself for easy ordering.  Another problem is that my razor came with a big plastic contraption into which you insert the razor for easy cleaning.  But the cleaning fluid takes the thin metal wrap off the razor so you are left with a peeling razor.  Just wash it under the faucet.</li>
            <li> I have had Braun shavers for years and always loved them. This cutter block is as always a good buy and these things last a very long time. I&#x27;m going to let it slide a few months longer between replacements since these are built so well and last longer than expected. remember to tap out the shavings daily and if you don&#x27;t use the combo cleaner/charger stand to make sure and clean it regularly with some soap and water to disinfect it. You get what you pay for and this is a great example of that.</li>
            <li> It is easy to install and makes it a new shaver again.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to install and makes it a new shaver again</li>
            <li> My Braun 380S came with the old style foil that had a regular pattern of holes. It worked well, but the new version is MUCH better. It has irregular shaped holes that really make a difference in catching all the hairs, especially when shaving dry. Wet shave is also improved, but not as much as a dry shave.  I&#x27;m getting dry shaves from this that are nearly as close and complete as I get from my Series 7.  That&#x27;s very impressive considering that the 3 series is far below the cost of a 7 series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the old style foil it&#x27;s well worth replacing it with this even if the foil and blades are still in decent shape. The price on a subscribe and save order is (when I ordered it) about 15 bucks - a minor cost for such an enhanced shaving performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 32S and 32B are exactly the same in terms of the foil and cutters. The only difference is that the trim on the 32S is silver; it&#x27;s black on the 32B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that the cutter and foil are merged together as a cassette. That makes is much easier to clean everything, esp. after a wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver head replacement.  The shaver head came to me in a couple of days and fit perfectly.  Just know that when you receive these&lt;br /&gt;items sometimes they are not in a \\&quot;Braun\\&quot; retail package, but they come new wrapped in bubble wrap.  The reason for this is that many resellers buy smaller items in bulk to save on cost from the manufacturer.  That is how they can sell to you at such a reasonable price.  It&#x27;s new and cuts and shaves wonderfully ...like the first day I bought the razor.  Plus the item comes to you at a cost about 40 -50% less than you would pay in a retail store! These guys even called me to make sure I got the item and that I was happy.  When was the last time a retailer called you to see if you were happy with your purchases?  Great price and find on Amazon ...will definitely buy again from these guys.</li>
            <li> Great shave. Just like new again</li>
            <li> I love the Braun shavers and when I needed a new head, I ordered this one.  It works great and the price is better than Wal-Mart.  The one thing I like about this company is that you can have them sent automatically and can save the shipping costs.  I didn&#x27;t do it on my first order, but will on my next.  Watch out though.  There are two heads for the Series 3.  I found that out at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> If you buy a Braun electric shaver, make sure to get a replacement head.  These shavers work best when the head is replaced every 6 months or so.</li>
            <li> Works well took a little time to get.</li>
            <li> It was time to replace existing shaver head - and the first use with this new one proved it.</li>
            <li> This is why Amazon is in place. In this age of multiple dozens of different types of items that all do the same thing, it is hard for a brick and mortar store to carry all the replacement parts. Amazon is the perfect venue for this type of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not want to have to replace my electric shaver just because it has a worn out foil. I can use this razor until the mechanisms break instead of having to upgrade to a new one just because my local store no longer carries the replacement foil.</li>
            <li> I got all of the information I could to match the product description given by Braun on the Amazon web site.  The problem was that even with the knowledge that I own a Braun Series 3 370 electric razor I did not have enough information to get the correct replacement foil and blades.  It seems there are 3 versions of this model, each with replacement foil and blades very different from the other two.  I found this out by ordering the replacement parts then finding out that the parts did not fit my razor.  On the back of the razor it does say \\&quot;Use Parts 31S\\&quot; ... and it says, \\&quot;Use only with Braun Series 549 ... class 2 power units\\&quot; and it says, \\&quot;NOM 176\\&quot; ... and it says&#x27; \\&quot;listed 3746\\&quot; and it says \\&quot;Type 5737 and it also lists the operating voltage.  Why not \\&quot;Model 370\\&quot;, \\&quot;repair parts for Model 370\\&quot; and if the model is changed, the next one is \\&quot;Model 371\\&quot; with repair parts for \\&quot;Model 371\\&quot;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line ... Braun fails in their model numbering and/or necessary information on their replacement part information.  Amazon on the other hand wins top scores for ease of ordering AND return.  Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, great shave compared to old worn head. Included the plastic trim piece that broke on mine, not just the cutter and foil.</li>
            <li> nice to have on hand with my new razor purchase instead of waiting for the foil to break and scrambling to get another one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this replacement for for my shaver.  I am not sure if it was me or there was something wrong with the cutter.  BUT, it did not seem as sharp as past cutters I have purchased in brick and mortar stores.  BUT this could be my imagination also.</li>
            <li> I had been using my old razor head for about 3 years. I finally decided to replace. It wasn&#x27;t broken or anything. I just figured it was time for a new head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received the new head I was so surprised at how smoothly it worked. It cut the facial hair much faster and my skin felt so much better afterwards. The difference was stark. I was totally surprised. I guess since the razor gets dull gradually, we don&#x27;t really realize how bad it is untill we change to a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to think the recommendations for changin razor head were a scam but now I am a total fan and will replace the razor head sooner.</li>
            <li> This replacement is hard for me to find for my husband&#x27;s razor.  I can always count on Amazon to find it and at a good price as well!</li>
            <li> My other blades were so warn down it took me 20 mins to shave. Its a clean close shave. Very happy with the Braun series 3 replacement blades..</li>
            <li> Husband loves his new father&#x27;s day gift.  It isn&#x27;t as good as the old fashion razor but still does what it needs to.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was required. A++++</li>
            <li> I kept ignoring the little flashing light to replace the blades on my Braun 370 shaver.  I finally got one and what a difference.  The shaver works so much better.  I guess I forgot how good it used to be versus the apparent steady decline in efficiency over a 2 year period. It takes about half the time to shave now.</li>
            <li> This was a repeat buy, and am very satisfied with it.  Would recommend it over purchasing at stores like Walmart, based on the price.</li>
            <li> The product description was a little confusing. I almost ordered the wrong part. I previously purchased this at a retail store but the wrong one.</li>
            <li> This is a great devise, just make sure that you do kit drop it on the head if the razor. That flimsy grating bends and breaks stupid easy.</li>
            <li> It is necessary to replace the shaving head about every 18 months due to normal wear.  This is the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendation and it was accurate for me.  After installing the new head the shaver was as good as new.</li>
            <li> The most difficult part of buying this replacement cutter was confirming that it would work with my Braun \\&quot;Series 3\\&quot; 360 razor. As other reviewers have stated, you should be able to read \\&quot;32S\\&quot; molded into the plastic beneath the trimmer attachment. (You will have to extend the trimmer to see this code.) This \\&quot;pack\\&quot; does not include a replacement trimmer, but you probably do not need to replace it at 18 months anyway. Also, this \\&quot;pack\\&quot; includes just one complete replacement head, so you may need another eventually. Hopefully this replacement will last as long as the original.</li>
            <li> Braun makes it quite confusing to figure out which replacement to order. Too many different 3 series shavers. This replacement fit my Braun 320s-4 perfectly.</li>
            <li> Replacement head fit my razor and works better than the one I dropped.</li>
            <li> Better price than Walmart, that&#x27;s right (at least at the time I ordered it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my Braun. I only shave every other day or so, so this lasts me a good year, if not longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say you should change them out every 6 months, so that&#x27;s about right. The newer, the better, because it&#x27;s sharper and can handle even a load of hair that&#x27;s been growing for three or four days. But when it starts to get dull, you welcome the opportunity to buy a new one and it&#x27;s worth the money just to do what I did and that&#x27;s buying this replacement head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without a doubt, this electric shaver has been great. Disposable razors slice me up on occasion and I can&#x27;t stand the other screens in the past like the three headed ones which left many hairs behind.</li>
            <li> Easy to install and works great.</li>
            <li> Best shaver I ever had. Replacing foil after 18 months is great.&lt;br /&gt;! But price ouldbe lower. But thats ok.</li>
            <li> This item delivered on schedule and the package was very good.&lt;br /&gt;This was the second time that I ordered it from Amazon.  The unit has always been&lt;br /&gt;properly installed in my shaver.  As long as I have this shaver, I will order this unit again&lt;br /&gt;from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Accurate replacement.</li>
            <li> It works great! It fit perfectly and added a shine since it is silver. Very nice shaver and attachment head</li>
            <li> I meant to buy the actualy razor pieces and ordered this one on accident.  I kind of messed up here.  It does LOOK better than my old one though.</li>
            <li> Thank you, just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The foil mesh cover seems to be a little thicker than the original but overall, works well.</li>
            <li> Great product and delivery</li>
            <li> We had to find our first replacement head  and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere locally, so I was so relieved to find it on Amazon. We had purchased another razor before this one, but he likes this one much better, and he&#x27;s 60.  Very good performance, and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s not hard to find replacement parts.</li>
            <li> They say to replace the head every 18 months and I would say that is about right. Just pop it on and away you go. Works great and the price is good.</li>
            <li> Braun saving products is all that I have used for many years.  They are &amp;#34;top drawer&amp;#34; company.  The entire process was exceptional.</li>
            <li> Great buy! I was looking for the right head to replace my husband&#x27;s shaver. Not knowing anything about shavers, I looked on the Braun website and figured out the right model.. Once I got that info I went on amazon. Not only was it cheaper but it was super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Restored performance to near new level as others have said in other reviews.  *How much does the rechargeable battery replacement cost or is it more cost effective to buy a whole new Braun rechargeable razor?  *(I noticed after 1.5 years of use it does not move the cutter as fast as when new.)</li>
            <li> Shaving with the replacement head renewed the great performance of this razor. The life of the electric razor has been extended.</li>
            <li> these replaced the original heads that developed a small tear in the screen.  work like new.  will buy these again in a year or two</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good, perfectly fit for my Braun Series 3-340s Shaver (B004UQ6Q62).</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my Dad because he was having a hard time finding them in our local stores.  This was perfect, and just what he needed.</li>
            <li> excellent razor hed. Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with the brand name product at a discounted price.</li>
            <li> Husband loves this Braun Replacement Head after we were unable to locate one locally.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly as promised.  Saved me from driving around looking for the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> good replacement for the razor</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price, &#x27;nuff said :)</li>
            <li> Items were as advertised and a good replacements for my old shaver heads</li>
            <li> Excellent product &amp; service.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor and I love it. Faster and cleaner than traditional shaving. GIve your face a week to get used to the change and then it cuts almost as close as razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for a unit that got broken. It was very easy to replace nice to have sharp new blades.</li>
            <li> I have not used the new replacement pack yet but do like the razor and am sure I will be satisfied with this replacement.</li>
            <li> good buy for the money</li>
            <li> Easy to attach and provides a very smooth and close shave!</li>
            <li> Works as intended. It&#x27;s nice to have a functioning razor again.</li>
            <li> What can I say it shaves your face.  What is really nice is not having to go to the store and shop and shop to find this.</li>
            <li> I love my shaver and was happy when I got the replacement heads. They were chrome in color instead of black which was weird but it just added a little style. Love it</li>
            <li> Did not realize the difference in shave until I replaced my old worn out head with this new replacemnet head.</li>
            <li> This product is a great replacement head for my razor.Every 18 months and i Get a new one.You just have to be care it is for the right razor.The part numbers can be a little tricky</li>
            <li> This was an exact replacement for my shaver head and is way cheaper than a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Works out good wish they were cheaper or last longer</li>
            <li> This replacement head fits like a charm and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, shave.</li>
            <li> Good, only thing not quite right.....original shave head cover/protector doesn&#x27;t quite fit on this new replacement head, continues to &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; off. My rating w/ issues: 4/5</li>
            <li> el repuesto dura 2 años!! y la afeitada es simple y sin dolor, igual que la maquina la marca es muy buena</li>
            <li> Very good price.  I was unable to find this replacement head at any of the stores in my area.  Went to amazon.com and found it at a very good price.  Replacement head is definitely a plus to have as the old head was not cutting very good.  Braun recommends replacing the head every 18 months which is probably a very good idea.</li>
            <li> I should really have changed the head a year ago.  I didn&#x27;t realize until I did that the old one was blunt.  Such a difference!</li>
            <li> this works well but the replacement but the head itself is chrome my razor is black other than that it works well would buy again</li>
            <li> This was a replacement head for my dad&#x27;s razor which I gave him for Father&#x27;s Day last year. He has tried many electric razors and this one works the best for him.</li>
            <li> Finally a clean shave again!</li>
            <li> This is my second replacement shaver head I have purchased, and I could not be more satisfied. Clean and comfortable shave even in the shower.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this razor about ]three weeks before i bought the new head. The razor was not satisfactory as it didn&#x27;t cut my beard well at all. I decided to buy a new head to see if it would help. It was amazing, i now love this razor as much as i hated it before the new head was purchased. I will buy another one when this one is dull.</li>
            <li> Perfect Size. Just what my husband needed</li>
            <li> The 32S is an exact fitting part for my Braun 330 Type 5776.  Silver is exactly as previous.  The only issue is that I the cutters and/or foil may be sub-standard to the original parts.  I would shave in the morning and I felt it would last the entire day.  Now with this replacement, it seems to me that I have considerable stubble in the evening. I will try increasing my shaving time but, to be honest, that was the greatest feature about the Braun to me.  I could shave in 2 mins and it would give a close shave to last the day. Perhaps I had developed a lazy shaving style - &amp;#34;its not you its me!!&amp;#34; Cheers!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price for an exact  replacement.</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I have always loved my Braun shaver and this is no exception.  The only challenge is that Braun has redesigned the cutter heads and not changed the series for the shaver.  So a head for the particular series may fit one model and not another.  In the past the same series all used the same cutter head, no longer.</li>
            <li> I bought this for future use on a shaver I bought at the same time.  I have purchased similar replacement packs for earlier Braun shavers.  They have always provided good service.  I have no reason to expect anything different from this replacement pack when it is time to put it into service.  The price was good, somewhat less than I&#x27;ve paid for comparable merchandise in the past five to seven years.</li>
            <li> works good, fit the razor that it was supposed to fit, not sure what else i can say about it.</li>
            <li> Great price- hard to find these at the drug store anymore.</li>
            <li> After a year, it&#x27;s amazing what a difference a new shaver head makes. The hair just glides right off!</li>
            <li> Best razor I have ever owned.. Just keep it clean</li>
            <li> Thank you....a repeat buyer!</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my 340s. It&#x27;s like bran new again. Very happy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the one and only replacement kit for a Braun Series 3. I learned the hard way as there are other kits that say they are but come in multiple pieces that require you to disassemble the foil and blades. On the series 3, the foil assembly comes off in one piece - you know this as you do this all the time to clean your razor. With this kit, you take the old foil assembly off - you toss it into the trash - you place the new foil assembly on and you shave. Too bad I spent $70.00 on other kit to learn this.</li>
            <li> Considering the distance I am from the supplier delivery was excellent and I received these goods within 8 days which suggests the supplier actioned my order promptly. The goods were as purported &amp; arrived well packed and in pristine condition. The quality of the item was of the usual high standard you expect from Braun, and worked beautifully was easy to fit and restored my shaver to as new cutting performance Would use this trader again . Regards and have a great day. Legolas.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun foil package in a timely manner. It fit the shaver as stated and performs great.It usually lasts about 1 year. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I paid a fraction of what Target was selling these for and you have to love that. The replacement fit perfectly and works as expected.</li>
            <li> My face has never been smoother.</li>
            <li> Dennis loved that I was able to find this on line.  He loves his Braun shaver.  It was so nice to find the replacement head instead of rebuying another razor.</li>
            <li> I have wor out 2 of the Braun shavers in the last 10 years or so and they do need a new head ever 18mo or so.</li>
            <li> For his favorite razor.</li>
            <li> Other than replacing the foils every 18 months, I have no complaints. I hope the prices come down to around $14 or $15. I still think rotaries are a better value provided they work. The last $50 Norelco was a total piece of garbage, the circular blades inside the foil housing chipped. Thankfully, I was given this as a present and have used the Braun 3 series ever since.</li>
            <li> This product offer good advantages to low price. It quality is good and I recommend the product. . . . .</li>
            <li> made my razor work like new again</li>
            <li> Great as always...makes it like a new razor every time.</li>
            <li> The product is just OK... the replacement blades did not shave as closely as the original blades.  We may still have to order more if we want to continue to use the shaver</li>
