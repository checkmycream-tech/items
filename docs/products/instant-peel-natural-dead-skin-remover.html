            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Wash it off with warm water.</li>
            <li>Worked liked they said it would.  </li>
            <li>You can do your own research and look up parabens, estrogen, etc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li>She was really happy and didn&#x27;t do her monthly clean ups for almost 2 months.</li>
            <li>Excellent highly recommend</li>
            <li>as a product junkie who prides herself on knowing a good product and being objective, I have to say this is an awesome product.  </li>
            <li>once a month is perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>first I thought this exfoliation treatment was great, and I was pretty happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly around those problem areas.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>This worked ok</li>
            <li>but i think you are just removing mostly product.</li>
            <li>so I was pleased to see it working.  </li>
            <li>My skin glows and looks more youthful after a treatment.</li>
            <li>.............Want or need to know more?  </li>
            <li>Keep reading :) ...........</li>
            <li>I found that doing one side of my face (a cheek and jawline) at the same time works best.</li>
            <li>So just don&#x27;t do it!  :)</li>
            <li>Make sure to seal it.</li>
            <li>My skin was literally and noticeably brighter and more even toned.</li>
            <li>So glad I invested in this product and stumbled across the page.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li>Yayyy :)and go bye-bye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>So glad I invested in this product and stumbled across the page.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li>Yayyy :)</li>
            <li>It does rub off stuff from your face and my face did have more sheen afterwards.</li>
            <li>I need to use it more to get results</li>
            <li>It does smooth the skin; nice during the winter since that allows your moisturizer to work better.  </li>
            <li>Although many companies say there is no scientific evidence that parabens are carcinogenic or unsafe, there are reports that disagree, saying that parabens disrupt endocrine function, and that they can mimic estrogen by binding to estrogen receptor cells.  </li>
            <li>love this peel, dont use it too often</li>
            <li>which is oddly satisfying.  </li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked more radiant or glowing.  </li>
            <li>I bought this many years ago in a cosmetic supply chain store that was going out of business.  </li>
            <li>anywhere -- &amp; I looked in many stores.  </li>
            <li>love it.  </li>
            <li>If I could give it 10 starrs I would! :-)</li>
            <li>I used it in the shower and while it took some time to rub it in, after I got out my face has never felt so smooth!</li>
            <li>This is a great product really works.</li>
            <li>I might get two more applications out of it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The first use made my face look amazon!!!</li>
            <li>But Amazon&#x27;s price is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>even a cheap drugstore one is fine, but I like Korre&#x27;s mud-based rose or pomegranate masks for this).</li>
            <li>Best used in shower, after skin is damp and warm, a little at a time.</li>
            <li>The benefits are so great that this is now a part of my (new) face care regimen.</li>
            <li>The benefits are so great that this is now a part of my (new) face care regimen.</li>
            <li>I have an important diner out or daytime outing, I always use Instant Peel to guarantee flawless radiance.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to stop rubbing when the skin stops rolling off onto your fingers and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>all my friends who i have given this to try love it and want more...not cheap, but my skin glows</li>
            <li>Because it really is that good.</li>
            <li>(hang one over the shower rod where you can get to it easily).</li>
            <li>Fine lines are&lt;br /&gt;no</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t need one full packet for your face to get a good result -- the first time I used one full packet</li>
            <li>I got this as a free sample from a lady who came into my job trying to sell us these products, I didn&#x27;t think any of it</li>
            <li>I am happy to&lt;br /&gt;have discovered Instant Peel &amp; now cannot be without it.</li>
            <li>but after I finished with it .. my face felt so smooth.  </li>
            <li>After using the peel,  I use a quality oil control astringent, and a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>After using the peel,  I use a quality oil control astringent, and a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>use the product when I get out of the shower, smooth it on my face, and watch the skin rub off.  </li>
            <li>No joke, it really has this amazing sloughing ability -</li>
            <li>So far I loved it.</li>
            <li>Leaves your face so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for you skin loving product junkies out</li>
            <li>As an experienced and savvy, 56 year old product consumer, I accidently found this product online and read all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I was overly excited).  </li>
            <li>The original box I had did not list the ingredients, but now it does.  </li>
            <li>I actually purchased for my feet and ended up loving it for my face!  </li>
            <li>simply the most amazing peel I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Exfoliated in between peels and was diligent about keeping my skin and pores clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a must purchase for those people who want to have a clean face.</li>
            <li>Also, my skin feels super smooth, and my makeup looks better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I rationed it out -- using it for special occasions.</li>
            <li>I would use it a lot more often if it didn&#x27;t cost so much per use.</li>
            <li>Since the Baiden Mitten works on my face (just have to rub more gently)</li>
            <li>And getting it off really does make your skin so much better</li>
            <li>There are only six envelopes, but I find each one is good for two or three applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was brighter and smoother after the very first application.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In lieu of monthly visits to a spa, I follow the below regiment, which saves money in the long run without compromising good</li>
            <li>my face look clean and more clear age spot .  </li>
            <li>Again, this was after the first use!</li>
            <li>Again, this was after the first use!</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and one packet last about 3 uses.</li>
            <li>Great to use one week  after a laser peel to get rid of the dead skin and flaking.  </li>
            <li>It is somewhat pricey,but well worth the&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey but the benefits are well worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny in my opinion</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so smooth, clean and soft.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t anything special nor did it seem to help my skin much.  </li>
            <li>and my skin is still super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>After using this product my skin became extremely irritated and now I have mild acne and burns from it!!!</li>
            <li>Way better than any facial scrub product I have tried (which have been plenty!).  </li>
            <li>lovely product that I cannot recommend enough.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>I just love a product that provides instant gratification and follows through on their claims!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not going to be using this product any longer, even though It worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>I give it five stars because it does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li>, skin was radiant looking and felt baby soft smooth.</li>
            <li>When I first started using the product I used it 2 times the first week (3 packets)</li>

            <li>When I first started using the product I used it 2 times the first week (3 packets)</li>
            <li>Instant Peel gives me more immediate radiance</li>
            <li>I couldnt stop touching my face the days following this....</li>
            <li>After using it my skin is completely and totally smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I first purchased this about 15 years ago,have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li>In addition, drinking lots and lots of water and lots of fruits and veggies, sun protection, taking vitamins, lots of green tea, and getting a good night&#x27;s rest, are also required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In addition, drinking lots and lots of water and lots of fruits and veggies, sun protection, taking vitamins, lots of green tea, and getting a good night&#x27;s rest, are also required.    </li>
            <li>I am very excited about Instant peel .</li>
            <li>used at home  salicylic and glycolic (liquid kind) peels every other week.  </li>
            <li>I tried other non-shower methods like steaming face, warm damp towel on face, etc).</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife after reading all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Gives even my sensitive skin a quick pick up in minutes.  </li>
            <li>longer visible nor large pores.&lt;br /&gt;You will not be dissapointed.</li>
            <li>Reduced acne and large</li>
            <li>The large pores on my cheeks had reduced in size, acne pimples drastically reduced in size,</li>
            <li>The large pores on my cheeks had reduced in size, acne pimples drastically reduced in size,</li>
            <li>But I certainly will keep using the product until it is gone.</li>
            <li>If your looking for a gentle exfoliator!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So it really does work, even my mom noticed just by looking at me.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it until I finish the whole box.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think it works.</li>
            <li>By the way, I&#x27;m 59 and look for gentle products if I&#x27;m putting them on my face.  </li>
            <li>my nose is very oily, and I was really going at it.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to give myself this very beneficial treatment.</li>
            <li>I get three uses from one packet so its very affordable.</li>
            <li>My skin tone has evened out quite a bit especially near the jawline.  </li>
            <li>My skin tone has evened out quite a bit especially near the jawline.  </li>
            <li>so I could use it all over my whole</li>
            <li>This is so much easier to use, and the results are immediate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it about once a week, and it took probably five weeks for me to go through a whole packet.  </li>
            <li>Much to my dismay, I never could find it again</li>
            <li>I am a product queen and this product really made my skin look radiant.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it really peels skin.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much......</li>
            <li>It needed to be thicker but the cream was really liquidity</li>
            <li>I had anxiety each time I used them, so I was extra careful and received good results.  </li>
            <li>This product works quickly and and is mild enough to use once a week on sensitive skin if massaged gently.</li>
            <li>Right now, my face just looks alright, not glowing completely yet.</li>
            <li>Reading the reviews it looks like other people have had better results.</li>
            <li>I have never used a product that has left me skin so smooth and soft!!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t suggest the level of regimentation to those with sensitive skin or dry skin.in, once a week for others),and in the \\&quot;in between\\&quot; days, stick to a regiment of a clarisonic brush or a good daily exfoliating scrub followed by toner and lotion</li>
            <li>I think temporarily, it takes the superficial loose dead cells off when you roll it but best to buy a derma roller or get personal microdermabrasion.</li>
            <li>i think its little bit expensive , but works good, good for oily skin</li>
            <li>Somehow, a clay-based mask, no matter if it&#x27;s a cheap Queen Helene Mint Julep mask or a Murad mask, clay sucks up alot of dirt, whiteheads, blackheads, and oily gunk when the pores are just steamed open, rather than washing your face with warm water and slapping a mud mask on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a whole new thing for me.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a whole new thing for me.  </li>
            <li>This is important because the product will dry outand go</li>
            <li>hop in steam shower or use a hot towel on your face, use the instant peel by squeezing a glob and work through each problem area, wash off once that area is \\&quot;sloughed off.\\&quot; moisten face with hot towel again, then keep going, region by region.</li>
            <li>This was my second purchase, and it does exactly what I remembered it doing the first time.  </li>
            <li>Parabens (e.g., methylparabens, propylparabens, etc.) can be found in the ingredient listings of many beauty and cosmetic products such as shampoo/conditioner, moisturizer, facial treatments, body wash, etc.---many products that contain water.  </li>
            <li>a facial done -- &amp; you&#x27;d pay way more for a facial.  </li>
            <li>Removed dead skin leaving your face feeling soft and nice .</li>
            <li>I think); at least try to get the most bang for your buck!  </li>
            <li>50 dollars is alot of money, espically when its for 5 applications, but my wife loves it, i even tried one and it works, i will buy it again even with the high cost</li>
            <li>With your fingers, smooth liquidy cream onto an area of your face; then, using back and forth motion apply light to moderate pressure (don&#x27;t massage it in using a circular motion-go back and forth).</li>
            <li>am in my early 40&#x27;s and have mocha brown skin which tends to get oily in certain areas of my face.  </li>
            <li>:)  Rinse off the product from fingers and splash a little on face to get rid of the residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use a soothing toner like L&#x27;occitane&#x27;s Immortelle brightening water or the normal Immortelle water.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li>Better yet, I recommend buying some natural dead sea salts, mix with aloe or some natural oil, like castor, vit e, grapeseed oil, gently message over your face and get ready to have the softest, smoothest, clearest skin.</li>
            <li>You will know when all of the dead skin is off your face because you will not be able to roll anymore</li>
            <li>I learned about it from an I Heart Daily post and bought it right away.</li>
            <li>Actually, you get far better results than a professional facial.  </li>
            <li>you do this at least once a week (1-2 for oily skin, once a week for others),and in the \\&quot;in between\\&quot; days, stick to a regiment of a clarisonic brush or a good daily exfoliating scrub followed by toner and lotion</li>
            <li>This product really works by removing dead skin and afterwards my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Immediately sloughs (with gentle finger rubbing) the dead skin from my face, leaving it soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I also suffer from adult acne which can range from a pimple or 2 or 10!</li>
            <li>Wow !  </li>
            <li>I stumbled upon this product, read all the glowing reviews and so appreciated that these weren&#x27;t the new kind of Amazon gimmicky fake reviews where people get free products, I ordered</li>
            <li>This way when I do my regular washing, I use my wash cloth a little more on those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It gets off ALL the dead skin and makes your skin soft and smooth, and it temporarily reduces the appearance of pores.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>above regiment is for very oily skin.</li>
            <li>The above regiment is for very oily skin.</li>
            <li>WOW.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised with all the build up i had on my face.  </li>
            <li>They are a naturally occurring chemical but putting it on your skin often can cause it to build up in the fat cells underneath.</li>
            <li>I have used the one envelope so far.</li>
            <li>thought that since I used a Clarisonic on a fairly regular basis, this product probably just wouldn&#x27;t have much of a job to do.&lt;br /&gt;OH.</li>
            <li>I never found anything that works anywhere near as well.</li>
            <li>shows you why it is important to exfoliate,you literally see and feel the dead skin peel away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been nearly a week since I used it</li>
            <li>and it was actually too much</li>
            <li>I use a facial scrub every day and this exfoliant was still able to remove dead skin and sebum.  </li>
            <li>but if you have a lot of dead skin then you will spend a little more time in the shower and possibly risk running out of hot water!  </li>
            <li>I recently bought it elsewhere on-line for 20% off which brought the price down to $40. &amp; free shipping.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen it sold it any other way (besides these packets) but it would be so cool if they packaged it differently</li>
            <li>I tested a few times and confirmed that after you rubbed all the crumbs off of one area of skin, you couldn&#x27;t make the product \\&quot;crumb up\\&quot; again on that spot, but I wasn&#x27;t totally sure it was because it had taken all the dead skin off or if it was some other aspect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this peel, one packet last for at least 3 peels.  </li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s just kind of tedious to rub the skin off and wipe the remaining cream off your face.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s really gentle and gets the job done if you do it correctly.</li>
            <li>am now addicted to this product and have had to order several more boxes.</li>
            <li>NOTE &amp; TIP:&lt;br /&gt;Unbeknownst to me, when I first used the product I had so much dead skin on my face</li>
            <li>I will also note that I have not had as much dead skin removal since the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>I will also note that I have not had as much dead skin removal since the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if it really removed my dead skin, but not bad.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing I will see much more dramatic changes within the next couple months if I keep using it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t suggest the level of regimentation to those with sensitive skin or dry skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty darn expensive for 6 packets (but worth it</li>
            <li>I was sure I would have very little dead skin cell removal because I exfoliated regularly.  </li>

            <li> This product is truly amazing -- my skin feels like a baby&#x27;s skin after I use it.  </li>

            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Wash it off with warm water.</li>
            <li> Worked liked they said it would.  </li>
            <li> You can do your own research and look up parabens, estrogen, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> She was really happy and didn&#x27;t do her monthly clean ups for almost 2 months.</li>
            <li> Excellent highly recommend</li>
            <li> as a product junkie who prides herself on knowing a good product and being objective, I have to say this is an awesome product.  </li>
            <li> once a month is perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> first I thought this exfoliation treatment was great, and I was pretty happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly around those problem areas.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> This worked ok</li>
            <li> but i think you are just removing mostly product.</li>
            <li> so I was pleased to see it working.  </li>
            <li> My skin glows and looks more youthful after a treatment.</li>
            <li> .............Want or need to know more?  </li>
            <li> Keep reading :) ...........</li>
            <li> I found that doing one side of my face (a cheek and jawline) at the same time works best.</li>
            <li> So just don&#x27;t do it!  :)</li>
            <li> Make sure to seal it.</li>
            <li> My skin was literally and noticeably brighter and more even toned.</li>
            <li> So glad I invested in this product and stumbled across the page.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li> Yayyy :)and go bye-bye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I love the way my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li> Yayyy :)</li>
            <li> It does rub off stuff from your face and my face did have more sheen afterwards.</li>
            <li> I need to use it more to get results</li>
            <li> It does smooth the skin; nice during the winter since that allows your moisturizer to work better.  </li>
            <li> Although many companies say there is no scientific evidence that parabens are carcinogenic or unsafe, there are reports that disagree, saying that parabens disrupt endocrine function, and that they can mimic estrogen by binding to estrogen receptor cells.  </li>
            <li> love this peel, dont use it too often</li>
            <li> which is oddly satisfying.  </li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked more radiant or glowing.  </li>
            <li> I bought this many years ago in a cosmetic supply chain store that was going out of business.  </li>
            <li> anywhere -- &amp; I looked in many stores.  </li>
            <li> love it.  </li>
            <li> If I could give it 10 starrs I would! :-)</li>
            <li> I used it in the shower and while it took some time to rub it in, after I got out my face has never felt so smooth!</li>
            <li> This is a great product really works.</li>
            <li> I might get two more applications out of it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The first use made my face look amazon!!!</li>
            <li> But Amazon&#x27;s price is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> even a cheap drugstore one is fine, but I like Korre&#x27;s mud-based rose or pomegranate masks for this).</li>
            <li> Best used in shower, after skin is damp and warm, a little at a time.</li>
            <li> The benefits are so great that this is now a part of my (new) face care regimen.</li>
            <li> The benefits are so great that this is now a part of my (new) face care regimen.</li>
            <li> I have an important diner out or daytime outing, I always use Instant Peel to guarantee flawless radiance.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to stop rubbing when the skin stops rolling off onto your fingers and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> all my friends who i have given this to try love it and want more...not cheap, but my skin glows</li>
            <li> Because it really is that good.</li>
            <li> (hang one over the shower rod where you can get to it easily).</li>
            <li> Fine lines are&lt;br /&gt;no</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need one full packet for your face to get a good result -- the first time I used one full packet</li>
            <li> I got this as a free sample from a lady who came into my job trying to sell us these products, I didn&#x27;t think any of it</li>
            <li> I am happy to&lt;br /&gt;have discovered Instant Peel &amp; now cannot be without it.</li>
            <li> but after I finished with it .. my face felt so smooth.  </li>
            <li> After using the peel,  I use a quality oil control astringent, and a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> After using the peel,  I use a quality oil control astringent, and a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li> use the product when I get out of the shower, smooth it on my face, and watch the skin rub off.  </li>
            <li> No joke, it really has this amazing sloughing ability -</li>
            <li> So far I loved it.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for you skin loving product junkies out</li>
            <li> As an experienced and savvy, 56 year old product consumer, I accidently found this product online and read all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I was overly excited).  </li>
            <li> The original box I had did not list the ingredients, but now it does.  </li>
            <li> I actually purchased for my feet and ended up loving it for my face!  </li>
            <li> simply the most amazing peel I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Exfoliated in between peels and was diligent about keeping my skin and pores clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a must purchase for those people who want to have a clean face.</li>
            <li> Also, my skin feels super smooth, and my makeup looks better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I rationed it out -- using it for special occasions.</li>
            <li> I would use it a lot more often if it didn&#x27;t cost so much per use.</li>
            <li> Since the Baiden Mitten works on my face (just have to rub more gently)</li>
            <li> And getting it off really does make your skin so much better</li>
            <li> There are only six envelopes, but I find each one is good for two or three applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was brighter and smoother after the very first application.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In lieu of monthly visits to a spa, I follow the below regiment, which saves money in the long run without compromising good</li>
            <li> my face look clean and more clear age spot .  </li>
            <li> Again, this was after the first use!</li>
            <li> Again, this was after the first use!</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and one packet last about 3 uses.</li>
            <li> Great to use one week  after a laser peel to get rid of the dead skin and flaking.  </li>
            <li> It is somewhat pricey,but well worth the&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey but the benefits are well worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny in my opinion</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt so smooth, clean and soft.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t anything special nor did it seem to help my skin much.  </li>
            <li> and my skin is still super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> After using this product my skin became extremely irritated and now I have mild acne and burns from it!!!</li>
            <li> Way better than any facial scrub product I have tried (which have been plenty!).  </li>
            <li> lovely product that I cannot recommend enough.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li> I just love a product that provides instant gratification and follows through on their claims!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to be using this product any longer, even though It worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> I give it five stars because it does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li> , skin was radiant looking and felt baby soft smooth.</li>
            <li> When I first started using the product I used it 2 times the first week (3 packets)</li>

            <li> When I first started using the product I used it 2 times the first week (3 packets)</li>
            <li> Instant Peel gives me more immediate radiance</li>
            <li> I couldnt stop touching my face the days following this....</li>
            <li> After using it my skin is completely and totally smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I first purchased this about 15 years ago,have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li> In addition, drinking lots and lots of water and lots of fruits and veggies, sun protection, taking vitamins, lots of green tea, and getting a good night&#x27;s rest, are also required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In addition, drinking lots and lots of water and lots of fruits and veggies, sun protection, taking vitamins, lots of green tea, and getting a good night&#x27;s rest, are also required.    </li>
            <li> I am very excited about Instant peel .</li>
            <li> used at home  salicylic and glycolic (liquid kind) peels every other week.  </li>
            <li> I tried other non-shower methods like steaming face, warm damp towel on face, etc).</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife after reading all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Gives even my sensitive skin a quick pick up in minutes.  </li>
            <li> longer visible nor large pores.&lt;br /&gt;You will not be dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Reduced acne and large</li>
            <li> The large pores on my cheeks had reduced in size, acne pimples drastically reduced in size,</li>
            <li> The large pores on my cheeks had reduced in size, acne pimples drastically reduced in size,</li>
            <li> But I certainly will keep using the product until it is gone.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a gentle exfoliator!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So it really does work, even my mom noticed just by looking at me.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it until I finish the whole box.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think it works.</li>
            <li> By the way, I&#x27;m 59 and look for gentle products if I&#x27;m putting them on my face.  </li>
            <li> my nose is very oily, and I was really going at it.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to give myself this very beneficial treatment.</li>
            <li> I get three uses from one packet so its very affordable.</li>
            <li> My skin tone has evened out quite a bit especially near the jawline.  </li>
            <li> My skin tone has evened out quite a bit especially near the jawline.  </li>
            <li> so I could use it all over my whole</li>
            <li> This is so much easier to use, and the results are immediate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it about once a week, and it took probably five weeks for me to go through a whole packet.  </li>
            <li> Much to my dismay, I never could find it again</li>
            <li> I am a product queen and this product really made my skin look radiant.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it really peels skin.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much......</li>
            <li> It needed to be thicker but the cream was really liquidity</li>
            <li> I had anxiety each time I used them, so I was extra careful and received good results.  </li>
            <li> This product works quickly and and is mild enough to use once a week on sensitive skin if massaged gently.</li>
            <li> Right now, my face just looks alright, not glowing completely yet.</li>
            <li> Reading the reviews it looks like other people have had better results.</li>
            <li> I have never used a product that has left me skin so smooth and soft!!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t suggest the level of regimentation to those with sensitive skin or dry skin.in, once a week for others),and in the \\&quot;in between\\&quot; days, stick to a regiment of a clarisonic brush or a good daily exfoliating scrub followed by toner and lotion</li>
            <li> I think temporarily, it takes the superficial loose dead cells off when you roll it but best to buy a derma roller or get personal microdermabrasion.</li>
            <li> i think its little bit expensive , but works good, good for oily skin</li>
            <li> Somehow, a clay-based mask, no matter if it&#x27;s a cheap Queen Helene Mint Julep mask or a Murad mask, clay sucks up alot of dirt, whiteheads, blackheads, and oily gunk when the pores are just steamed open, rather than washing your face with warm water and slapping a mud mask on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a whole new thing for me.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a whole new thing for me.  </li>
            <li> This is important because the product will dry outand go</li>
            <li> hop in steam shower or use a hot towel on your face, use the instant peel by squeezing a glob and work through each problem area, wash off once that area is \\&quot;sloughed off.\\&quot; moisten face with hot towel again, then keep going, region by region.</li>
            <li> This was my second purchase, and it does exactly what I remembered it doing the first time.  </li>
            <li> Parabens (e.g., methylparabens, propylparabens, etc.) can be found in the ingredient listings of many beauty and cosmetic products such as shampoo/conditioner, moisturizer, facial treatments, body wash, etc.---many products that contain water.  </li>
            <li> a facial done -- &amp; you&#x27;d pay way more for a facial.  </li>
            <li> Removed dead skin leaving your face feeling soft and nice .</li>
            <li> I think); at least try to get the most bang for your buck!  </li>
            <li> 50 dollars is alot of money, espically when its for 5 applications, but my wife loves it, i even tried one and it works, i will buy it again even with the high cost</li>
            <li> With your fingers, smooth liquidy cream onto an area of your face; then, using back and forth motion apply light to moderate pressure (don&#x27;t massage it in using a circular motion-go back and forth).</li>
            <li> am in my early 40&#x27;s and have mocha brown skin which tends to get oily in certain areas of my face.  </li>
            <li> :)  Rinse off the product from fingers and splash a little on face to get rid of the residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use a soothing toner like L&#x27;occitane&#x27;s Immortelle brightening water or the normal Immortelle water.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li> Better yet, I recommend buying some natural dead sea salts, mix with aloe or some natural oil, like castor, vit e, grapeseed oil, gently message over your face and get ready to have the softest, smoothest, clearest skin.</li>
            <li> You will know when all of the dead skin is off your face because you will not be able to roll anymore</li>
            <li> I learned about it from an I Heart Daily post and bought it right away.</li>
            <li> Actually, you get far better results than a professional facial.  </li>
            <li> you do this at least once a week (1-2 for oily skin, once a week for others),and in the \\&quot;in between\\&quot; days, stick to a regiment of a clarisonic brush or a good daily exfoliating scrub followed by toner and lotion</li>
            <li> This product really works by removing dead skin and afterwards my skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Immediately sloughs (with gentle finger rubbing) the dead skin from my face, leaving it soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I also suffer from adult acne which can range from a pimple or 2 or 10!</li>
            <li> Wow !  </li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this product, read all the glowing reviews and so appreciated that these weren&#x27;t the new kind of Amazon gimmicky fake reviews where people get free products, I ordered</li>
            <li> This way when I do my regular washing, I use my wash cloth a little more on those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It gets off ALL the dead skin and makes your skin soft and smooth, and it temporarily reduces the appearance of pores.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> above regiment is for very oily skin.</li>
            <li> The above regiment is for very oily skin.</li>
            <li> WOW.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised with all the build up i had on my face.  </li>
            <li> They are a naturally occurring chemical but putting it on your skin often can cause it to build up in the fat cells underneath.</li>
            <li> I have used the one envelope so far.</li>
            <li> thought that since I used a Clarisonic on a fairly regular basis, this product probably just wouldn&#x27;t have much of a job to do.&lt;br /&gt;OH.</li>
            <li> I never found anything that works anywhere near as well.</li>
            <li> shows you why it is important to exfoliate,you literally see and feel the dead skin peel away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been nearly a week since I used it</li>
            <li> and it was actually too much</li>
            <li> I use a facial scrub every day and this exfoliant was still able to remove dead skin and sebum.  </li>
            <li> but if you have a lot of dead skin then you will spend a little more time in the shower and possibly risk running out of hot water!  </li>
            <li> I recently bought it elsewhere on-line for 20% off which brought the price down to $40. &amp; free shipping.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen it sold it any other way (besides these packets) but it would be so cool if they packaged it differently</li>
            <li> I tested a few times and confirmed that after you rubbed all the crumbs off of one area of skin, you couldn&#x27;t make the product \\&quot;crumb up\\&quot; again on that spot, but I wasn&#x27;t totally sure it was because it had taken all the dead skin off or if it was some other aspect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this peel, one packet last for at least 3 peels.  </li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s just kind of tedious to rub the skin off and wipe the remaining cream off your face.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s really gentle and gets the job done if you do it correctly.</li>
            <li> am now addicted to this product and have had to order several more boxes.</li>
            <li> NOTE &amp; TIP:&lt;br /&gt;Unbeknownst to me, when I first used the product I had so much dead skin on my face</li>
            <li> I will also note that I have not had as much dead skin removal since the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> I will also note that I have not had as much dead skin removal since the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it really removed my dead skin, but not bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing I will see much more dramatic changes within the next couple months if I keep using it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t suggest the level of regimentation to those with sensitive skin or dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty darn expensive for 6 packets (but worth it</li>
            <li> I was sure I would have very little dead skin cell removal because I exfoliated regularly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s like an eraser, and sloughs off little rolled layers of old skin, just as with an eraser, for when you don&#x27;t feel so dry and faded that a professional peel at the dermatologist is needed</li>
            <li> Kind of disgusting how many dead skin layers are on the human face though, but that&#x27;s the point of it all.</li>
            <li> , that really is your dead dry skin layer that is crumbing up and rolling off when you use it.  </li>
            <li> I am a dark skin African American women, I never had acne in my life!!!!</li>
            <li> wash face, steam your face for however long your skin type needs</li>
            <li> I used a brush fan to apply on my face verses my fingers cause of my long nails.  </li>
            <li> Used sparingly, it can go a long way.  </li>
            <li> When I bought this I was hoping for a solution to my problem of a perpetually flakey face.  </li>
            <li> Rubs away all stubborn dead skin leaving beautifully soft even toned skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway - I&#x27;ve since become enlightened to the dry skin crumbing/rolling truth - because of buying the Baiden Mitten, which (without any other product added except water) rubs all the dry skin off your entire body in the same way.  </li>
            <li> , a baby smooth layer is revealed underneath that has no more flaking, dull dry scaley etc.</li>
            <li> 1 sachet can last long if you only have a few dry areas on your skin.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin with blackhead problems on the nose and cheeks, and dry flaky skin around the lips.</li>
            <li> It gets rid of blackheads and sloughs off the dry skin around the nose, cheeks, and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> pat dry with a cloth</li>
            <li> and I exfoliate often, as I have dry skin</li>
            <li> 1 packet treatment a month takes away all the dry patches,hard to eradicate patches with ease.</li>
            <li> Now before I go on, understand that I&#x27;m not one of those crazy granola-hippie people who scream &amp;#34;chemiKILLS&amp;#34; at everything; I drink diet soda every once in a while, eat processed foods like everyone else, and the like, but I&#x27;m going to be more careful with skincare products</li>
            <li> This product is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that actively removes all the blackheads from my face.</li>
            <li> Once in the shower for about 1-2 minutes (your face has to be moist/damp NOT wet), squeeze out a little bit onto the tips  of your fingers.  </li>
            <li> generally use Retin-A, and clinically proven skin products, but during the winter they are  too harsh, since I am outdoors allot.</li>
            <li> This past year I began seeing large pores around my cheek area and noticed my face had become uneven in skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I was VERY skeptical at first, I was completely convinced that the product itself was simply drying and turning into those little crumbs as you rub it on your face and that it wasn&#x27;t actually exfoliating anything.  </li>
            <li> price is a little steep, but I don&#x27;t use an entire packet each time.  </li>
            <li> Not abrasive, only acts where it finds dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> Just be careful with how vigorously you rub -</li>
            <li> Parabens can also mimic the hormone estrogen (because it&#x27;s metabolized into a phytoestrogen), which means those who have endocrine problems/imbalance/sensitivity/disorders need to really be careful how often they are using skin products with parabens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I definitely don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a gimmick as if there&#x27;s no spot where there is dead skin, the product does not activate at all.</li>
            <li> You can actually feel &amp; see the dead skin coming off</li>
            <li> The thing that actually peels of, is the stuff that you apply on the skin and not your dead skin.</li>
            <li> and it really didn&#x27;t get off hardly any dead skin!</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way</li>
            <li> I think there are other options for cheaper that you can get.</li>
            <li> These of course, leave some acne scars (due to extraction) but once I have that under control with the use of creams, treatments and use of peels....</li>
            <li> Repeat process on other side and forehead.</li>
            <li> and then once every other week (1 packet).</li>
            <li> and then once every other week (1 packet).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty expensive for the small quantity you get, especially if you want to use it all over and not just your face.</li>
            <li> Then when she finally did it, her beautician said all her dead skin is still there and her pores are clogged!</li>
            <li> The dead skin actually rubs off in little balls.</li>
            <li> done showering, I dried off, patted face dry and couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes when I looked in the mirror.  </li>
            <li> done showering, I dried off, patted face dry and couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes when I looked in the mirror.  </li>
            <li> I am truly shocked at how fantastic my skin feels after using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really the dead skin on your face coming off.  </li>
            <li> Try it on something non-skin related and see what I mean.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s sold on Amazon &amp; a few other places.  </li>
            <li> I ended up using a pack and a half of product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed the wrinkles on my forehead lessen, the pores on my nose are clearer, and the parenthesis around my mouth are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Do wish it was a little bit cheaper</li>
            <li> If you pay $44 for the 6 packets that comes to a little over $7.</li>
            <li> and I was amazed at how one little packet could take off so much dead skin.</li>
            <li> And sometimes when I know there&#x27;s a lot of dead skin on my face that I can see, I&#x27;ll use this stuff and it won&#x27;t \\&quot;find\\&quot; the dead skin to peel off (i.e., it won&#x27;t roll the dead skin off in those little balls like it&#x27;s supposed to).  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately it did not seem to work half as well as numerous other products that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Dead skin rolled off in moments.  </li>
            <li> I dont want to waste any of it and with the brush</li>
            <li> The dead skin will roll off onto your fingers.</li>
            <li> If you have dead skin it somehow clings to it so you can rub it off.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money for this one.</li>
            <li> , I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my money on the acid.  </li>
            <li> or you don&#x27;t have much dead skin to slough</li>
            <li> I tell them my secret: Instant Peel.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much dead skin I had</li>
            <li> I have dead skin on my face every day that can be seen when I apply my makeup.  </li>
            <li> This stuff does take off some of the dead skin, but not all.  </li>
            <li> there it is... the dead skin.  </li>
            <li> Once she started using it, she noticed her dead skin peeling off.</li>
            <li> The layers of dead skin peeled off almost immediately.</li>
            <li> If you rub too hard and continue to rub vigorously past the \\&quot;no more rolling required\\&quot; point you will cause your face to be raw and red and even perhaps end up damaging your skin</li>
            <li> Will save you $$$ on expensive peels because it works just as well with no down time.</li>
            <li> and I am still currently having this problem I am hoping it will eventually clear up and heal :-(</li>
            <li> and you get the result instantly instead of skin peeling and flaking constantly and looking bad under your makeup.</li>
            <li> The product isn&#x27;t supposed to affect new skin cells but, again, if you rub like a mad woman (i.e., yours truly) then there is a risk of hurting your skin.  </li>
            <li> Unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> Overall I would not recommend it and it is expensive.  </li>
            <li> - just usually go with glycolic acid cream, or a peel off mask...</li>
            <li> Yes it is expensive, but I get two to three uses out of each packet and only use it once every week or two.</li>
            <li> No more Chemical peels for me.</li>
            <li> The creases of my nose around my nostrils ended up very raw and sore.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how it works, but it DOES!</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad it has paraben in it which is not good, but I only use it about once a month</li>
            <li> sometimes afraid I would burn my skin, leave on too long or just make my situation worse.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like parabens are horrible, terrible things to avoid at all costs, I&#x27;m just saying to be careful and inform yourselves:)</li>
            <li> GOD.&lt;br /&gt;I used the product yesterday and so much old, dead, nasty skin came off of my nose and the surrounding areas that I stopped rubbing out of an irrational concern that there was something really wrong with</li>
            <li> Poor product.</li>
            <li> Very expensive, not effective.</li>
            <li> And then one day I decided to take a look at what the ingredients actually were, and I discovered that this is some terrible stuff to be putting on your skin!  </li>
            <li> wrong.  </li>
            <li> It seems expensive, but you get the results you&#x27;d get</li>
            <li> It kinds of give a fake feeling of cleansing your skin.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical</li>
            <li> horrible product in my opinion</li>
            <li> Terrible product.....</li>
            <li> Disappointed!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff works! Amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and one packet last about 3 uses. It&#x27;s well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> This product works as it promises.  Kind of disgusting how many dead skin layers are on the human face though, but that&#x27;s the point of it all.</li>
            <li> I am a dark skin African American women, I never had acne in my life!!!! After using this product my skin became extremely irritated and now I have mild acne and burns from it!!! This was almost a month a go and I am still currently having this problem I am hoping it will eventually clear up and heal :-( don&#x27;t buy this!!!! If your looking for a gentle exfoliator!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first use made my face look amazon!!! But over time just was to ruff for my skin horrible product in my opinion</li>
            <li> I got this as a free sample from a lady who came into my job trying to sell us these products, I didn&#x27;t think any of it and I decided to try it out this morning and let me tell you WOW. I had to look it up to see if I could purchase it online. Because it really is that good. My skin has never felt so smooth, clean and soft. So it really does work, even my mom noticed just by looking at me. Therefore I recommend this greatly.</li>
            <li> 50 dollars is alot of money, espically when its for 5 applications, but my wife loves it, i even tried one and it works, i will buy it again even with the high cost</li>
            <li> I discovered this peel years ago when Bliss carried the product. I have oily skin with blackhead problems on the nose and cheeks, and dry flaky skin around the lips. I use it mostly around those problem areas. It gets rid of blackheads and sloughs off the dry skin around the nose, cheeks, and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like an eraser, and sloughs off little rolled layers of old skin, just as with an eraser, for when you don&#x27;t feel so dry and faded that a professional peel at the dermatologist is needed yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In lieu of monthly visits to a spa, I follow the below regiment, which saves money in the long run without compromising good skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good \\&quot;at home,\\&quot; facial regiment once a week for glowing skin is:&lt;br /&gt;1) wash face, steam your face for however long your skin type needs (I have a face steamer, which I pour eucalpytus or lavender essential oil into--and I steam to open up my pores for about 15-20 minutes).&lt;br /&gt;2) immediately slap on a mud-based face mask (even a cheap drugstore one is fine, but I like Korre&#x27;s mud-based rose or pomegranate masks for this). Wait til mask dries. Wash it off with warm water. Somehow, a clay-based mask, no matter if it&#x27;s a cheap Queen Helene Mint Julep mask or a Murad mask, clay sucks up alot of dirt, whiteheads, blackheads, and oily gunk when the pores are just steamed open, rather than washing your face with warm water and slapping a mud mask on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) hop in steam shower or use a hot towel on your face, use the instant peel by squeezing a glob and work through each problem area, wash off once that area is \\&quot;sloughed off.\\&quot; moisten face with hot towel again, then keep going, region by region. If you squeeze it all out at once and rub all over the place, it won&#x27;t be as effective.&lt;br /&gt;4) wash off. Use a soothing toner like L&#x27;occitane&#x27;s Immortelle brightening water or the normal Immortelle water.&lt;br /&gt;5) use good night treatment lotion (immortelle brightening cream, Caudelie night cream, Clarins, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do this at least once a week (1-2 for oily skin, once a week for others),and in the \\&quot;in between\\&quot; days, stick to a regiment of a clarisonic brush or a good daily exfoliating scrub followed by toner and lotion your skin will glow. In addition, drinking lots and lots of water and lots of fruits and veggies, sun protection, taking vitamins, lots of green tea, and getting a good night&#x27;s rest, are also required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above regiment is for very oily skin. I don&#x27;t suggest the level of regimentation to those with sensitive skin or dry skin.in, once a week for others),and in the \\&quot;in between\\&quot; days, stick to a regiment of a clarisonic brush or a good daily exfoliating scrub followed by toner and lotion your skin will glow.

            <li> If you want to look as though you had a face lift, order this product.&lt;br /&gt;A GREAT exfoliant and after using my face looks anew. Fine lines are&lt;br /&gt;no longer visible nor large pores.&lt;br /&gt;You will not be dissapointed. It is somewhat pricey,but well worth the&lt;br /&gt;money if you want compliments about your face and makeup. I am happy to&lt;br /&gt;have discovered Instant Peel &amp; now cannot be without it.</li>
            <li> This product really works by removing dead skin and afterwards my skin feels soft and smooth. I&#x27;m hooked on it!</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this product, read all the glowing reviews and so appreciated that these weren&#x27;t the new kind of Amazon gimmicky fake reviews where people get free products, I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never in my life used a product like this, I found it to be amazing!!  WOW.  Dead skin rolled off in moments.  I have a feeling this is a keeper for life!  THANK YOU all who shared authentic reviews!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years now...just once every few weeks to really exfoliate and brighten my complexion. Be sure to use a good moisturizer afterwards!</li>
            <li> I have only used it one once, and this was last night.  I was so pleased with the results.  I didnt know what to expect but after I finished with it .. my face felt so smooth.  Unbelievable.  I will continue to use it until I finish the whole box.  One package can be used for 2 applications or maybe 3.  So far I loved it. I was surprised with all the build up i had on my face.  I recommend it.. I used a brush fan to apply on my face verses my fingers cause of my long nails.  I dont want to waste any of it and with the brush i didnt .</li>
            <li> This peel is amazing. It gets off ALL the dead skin and makes your skin soft and smooth, and it temporarily reduces the appearance of pores. It doesn&#x27;t burn or sting at all, unlike an acid based peel. It doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin in the slightest, which is surprising for something this effective. The only downside is the price. I would use it a lot more often if it didn&#x27;t cost so much per use.</li>
            <li> This worked ok but it wasn&#x27;t anything special nor did it seem to help my skin much.  Overall I would not recommend it and it is expensive.  I think there are other options for cheaper that you can get.</li>
            <li> simply the most amazing peel I have ever used. Not abrasive, only acts where it finds dead skin cells. 1 sachet can last long if you only have a few dry areas on your skin. Best used in shower, after skin is damp and warm, a little at a time. all my friends who i have given this to try love it and want more...not cheap, but my skin glows</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think it works. The consistency makes you feel like you are really removing dead skin but i think you are just removing mostly product. I think temporarily, it takes the superficial loose dead cells off when you roll it but best to buy a derma roller or get personal microdermabrasion. Better yet, I recommend buying some natural dead sea salts, mix with aloe or some natural oil, like castor, vit e, grapeseed oil, gently message over your face and get ready to have the softest, smoothest, clearest skin.</li>
            <li> i have been using this for years. Best at home exfoliator.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  This was my second purchase, and it does exactly what I remembered it doing the first time.  Immediately sloughs (with gentle finger rubbing) the dead skin from my face, leaving it soft and smooth.  Plus, no pain for all gain.  Way better than any facial scrub product I have tried (which have been plenty!).  By the way, I&#x27;m 59 and look for gentle products if I&#x27;m putting them on my face.  This passes that test!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lovely product that I cannot recommend enough.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says.  I use a facial scrub every day and this exfoliant was still able to remove dead skin and sebum.  I have oily skin so I was pleased to see it working.  Just be careful with how vigorously you rub - my nose is very oily, and I was really going at it.  The creases of my nose around my nostrils ended up very raw and sore.  I have only used it once but still have several packages to use and can&#x27;t wait!</li>
            <li> Product is good I keep trying,  my face look clean and more clear age spot .  Instant peel use protection after use it.</li>
            <li> this product works great. I am truly shocked at how fantastic my skin feels after using it. I just love a product that provides instant gratification and follows through on their claims!  It&#x27;s pricey but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> *did not buy this from Amazon but used it from a different retailer, so this is simply a review of the product, not the seller*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought this exfoliation treatment was great, and I was pretty happy with the results. And then one day I decided to take a look at what the ingredients actually were, and I discovered that this is some terrible stuff to be putting on your skin!  Now before I go on, understand that I&#x27;m not one of those crazy granola-hippie people who scream &amp;#34;chemiKILLS&amp;#34; at everything; I drink diet soda every once in a while, eat processed foods like everyone else, and the like, but I&#x27;m going to be more careful with skincare products now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product contains parabens, which are used as a preservative, and they are being scrutinized for their link to cancer and endocrine disruption. They are a naturally occurring chemical but putting it on your skin often can cause it to build up in the fat cells underneath. Parabens can also mimic the hormone estrogen (because it&#x27;s metabolized into a phytoestrogen), which means those who have endocrine problems/imbalance/sensitivity/disorders need to really be careful how often they are using skin products with parabens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to be using this product any longer, even though It worked pretty well. It&#x27;s not like parabens are horrible, terrible things to avoid at all costs, I&#x27;m just saying to be careful and inform yourselves:)</li>
            <li> I give it five stars because it does exactly what it claims. I used it on my feet and I was amazed at how one little packet could take off so much dead skin. I will continue to give myself this very beneficial treatment.</li>
            <li> This product works quickly and and is mild enough to use once a week on sensitive skin if massaged gently. I love this product!</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this product after reading the great reviews. I am very excited about Instant peel . I get three uses from one packet so its very affordable. Every time I have used this product people have complemented  my appearance. I know its because of this peel. My skin glows and looks more youthful after a treatment. I wiil continue to use it and tell all my friends.</li>
            <li> OVERALL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;Speaking as a product junkie who prides herself on knowing a good product and being objective, I have to say this is an awesome product.  Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey but the benefits are well worth it. My skin is brighter, smoother and softer. Reduced acne and large pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.............Want or need to know more?  Keep reading :) ...........&lt;br /&gt;MY SKIN:&lt;br /&gt;I am in my early 40&#x27;s and have mocha brown skin which tends to get oily in certain areas of my face.  I also suffer from adult acne which can range from a pimple or 2 or 10! These of course, leave some acne scars (due to extraction) but once I have that under control with the use of creams, treatments and use of peels....life is ok!  This past year I began seeing large pores around my cheek area and noticed my face had become uneven in skin tone.  Yikes! *faint*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY(old) REGIMEN:&lt;br /&gt;I used at home  salicylic and glycolic (liquid kind) peels every other week.  Exfoliated in between peels and was diligent about keeping my skin and pores clean. However, using these peels I had to wait a week before seeing results and sometimes afraid I would burn my skin, leave on too long or just make my situation worse.  I had anxiety each time I used them, so I was extra careful and received good results.  One day when I went to re-order my peels  I stumbled across \\&quot;Instant Peel\\&quot;.  I figured, what the heck and here we are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW I USED THE PRODUCT:&lt;br /&gt;The product recommends that you use it in the shower, which I have found is the best method (yeah I tried other non-shower methods like steaming face, warm damp towel on face, etc). There are 6 packets and it is creamy in texture (not thick-creamy a bit liquidy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Once in the shower for about 1-2 minutes (your face has to be moist/damp NOT wet), squeeze out a little bit onto the tips  of your fingers.  With your fingers, smooth liquidy cream onto an area of your face; then, using back and forth motion apply light to moderate pressure (don&#x27;t massage it in using a circular motion-go back and forth). The dead skin will roll off onto your fingers. Just rinse your fingers pat dry with a cloth (hang one over the shower rod where you can get to it easily). I found that doing one side of my face (a cheek and jawline) at the same time works best. I use about 33-40% of the product for each side of my face (twice).  Doing smaller sections works well too but if you have a lot of dead skin then you will spend a little more time in the shower and possibly risk running out of hot water!  :)  Rinse off the product from fingers and splash a little on face to get rid of the residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Repeat process on other side and forehead. I liken this peeling process to having Elmers Glue (white stuff we used in school during art time) being semi-dry on your hands and you roll it off to be free of gluey hands.  You will know when all of the dead skin is off your face because you will not be able to roll anymore off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. BEWARE!  If you rub too hard and continue to rub vigorously past the \\&quot;no more rolling required\\&quot; point you will cause your face to be raw and red and even perhaps end up damaging your skin (yes, this is what happened to me! I was overly excited).  Just be sure to stop rubbing when the skin stops rolling off onto your fingers and you&#x27;ll be fine. The product isn&#x27;t supposed to affect new skin cells but, again, if you rub like a mad woman (i.e., yours truly) then there is a risk of hurting your skin.  So just don&#x27;t do it!  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIDE NOTE &amp; TIP:&lt;br /&gt;Unbeknownst to me, when I first used the product I had so much dead skin on my face it was unreal!  I was sure I would have very little dead skin cell removal because I exfoliated regularly.  Ha!  wrong.  I ended up using a pack and a half of product.  If you have product left over put the unused portion/packet in a ziplock bag and save for next time. Make sure to seal it. This is important because the product will dry outand go bye-bye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE RESULTS:&lt;br /&gt;Once done showering, I dried off, patted face dry and couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes when I looked in the mirror.  My skin was literally and noticeably brighter and more even toned. After one use?? The large pores on my cheeks had reduced in size, acne pimples drastically reduced in size, face looked younger (a solid 5 years-Girl Scouts&#x27; Honor!!), skin was radiant looking and felt baby soft smooth. Again, this was after the first use! I stood in literal awe. Amazing!!!!!  I have not used my at home liquid peels since then.  I continued using this product because this one does the trick and you see instant results.  My make-up goes on smoother and people comment on my skin and it&#x27;s texture. That&#x27;s a whole new thing for me.  When I first started using the product I used it 2 times the first week (3 packets) and then once every other week (1 packet). The entire box lasted about 2-1/2 months.  I am now on box #2.  The benefits are so great that this is now a part of my (new) face care regimen. So glad I invested in this product and stumbled across the page.  I love the way my skin looks and feels. I haven&#x27;t seen my skin this \\&quot;bright and glowy\\&quot; in years&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you are wondering......&lt;br /&gt;MY(new)REGIMEN:&lt;br /&gt;Use peel once every two weeks (only have to use 1 packet now).  After using the peel,  I use a quality oil control astringent, and a light moisturizer. In between peels, I use a glycolic exfoliating wash every 2-3 days and this along with the Instant Peels have helped keep the dreaded acne at bay. I will also note that I have not had as much dead skin removal since the first time I used it.  My skin continues to look youthful and the acne marks/spots are lighter. My skin tone has evened out quite a bit especially near the jawline.  I love this stuff!  It really is amazing!  Yayyy :)and go bye-bye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE RESULTS:&lt;br /&gt;Once done showering, I dried off, patted face dry and couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes when I looked in the mirror.

            <li> Worked liked they said it would.  Will definitely buy more!  Do wish it was a little bit cheaper but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I have used the one envelope so far. It does rub off stuff from your face and my face did have more sheen afterwards. I need to use it more to get results I&#x27;m happy with. Reading the reviews it looks like other people have had better results. But I certainly will keep using the product until it is gone.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how this stuff works, but it&#x27;s amazing. If you have dead skin it somehow clings to it so you can rub it off. I definitely don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a gimmick as if there&#x27;s no spot where there is dead skin, the product does not activate at all. This product is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that actively removes all the blackheads from my face. The only downside is the price. It&#x27;s pretty expensive for the small quantity you get, especially if you want to use it all over and not just your face.</li>
            <li> This is a great product---it does what it says it will, which is great.  It does smooth the skin; nice during the winter since that allows your moisturizer to work better.  However, the product contains parabens so I will not be buying it again.  Parabens are often used as a preservative in products, to keep the product &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; from mold, bacteria, yeast, etc.  Although many companies say there is no scientific evidence that parabens are carcinogenic or unsafe, there are reports that disagree, saying that parabens disrupt endocrine function, and that they can mimic estrogen by binding to estrogen receptor cells.  Parabens (e.g., methylparabens, propylparabens, etc.) can be found in the ingredient listings of many beauty and cosmetic products such as shampoo/conditioner, moisturizer, facial treatments, body wash, etc.---many products that contain water.  You can do your own research and look up parabens, estrogen, etc.</li>
            <li> I am  very happy with my purchase.  It&#x27;s a must purchase for those people who want to have a clean face.</li>
            <li> There is no skin was peeled, it was the material in the product that formed after rubbed againt skin, dont take my words for it check it out yourself look at it yourself in Microscope no proof it was daed skin all from product itself, what a ripped off I dont recommend this product to anyone at all. Dont waste your money for this one.</li>
            <li> love this peel, dont use it too often i think its little bit expensive , but works good, good for oily skin</li>
            <li> I like it, It&#x27;s just kind of tedious to rub the skin off and wipe the remaining cream off your face. Other than that, it&#x27;s really gentle and gets the job done if you do it correctly. I&#x27;m guessing I will see much more dramatic changes within the next couple months if I keep using it. Right now, my face just looks alright, not glowing completely yet.</li>
            <li> I was VERY skeptical at first, I was completely convinced that the product itself was simply drying and turning into those little crumbs as you rub it on your face and that it wasn&#x27;t actually exfoliating anything.  I tested a few times and confirmed that after you rubbed all the crumbs off of one area of skin, you couldn&#x27;t make the product \\&quot;crumb up\\&quot; again on that spot, but I wasn&#x27;t totally sure it was because it had taken all the dead skin off or if it was some other aspect.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway - I&#x27;ve since become enlightened to the dry skin crumbing/rolling truth - because of buying the Baiden Mitten, which (without any other product added except water) rubs all the dry skin off your entire body in the same way.  Since the Baiden Mitten works on my face (just have to rub more gently) I will not be continuing to use this InstantPeel product, but if I didn&#x27;t already have the Baiden Mitten now, the InstantPeel is a good product and it definitely DOES do what it claims, that really is your dead dry skin layer that is crumbing up and rolling off when you use it.  And getting it off really does make your skin so much better, a baby smooth layer is revealed underneath that has no more flaking, dull dry scaley etc. - I&#x27;m now an exfoliation believer.</li>
            <li> This is amazing!  You can actually feel &amp; see the dead skin coming off which is oddly satisfying.  Leaves your face so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Seriously. Believe the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I thought that since I used a Clarisonic on a fairly regular basis, this product probably just wouldn&#x27;t have much of a job to do.&lt;br /&gt;OH. MY. GOD.&lt;br /&gt;I used the product yesterday and so much old, dead, nasty skin came off of my nose and the surrounding areas that I stopped rubbing out of an irrational concern that there was something really wrong with me.&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks awesome.&lt;br /&gt;And, having regained my composure, I&#x27;m going in after the rest of that nastiness tonight.&lt;br /&gt;Wish me luck.</li>
            <li> I wish this came in a giant tub so I could use it all over my whole body!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the product when I get out of the shower, smooth it on my face, and watch the skin rub off.  I&#x27;ve noticed the wrinkles on my forehead lessen, the pores on my nose are clearer, and the parenthesis around my mouth are less noticeable.  Also, my skin feels super smooth, and my makeup looks better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right before I purchased this (on a recommendation from my friend), I purchased a bottle of glycolic acid.  I have to say, had I known how great this was, I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my money on the acid.  This is so much easier to use, and the results are immediate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is a little steep, but I don&#x27;t use an entire packet each time.  I&#x27;ve used it about once a week, and it took probably five weeks for me to go through a whole packet.  Used sparingly, it can go a long way.  I will definitely be repurchasing when I run out!</li>
            <li> yes it does work and if you think it does not you are either using it improperly or you don&#x27;t have much dead skin to slough off.&lt;br /&gt;I love it and you get the result instantly instead of skin peeling and flaking constantly and looking bad under your makeup.Evens gets rid of a lot of blackheads on my T-zone...Worth every penny in my opinion</li>
            <li> As an experienced and savvy, 56 year old product consumer, I accidently found this product online and read all of the positive reviews. I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now addicted to this product and have had to order several more boxes. I don&#x27;t want to be left without it!  My skin has never looked more radiant or glowing.  Numerous people I know and strangers, have literally stopped me on the street, and have commented on how beautiful and how flawless my skin looks. I tell them my secret: Instant Peel.  I can&#x27;t believe how much dead skin I had and I now know the areas where it collects.  This way when I do my regular washing, I use my wash cloth a little more on those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally use Retin-A, and clinically proven skin products, but during the winter they are  too harsh, since I am outdoors allot. Instant Peel gives me more immediate radiance and I follow the treatment with a good moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I have an important diner out or daytime outing, I always use Instant Peel to guarantee flawless radiance. My Boyfriend loves the way my skin glows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely Love this product!</li>
            <li> I have never used a product that has left me skin so smooth and soft!!  A little goes a LONG way so I get multiple treatments out of one packet.  I will definitely be ordering this one again.</li>
            <li> I couldnt stop touching my face the days following this.... and I exfoliate often, as I have dry skin - just usually go with glycolic acid cream, or a peel off mask...&lt;br /&gt;InstantPeel kicks up my regime - I use it about 2 x a month.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s awesome.  makes my skin glow.</li>
            <li> I bought this many years ago in a cosmetic supply chain store that was going out of business.  I&#x27;d never heard of it, but it was 50% off so I figured I&#x27;d try it.  Wow !  I was amazed.  Much to my dismay, I never could find it again&lt;br /&gt;sold anywhere -- &amp; I looked in many stores.  So I rationed it out -- using it for special occasions. I thought it wasn&#x27;t being sold anymore. Well, that way in the days before the internet.  Now it&#x27;s sold on Amazon &amp; a few other places.  I recently bought it elsewhere on-line for 20% off which brought the price down to $40. &amp; free shipping.  So it pays to search on-line.  But Amazon&#x27;s price is pretty good.  If you pay $44 for the 6 packets that comes to a little over $7. per use.  It seems expensive, but you get the results you&#x27;d get if you&lt;br /&gt;had a facial done -- &amp; you&#x27;d pay way more for a facial.  Actually, you get far better results than a professional facial.  This product is truly amazing -- my skin feels like a baby&#x27;s skin after I use it.  I wish they made it in tubs so I could treat my entire body !  It&#x27;s too bad it has paraben in it which is not good, but I only use it about once a month so I&#x27;ll take my chances on the paraben.  The original box I had did not list the ingredients, but now it does.  I&#x27;ll still use it -- I never found anything that works anywhere near as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already written one glowing review about this product and I stand by it. Not sure how it works, but it DOES! My skin truly benefits from regular use of this stuff and I hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> This peel is truly amazing.  The dead skin actually rubs off in little balls. After using it my skin is completely and totally smooth and shiny.  Yes it is expensive, but I get two to three uses out of each packet and only use it once every week or two.</li>
            <li> Great to use one week  after a laser peel to get rid of the dead skin and flaking.  Excellent highly recommend</li>
            <li> This is the exfoliant that I have personally ever used . Removed dead skin leaving your face feeling soft and nice .</li>
            <li> Gives even my sensitive skin a quick pick up in minutes.  There are only six envelopes, but I find each one is good for two or three applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Very expensive, not effective. If you thoroughly wash your face before applying this product, it doesn&#x27;t do anything at all.</li>
            <li> When I bought this I was hoping for a solution to my problem of a perpetually flakey face.  I have dead skin on my face every day that can be seen when I apply my makeup.  This stuff does take off some of the dead skin, but not all.  I&#x27;d need to use it every day.  And sometimes when I know there&#x27;s a lot of dead skin on my face that I can see, I&#x27;ll use this stuff and it won&#x27;t \\&quot;find\\&quot; the dead skin to peel off (i.e., it won&#x27;t roll the dead skin off in those little balls like it&#x27;s supposed to).  And when I get out of the shower and put on my makeup... there it is... the dead skin.  So I think, for the price and efficacy, this is not a winner.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased for my feet and ended up loving it for my face!  I am a product queen and this product really made my skin look radiant.</li>
            <li> Super.reviews r correct. Actually worked for me.remember to get a face steamer before u go ahead with the instant peel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it really peels skin. It has ingredients that coagulate on your skin and &amp;#34;pill up&amp;#34; when you rub them.  It&#x27;s not really the dead skin on your face coming off.  Try it on something non-skin related and see what I mean.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife after reading all the positive reviews. Once she started using it, she noticed her dead skin peeling off. She was really happy and didn&#x27;t do her monthly clean ups for almost 2 months. Then when she finally did it, her beautician said all her dead skin is still there and her pores are clogged! She argued with her beautician about this product and they wanted to test this. Guess what they found... The thing that actually peels of, is the stuff that you apply on the skin and not your dead skin. It kinds of give a fake feeling of cleansing your skin. So folks.. JUST RUN</li>
            <li> Does NOT work. Poor product.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this about 15 years ago,have been using it ever since. 1 packet treatment a month takes away all the dry patches,hard to eradicate patches with ease. shows you why it is important to exfoliate,you literally see and feel the dead skin peel away. addictive. once a month is perfect for my sensitive skin. try it</li>
            <li> Not sure if it really removed my dead skin, but not bad.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. I learned about it from an I Heart Daily post and bought it right away. It&#x27;s been nearly a week since I used it and my skin is still super soft and smooth. Amazing!</li>
            <li> The best peel ever without irritation. This product is amazing. My skin is, always glowing after I use it&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I love this peel, one packet last for at least 3 peels.  You don&#x27;t need much......love it.  Will save you $$$ on expensive peels because it works just as well with no down time.</li>
            <li> Wanted to like this product but unfortunately it did not seem to work half as well as numerous other products that I&#x27;ve used.  Noticed no difference.</li>
            <li> Terrible product.....what a big rip off!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product works.. I was very skeptical but when i tried it my skin looked GREAT!!! It was brighter and smoother after the very first application. I am very satisfied and will be buying this product continually. The layers of dead skin peeled off almost immediately. No more Chemical peels for me. Instant Peel is the way to go from now on. If I could give it 10 starrs I would! :-)</li>
            <li> It needed to be thicker but the cream was really liquidity and it really didn&#x27;t get off hardly any dead skin! Disappointed!!!!!</li>
            <li> I saw reviews on this product on BirchBox and came over here to order. This stuff is amazing. I used it in the shower and while it took some time to rub it in, after I got out my face has never felt so smooth! I will be reordering!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! It truly serves its purpose. Rubs away all stubborn dead skin leaving beautifully soft even toned skin. Of course it doesn&#x27;t happen over night but you could see results instantly. Skin feels great</li>
            <li> This is a great product really works. Using it for years. Thank you</li>
            <li> No joke, it really has this amazing sloughing ability - it&#x27;s magical!  And your skin just glows with freshness and is crazy-soft afterward.  I highly recommend this product for you skin loving product junkies out there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(tip:  you don&#x27;t need one full packet for your face to get a good result -- the first time I used one full packet and it was actually too much, I felt like I was wasting it.  The second time I just used some of it, and stored the rest in a zip lock.  I might get two more applications out of it.  It&#x27;s pretty darn expensive for 6 packets (but worth it I think); at least try to get the most bang for your buck!  I haven&#x27;t seen it sold it any other way (besides these packets) but it would be so cool if they packaged it differently (tube?  bottle?  you catch my drift);</li>
