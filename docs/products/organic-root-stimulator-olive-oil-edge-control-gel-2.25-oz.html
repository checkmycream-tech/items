    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Best edge control product on the market.</li>
            <li>This edge control gel works great.</li>
            <li>I promise I would have loved to fling it out the window going 85 MPH on 75 South towards the Georgia Dome.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product before and loved it.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Otherwise the product is 100% effective.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s organic olive oil, so its healthy and doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love it,  made my hair and edges look smooth.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold all day but nice gold when you first put it on</li>
            <li>I can use it to smooth out the frizz in her synthetic braids</li>
            <li>This will definitely get those edges under control at first and you&#x27;ll look great in the morning.  </li>
            <li>It really does smooth your edges and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend Organic Root Stimulator to any women that wants a good look the last all day.</li>
            <li>It holds edges down like magic and doesn&#x27;t leave a strong smell.</li>
            <li>It only took one use to look up reviews and find an alarming rate of consensus of people who have experienced breakage and weakening.  </li>
            <li>if you want good edges for the entire day, you would have to reapply it later in the day.</li>
            <li>On the Positive Side</li>
            <li>This really does work.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my hair really straight</li>
            <li>Good product to hold down the edges until your next retouch</li>
            <li>It smells good and holds the edges for about 20 minutes after that your edges come a loose and it runs down your face like water</li>
            <li>all day people always think my hair style is new because of the shine I get from this.</li>
            <li>if you have african american curly hair use it with an alcohol free gel holds all day long.</li>
            <li>This product does hold edges down and it smells good, but it leaves a thick white film on my daughter&#x27;s edges that has to be wiped with a wet cloth after about 2 hours.</li>
            <li>But, in a couple of hours (especially if you have NATURAL edges that are coarse) they will be right back looking like you are wearing little Afro puffs for edges!</li>

            <li> I have 3C/4A natural hair, and it laid these edges down.</li>
            <li> When I first saw the bottle size I was confused and upset.</li>

            <li> By the end of the day it&#x27;s white, cakey and hard.  </li>
            <li> Me and my daughter have 4a hair and it tackles flyways even on my daughters less than an inch hair.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have to wash it out after each use or it only gets worse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not great!  </li>
            <li> Decided to get again and unfortunately the seller sent me the wrong product.</li>
            <li> if you hate someone...snatch their edges with this.  </li>
            <li> I have tried to like this edge control but it horrible</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This really does work.  I have 3C/4A natural hair, and it laid these edges down. All day. It&#x27;s the truth!</li>
            <li> I have tried to like this edge control but it horrible and I would not recommend this. Its clumpy and doesnt do anything or my edges but make them shiny. Save your money</li>
            <li> It leaves white residue.</li>
            <li> This stuff will irritate your edges, weaken your hair, and does not stand a chance in humidity.  This is satan in a jar.  My head was so irritated and it broke out. It only took one use to look up reviews and find an alarming rate of consensus of people who have experienced breakage and weakening.  I promise I would have loved to fling it out the window going 85 MPH on 75 South towards the Georgia Dome.  This is a revenge gift...if you hate someone...snatch their edges with this.  If you care about your relationship with your hair or other people, you will leave this alone.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold all day but nice gold when you first put it on</li>
            <li> It smells good and holds the edges for about 20 minutes after that your edges come a loose and it runs down your face like water it&#x27;s so embarrassing never again</li>
            <li> This will definitely get those edges under control at first and you&#x27;ll look great in the morning.  By the end of the day it&#x27;s white, cakey and hard.  You&#x27;ll have to wash it out after each use or it only gets worse.</li>
            <li> This product does hold edges down and it smells good, but it leaves a thick white film on my daughter&#x27;s edges that has to be wiped with a wet cloth after about 2 hours. At the end of a school day her edges look like they have white lint on it.  On the Positive Side *I can use it to smooth out the frizz in her synthetic braids and it does not leave a film on the (synthetic hair).*  *It does NOT cause my child&#x27;s skin to break out in rashes the way &amp;#34;Lets Jam&amp;#34; does&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love it,  made my hair and edges look smooth. Highly recommend Organic Root Stimulator to any women that wants a good look the last all day.</li>
            <li> I use the Edge Control for my sides every time when I do my hair. It keeps it hold all day people always think my hair style is new because of the shine I get from this. Plus it&#x27;s organic olive oil, so its healthy and doesn&#x27;t shed. I buy every once in awhile when needed. Otherwise the product is 100% effective.</li>
            <li> It works, but only for like 30 minutes. if you want good edges for the entire day, you would have to reapply it later in the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not great!  Will hold for a while.  But, in a couple of hours (especially if you have NATURAL edges that are coarse) they will be right back looking like you are wearing little Afro puffs for edges!</li>
            <li> This edge control gel works great. It really does smooth your edges and it lasts all day. The only negative would be product build up that I experience the following day.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s white like glue when placed on edges.</li>
            <li> It leaves a white looking residue that I don&#x27;t to see.</li>
            <li> Good product to hold down the edges until your next retouch</li>
