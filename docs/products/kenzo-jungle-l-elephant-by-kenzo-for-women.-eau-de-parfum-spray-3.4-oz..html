            <li>Her own special fragrance.</li>
            <li>I felt so fortunate to be able to find it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>laden with a feast of hot cardamon pudding, piping hot liquorice tea, freshly cut perfectly ripe juicy mangoes...</li>
            <li>It makes a statement of its own- rather exotic and somewhat intense .</li>
            <li>musky strong scent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s for a strong, energetic, vibrant, confident woman who is not afraid to be sexy, attractive, wear bright lipstick and laugh with open mouth and showing all her teeth!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a Christmas Holiday following you around and making you feel happy without gaining the calories.</li>
            <li>Very very very distinct and unique scent, stays on all day,</li>
            <li>This one is a classic - floral, spicy , warm and powerful !</li>
            <li>and I recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t care for extremely sweet perfumes.</li>
            <li>Excellent I have been purchasing this product for at least 10 years</li>
            <li>profile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty fluent with what&#x27;s available out there, Kenzo Jungle is one of the most unique, wild,  mysterious, hypnotizing and unforgettable perfumes that I have dealt with during the period of about 20 years.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a head turner also - very pretty .</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it!!</li>
            <li>Deep, rich, unique, exotic, spicy, creamy, with just a touch of mango tartness.  </li>
            <li>It came in a nice big bottle.</li>
            <li>It smells like table decorated in fragrant cloves, and freshly picked ylang ylang flowers...</li>
            <li>This fragrance is very long-lasting with significant sillage.</li>
            <li>It really made her birthday special.</li>
            <li>Although I personally detect a mild cardamom essence, I get a more sandalwood/clove smell on my skin.</li>
            <li>This is a very different, strong, spicy perfume!  </li>
            <li>Super fast delivery.</li>
            <li>The perfum I got was an original one, new in box, 3.4 oz.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much !</li>
            <li>At first, my boyfriend didn&#x27;t care for it, but he now likes it a lot.</li>
            <li>Its been more then ten years that a Friend give the first bottle of kenzo jungle</li>
            <li>I figure that such a great perfume is always due to be dis-continued</li>
            <li>I am glad I found it , and will wear a long time .</li>
            <li>Jungle L&#x27;Elephant has strong cinnamon-cardamon notes, similar to Christmas potpourri.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot for amazon.</li>
            <li>The real deal.  </li>
            <li>Almost gourmand, but a bit too much oud to be truly foodie...</li>
            <li>a stick of gently burning nag champa incense gently wafting through the windows...</li>
            <li>I feel almost high after I spray it on me.&lt;br /&gt;STRONG</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t find it where I live.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible, I just don&#x27;t want to go around smelling like a Christmas wreath past December.</li>
            <li>Spicy, soft and well put together and others think so too!</li>
            <li>Goodness it doesn&#x27;t hardly get any better than this perfume.</li>
            <li>This scent is unexpected.</li>
            <li>and my wife nearly cried.</li>
            <li>A fair price for a product that is difficult to find anywhere on the shelf.  </li>
            <li>right exactly as i expected</li>
            <li>Definitely not for the new year.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely strong though and a little goes a long way.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s great!! Thank you so much !</li>
            <li> It is really nice, not too strong or sweet just perfect!  I use another perfume by Kenzo: Flower.  Which is my all time favorite!</li>
            <li> My favorite parfum - arrived on time all was good / customer happy !!</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume through the amazon website and was surprised and disappointed to receive a fake product. Thankfully amazon took charge of the situation and I received a refund. I will never order or buy perfume online again.</li>
            <li> This scent is unexpected. I guess I didn&#x27;t read the notes well enough. It&#x27;s not terrible, I just don&#x27;t want to go around smelling like a Christmas wreath past December. I was hoping for a fresh but complex scent- this is not fresh. It smells like a wreath or gingerbread house. Definitely not for the new year.</li>
            <li> Knew the scent from others wearing it and it lives up to expectations.</li>
            <li> I order this every year for my Mom for her birthday and Christmas. She absolutely loves it!! And so do I!</li>
            <li> Ok.  I have had better perfumes.  I am picky!  I thought I was buying something else.  Beckie J.</li>
            <li> One my Fav&#x27;s.  Every time I wear It women want to know what I have on.  I have to write it down.  Then I tell them where I bought it.  Hopefully they&#x27;ll be enough for me next time I try to buy it on here again!  I&#x27;ve loved Jungle L Elephant since it came out!  I&#x27;m so happy I can find it on Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> Wonderful mix of cloves, cardamon and vanilla with hints of floral/amber in the background.  One of my favorite perfumes ever.&lt;br /&gt;I am the proud owner of 31/2 large 100ml bottles.  I figure that such a great perfume is always due to be dis-continued and I don&#x27;t want to be with out this perfume.</li>
            <li> I love it, it is my favorite. Even though some times you feel the alcohol, it last all day. It is perfect for my skin.  The product came as it was described. I would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Awesome perfume! Spicy, sweet, sexy! Must have!</li>
            <li> I purchased this scent blindly after scouring the internet for cardamom-based scents. Although I personally detect a mild cardamom essence, I get a more sandalwood/clove smell on my skin. I definitely agree with the reviewers who say this reminds them of Christmas, as the spices evoke a gourmet flavor. At first, my boyfriend didn&#x27;t care for it, but he now likes it a lot. It&#x27;s definitely strong though and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Its been more then ten years that a Friend give the first bottle of kenzo jungle and i fall in love with it</li>
            <li> I love this parfum, it lasts the better part of a day, and I would buy it again when I finish this bottle.</li>
            <li> Jungle L&#x27;Elephant has strong cinnamon-cardamon notes, similar to Christmas potpourri. This fragrance is very long-lasting with significant sillage. If you like Guerlain&#x27;s Samsara, then this fragrance will be appealing.</li>
            <li> Very very very distinct and unique scent, stays on all day, musky strong scent, i use it mostly as night perfume.</li>
            <li> One of the favorite perfums for my wife,she is using it since years.  Amazon .com is my favorite web.  The perfum I got was an original one, new in box, 3.4 oz.  Shipping was fast as usual.  I got the best price in the market.  Thanks a lot for amazon.</li>

            <li> You are not going to get this item for your mom! It&#x27;s for a strong, energetic, vibrant, confident woman who is not afraid to be sexy, attractive, wear bright lipstick and laugh with open mouth and showing all her teeth! It&#x27;s not safe, it&#x27;s not quiet, it&#x27;s not low profile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty fluent with what&#x27;s available out there, Kenzo Jungle is one of the most unique, wild,  mysterious, hypnotizing and unforgettable perfumes that I have dealt with during the period of about 20 years.</li>

            <li> Great perfume with an exotic scent. I always receive compliments about it. The price was great and I recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t care for extremely sweet perfumes.</li>
            <li> it smells awful it made me sick at the stomach, never want to try that again and advice to others be cautions</li>
            <li> I bought it for my mom.... SHE LOVED IT!!!! ... She already told me that next time she needs a perfume, she will ask me...he he he</li>
            <li> Great product for a gift. Great price and great service too. My friend was happy for the gift and like very much the perfum. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a very different, strong, spicy perfume!  I tend to love it but it is definitely not made for everyone.</li>
            <li> Amazing scent! My mom loves it.</li>
            <li> The real deal.  A fair price for a product that is difficult to find anywhere on the shelf.  Thank you for having it!</li>
            <li> I have been buying Kenzo Jungle Elephant for my wife each year for the past eight years. We had heard it was to be discontinued and my wife nearly cried. I felt so fortunate to be able to find it here on Amazon. It really made her birthday special.</li>
            <li> Goodness it doesn&#x27;t hardly get any better than this perfume. It&#x27;s like a Christmas Holiday following you around and making you feel happy without gaining the calories. Spicy, soft and well put together and others think so too!</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. Her own special fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, I have been using it since it came out.  The scent stays on all day and I am constantly told, &amp;#34;You smell good!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Excellent I have been purchasing this product for at least 10 years</li>
            <li> Most amazing fragrance ever. Deep, rich, unique, exotic, spicy, creamy, with just a touch of mango tartness.  Almost gourmand, but a bit too much oud to be truly foodie... which is perfect and wonderful.  It smells like table decorated in fragrant cloves, and freshly picked ylang ylang flowers... laden with a feast of hot cardamon pudding, piping hot liquorice tea, freshly cut perfectly ripe juicy mangoes... a stick of gently burning nag champa incense gently wafting through the windows... intermingling with the scent of the blooming heliotrope just outside.  This fragrance is an EXPERIENCE, and its truly not for everyone.  But me?  I feel almost high after I spray it on me.&lt;br /&gt;STRONG fragrance, but it also has a mother-earth-like love and softness to it.  Infinitely comforting and somewhat primal. A precious and dear thing of beauty to this reviewer.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume!</li>
            <li> perfume to remember a women in love, and the moments that we spend with her,  and the places, perfect give</li>
            <li> I love exploring fragrances and have researched this one and found it interesting in reviews I read . This one is a classic - floral, spicy , warm and powerful ! I love the fact that it stay with me ALL day and that it is a fragrance that attracts attention , but is not one everyone else is wearing around me. It makes a statement of its own- rather exotic and somewhat intense . I am glad I found it , and will wear a long time . The bottle is a head turner also - very pretty .</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfume!! The package came in time. Thank you!!</li>
