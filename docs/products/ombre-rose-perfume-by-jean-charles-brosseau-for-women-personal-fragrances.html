            <li>I&#x27;ve used Ombre Rose since I received it as a gift in the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>This Ombre Rose By Jean Charles Brosseau for women Eau De Cologne Spray</li>
            <li>Use to wear Ombre Rose about 40 years ago.  </li>
            <li>I love Ombre Rose and wish it was easier to find.</li>
            <li>After 25 years, Ombre Rose is still one of my favorite fragrances...</li>
            <li>It is light and pleasant and does not set off my allergies like most scents do.</li>
            <li>Very refreshing, light scent.</li>
            <li>I know that are allergic to most perfumes.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price can&#x27;t be better.</li>
            <li>Still love that scent after all these years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments whenever I wear this and will always have some on hand.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for Ombre Rose recently to try it again since I really liked it.  </li>
            <li>Ombre Rose is the only cologne or perfume I wear and have for over 20 years.  </li>
            <li>I am familiar with the real deal, used in the morning, it lasts until evening.</li>
            <li>Just the same after many years of using it.  </li>
            <li>This is the classic Brosseau fragrance, delicate but unforgettable.</li>
            <li>She loves the smell of this and it lasts pretty much the whole day.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Still has the nice smell I remember from years ago, but the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Other scents are just to strong for today&#x27;s sensitivity requirements in the workplace.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite perfumes, as I dislike heavy scented aromas.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cologne that I purchased recently might not be the same scent as the original gift I received.</li>
            <li>The scent does not seem to annoy others who are sensitive to perfume and cologne which is a plus.  </li>
            <li>The Ombre Rose I received as a&lt;br /&gt;gift for Mother&#x27;s Day last year came in a flat round bottle.  </li>
            <li>clean, fresh, subtle, but very long lasting.  </li>

            <li> NOT AS FRAGRANT, WAS DIFFERENT AND DID NOT STAYED AS LONG AS IT USED</li>
            <li> It has become impossible to find Ombre Rose in stores, and so I hope I can continue to find it online.  </li>
            <li> 3.3 Oz is not the scent I expected.  </li>
            <li> This is one of those \\&quot;a la fragrance\\&quot; that are sold on the streets by some shady characters and made in someone&#x27;s basement.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> NOT THE SAME AS IN THE 80&#x27;S.</li>
            <li> I do not like the smell of this cologne.  Nothing like I was expecting.</li>
            <li> The scent does not seem to annoy others who are sensitive to perfume and cologne which is a plus.  Ombre Rose is the only cologne or perfume I wear and have for over 20 years.  Other scents are just to strong for today&#x27;s sensitivity requirements in the workplace.  Well packaged for save and unbroken delivery.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Just the same after many years of using it.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Ombre Rose since I received it as a gift in the 80&#x27;s. It is light and pleasant and does not set off my allergies like most scents do. It doesn&#x27;t bother anyone else I know that are allergic to most perfumes. I get a lot of compliments. Amazon&#x27;s price can&#x27;t be better. It is a wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li> It has become impossible to find Ombre Rose in stores, and so I hope I can continue to find it online.  This is the classic Brosseau fragrance, delicate but unforgettable.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t last as long as perfume but the fragrance is the same. I love Ombre Rose and wish it was easier to find.</li>
            <li> this was and still is a hit with the wife and a happy wife is always welcoming during a lifetime of marriage.... THANKS</li>
            <li> 100% waiste of money. I do not recommend this seller. This is one of those \\&quot;a la fragrance\\&quot; that are sold on the streets by some shady characters and made in someone&#x27;s basement.  Aroma stays for about 5 minutes and you can take a bath in it, the result will be the same. I am familiar with the real deal, used in the morning, it lasts until evening.</li>
            <li> Still has the nice smell I remember from years ago, but the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Order this item for my mother-in-law...a perfume she always loved but could never find in a store...I found it and gave it to her for mother&#x27;s day...she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Still love that scent after all these years.</li>
            <li> This Ombre Rose By Jean Charles Brosseau for women Eau De Cologne Spray 3.3 Oz is not the scent I expected.  I&#x27;ve used Ombre Rose for nearly 10 years and was disappointed in the product I purchased recently.  The Ombre Rose I received as a&lt;br /&gt;gift for Mother&#x27;s Day last year came in a flat round bottle.  This cologne that I purchased recently might not be the same scent as the original gift I received.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is seductive yet romantic. It smells wonderful and makes one feel special when wearing it.</li>
            <li> This perfume is all my wife wears. She loves the smell of this and it lasts pretty much the whole day.</li>
            <li> NOT AS FRAGRANT, WAS DIFFERENT AND DID NOT STAYED AS LONG AS IT USED TO.&lt;br /&gt;WILL PROBABLY WON&#x27;T ORDER AGAIN.</li>
            <li> given as a gift, they loved it</li>
            <li> Use to wear Ombre Rose about 40 years ago.  Had surgery and the cologne no longer worked for me.  I have been searching for Ombre Rose recently to try it again since I really liked it.  Never thought to look on Amazon until someone suggested I do.  The scent is just as I remember it and I can wear it successfully  and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne in the world! Very pleased! :)</li>
            <li> After 25 years, Ombre Rose is still one of my favorite fragrances...clean, fresh, subtle, but very long lasting.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Very refreshing, light scent. One of my favorite perfumes, as I dislike heavy scented aromas.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments whenever I wear this and will always have some on hand.</li>
