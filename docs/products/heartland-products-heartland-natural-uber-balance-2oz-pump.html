    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The best balancing cream ever.</li>
            <li>And to find it at a great price is every better!</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>A friend who is a nurse recommended it, and I&#x27;m glad she did!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Will continue to use with hopes of more good results.</li>
            <li>much more effective than most progestogels on the market</li>
            <li>Great product and recommended by my Dr. - Been using one month and has already helped reduce night time hot flashes.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have given it to many friends of mine and they love it.</li>
            <li>Love that I can get it here</li>
            <li>I love the cream.  </li>
            <li>It has helped the hot flashes and hope it show good report when having my bone density test.</li>
            <li>While it didn&#x27;t take away my hot flashes altogether, it&#x27;s sure reduced the intensity and frequency.</li>
            <li>This cream saved me from embarrassing hot flashes and helped me to sleep better at night.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is absolutely golden.</li>
            <li>I normally get it from my chiropractor&#x27;s office, but they charge me over $30 for it!!!  </li>
            <li>I feel the price is very reasonable</li>
            <li>Now I just use it on a maintenance basis, and haven&#x27;t had a hot flash in years.</li>
            <li>I have tried many pills and creams, and Uber Balance is the only thing that relieved my hot flashes and night sweats.  </li>
            <li>considering I would pay triple the amount because it helped me SO much!  </li>
            <li>I have used this product to combat hot flashes…and</li>
            <li>It is all natural, so I feel comfortable not  putting any chemicals into my body.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>To be completely honest, I used the cream in a jar, not the pump, but despite the packaging difference, the product is the same, and I can definitely recommend this.  </li>
            <li>A highly rated, natural progesterone cream.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to the hormone and have as of yet not quite learned how to control the dosage.  </li>
            <li>I am way past menopause and still love this product.</li>
            <li>I tried so many other products and this one finally worked.  </li>
            <li>Recommended by my Natural, preventative doctor.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a few years and believe that it does make a difference in balancing my hormones at a time in my life that I either am now or will soon be experiencing full blown menopause.</li>
