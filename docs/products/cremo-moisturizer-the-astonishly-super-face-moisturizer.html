    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I figured, \\&quot;Perfect.</li>
            <li>this said SPF Cremo were thicker, that would be awesome for the winter months as well.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best lotions I have ever bought for the price.</li>
            <li>best shaving cream around!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but....</li>
            <li>This is a truly excellent face moisturizer which I use as an after shave balm.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes for a wonderful aftershave balm.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is awesome !</li>
            <li>The shave cream is the best I have used in 35 years.  </li>
            <li>This works great</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t use makeup I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s also great because it absorbs well, without a shine.</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>If it had SPF it would be great.</li>
            <li>Seems to be a great \\&quot;guy\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li>A great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy when you put it on but does a GREAT job moisturizing my face, and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I read all of the great reviews about it</li>
            <li>The face wash is great too.</li>
            <li>Non greasy, lasts forever, great good stuff</li>
            <li>I have been using it along with the Cremo Wash Superior Face Cleanser and my skin tone has also noticeably evened out.  </li>
            <li>Was looking for a good moisturizer that didn&#x27;t break the bank</li>
            <li>light, non clogging,not greasy and noticed improvements in skin, being a man that sweats a ton from training, paints cars for a living, my skin gets beat up and this has helped greatly.</li>
            <li>and he really liked it.</li>
            <li>Began using this company&#x27;s shave cream and liked it a lot, so I thought I would give the moisturizer a try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used at this price.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly light compared to many others I&#x27;ve tried and good amount for the price.</li>
            <li>For a pretty inexpensive product this is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was a good find for the price, and though I&#x27;m not \\&quot;astonished\\&quot; by any miraculous transformation of my face, it fits my needs that it is lightweight moisturizer that gets quickly absorbed, and doesn&#x27;t make my face greasy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better to use a heavier moisturizer at night and put this medium one on in a.m before you put on makeup.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d love to see an SPF product with matte finish offered by Cremo.</li>
            <li>and so glad I tried this.</li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like magic.  </li>
            <li>I like this product better.</li>
            <li>My favorite for the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a great light texture and you can feel it really sinking into your skin without feeling like your wearing anything.</li>
            <li>Love the orange scent of that and how easy it makes shaving.</li>
            <li>Especially great after a shower, or after shaving, when my face feels taut and dry.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and does not leave a sticky or greasy residue, unlike many of its competitors.</li>
            <li>say it&#x27;s fine, others don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to smooth on w/o being greasy and no perfumy smell to irritate the skin.  </li>
            <li>as a result, it had a dank, somewhat moldy smell that was far from pleasant on my face or hands.</li>
            <li>I risked the change with this stuff since I ran out of Anthony Logistics Oil Free Moisturizer while I was on vacation.</li>
            <li>I would like to see them somehow add sunblock to this product which would make it even more useful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice that it doesn&#x27;t really have a fragrance.</li>
            <li>It also came with promotion and I could get it for free if I fill the online forms.  </li>
            <li>Good for the sensitive in our family.</li>
            <li>Most importantly , this company really cares about their customers.  </li>
            <li>This is far better than Keils or anything I&#x27;ve tried even more than this price.</li>
            <li>I bought this lotion from whole foods that&#x27;s supposedly organic, light, and ultra-moisturizing, but I&#x27;d wake up with greasy face, and my pores were more visible than before I went to sleep, so I quickly put that away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, now I&#x27;m in Florida and the summer&#x27;s approaching, so I don&#x27;t think any cream is a good idea.</li>
            <li>Cremo moisturizer goes on and soaks into the skin quickly, preventing oily buildup on the skin&#x27;s surface which traps dirt and leads to blackheads.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is nice and light and it seems to last all day.</li>
            <li>I really love all cremo products and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>First rate!</li>
            <li>I have use this fine product for over a year, I am outside most of the time and it keeps my face from over aging....</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great moisturizer without all the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>This lotion, when applied--to me, anyway--smells pretty close to that.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this stuff (despite the typos on the bottle&#x27;s label--there&#x27;s really zero excuse for this, guys: \\&quot;This also make it uniquely light....</li>
            <li>The one thing that could make it better would only be if it had a sunscreen built in.</li>
            <li>Product is small, neat, and matches my Cremo Face Wash. I am very happy with the purchase initially and believe it will continue to be helpful for my face.</li>
            <li>Maybe it will work better for different skin types, but I wont be using this one again.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more of this stuff.</li>
            <li>After the first application, I was absolutely astonished!  </li>
            <li>Very light weight a bit thin but as good as the high end stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and a bit creamy--feels nice--and maybe it would better for me in the dead of winter</li>
            <li>I purchased this moisturizer because of the name and positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I was okay, a good moisturizer, only need a small amount!</li>
            <li>...what really does it for me is the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li>When I put some in my palm, rub it gently, and apply it, it has this odor...</li>
            <li>Cremo reads this and wants a copy editor, I do it for a living), but the odor of it is not bearable for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sorry, Cremo boys, I really tried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I do have oily skin and my face shines with or without using Cremo brand, I noticed that using a Matte SPF Moisturizer, specifically Murads, really helps and compliments this</li>
            <li>As important as SPF is on your face, so is not looking shiny mid morning for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like this moisturizer as much as I thought I would.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very unimpressed with this product.</li>
            <li>it is marketing hype and if you think jack black is going to make you look better</li>
            <li>I really do think my skin looked better in just a few days.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to every man.</li>
            <li>As a guy who was sunburned many times as a kid I definitely need a product like this, but have steadfastly avoided them in the past because most were heavy, oily, and pore-clogging.</li>
            <li>Naturally, when I saw the moisturizer in the shop and then read lots of positive--and just a few negative--reviews, I grabbed a bottle, pretty sure I&#x27;d found my new moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is light weighted and moisturize my skin , I usually spend money on luxury brand creams and I can tell you this is just as good if not better.  </li>
            <li>my face feels smooth and protected from the elements with no after stinging feeling like other moisturizers.</li>
            <li>so I should get a new moisturizer for evening use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very natural feeling.</li>
            <li>All in all this was a great product, my only dislike is the amount they give your is relatively small compared to other moisturizers.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t wake up feeling the soft skin that I&#x27;m used to with the night creams.</li>
            <li>The reason I don&#x27;t like it is because it actually leaves my face feeling really oily after I put it on.</li>
            <li>Not a big fan of most moisturizers as they seem to be heavy and oily.</li>
            <li>Very economical as a small dollop of lotion is all you need to moisturize.</li>
            <li>We really will not know how much we like it for a few months.</li>
            <li>sometimes I will need to put this on first and then a thin layer of vanicream lite moisturizer on top of it to keep my face from getting dry mid day.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m a guy in my early 20&#x27;s and was looking for a no hassle uncomplicated facial regimen.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, it absorbs quickly and is not oily or greasy.</li>
            <li>In all fairness I have VERY dry, sensitive skin</li>
    </ol>

            <li> So I&#x27;m a guy in my early 20&#x27;s and was looking for a no hassle uncomplicated facial regimen.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, it absorbs quickly and is not oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> In all fairness I have VERY dry, sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The moisture soaks right into your skin almost instantly, and does not leave behind any oily or other film.  </li>
            <li> If you have really dry skin in spots like me</li>
            <li> When the weather is really dry</li>
            <li> Then after a couple of minutes my skin gets really dry from it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and one bottle will last months.  </li>
            <li> Current Cremo leaves my face a bit tight for about 30 minutes after application during the winter months in Maryland, thus the 4 star versus 5 rating.</li>
            <li> I would order again, and also try other products,</li>
            <li> My skin is instantly moisturized with absolutely no residue left behind and no scent.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> One thing I have found that makes a less greasy SPF Moisturizer is Zinc Oxide.</li>
            <li> All Zinc Oxide based SPF products have provided less shine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I discovered this moisturizer randomly at a Duane Reade in New York City.  </li>
            <li> I tend to get a little redness on my face.</li>
            <li> I wish they had some with a little UV protection.</li>
            <li> I notice my face brighter, cleaner and have little to no break outs now.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is not oily or slimy or heavy.</li>
            <li> I once had a bathroom with poor air circulation, and my washcloth wouldn&#x27;t always dry 100%;</li>
            <li> One of the very few moisturizers that doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out.  </li>

            <li> This is a must have item if you want to combat crows feet, wrinkles and keep your skin looking 5 years younger. Cremo moisturizer goes on and soaks into the skin quickly, preventing oily buildup on the skin&#x27;s surface which traps dirt and leads to blackheads. All in all this was a great product, my only dislike is the amount they give your is relatively small compared to other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I was okay, a good moisturizer, only need a small amount!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my boyfriend for Holiday and he really liked it. We really will not know how much we like it for a few months.</li>
            <li> I ran out of night cream, and had been using my day lotion in the evenings, and just felt like the SPF might be clogging up my pores or something so I should get a new moisturizer for evening use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, now I&#x27;m in Florida and the summer&#x27;s approaching, so I don&#x27;t think any cream is a good idea. I bought this lotion from whole foods that&#x27;s supposedly organic, light, and ultra-moisturizing, but I&#x27;d wake up with greasy face, and my pores were more visible than before I went to sleep, so I quickly put that away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a good find for the price, and though I&#x27;m not \\&quot;astonished\\&quot; by any miraculous transformation of my face, it fits my needs that it is lightweight moisturizer that gets quickly absorbed, and doesn&#x27;t make my face greasy. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s THAT moisturizing though, I don&#x27;t wake up feeling the soft skin that I&#x27;m used to with the night creams.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the Cremo Cream shave formula. Love the orange scent of that and how easy it makes shaving. Naturally, when I saw the moisturizer in the shop and then read lots of positive--and just a few negative--reviews, I grabbed a bottle, pretty sure I&#x27;d found my new moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for three days. So far, my face (normal skin) is oilier than usual. It&#x27;s light and a bit creamy--feels nice--and maybe it would better for me in the dead of winter (it&#x27;s autumn now--50s/60s F outside), but for now, it&#x27;s bringing the oil to the surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But...what really does it for me is the smell of this stuff. I figured, \\&quot;Perfect. A moisturizer without a scent to clash with my after shave or colognes.\\&quot; From the bottle, there&#x27;s no scent. When I put some in my palm, rub it gently, and apply it, it has this odor... One person described it as \\&quot;dirty,\\&quot; and I racked my brain &#x27;til I got it: I once had a bathroom with poor air circulation, and my washcloth wouldn&#x27;t always dry 100%; as a result, it had a dank, somewhat moldy smell that was far from pleasant on my face or hands. This lotion, when applied--to me, anyway--smells pretty close to that. Fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some say it&#x27;s fine, others don&#x27;t like it. I&#x27;m returning the bottle I got to the store. I really wanted to love this stuff (despite the typos on the bottle&#x27;s label--there&#x27;s really zero excuse for this, guys: \\&quot;This also make it uniquely light....\\&quot;--if Cremo reads this and wants a copy editor, I do it for a living), but the odor of it is not bearable for me. I need to wash my hands after applying this, and I smell it on my face around my nose. They could&#x27;ve added the slightest hint of scent (maybe orange like their terrific shave cream) to make it bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, Cremo boys, I really tried.</li>
            <li> I tend to get a little redness on my face. This works great... level of  moisturizing effects 1/10 is a 6. If you have really dry skin in spots like me it&#x27;s better to use a heavier moisturizer at night and put this medium one on in a.m before you put on makeup. If you don&#x27;t use makeup I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s also great because it absorbs well, without a shine. Very natural feeling. I would order again, and also try other products, did order the face wash at the same time but for some reason they cancelled it, guess it became unavailable at some point and just sent the moisturizer....disappointed about that.</li>
            <li> I risked the change with this stuff since I ran out of Anthony Logistics Oil Free Moisturizer while I was on vacation. I found this in Bed Bath Beyond and have been using it since!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I do have oily skin and my face shines with or without using Cremo brand, I noticed that using a Matte SPF Moisturizer, specifically Murads, really helps and compliments this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d love to see an SPF product with matte finish offered by Cremo. Kyle replied on another post in regards to researching that option- One thing I have found that makes a less greasy SPF Moisturizer is Zinc Oxide. As important as SPF is on your face, so is not looking shiny mid morning for the rest of the day. All Zinc Oxide based SPF products have provided less shine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this said SPF Cremo were thicker, that would be awesome for the winter months as well. Current Cremo leaves my face a bit tight for about 30 minutes after application during the winter months in Maryland, thus the 4 star versus 5 rating.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best lotions I have ever bought for the price. Lives up to every expectation. The one thing that could make it better would only be if it had a sunscreen built in.</li>
            <li> I have use this fine product for over a year, I am outside most of the time and it keeps my face from over aging....LOL</li>
            <li> best shaving cream around!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now I have a beard so won&#x27;t be using anymore</li>
            <li> Product is small, neat, and matches my Cremo Face Wash. I am very happy with the purchase initially and believe it will continue to be helpful for my face.</li>
            <li> EXCELENT! light, non clogging,not greasy and noticed improvements in skin, being a man that sweats a ton from training, paints cars for a living, my skin gets beat up and this has helped greatly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about 1.5 years now.  It&#x27;s easy to smooth on w/o being greasy and no perfumy smell to irritate the skin.  Will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> One of the very few moisturizers that doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out.  Hydrating without being greasy.  When the weather is really dry sometimes I will need to put this on first and then a thin layer of vanicream lite moisturizer on top of it to keep my face from getting dry mid day.</li>
            <li> For a pretty inexpensive product this is great. If it had SPF it would be great. Very light weight a bit thin but as good as the high end stuff. Guys it is marketing hype and if you think jack black is going to make you look better go ahead and spend the 5x  trust me it wont</li>
            <li> This is a truly excellent face moisturizer which I use as an after shave balm. A little goes a long way and one bottle will last months.  I would like to see them somehow add sunblock to this product which would make it even more useful.</li>
            <li> I decided to try it because I like their shave cream. A little goes a long way, it absorbs quickly and is not oily or greasy. Nor does it seem to gunk up your face. As a guy who was sunburned many times as a kid I definitely need a product like this, but have steadfastly avoided them in the past because most were heavy, oily, and pore-clogging. This one gives the skin a subtle glow without making it shine. Seems to be a great \\&quot;guy\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li> A great product. It&#x27;s not greasy when you put it on but does a GREAT job moisturizing my face, and it lasts all day. Especially great after a shower, or after shaving, when my face feels taut and dry. Put Cremo moisturizer on and voila! my face feels smooth and protected from the elements with no after stinging feeling like other moisturizers. Very economical as a small dollop of lotion is all you need to moisturize.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly light compared to many others I&#x27;ve tried and good amount for the price. I wish they had some with a little UV protection.</li>
            <li> I use this product on an occasional basis after shaving or in the evening as a basic moisturizer. A small amount goes a long way. I have not noticed any residue buildup.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this moisturizer as much as I thought I would. I read all of the great reviews about it so I figured I would try it. The reason I don&#x27;t like it is because it actually leaves my face feeling really oily after I put it on. Then after a couple of minutes my skin gets really dry from it. Maybe it will work better for different skin types, but I wont be using this one again.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m a guy in my early 20&#x27;s and was looking for a no hassle uncomplicated facial regimen. Being out of college and looking for a job in this crazy economy I wanted something that was affordable. After using both the face wash and moisturizer I notice my face brighter, cleaner and have little to no break outs now. I really love all cremo products and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is nice and light and it seems to last all day. It&#x27;s also nice that it doesn&#x27;t really have a fragrance. I recommend trying it. It&#x27;s by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used at this price.</li>
            <li> Not a big fan of most moisturizers as they seem to be heavy and oily. Began using this company&#x27;s shave cream and liked it a lot, so I thought I would give the moisturizer a try. I like the fact that it is not oily or slimy or heavy.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes for a wonderful aftershave balm.  It goes on easily and does not leave a sticky or greasy residue, unlike many of its competitors. First rate!</li>
            <li> So I was shopping in my local pharmacy and  I saw this bottle of \\&quot;not so fancy looking \\&quot; bottle of cream sitting on the bottle level of the shelve.  It also came with promotion and I could get it for free if I fill the online forms.  I thought what the heck and bought a bottle of this.  This lotion is awesome ! It is light weighted and moisturize my skin , I usually spend money on luxury brand creams and I can tell you this is just as good if not better.  Most importantly , this company really cares about their customers.  My rebate cheque came with a hand written note from the founder Kyle Schroeder (who happens to be a hottie ) . I highly recommend this to every man.</li>
            <li> This stuff does the job that it&#x27;s advertised to do and does it well.  I have been using it along with the Cremo Wash Superior Face Cleanser and my skin tone has also noticeably evened out.  I will definitely be buying more of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a good moisturizer that didn&#x27;t break the bank and so glad I tried this. I really do think my skin looked better in just a few days. Now at 2 weeks, I&#x27;m stocking up and telling my friends. This is far better than Keils or anything I&#x27;ve tried even more than this price. It&#x27;s got a great light texture and you can feel it really sinking into your skin without feeling like your wearing anything. The face wash is great too. The packaging also fits the bills. Well done</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer.  The shave cream is the best I have used in 35 years.  Buy both of these products NOW!</li>
            <li> I purchased this moisturizer because of the name and positive reviews. In all fairness I have VERY dry, sensitive skin and it is winter but I&#x27;m very unimpressed with this product. It&#x27;s been almost a month since I bought it and I think I&#x27;m just taking it to work to use as a hand moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Good for the sensitive in our family. Non greasy, lasts forever, great good stuff</li>
            <li> I discovered this moisturizer randomly at a Duane Reade in New York City.  After the first application, I was absolutely astonished!  The moisture soaks right into your skin almost instantly, and does not leave behind any oily or other film.  It&#x27;s like magic.  My skin is instantly moisturized with absolutely no residue left behind and no scent. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great moisturizer without all the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have been using the much more expensive Kiehls Face lotion. I like this product better. It seems lighter and silkier. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or like its clogging my pores. Seems to help with dryness. No signs on if it helps remove or conceal wrinkles around the eyes yet. My favorite for the money.</li>
