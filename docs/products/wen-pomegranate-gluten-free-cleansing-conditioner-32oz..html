            <li>The stuff does work amazing though.</li>
            <li>and it feels nice and tingly after use.</li>
            <li>do use my own styling products, as I did not like the Wen mousse.  </li>
            <li>I was kind of hesitant to purchase Wen, but my daughter in law talked me into it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, makes your hair feel so good.</li>

            <li>Worth the price!!!  </li>
            <li>Wen product is great and consistent !</li>
            <li>Amazon offers the best choices for every item I am looking for.  </li>
            <li>but Pomegranate has been the best for my hair type so far.</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this product, I love all of Chaz Dean&#x27;s WEN hair products, my hair has never felt so soft and looked to great!  </li>
            <li>I was fairly hesistant using it, but my hair feels so clean and healthy.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very fortunate not to have turned gray).</li>

            <li>I love this cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I love and recomend this product to all my family and friends.</li>
            <li>This time, I decided to cut my length to collar bone length making the amount used better.</li>
            <li>She has tried several of the scents, but seems to like the pomegranate the best of the bunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>No need for conditioner, even with my color treated hair and my hair has never felt better.  </li>
            <li>It is an OK conditioner</li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>This cleanser cleans your hair, moisturize&#x27;s and leaves hair with a healthy shiny glow.</li>
            <li>Just wish that the purchase price was cheaper and could purchase it at a better price... as needed.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s the cleaner, conditioner and the leave-in.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I love wen.</li>
            <li>Have always been searching for that magical shampoo/conditioner combo that makes me look like a model when i blow it out.</li>
            <li>Pomegranate is my favorite sent</li>
            <li>I love Wen, and I&#x27;ve been using it for quite some time.  </li>
            <li>and because I love pomegranate.  </li>
            <li>LOVE it and use nothing else</li>
            <li>I do love Wen cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have used Wen for 3 or 4 years and I love it.  </li>
            <li>It takes a bit longer to wash my hair, but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>When I run out, I will be getting more.</li>
            <li>Love Wen.  </li>
            <li>and my hair has never felt better, softer, and easier to manage.</li>
            <li>I love the size of this one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(only typing more because review requires more words.)</li>
            <li>The  shampoo/conditioner is phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>After having great results with Wen, I was very intrigued.</li>
            <li>tonight EVERYTHING changed when I found the magic formula for my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m officially a Wen girl now. :)</li>
            <li>I love you. :-)</li>
            <li>so you have to wash you hair more often,</li>
            <li>I really love Wen.</li>
            <li>I still love it for wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>I contacted Wen today and asked if any Amazon sellers have authentic Wen products to sell.</li>
            <li>My hair, has never looked better, it just does.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My hair just looks healthier and feels better.  </li>
            <li>and I love how it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this product makes my hair look shiney without putting product in it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It does not leave that waxy residue on your hair shaft like most shampoos do.</li>
            <li>And I love not needing to use a separate conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair feels cleaner and feels softer, it looks shinier and fuller with more volume.</li>
            <li>so I need more than they recommend but one of these lasted me almost three months.</li>
            <li>I love Wen cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>My scalp feels better and color lasts longer.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and ave</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>: - )</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the way my scalp and hair feel after shampooing.  </li>
            <li>(the Dietitian in me is very excited about that!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great deal on Wen without having to pay more buying direct.</li>
            <li>recently ordered Wen from QVC (authorized seller) and the cleansing conditioner smelled AMAZING, and did a great job on my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is just as advertised, it is healthy, shiny and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>, felt like there was residue, hair tangled easily and had static.</li>
            <li>Even having oily hair it still comes out clean!</li>
            <li>The gluten free thing was appealing to me.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t my favorite kind because I don&#x27;t care for the smell but overall Wen is a good product.</li>
            <li>Again, try it and stay with it, I can really notice the changes now after extended use, all for the GOOD.</li>
            <li>Vendor incentives are sweet!</li>
            <li>that leaves me feeling that my hair is clean, and while I still use conditioner my hair is noticeably more manageable.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the extra money, as I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair as often, but still get the great results!</li>
            <li>Wen is an amazing product that works very well to keep hair healthy.</li>
            <li>My hair is strong.  </li>
            <li>the color was holding strong.</li>
            <li>I choose Pomegranate scent because it is not as strong as the others.</li>
            <li>I have tried other \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; of WEN cleansing conditioners but for some reason, this gluten free product works the best for me.</li>
            <li>i love the smell of pomegranate and this one is thicker than the sweet almond</li>
            <li>My hair looks so healthy, full and shiny, since I&#x27;ve been using Wen.</li>
            <li>It is hands down the best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair.  </li>
            <li>my hair is fine</li>
            <li>The smell is fine after it dries.  </li>
            <li>Works well for my type of hair, which is fine and has a tendency to frizz.  </li>
            <li>I particularly like the Pomegranate as it is mild and has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>Its been a huge improvement.</li>
            <li>Amazon was great about crediting me back for the purchase.</li>
            <li>thank you Chaz Dean for making one that is Gluten Free.  </li>
            <li>So happy I came back.</li>
            <li>fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li>Turns out the shampoo I was using wasn&#x27;t gluten free.</li>
            <li>Please, Wen, do some additional gluten free styling g products.  </li>
            <li>Wen Pomegranate (Gluten Free) Cleansing Conditioner 32oz.  </li>
            <li>Also it is Gluten Free.</li>
            <li>I decided to just rinse my hair in the shower, rather than wash again, and when it dried, it still looked and felt great!!</li>
            <li>It took more than a year of nothing but Wen, but is worth it.</li>
            <li>I used the Sweet Almond for over a year and decided to try the Pomegranate because I loved the Sweet Almond so much.  </li>
            <li>Not only has my hair never looked so good it has also never been so healthy.  </li>
            <li>Works great and has a different feel than the original formula.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair feel great at first but after about a month it just wasn&#x27;t as soft</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 1 month now and love my hair, for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li>,i used to be excited to wash my hair with WEN -the fig conditioner.</li>
            <li>but I think using the products consistently over a period of time I have been able to truly see the distinction.</li>
            <li>It takes some elbow grease, but its totally worth it!</li>
            <li>Not my first use of WEN, but one of my favorite &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this through the \\&quot;official\\&quot; website</li>
            <li>alone is worth the price of admission!  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many products due to my hair&#x27;s challenges, Wen is the best by far.</li>
            <li>Even though it doesn&#x27;t lather, you know it&#x27;s clean when you&#x27;re done...</li>
            <li>Thanks Chaz, GREAT products, and Thanks Amazon for bringing them to us a little more affordably!!</li>
            <li>To top it off, this particular one is Gluten Free</li>
            <li>What I realized after reviewing the ingredients again was that all of the Wen Cleansing Conditioners (including the special season conditioners) except the Sweet Almond contain Methosulfate.</li>
            <li>It was a very herbal-sweet smell, and I liked it very much.</li>
            <li>have bright red hair that I color.  </li>
            <li>I have tried sweet almond mint didn&#x27;t like it ,</li>
            <li>I have used the Sweet Almond Mint, Lavendar, Pomengrante, and Fig.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this smell, very suttle and</li>
            <li>so healthy and so much easier to manage.</li>
            <li>Never again will I do that to my hair, I will stick with my tried and true brand, and where I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair as often also.</li>
            <li>I tried the sweet almond and it was unremarkable and did nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li>I am a true Wen addict.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried the Sweet Almond and Cucumber.  </li>
            <li>I tried Wen a little over a year ago and loved it!</li>
            <li>(its pretty easy to see the difference between 2 cups and 4 cups)</li>
            <li>The latest was Free &amp; Clear with no fragrance/sulfates etc.</li>
            <li>It keeps it soft, healthy, frizz and split-end free.  </li>
            <li>Then my hair started growing and got super</li>
            <li>I LOVE Wen and was SO glad I could purchase these big sized bottles on Amazon.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had so many people if I had done anything to it as the color is more red and shiny!  </li>
            <li>I love my soft tangled-free hair!</li>
            <li>I noticed it with the very 1st wash!!</li>
            <li>My wife uses the Wen Pomegranate (Gluten Free) Cleansing  Conditioner and  she loves it, and it really does work as advertised.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great....makes my hair shiny soft and feel so healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this product, but frequently have issues with the pump device.</li>
            <li>But its obviously worth it, have been using wen for about 7 months now.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the cost&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth the investment.</li>
            <li>The fragrance was great and it left my hair really soft, so I wish I could have continued to use it.  </li>
            <li>The difference has to be that this product is able to clean my hair without stripping the natural oils from it, which apparently no conditioner was able to adequately replace.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure I will love the other scents just as well when I use them correctly.</li>
            <li>i go through it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>, Wen is best on very wet hair and use plenty of it, trying to economize on product ends up not doing a proper job.</li>
            <li>I noticed some difference right away</li>
            <li>Scent good, easy to use, I only need about 6 pumps for my entire head when I do the \\&quot;Wash\\&quot; and 2 pumps per day for restyle.</li>
            <li>Being able to order when I need it is a major plus in my book.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, very curly, dense hair, and it makes my hair so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I am also happy it is offered here as no matter how great the product I do NOT participate in clubs such as the Wen site has, I have had too many bad experiences with those Clubs.</li>
            <li>I used Mixed Chicks, and was happy to go with my natural curl, but my hair was coming out too much, and I had to use too much product to keep the style.  </li>
            <li>I like this product very much.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know why I stopped using it!</li>
            <li>Just pretty waves and curls.</li>
            <li>I do love Wen, but there are two reasons I only gave it 3 stars...</li>
            <li>Just used wen for the first time, and I&#x27;m hooked.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Wen!</li>
            <li>Except Wen clearly stated that none of the products were gluten free.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was humorous because one obviously doesn&#x27;t eat shampoo, but I figured, as someone with celiacs</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, The first thing I noticed was it&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li>We did initially purchase one from another store but have been pleased with the Wen sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li>and I actually feel like I&#x27;m doing something healthy for my hair</li>
            <li>so she cleary wondered how my hair was getting better all of a sudden.</li>
            <li>Thanks WEN!</li>
            <li>buy wen from the wenhaircare.com site - they claim only $50 for their kit, then hit you for 2 additional monthly payments of $35 to cover the &#x27;rest&#x27; of the kit cost AND set you up for auto-shipments, with even more monthly charges.</li>
            <li>When I first used this product, I cleansed once and rinsed</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently.</li>
            <li>Wen products are unique and are nothing like your commercial shampoos and conditioners that are full of all kinds of chemicals that can will ruin your hair.</li>
            <li>and I was shocked how great it dryed on its own</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to personal care products but this is amazing.  </li>
            <li>For those gals out there with &#x27;big&#x27; hair like my own - knock yourself out and use WEN as often as you like - it will make your hair less brittle, softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li>Anyway, bottom line, it doesn&#x27;t ever look overly dry or frizzy, I experience no breakage and my hair appears healthy and feels smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I now remember that when I was a child my mom shampooed my hair in cool water and rinsed until the water became clear which is pretty close to the instructions for using wen products.  </li>
            <li>this my absolute favorite  shampoo out of all of the different kinds of wen</li>
            <li>The tingle is a refreshing clean feeling on my scalp and long hair to my butt is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>My split ends long gone, no longer dry and fly away.</li>
            <li>Also, the bottle was filled to the brim with cleanser, so when I inserted the pump, the cleanser overflowed from the top of the bottle wasting at least one wash worth of cleanser.</li>
            <li>But, a friend of mine has used the other styling products, sprays, and liked them very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This keeps your hair strong and healthy without weighing down your natural curl or wave.</li>
            <li>the larger size is a sweet treat!</li>
            <li>The first few days I used Wen it was amazing,</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this product!!</li>
            <li>I have highlighted blonde hair that is fine, but I have a lot of strands.</li>
            <li>As a teen I had greasy hair that I needed to wash every morning - at that time of my life Wen would have been a huge mistake.  </li>
            <li>I had really wanted this to work for me</li>
            <li>These people should alternate use with another sulfate free shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This product REALLY can be used on all hair types and I&#x27;m proof of that now.</li>
            <li>I will just go straight to WEN for this from now on.</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>my scalp would be really oily and and flaky.</li>
            <li>My hair is also much shinier than before.</li>
            <li>My wife really likes this product.  </li>
            <li>and this makes it reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Using too much leave-in conditioner will make your hair feel like straw too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>It has so much shine</li>
            <li>Then when every 6 weeks turned to 8 and then to 10 she really doubted me.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot Wen...</li>
            <li>: friend of mine used the lavendar vanilla on her son&#x27;s VERY corse hair.  </li>
            <li>but, I found I did not need all that it offered, the whole package.  </li>
            <li>If you need the whole package of products, the website is for you, if not . . .</li>
            <li>The Wen cleanser I purchased from Amazon, didn&#x27;t have much of a scent at all.</li>
            <li>I do go through it fast though.</li>
            <li>i wish it wer cheaper and in stores i would buy it for my whole family</li>
            <li>For my most recent purchase, the device was completely inoperable.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>I mean bright.  </li>
            <li>First time using this new scent</li>
            <li>I have thin, long hair that doesn&#x27;t do much, but this one makes it look the best and gives me some body.</li>
            <li>My only issue with this pomegranite is that it smells just like the original mint scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited now to have the bigger sized 32 ounce bottle.</li>
            <li>Now, being back to WEN, after the first cleansing, my scalp is calm, no itch, no crustiness, no flakes.</li>
            <li>This particular scent i felt wasnt AS hydrating as like the almond mint, but who knows maybe i just didnt use as much product trying to conserve.  </li>
            <li>Length hair and the directed amount isn&#x27;t enough to make my hair feel clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Soon Wen had my hair growing, super thick, healthy and manageable.</li>
            <li>I have very long, fine hair, but I have a LOT of it.</li>
            <li>My hair is SO soft, frizz-free, tangle-free, and so straight!</li>
            <li>I will have to go back to the Sweet Almond.</li>
            <li>If the price went down, I would continue to buy more.</li>
            <li>By the time my hair has dried, it is not dry (like other shampoos leave it) and most importantly its smooth.</li>
            <li>People are more inclined to share a bad story about a product or service than they are when they have had a good experience with a product or service.</li>
            <li>I love the slight tingle I feel (from the menthol?)</li>
            <li>I used Wen for the first time this past weekend, and I am SO pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Love my hair since using Wen, I went back to salon shampoo at one point, a big mistake!</li>
            <li>I am african american and my hair has always been manageable when healthy.  </li>
            <li>My hair is a decent amount of highlighted curls sticking out here and there and making me look like a merino sheep if unstyled.</li>
            <li>Okay, this stuff is a little pricy.  </li>
            <li>buy it here, it&#x27;s less money, same outstanding product!  </li>
            <li>Upon first use i despised the smell and my hair didn&#x27;t feel clean like it did with the fig.&lt;br /&gt;Its been about a month and a half</li>
            <li>Wen products may not be for all, but I have curly frizzy hair, and have used every EXPENSIVE product out there, the Wen product, especially the oil treament is far the BEST.</li>
            <li>I love having few suds.</li>
            <li>The only con, in my opinion, is the cost, but I would still say it is worth the investment.</li>
            <li>- i use drama clean herbal essences to get rid of the build up, about once every other week, but really any stripping product will work -</li>
            <li>Truely cleans your hair, I work out daily and can use this for clean hair without striping or drying out my dark curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Many times, people have trouble following directions and blame the product when it was their fault in the first place.</li>
            <li>hint to new users</li>
            <li>If you are new to Wen then by all means purchase their products.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny, and full of long curls.</li>
            <li>Hair is very soft and manageable with Wen.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a little pricey, but Amazon has a pretty good deal on it usually.  </li>
            <li>am dissapointed in WEN company for making so many different scents to make extra money and still claiming its the same product</li>
            <li>hair condition vastly improved from first use.</li>
            <li>no where near the cost of buying it from their site!</li>
            <li>Feel funny when washing, but the after the third wash.</li>
            <li>But it was when I got my first color rinse that flat out dumped me.</li>
            <li>I have used other Wen cleansing conditioners sweet almond mint.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t dry it straight much.  </li>
            <li>Instead of straightening my hair with a flat iron, I used my blow dryer to straighten on cool and low, with the plastic cap (don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s called) on the end.</li>
            <li>I am West Indian, we have naturally cotton like hair.</li>
            <li>My hair/scalp is not oily naturally so that was never a problem.  </li>
            <li>Wow I never realized the extent of the abuse my hair takes...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an African-American woman who is transitioning from relaxers to natural hair.  </li>
            <li>It completely cleans it.</li>
            <li>You really have to use it properly.</li>
            <li>I also noticed how much stronger my hair became after only a week.</li>
            <li>My scalp hasn&#x27;t itched a bit, and the rash on my skin is completely cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft, supple with body.  </li>
            <li>The fool proof standard is to look at how much hair comes out in the comb.  </li>
            <li>My hair hasn&#x27;t been this soft since I was 10.</li>
            <li>yes my hair was soft but it wasn&#x27;t manageable, and at times my hair felt like it was clinging to my head (not bouncy)</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair which is always prone to frizzy days.</li>
            <li>, I have natural wavy hair and when I used this product, there is no frizzing.  </li>
            <li>(My natural color - I never died my hair</li>
            <li>a few months later i tried the fig and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I went back to my normal salon shampoo (every other wash) and used Wen in place of the conditioner I normally use after those shampoos (I also used a 1/4 pumps worth as a leave in conditioner near the ends of my hair).  </li>
            <li>I even precondition by rinsing for a minute, applying the cleanser and leaving it in for a half hour, then rinse and rinse in cool water.  </li>
            <li>I choose Wen Pomegrante Cleasning Conditioner because I HAD very fine and thin hair.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend, who is not especially concerned with hair or the like, actually noticed the quality increase of my hair and mentioned it to me, much to my surprise.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad my hair is short, but it is thick.  </li>
            <li>I have very think, dry, curly hair that I dye (pesky treys!)</li>
            <li>However, people with fine or fairly naturally straight hair should not use WEN everyday for the same reason - it might weigh their hair down.  </li>
            <li>No matter if I am in south Florida with the humidity or damp Seattle, my hair is always the same: shiny, and soft curls.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to my old quality shampoo.</li>
            <li>I buy it on a regular basis and my hairdresser always comments on how soft my hair is.</li>
            <li>I used for three weeks, and decided to go back to my old shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>never have I used a product that controlled the frizziness as well nor left my hair as soft.</li>
            <li>my hair was soft, shiny and actually had some life to it!</li>
            <li>$56 may not be cheap, but it sure beats $120 and an autoshipping service that&#x27;s near impossible to get out of!</li>
            <li>If I blow dry my hair straight, it&#x27;s a little heavy on my fine hair</li>
            <li>My hair is brittle and my ends are VERY dry normally.</li>
            <li>An added bonus is that I only have one small bottle to carry when I travel, leaving more room in my 1-qt ziplock for other necessities.</li>
            <li>I can comb thought my hair so easy, my hair is long and thick.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions and let my hair dry NATURALLY</li>
            <li>I then looked at the back of the bottle and saw that you need to wash your hair a few times when its your first use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 52 and have thin, fine, and processed hair.</li>

            <li> It is an OK conditioner</li>
            <li> I love this product...</li>
            <li> This cleanser cleans your hair, moisturize&#x27;s and leaves hair with a healthy shiny glow.</li>
            <li> Just wish that the purchase price was cheaper and could purchase it at a better price... as needed.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s the cleaner, conditioner and the leave-in.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I love wen.</li>
            <li> Have always been searching for that magical shampoo/conditioner combo that makes me look like a model when i blow it out.</li>
            <li> Pomegranate is my favorite sent</li>
            <li> I love Wen, and I&#x27;ve been using it for quite some time.  </li>
            <li> and because I love pomegranate.  </li>
            <li> LOVE it and use nothing else</li>
            <li> I do love Wen cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have used Wen for 3 or 4 years and I love it.  </li>
            <li> It takes a bit longer to wash my hair, but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> When I run out, I will be getting more.</li>
            <li> Love Wen.  </li>
            <li> and my hair has never felt better, softer, and easier to manage.</li>
            <li> I love the size of this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(only typing more because review requires more words.)</li>
            <li> The  shampoo/conditioner is phenomenal.  </li>
            <li> After having great results with Wen, I was very intrigued.</li>
            <li> tonight EVERYTHING changed when I found the magic formula for my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m officially a Wen girl now. :)</li>
            <li> I love you. :-)</li>
            <li> so you have to wash you hair more often,</li>
            <li> I really love Wen.</li>
            <li> I still love it for wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I contacted Wen today and asked if any Amazon sellers have authentic Wen products to sell.</li>
            <li> My hair, has never looked better, it just does.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair just looks healthier and feels better.  </li>
            <li> and I love how it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this product makes my hair look shiney without putting product in it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It does not leave that waxy residue on your hair shaft like most shampoos do.</li>
            <li> And I love not needing to use a separate conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair feels cleaner and feels softer, it looks shinier and fuller with more volume.</li>
            <li> so I need more than they recommend but one of these lasted me almost three months.</li>
            <li> I love Wen cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> My scalp feels better and color lasts longer.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and ave</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> : - )</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the way my scalp and hair feel after shampooing.  </li>
            <li> (the Dietitian in me is very excited about that!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great deal on Wen without having to pay more buying direct.</li>
            <li> recently ordered Wen from QVC (authorized seller) and the cleansing conditioner smelled AMAZING, and did a great job on my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is just as advertised, it is healthy, shiny and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> , felt like there was residue, hair tangled easily and had static.</li>
            <li> Even having oily hair it still comes out clean!</li>
            <li> The gluten free thing was appealing to me.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t my favorite kind because I don&#x27;t care for the smell but overall Wen is a good product.</li>
            <li> Again, try it and stay with it, I can really notice the changes now after extended use, all for the GOOD.</li>
            <li> Vendor incentives are sweet!</li>
            <li> that leaves me feeling that my hair is clean, and while I still use conditioner my hair is noticeably more manageable.  </li>
            <li> It is worth the extra money, as I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair as often, but still get the great results!</li>
            <li> Wen is an amazing product that works very well to keep hair healthy.</li>
            <li> My hair is strong.  </li>
            <li> the color was holding strong.</li>
            <li> I choose Pomegranate scent because it is not as strong as the others.</li>
            <li> I have tried other \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; of WEN cleansing conditioners but for some reason, this gluten free product works the best for me.</li>
            <li> i love the smell of pomegranate and this one is thicker than the sweet almond</li>
            <li> My hair looks so healthy, full and shiny, since I&#x27;ve been using Wen.</li>
            <li> It is hands down the best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair.  </li>
            <li> my hair is fine</li>
            <li> The smell is fine after it dries.  </li>
            <li> Works well for my type of hair, which is fine and has a tendency to frizz.  </li>
            <li> I particularly like the Pomegranate as it is mild and has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> Its been a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> Amazon was great about crediting me back for the purchase.</li>
            <li> thank you Chaz Dean for making one that is Gluten Free.  </li>
            <li> So happy I came back.</li>
            <li> fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li> Turns out the shampoo I was using wasn&#x27;t gluten free.</li>
            <li> Please, Wen, do some additional gluten free styling g products.  </li>
            <li> Wen Pomegranate (Gluten Free) Cleansing Conditioner 32oz.  </li>
            <li> Also it is Gluten Free.</li>
            <li> I decided to just rinse my hair in the shower, rather than wash again, and when it dried, it still looked and felt great!!</li>
            <li> It took more than a year of nothing but Wen, but is worth it.</li>
            <li> I used the Sweet Almond for over a year and decided to try the Pomegranate because I loved the Sweet Almond so much.  </li>
            <li> Not only has my hair never looked so good it has also never been so healthy.  </li>
            <li> Works great and has a different feel than the original formula.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair feel great at first but after about a month it just wasn&#x27;t as soft</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 1 month now and love my hair, for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> ,i used to be excited to wash my hair with WEN -the fig conditioner.</li>
            <li> but I think using the products consistently over a period of time I have been able to truly see the distinction.</li>
            <li> It takes some elbow grease, but its totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Not my first use of WEN, but one of my favorite &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought this through the \\&quot;official\\&quot; website</li>
            <li> alone is worth the price of admission!  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many products due to my hair&#x27;s challenges, Wen is the best by far.</li>
            <li> Even though it doesn&#x27;t lather, you know it&#x27;s clean when you&#x27;re done...</li>
            <li> Thanks Chaz, GREAT products, and Thanks Amazon for bringing them to us a little more affordably!!</li>
            <li> To top it off, this particular one is Gluten Free</li>
            <li> What I realized after reviewing the ingredients again was that all of the Wen Cleansing Conditioners (including the special season conditioners) except the Sweet Almond contain Methosulfate.</li>
            <li> It was a very herbal-sweet smell, and I liked it very much.</li>
            <li> have bright red hair that I color.  </li>
            <li> I have tried sweet almond mint didn&#x27;t like it ,</li>
            <li> I have used the Sweet Almond Mint, Lavendar, Pomengrante, and Fig.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this smell, very suttle and</li>
            <li> so healthy and so much easier to manage.</li>
            <li> Never again will I do that to my hair, I will stick with my tried and true brand, and where I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair as often also.</li>
            <li> I tried the sweet almond and it was unremarkable and did nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> I am a true Wen addict.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried the Sweet Almond and Cucumber.  </li>
            <li> I tried Wen a little over a year ago and loved it!</li>
            <li> (its pretty easy to see the difference between 2 cups and 4 cups)</li>
            <li> The latest was Free &amp; Clear with no fragrance/sulfates etc.</li>
            <li> It keeps it soft, healthy, frizz and split-end free.  </li>
            <li> Then my hair started growing and got super</li>
            <li> I LOVE Wen and was SO glad I could purchase these big sized bottles on Amazon.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had so many people if I had done anything to it as the color is more red and shiny!  </li>
            <li> I love my soft tangled-free hair!</li>
            <li> I noticed it with the very 1st wash!!</li>
            <li> My wife uses the Wen Pomegranate (Gluten Free) Cleansing  Conditioner and  she loves it, and it really does work as advertised.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great....makes my hair shiny soft and feel so healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but frequently have issues with the pump device.</li>
            <li> But its obviously worth it, have been using wen for about 7 months now.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the cost&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worth the investment.</li>
            <li> The fragrance was great and it left my hair really soft, so I wish I could have continued to use it.  </li>
            <li> The difference has to be that this product is able to clean my hair without stripping the natural oils from it, which apparently no conditioner was able to adequately replace.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure I will love the other scents just as well when I use them correctly.</li>
            <li> i go through it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> , Wen is best on very wet hair and use plenty of it, trying to economize on product ends up not doing a proper job.</li>
            <li> I noticed some difference right away</li>
            <li> Scent good, easy to use, I only need about 6 pumps for my entire head when I do the \\&quot;Wash\\&quot; and 2 pumps per day for restyle.</li>
            <li> Being able to order when I need it is a major plus in my book.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, very curly, dense hair, and it makes my hair so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I am also happy it is offered here as no matter how great the product I do NOT participate in clubs such as the Wen site has, I have had too many bad experiences with those Clubs.</li>
            <li> I used Mixed Chicks, and was happy to go with my natural curl, but my hair was coming out too much, and I had to use too much product to keep the style.  </li>
            <li> I like this product very much.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know why I stopped using it!</li>
            <li> Just pretty waves and curls.</li>
            <li> I do love Wen, but there are two reasons I only gave it 3 stars...</li>
            <li> Just used wen for the first time, and I&#x27;m hooked.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Wen!</li>
            <li> Except Wen clearly stated that none of the products were gluten free.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was humorous because one obviously doesn&#x27;t eat shampoo, but I figured, as someone with celiacs</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, The first thing I noticed was it&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li> We did initially purchase one from another store but have been pleased with the Wen sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li> and I actually feel like I&#x27;m doing something healthy for my hair</li>
            <li> so she cleary wondered how my hair was getting better all of a sudden.</li>
            <li> Thanks WEN!</li>
            <li> buy wen from the wenhaircare.com site - they claim only $50 for their kit, then hit you for 2 additional monthly payments of $35 to cover the &#x27;rest&#x27; of the kit cost AND set you up for auto-shipments, with even more monthly charges.</li>
            <li> When I first used this product, I cleansed once and rinsed</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently.</li>
            <li> Wen products are unique and are nothing like your commercial shampoos and conditioners that are full of all kinds of chemicals that can will ruin your hair.</li>
            <li> and I was shocked how great it dryed on its own</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to personal care products but this is amazing.  </li>
            <li> For those gals out there with &#x27;big&#x27; hair like my own - knock yourself out and use WEN as often as you like - it will make your hair less brittle, softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li> Anyway, bottom line, it doesn&#x27;t ever look overly dry or frizzy, I experience no breakage and my hair appears healthy and feels smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I now remember that when I was a child my mom shampooed my hair in cool water and rinsed until the water became clear which is pretty close to the instructions for using wen products.  </li>
            <li> this my absolute favorite  shampoo out of all of the different kinds of wen</li>
            <li> The tingle is a refreshing clean feeling on my scalp and long hair to my butt is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> My split ends long gone, no longer dry and fly away.</li>
            <li> Also, the bottle was filled to the brim with cleanser, so when I inserted the pump, the cleanser overflowed from the top of the bottle wasting at least one wash worth of cleanser.</li>
            <li> But, a friend of mine has used the other styling products, sprays, and liked them very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This keeps your hair strong and healthy without weighing down your natural curl or wave.</li>
            <li> the larger size is a sweet treat!</li>
            <li> The first few days I used Wen it was amazing,</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this product!!</li>
            <li> I have highlighted blonde hair that is fine, but I have a lot of strands.</li>
            <li> As a teen I had greasy hair that I needed to wash every morning - at that time of my life Wen would have been a huge mistake.  </li>
            <li> I had really wanted this to work for me</li>
            <li> These people should alternate use with another sulfate free shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This product REALLY can be used on all hair types and I&#x27;m proof of that now.</li>
            <li> I will just go straight to WEN for this from now on.</li>
            <li> Fast service.</li>
            <li> my scalp would be really oily and and flaky.</li>
            <li> My hair is also much shinier than before.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this product.  </li>
            <li> and this makes it reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Using too much leave-in conditioner will make your hair feel like straw too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> It has so much shine</li>
            <li> Then when every 6 weeks turned to 8 and then to 10 she really doubted me.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot Wen...</li>
            <li> : friend of mine used the lavendar vanilla on her son&#x27;s VERY corse hair.  </li>
            <li> but, I found I did not need all that it offered, the whole package.  </li>
            <li> If you need the whole package of products, the website is for you, if not . . .</li>
            <li> The Wen cleanser I purchased from Amazon, didn&#x27;t have much of a scent at all.</li>
            <li> I do go through it fast though.</li>
            <li> i wish it wer cheaper and in stores i would buy it for my whole family</li>
            <li> For my most recent purchase, the device was completely inoperable.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> I mean bright.  </li>
            <li> First time using this new scent</li>
            <li> I have thin, long hair that doesn&#x27;t do much, but this one makes it look the best and gives me some body.</li>
            <li> My only issue with this pomegranite is that it smells just like the original mint scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited now to have the bigger sized 32 ounce bottle.</li>
            <li> Now, being back to WEN, after the first cleansing, my scalp is calm, no itch, no crustiness, no flakes.</li>
            <li> This particular scent i felt wasnt AS hydrating as like the almond mint, but who knows maybe i just didnt use as much product trying to conserve.  </li>
            <li> Length hair and the directed amount isn&#x27;t enough to make my hair feel clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Soon Wen had my hair growing, super thick, healthy and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have very long, fine hair, but I have a LOT of it.</li>
            <li> My hair is SO soft, frizz-free, tangle-free, and so straight!</li>
            <li> I will have to go back to the Sweet Almond.</li>
            <li> If the price went down, I would continue to buy more.</li>
            <li> By the time my hair has dried, it is not dry (like other shampoos leave it) and most importantly its smooth.</li>
            <li> People are more inclined to share a bad story about a product or service than they are when they have had a good experience with a product or service.</li>
            <li> I love the slight tingle I feel (from the menthol?)</li>
            <li> I used Wen for the first time this past weekend, and I am SO pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Love my hair since using Wen, I went back to salon shampoo at one point, a big mistake!</li>
            <li> I am african american and my hair has always been manageable when healthy.  </li>
            <li> My hair is a decent amount of highlighted curls sticking out here and there and making me look like a merino sheep if unstyled.</li>
            <li> Okay, this stuff is a little pricy.  </li>
            <li> buy it here, it&#x27;s less money, same outstanding product!  </li>
            <li> Upon first use i despised the smell and my hair didn&#x27;t feel clean like it did with the fig.&lt;br /&gt;Its been about a month and a half</li>
            <li> Wen products may not be for all, but I have curly frizzy hair, and have used every EXPENSIVE product out there, the Wen product, especially the oil treament is far the BEST.</li>
            <li> I love having few suds.</li>
            <li> The only con, in my opinion, is the cost, but I would still say it is worth the investment.</li>
            <li> - i use drama clean herbal essences to get rid of the build up, about once every other week, but really any stripping product will work -</li>
            <li> Truely cleans your hair, I work out daily and can use this for clean hair without striping or drying out my dark curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Many times, people have trouble following directions and blame the product when it was their fault in the first place.</li>
            <li> hint to new users</li>
            <li> If you are new to Wen then by all means purchase their products.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, shiny, and full of long curls.</li>
            <li> Hair is very soft and manageable with Wen.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little pricey, but Amazon has a pretty good deal on it usually.  </li>
            <li> am dissapointed in WEN company for making so many different scents to make extra money and still claiming its the same product</li>
            <li> hair condition vastly improved from first use.</li>
            <li> no where near the cost of buying it from their site!</li>
            <li> Feel funny when washing, but the after the third wash.</li>
            <li> But it was when I got my first color rinse that flat out dumped me.</li>
            <li> I have used other Wen cleansing conditioners sweet almond mint.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t dry it straight much.  </li>
            <li> Instead of straightening my hair with a flat iron, I used my blow dryer to straighten on cool and low, with the plastic cap (don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s called) on the end.</li>
            <li> I am West Indian, we have naturally cotton like hair.</li>
            <li> My hair/scalp is not oily naturally so that was never a problem.  </li>
            <li> Wow I never realized the extent of the abuse my hair takes...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African-American woman who is transitioning from relaxers to natural hair.  </li>
            <li> It completely cleans it.</li>
            <li> You really have to use it properly.</li>
            <li> I also noticed how much stronger my hair became after only a week.</li>
            <li> My scalp hasn&#x27;t itched a bit, and the rash on my skin is completely cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft, supple with body.  </li>
            <li> The fool proof standard is to look at how much hair comes out in the comb.  </li>
            <li> My hair hasn&#x27;t been this soft since I was 10.</li>
            <li> yes my hair was soft but it wasn&#x27;t manageable, and at times my hair felt like it was clinging to my head (not bouncy)</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair which is always prone to frizzy days.</li>
            <li> , I have natural wavy hair and when I used this product, there is no frizzing.  </li>
            <li> (My natural color - I never died my hair</li>
            <li> a few months later i tried the fig and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I went back to my normal salon shampoo (every other wash) and used Wen in place of the conditioner I normally use after those shampoos (I also used a 1/4 pumps worth as a leave in conditioner near the ends of my hair).  </li>
            <li> I even precondition by rinsing for a minute, applying the cleanser and leaving it in for a half hour, then rinse and rinse in cool water.  </li>
            <li> I choose Wen Pomegrante Cleasning Conditioner because I HAD very fine and thin hair.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend, who is not especially concerned with hair or the like, actually noticed the quality increase of my hair and mentioned it to me, much to my surprise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad my hair is short, but it is thick.  </li>
            <li> I have very think, dry, curly hair that I dye (pesky treys!)</li>
            <li> However, people with fine or fairly naturally straight hair should not use WEN everyday for the same reason - it might weigh their hair down.  </li>
            <li> No matter if I am in south Florida with the humidity or damp Seattle, my hair is always the same: shiny, and soft curls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to my old quality shampoo.</li>
            <li> I buy it on a regular basis and my hairdresser always comments on how soft my hair is.</li>
            <li> I used for three weeks, and decided to go back to my old shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> never have I used a product that controlled the frizziness as well nor left my hair as soft.</li>
            <li> my hair was soft, shiny and actually had some life to it!</li>
            <li> $56 may not be cheap, but it sure beats $120 and an autoshipping service that&#x27;s near impossible to get out of!</li>
            <li> If I blow dry my hair straight, it&#x27;s a little heavy on my fine hair</li>
            <li> My hair is brittle and my ends are VERY dry normally.</li>
            <li> An added bonus is that I only have one small bottle to carry when I travel, leaving more room in my 1-qt ziplock for other necessities.</li>
            <li> I can comb thought my hair so easy, my hair is long and thick.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and let my hair dry NATURALLY</li>
            <li> I then looked at the back of the bottle and saw that you need to wash your hair a few times when its your first use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 52 and have thin, fine, and processed hair.</li>
            <li> Now in my 30&#x27;s my hair is still thick and wavy but it is super dry.  </li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s normally a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 60 year old woman with dark auburn hair</li>
            <li> i also only wash my hair every couple of days as i have long, brittle, colored hair</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s thin on strand/thick on quantity - my hair also used to be ironing board straight and dull, but using wen has given it a ton of shine, increased the strand thickness, and even brought back curls that i haven&#x27;t seen since i was a child - true, the cost for one bottle here is quite pricy, and that&#x27;s coming from someone who buys alterna conditioning products - but buying it here is</li>
            <li> with other products I have found that if I didn&#x27;t wash my hair everyday, it would look very oily, especially at the roots.</li>
            <li> Because the product is so pricey, even one hair wash of cleanser wasted is an issue to budget conscious consumers such as myself.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to do the same damage as your other standard shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> there was a inconsistency in our hair while using the whole bottle, big disappointment since spending so much on this product.</li>
            <li> I was also getting a minor rash on my neck shoulders and arms.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time (I have hair that just hits the shoulder).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a LONG journey.</li>
            <li> (Long) hair</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;Leave it on as long as you can in the shower, like 5 minutes, longer if you like.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair (down to my bra/mid back) and it takes what seems like ALOT of product to cleanse my hair properly.</li>
            <li> However, I think this may be a little too conditioning for my fine, thin hair, and I&#x27;m not that fond of the scent either.  </li>
            <li> My stylist warned me that the black rinse wouldn&#x27;t last very long but 2 visits (and almost 4 months later)</li>
            <li> I have dyed blonde hair, long and kinda coarse with uneven wave.</li>
            <li> I alternate washing with Wen and using baking soda/vinegar the other days</li>
            <li> I use some Moroccan oil product and the Wen styling cream after every wash then blow dry and straighten or curl my hair.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> My hair was mostly dry</li>
            <li> since it was sulfa free figured that would help us maintain out coloring longer - big disappointment</li>
            <li> My hair is really dry, but not with this product.</li>
            <li> hair was a lot softer than normal (I use expensive salon products normally).</li>
            <li> By the end of the first week I noticed how oily my hair was looking around my scalp, which I can say I have never experienced before because my hair is always so dry.</li>
            <li> The only reason I keep buying this product is because it does make my hair look less dry after I style it with my InStyler.</li>
            <li> This lasted much longer than the little 16oz we usually get.  </li>
            <li> but it does not clean well at all and definitely does not help control the frizzy hair that pops up during NJ summers.</li>
            <li> It takes a little longer to use and settle as regular shampoo</li>
            <li> Other shampoos made her hair dry and cracked.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure.&lt;br /&gt;Previously, before using WEN, my scalp was dry and irritated, and then a day after washing (I wash every other day)</li>
            <li> Again, this is just a product and no after simply washing and drying your hair will not look like the STYLED BY PROFESSIONALS MODELS in the videos for Wen (hard to believe some actually expect that?)</li>
            <li> The bad news - if you like WEN, pomegranite is the ONLY formulation that is Gluten Free.  </li>
            <li> no really thanks</li>
            <li> This product is very expensive for slightly better than average results in my curly hair.</li>
            <li> I apply wen daily to my har (as directed) and usually let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> When wet, my hair comes half way down my back.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and tell people to at least stop using shampoo!</li>
            <li> The truth be told, I have allergies pretty bad, and I have a sensitive scalp!</li>
            <li> Even though Wen made a big difference in my hair, my ends still were a little dry and my hair was still a little tangly.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, straight hair and was afraid it would make it look limp and oily like some of the commenters complained about, not at all, it actually stays clean longer and is less oily than it was with regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I read a review that said this was mediocre,&amp; smelled funny.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical regarding these products</li>
            <li> My hair has been softer than it had been for several years; and no more dryness.  </li>
            <li> This product makes my hair smoother and softer than any other product out there.</li>
            <li> I end up alternated every other day with shampoo.</li>
            <li> used it over the past several years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m inidan wth long black hair, my hair is not thick or course, but its not super thin either.</li>
            <li> Also I noticed that I shed less hair in the shower with WEN compared to other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I wet it everyday in the shower, wrap it in a towel, and then put it through my hair.</li>
            <li> I never, Never, Never see my color in the shower washing down the drain.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My color lasts longer and my hair is less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a mess.</li>
            <li> A softer mess.</li>
            <li> I wish it cost a little less though.</li>
            <li> and I think a lot of people that do this will be unhappy because they probably have typical &#x27;caucasian&#x27; hair and it would be weighted down with too much of the WEN product.  </li>
            <li> I have very long, thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> The smell is funky..  Not a clean or even fruity smell.  </li>
            <li> When it dries, it comes a little longer than shoulder length.</li>
            <li> I expect to have to buy just a little over one bottle a year.  </li>
            <li> Turns out, using too little of the product will make your hair greasy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried Wen before a few years ago and wanted to try it again.  </li>
            <li> This product can be used everyday without drying your hair.</li>
            <li> I had ordered it from the site a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s the same amount of product, but I feel it&#x27;s false advertising.  </li>
            <li> I recommend using the Wen only every other or every few days because it is expensive</li>
            <li> It also takes less time than shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> To make it worse when I shipped it back they coded the return as shipped late???</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I had to send it back.  </li>
            <li> Not cheap either!</li>
            <li> I cut my hair short because it was so sad.  </li>
            <li> Since i started using my color lasts and no more split ends.</li>
            <li> I take steroids for my sense of smell, and I can say, there are very few products that I can stand using because of their sent, I can literally smell every molecule.</li>
            <li> My hair is course, very very thick, sometimes frizzy, alot of times unmanageable unless u spend about an hour and half on it.  </li>
            <li> After a week of sun, sand and salt water in Mexico my hair was bleached to a dull brown.</li>
            <li> and it is difficult to pick up and try to pour it when hands are wet</li>
            <li> so I dont even dare order it again, afraid I will just get the smaller bottle again....</li>
            <li> This product is made specifically for thick, curly or wavy hair.</li>
            <li> It does fell so thick when I use Wen.  </li>
            <li> The downfall is still the price, it is very expensive and having longer dry hair</li>
            <li> or you will have problems, these products have been Heaven sent for my hair which is very thick and unruly.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick about shoulder length, this size lasts me almost a year using it 2 or 3 times a week.  </li>
            <li> Not attractive.</li>
            <li> I have medium course, thick, wavy hair that I dye with henna/indigo so it can be difficult to manage.   </li>
            <li> If I could give this 10 stars I would, seriously!  </li>
            <li> Buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> It does smell weird in the bottle and while using it but by the time</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to Wen!</li>
            <li> I was shipped the wrong size as I had ordered 2 of the 32oz and was shipped the 16oz.</li>
            <li> My hair has been transformed from frizzy and frightening to sleek and manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair felt weird, it felt rubbery when I tried to run my fingers through it.</li>
            <li> The salon shampoo dried my hair out terribly, will use Wen from now on!</li>
            <li> that was causing me to itch like crazy</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because I did not get a pump with it</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because it wasn&#x27;t what I ordered</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed when I tried the Lavendar.</li>
            <li> FINALLLLLLLY found the secret to Wen hair!!!!</li>
            <li> I have terrible allergies to sulfates</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use anything else at this point! You&#x27;ve been warned! There&#x27;s no turning backâ€¦an amazing product!</li>
            <li> Works great and has a different feel than the original formula.  First time using this new scent and I think I will keep on buying it.</li>
            <li> I read a review that said this was mediocre,&amp; smelled funny. I must disagree. I take steroids for my sense of smell, and I can say, there are very few products that I can stand using because of their sent, I can literally smell every molecule. This is fruitiously yummy. I am West Indian, we have naturally cotton like hair. Straightening is temporary, like minutes, don&#x27;t color or use chemical anything on it, &amp; grows 3 inches per decade. I used Mixed Chicks, and was happy to go with my natural curl, but my hair was coming out too much, and I had to use too much product to keep the style.  So I gave this a try and OMGoodness. I have been using it for 1 month now and love my hair, for the first time in my life. Scent good, easy to use, I only need about 6 pumps for my entire head when I do the \\&quot;Wash\\&quot; and 2 pumps per day for restyle. Soft, beautiful hair, my hair has stopped falling out, my natural curls are perfect, and I am getting compliments! Buy it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great....makes my hair shiny soft and feel so healthy. Use it a couple times a week and what a difference it makes. Its like a treat for my hair...feels so much better after using wen !</li>
            <li> Leaves a waxy residue after several washes.  My hair started to feel like a candle.</li>
            <li> I tried Wen before a few years ago and wanted to try it again.  It made my hair feel great at first but after about a month it just wasn&#x27;t as soft and I went in for my monthly coloring and my color didn&#x27;t take on part of my hair.  My hairdresser said that had never happened before and shes been doing my hair for years.  She and another one of her clients both started using Wen about the same time and had had similar problems.  Both had color fading problems so after talking it couldn&#x27;t just be a coincidence.  I had really wanted this to work for me but unfortunately I had to send it back.  Amazon was great about crediting me back for the purchase.</li>
            <li> I have tried sweet almond mint didn&#x27;t like it ,a few months later i tried the fig and fell in love with it. 4 months later when i ran out i came back to buy a noter bottle and realized it was out of stock and ended up purchasing the pomegranate.Upon first use i despised the smell and my hair didn&#x27;t feel clean like it did with the fig.&lt;br /&gt;Its been about a month and a half and i feel the same way,i used to be excited to wash my hair with WEN -the fig conditioner.Now i despise washing my hair with this  crappy  scent and my hair is not clean!&lt;br /&gt;I am dissapointed in WEN company for making so many different scents to make extra money and still claiming its the same product</li>
            <li> My hair is course, very very thick, sometimes frizzy, alot of times unmanageable unless u spend about an hour and half on it.  I love this cleansing conditioner.  It is PERFECT for someone who has unruly hair like I do.  To top it off, this particular one is Gluten Free and I have a severe reaction to Gluten, so thank you Chaz Dean for making one that is Gluten Free.  The bad news - if you like WEN, pomegranite is the ONLY formulation that is Gluten Free.  I also do not leave in any to use as a styling balm and I think a lot of people that do this will be unhappy because they probably have typical &#x27;caucasian&#x27; hair and it would be weighted down with too much of the WEN product.  However, people with fine or fairly naturally straight hair should not use WEN everyday for the same reason - it might weigh their hair down.  These people should alternate use with another sulfate free shampoo.  For those gals out there with &#x27;big&#x27; hair like my own - knock yourself out and use WEN as often as you like - it will make your hair less brittle, softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but frequently have issues with the pump device. For my most recent purchase, the device was completely inoperable. Also, the bottle was filled to the brim with cleanser, so when I inserted the pump, the cleanser overflowed from the top of the bottle wasting at least one wash worth of cleanser. Because the product is so pricey, even one hair wash of cleanser wasted is an issue to budget conscious consumers such as myself.</li>
            <li> After a year of buying everything on the market, I tried WEN. I have been using it for 3 years,. I have used the Sweet Almond Mint, Lavendar, Pomengrante, and Fig. They all work the same. My hair never frizzes. I wash my hair about once a week. I wet it everyday in the shower, wrap it in a towel, and then put it through my hair. My hair is soft, shiny, and full of long curls. When wet, my hair comes half way down my back. When it dries, it comes a little longer than shoulder length. No matter if I am in south Florida with the humidity or damp Seattle, my hair is always the same: shiny, and soft curls.</li>
            <li> Wen Cleaning Conditioner is awesome. I&#x27;ve been using Wen for about 2-1/2 years. Tea Tree and Cucumber &amp; Aloe are my favorites (for fine/thin hair) I&#x27;m 52 and have thin, fine, and processed hair. My hair is in the healthiest and best condition it&#x27;s ever been in. I love and recomend this product to all my family and friends.</li>
            <li> I tried Wen a little over a year ago and loved it! I don&#x27;t really know why I stopped using it! Big mistake. I have long hair (down to my bra/mid back) and it takes what seems like ALOT of product to cleanse my hair properly. This time, I decided to cut my length to collar bone length making the amount used better. So happy I came back. The truth be told, I have allergies pretty bad, and I have a sensitive scalp! It sounds gross like I&#x27;m unclean but I&#x27;m not. I have tried dandruff shampoos, extra moisturizing, deep cleaning etc. Not cheap either! The latest was Free &amp; Clear with no fragrance/sulfates etc. I was still itchy and it seemed like I had a crusty flakey scalp. With WEN I don&#x27;t itch, no hives in my scalp/hair line/neck, no crusty scalp and no flakes. My hair/scalp is not oily naturally so that was never a problem.  Now, being back to WEN, after the first cleansing, my scalp is calm, no itch, no crustiness, no flakes. Just pretty waves and curls. Thank you WEN!</li>
            <li> My wife says that her hair feels great after using this shampoo.  Other shampoos made her hair dry and cracked.  This doesn&#x27;t seem to do the same damage as your other standard shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little pricey, but Amazon has a pretty good deal on it usually.  She has tried several of the scents, but seems to like the pomegranate the best of the bunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> I do love Wen, but there are two reasons I only gave it 3 stars... it is not affordable, and I do sometimes have to use regular shampoo or I feel some build up in my hair.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product. I have not used shampoo for about 3 months now and will never go back. No need for conditioner, even with my color treated hair and my hair has never felt better.  An added bonus is that I only have one small bottle to carry when I travel, leaving more room in my 1-qt ziplock for other necessities.</li>
            <li> Great product at an even greater value.  Amazon offers the best choices for every item I am looking for.  Ease of purchase and available products make Amazon the perfect place to shop.</li>
            <li> As a teen I had greasy hair that I needed to wash every morning - at that time of my life Wen would have been a huge mistake.  Now in my 30&#x27;s my hair is still thick and wavy but it is super dry.  I have my locks colored every 6 weeks or so.  I use Wen about 2-3 times a week and throw in a traditional sulfate shampoo and conditioner as needed (maybe 1-2 a month) My color lasts longer and my hair is less frizzy.  I use some Moroccan oil product and the Wen styling cream after every wash then blow dry and straighten or curl my hair.  Wow I never realized the extent of the abuse my hair takes... Anyway, bottom line, it doesn&#x27;t ever look overly dry or frizzy, I experience no breakage and my hair appears healthy and feels smooth and soft.  It does smell weird in the bottle and while using it but by the time it&#x27;s dry I no longer notice it.</li>
            <li> have gone through the largest bottle and ordered another one. fantastic stuff. use on hair with color and it helps retain the color weeks longer. don&#x27;t ever want to run out of this. hair condition vastly improved from first use. hint to new users, Wen is best on very wet hair and use plenty of it, trying to economize on product ends up not doing a proper job.</li>
            <li> The smell is funky..  Not a clean or even fruity smell.  For my hair... It is not like they show on TV.  It is an OK conditioner but it does not clean well at all and definitely does not help control the frizzy hair that pops up during NJ summers.</li>
            <li> I love this product...it makes your hair look and feel wonderful...i tell my friends to get this product because it is the best</li>
            <li> This cleanser cleans your hair, moisturize&#x27;s and leaves hair with a healthy shiny glow. And it smells amazing. I wish it cost a little less though.</li>
            <li> Just used wen for the first time, and I&#x27;m hooked.  It is all it is promised to be.  Thanks Wen!</li>
            <li> Great deal on Wen without having to pay more buying direct.</li>
            <li> I tried this three months ago and I will never go back to regular shampoo and conditioner.  My hair is just as advertised, it is healthy, shiny and easy to manage.  I no longer have to wash it every day which is a miracle since I&#x27;ve been doing that for over 40 years!</li>
            <li> I choose Wen Pomegrante Cleasning Conditioner because I HAD very fine and thin hair. Iam on my second bottle now and my hair  Is thicker and fuller. Very satisfied with the products performance...Just wish that the purchase price was cheaper and could purchase it at a better price... as needed.</li>
            <li> I used Wen for the first time this past weekend, and I am SO pleased with the product. I was fairly hesistant using it, but my hair feels so clean and healthy.  Even though it doesn&#x27;t lather, you know it&#x27;s clean when you&#x27;re done... It revitalized my hair in the dryest location, and I am now a fan.  I love that it&#x27;s the cleaner, conditioner and the leave-in. :)  This product REALLY can be used on all hair types and I&#x27;m proof of that now. I&#x27;m an African-American woman who is transitioning from relaxers to natural hair.  It gave my hair body and made it manageable... I am a Wen believer now!</li>
            <li> works great for my me! my hair is fine so this gives a lift and shine to my hair. i recommend this product</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick wavy hair and I was finding that no matter what conditioner I used with my shampoo my hair was unmanageable.  This stuff is great.  I love the slight tingle I feel (from the menthol?) that leaves me feeling that my hair is clean, and while I still use conditioner my hair is noticeably more manageable.  The difference has to be that this product is able to clean my hair without stripping the natural oils from it, which apparently no conditioner was able to adequately replace.</li>
            <li> I love wen. Have always been searching for that magical shampoo/conditioner combo that makes me look like a model when i blow it out. I have dyed blonde hair, long and kinda coarse with uneven wave. This particular scent i felt wasnt AS hydrating as like the almond mint, but who knows maybe i just didnt use as much product trying to conserve.  The downfall is still the price, it is very expensive and having longer dry hair i go through it pretty quickly. But its obviously worth it, have been using wen for about 7 months now.</li>
            <li> Tried the WEN shampoo and finishing cream but I&#x27;m not impressed. I didn&#x27;t like the way my hair felt, felt like there was residue, hair tangled easily and had static. I&#x27;m back to my old quality shampoo. Thank goodness I could return it via Amazon, they&#x27;re the BEST</li>
            <li> Except Wen clearly stated that none of the products were gluten free.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical regarding these products and yes you must follow the directions or you will have problems, these products have been Heaven sent for my hair which is very thick and unruly. I noticed some difference right away but I think using the products consistently over a period of time I have been able to truly see the distinction. Again, this is just a product and no after simply washing and drying your hair will not look like the STYLED BY PROFESSIONALS MODELS in the videos for Wen (hard to believe some actually expect that?) but I have dramatically improved texture, manageability, shine and appearance. I have tried so many products due to my hair&#x27;s challenges, Wen is the best by far. I experimented with some formulas and still keep several but Pomegranate has been the best for my hair type so far. I am also happy it is offered here as no matter how great the product I do NOT participate in clubs such as the Wen site has, I have had too many bad experiences with those Clubs. Again, try it and stay with it, I can really notice the changes now after extended use, all for the GOOD.</li>
            <li> This is the best one I&#x27;ve tried yet and I&#x27;ve tried all of them. I have thin, long hair that doesn&#x27;t do much, but this one makes it look the best and gives me some body. The cucumber is second place. Once you try this product, you&#x27;ll never go back to shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love my hair since using Wen, I went back to salon shampoo at one point, a big mistake! The salon shampoo dried my hair out terribly, will use Wen from now on!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Even having oily hair it still comes out clean! Smells and feels wonderful! I am addicted to Wen!</li>
            <li> I have very think, dry, curly hair that I dye (pesky treys!) and I&#x27;ve been using Wen for about 3 years now.  It is hands down the best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair.  It keeps it soft, healthy, frizz and split-end free.  Pomegranate is my favorite sent and it is the perfect amount of moisture for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love Wen, and I&#x27;ve been using it for quite some time.  I thought I&#x27;d give this version a try for some variety and because I love pomegranate.  However, I think this may be a little too conditioning for my fine, thin hair, and I&#x27;m not that fond of the scent either.  Still a good product, just not the best one for me.</li>
            <li> WE love Wen &amp; this was a great Super size for an awesome price. This lasted much longer than the little 16oz we usually get.  I would buy this again &amp; again.</li>
            <li> This is the last time I will review this products... I buy it on a regular basis and my hairdresser always comments on how soft my hair is. I don&#x27;t have to use conditioner on my hair anymore. LOVE it and use nothing else but this...</li>
            <li> I have used this brand for 6 months or so.  I don&#x27;t think I will go back to shampoo anytime soon.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because I did not get a pump with it and it is difficult to pick up and try to pour it when hands are wet</li>
            <li> I do love Wen cleansing conditioner.  I was shipped the wrong size as I had ordered 2 of the 32oz and was shipped the 16oz. (its pretty easy to see the difference between 2 cups and 4 cups) To make it worse when I shipped it back they coded the return as shipped late??? so I dont even dare order it again, afraid I will just get the smaller bottle again.... I will just go straight to WEN for this from now on.</li>
            <li> I have used Wen for 3 or 4 years and I love it.  I ordered the 32 oz size of Wen, but when it arrived it was two 16 oz bottles.  I was disappointed because it wasn&#x27;t what I ordered and I wasn&#x27;t informed that they were substituting.  Yes, it&#x27;s the same amount of product, but I feel it&#x27;s false advertising.  I like the bigger bottle because I always end up mixing water with it to get all the product out and I&#x27;d rather do it once than twice with 2 smaller bottles, that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> Fast service. Absolutely love this smell, very suttle and the larger size is a sweet treat! I will reorder again and again......</li>
            <li> This hair stuff is amazing.  It&#x27;s done wonders for my hair, now that I finally figured out how to use it.  It takes some elbow grease, but its totally worth it!</li>
            <li> It seemed to me that there were a lot of mixed reviews about this product. I gave it a shot anyway. The gluten free thing was appealing to me. At first I thought it was humorous because one obviously doesn&#x27;t eat shampoo, but I figured, as someone with celiacs, I might as well give it a shot. Maybe my skin reacts to gluten as well. I wasn&#x27;t sure.&lt;br /&gt;Previously, before using WEN, my scalp was dry and irritated, and then a day after washing (I wash every other day) my scalp would be really oily and and flaky. If I washed every day, my scalp would get even drier and flakier. Not attractive. I was also getting a minor rash on my neck shoulders and arms. Turns out the shampoo I was using wasn&#x27;t gluten free. Strangely enough, my skin was reacting similarly to how my stomach acts when I ingest wheat. I hadn&#x27;t made that connection until I switched over to the WEN product.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I had no problem with stinky hair. It completely cleans it. You really have to use it properly. Many times, people have trouble following directions and blame the product when it was their fault in the first place. Follow the directions. It&#x27;s easy.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, The first thing I noticed was it&#x27;s scent. It was a very herbal-sweet smell, and I liked it very much. It takes a bit longer to wash my hair, but it&#x27;s okay. I also noticed how much stronger my hair became after only a week. My hair is also much shinier than before. My boyfriend, who is not especially concerned with hair or the like, actually noticed the quality increase of my hair and mentioned it to me, much to my surprise. My scalp hasn&#x27;t itched a bit, and the rash on my skin is completely cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;A wonderful product. When I run out, I will be getting more.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this product.  We did initially purchase one from another store but have been pleased with the Wen sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been using this all year.  It lasts a long time (I have hair that just hits the shoulder).  I expect to have to buy just a little over one bottle a year.  My hair has been softer than it had been for several years; and no more dryness.  Its been a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> Love Wen.  Makes my hair soft, supple with body.  One stop shopping product.  Love that!</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen for about 5 weeks now and I adore what it does for my hair. I have medium course, thick, wavy hair that I dye with henna/indigo so it can be difficult to manage.   It has a rather medicinal smell but you get used to it and it feels nice and tingly after use. The smell is fine after it dries.  I alternate washing with Wen and using baking soda/vinegar the other days and my hair has never felt better, softer, and easier to manage. I recommend using the Wen only every other or every few days because it is expensive and this makes it reasonably priced. The only reason that I only give it 4 stars, is price.  I highly recommend it and tell people to at least stop using shampoo!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! My hair has been transformed from frizzy and frightening to sleek and manageable. I am a Wen girl.</li>
            <li> I have tried other \\&quot;flavors\\&quot; of WEN cleansing conditioners but for some reason, this gluten free product works the best for me. My hair is coarse and can be frizzy. This product makes my hair smoother and softer than any other product out there.</li>
            <li> Wen products may not be for all, but I have curly frizzy hair, and have used every EXPENSIVE product out there, the Wen product, especially the oil treament is far the BEST. This product can be used everyday without drying your hair.</li>
            <li> Wen is 4 the African American person 2! I have been teeling every1 of color who will listen! I love my soft tangled-free hair! Hallelujah! Wish they would have a big SALE</li>
            <li> Wonder scent and I love the size of this one. It is well worth the cost&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(only typing more because review requires more words.)</li>
            <li> WEN is amazing, been using it and nothnig else for 2 years. My split ends long gone, no longer dry and fly away. Worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I got Wen as a birthday gift 3 years ago, It was the best gift ever!  Will not EVER buy another shampoo!  This product is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> The  shampoo/conditioner is phenomenal.  I have experienced hair loss,  scalp itch and tangling.  I am african american and my hair has always been manageable when healthy.  I now remember that when I was a child my mom shampooed my hair in cool water and rinsed until the water became clear which is pretty close to the instructions for using wen products.  The one minute rinse before shampooing is great for my hair.  I even precondition by rinsing for a minute, applying the cleanser and leaving it in for a half hour, then rinse and rinse in cool water.  My hair seems thicker, scalp is cleared of sore spots, no longer itching and there is growth.I get shine and mangeability.  I can choose to straighten with iron or not.  I have grown out my perm and will not put chemicals on my hair again.  My hair is strong.  The fool proof standard is to look at how much hair comes out in the comb.  nothing.  Please, Wen, do some additional gluten free styling g products.  I love having few suds.</li>
            <li> Where do I even begin with my Wen experience? It&#x27;s been a LONG journey. I bought Wen about 3 or 4 years ago after being mesmerized by the infomercials. I was quite disappointed when I tried the Lavendar. I did not follow the instructions and my hair turned out like straw and my roots were SO greasy--stored the bottle away. Well, I received the Winter Vanilla Mint as a gift. I decided to try it again (following the instructions this time) and it was a completely different experience. Turns out, using too little of the product will make your hair greasy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was a lot softer than normal (I use expensive salon products normally). I have highlighted blonde hair that is fine, but I have a lot of strands. My hair is brittle and my ends are VERY dry normally. After having great results with Wen, I was very intrigued. I ended up ordering a pack of the 6 oz bottles and have tried various amounts of each. Even though Wen made a big difference in my hair, my ends still were a little dry and my hair was still a little tangly. WARNING: Using too much leave-in conditioner will make your hair feel like straw too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well tonight EVERYTHING changed when I found the magic formula for my hair. I used the pomegranate tonight and loved the smell. I followed the instructions and let my hair dry NATURALLY (that is the key). My hair was mostly dry and I was shocked how great it dryed on its own--it&#x27;s normally a frizzy mess. Instead of straightening my hair with a flat iron, I used my blow dryer to straighten on cool and low, with the plastic cap (don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s called) on the end. WOW!!! I FINALLLLLLLY found the secret to Wen hair!!!! My hair is SO soft, frizz-free, tangle-free, and so straight! It has so much shine and I actually feel like I&#x27;m doing something healthy for my hair (the Dietitian in me is very excited about that!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure I will love the other scents just as well when I use them correctly. Don&#x27;t give up on Wen if you are having trouble--just experiment. My hair hasn&#x27;t been this soft since I was 10. I&#x27;m officially a Wen girl now. :)</li>
            <li> I knew my stylist was suspicious when she kept saying how great my hair felt. I only saw her every 6 weeks for a chemical straightening so she cleary wondered how my hair was getting better all of a sudden. I told her it was Wen! Then my hair started growing and got super thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon Wen had my hair growing, super thick, healthy and manageable. Then when every 6 weeks turned to 8 and then to 10 she really doubted me. But it was when I got my first color rinse that flat out dumped me. After a week of sun, sand and salt water in Mexico my hair was bleached to a dull brown. My stylist warned me that the black rinse wouldn&#x27;t last very long but 2 visits (and almost 4 months later) the color was holding strong. Thanks WEN! At that point she was convinced I was cheating with another stylist and I was officially back listed. Thanks a lot Wen...no really thanks I love you. :-)</li>
            <li> I love the product but its just too expensive to continue using.  If the price went down, I would continue to buy more.</li>
            <li> I used the Sweet Almond for over a year and decided to try the Pomegranate because I loved the Sweet Almond so much.  After several weeks I began to have a reaction to it.  What I ordered also came with the 636.  What I realized after reviewing the ingredients again was that all of the Wen Cleansing Conditioners (including the special season conditioners) except the Sweet Almond contain Methosulfate. In addition so do the Wen Re-moist products. I have terrible allergies to sulfates and I believe that is the cause of the reaction.  The fragrance was great and it left my hair really soft, so I wish I could have continued to use it.  If you don&#x27;t have sensitivity to any of the ingredients it would be an excellent product. I will have to go back to the Sweet Almond.</li>
            <li> Over the years we have all seen the commercials.  I decided to try.  I like this product very much.  I used for three weeks, and decided to go back to my old shampoo and conditioner.  Mistake.  What a difference!&lt;br /&gt;1.  Hair is very soft and manageable with Wen.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Hair feels healthier with Wen.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Hair feels thicker with Wen.&lt;br /&gt;I do use my own styling products, as I did not like the Wen mousse.  The mousse did nothing.  But, a friend of mine has used the other styling products, sprays, and liked them very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Note: friend of mine used the lavendar vanilla on her son&#x27;s VERY corse hair.  His hair has never been softer, she states.</li>
            <li> Not my first use of WEN, but one of my favorite &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34;.  The pomegranate moisturizes almost as well as the fig, and is weightless.  I spend $$$ to keep my hair cut and colored, using WEN extends the grey/silver coverage.  It also means only one bottle in the shower!</li>
            <li> My hair is so shiny so healthy and so much easier to manage. It does every thing the infomercial says. I will never use any thing else!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> i love the smell of pomegranate and this one is thicker than the sweet almond so if you have thicker/longer hair go with this one</li>
            <li> I bought this after my daughter and I had our hair colored at the salon, since it was sulfa free figured that would help us maintain out coloring longer - big disappointment, daughters washed out in 1 washings, mine lasted about 3 washings - this product is so you have to wash you hair more often, yes my hair was soft but it wasn&#x27;t manageable, and at times my hair felt like it was clinging to my head (not bouncy) both my daughter and i have mid back length (Long) hair there was a inconsistency in our hair while using the whole bottle, big disappointment since spending so much on this product. Never again will I do that to my hair, I will stick with my tried and true brand, and where I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair as often also.</li>
            <li> I really love Wen. I had ordered it from the site a few years ago. I didn&#x27;t like the fact that there were only two scents to choose from or that it as auto reorder. It was a wonderful surprise to see more scents availiable. My only issue with this pomegranite is that it smells just like the original mint scent. Being able to order when I need it is a major plus in my book.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this through the \\&quot;official\\&quot; website but, I found I did not need all that it offered, the whole package.  I just wanted the Conditioning Cleanser.  If you need the whole package of products, the website is for you, if not . . . buy it here, it&#x27;s less money, same outstanding product!  I am sensitive to personal care products but this is amazing.  It truly is the BEST.  Thanks Chaz, GREAT products, and Thanks Amazon for bringing them to us a little more affordably!! YAY!!</li>
            <li> i too have to use wen sparingly then use a shampoo to get rid of build up on my scalp that was causing me to itch like crazy - i use drama clean herbal essences to get rid of the build up, about once every other week, but really any stripping product will work - i also only wash my hair every couple of days as i have long, brittle, colored hair that&#x27;s thin on strand/thick on quantity - my hair also used to be ironing board straight and dull, but using wen has given it a ton of shine, increased the strand thickness, and even brought back curls that i haven&#x27;t seen since i was a child - true, the cost for one bottle here is quite pricy, and that&#x27;s coming from someone who buys alterna conditioning products - but buying it here is no where near the cost of buying it from their site! NEVER NEVER NEVER buy wen from the wenhaircare.com site - they claim only $50 for their kit, then hit you for 2 additional monthly payments of $35 to cover the &#x27;rest&#x27; of the kit cost AND set you up for auto-shipments, with even more monthly charges. i was on their site for 3 months and charged over $400! heck, i cancelled last month, and got charged again this month for product that i will have to ship back to them! SCAM artists! $56 may not be cheap, but it sure beats $120 and an autoshipping service that&#x27;s near impossible to get out of!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair which is always prone to frizzy days. The first few days I used Wen it was amazing, never have I used a product that controlled the frizziness as well nor left my hair as soft. By the end of the first week I noticed how oily my hair was looking around my scalp, which I can say I have never experienced before because my hair is always so dry. I went back to my normal salon shampoo (every other wash) and used Wen in place of the conditioner I normally use after those shampoos (I also used a 1/4 pumps worth as a leave in conditioner near the ends of my hair).  This product is very expensive for slightly better than average results in my curly hair. I am also not a fan of the \\&quot;minty\\&quot; feeling it had on my scalp.</li>
            <li> If I could give this 10 stars I would, seriously!  Since using this product, my hair behaves the way I want it to.  I would like to make note, I have natural wavy hair and when I used this product, there is no frizzing.  If I blow dry my hair straight, it&#x27;s a little heavy on my fine hair but I don&#x27;t dry it straight much.  I still love it for wavy hair.  I went back to regular shampoo to change off and my hair went back to frizzy.  Only reason I switched up is because of the price but I bite the bullet and only use this stuff.  Worth the price!!!  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Great product. Great value. Vendor incentives are sweet!</li>
            <li> I contacted Wen today and asked if any Amazon sellers have authentic Wen products to sell. I was told &amp;#34;no&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently ordered Wen from QVC (authorized seller) and the cleansing conditioner smelled AMAZING, and did a great job on my hair.  The Wen cleanser I purchased from Amazon, didn&#x27;t have much of a scent at all. So beware buying this product from an Amazon seller.</li>
            <li> This product is made specifically for thick, curly or wavy hair. This keeps your hair strong and healthy without weighing down your natural curl or wave.</li>
            <li> I love wen! I&#x27;ve used it off and on for years. I do go through it fast though. I have med. Length hair and the directed amount isn&#x27;t enough to make my hair feel clean. The smaller bottle for the supposed &amp;#34;30&amp;#34; supply lasts only about 2.5 weeks. I end up alternated every other day with shampoo. I&#x27;m excited now to have the bigger sized 32 ounce bottle. Although i doubt it will last 90 days. The stuff does work amazing though.</li>
            <li> Okay, this stuff is a little pricy.  I&#x27;m glad my hair is short, but it is thick.  Anyway..Follow the instructions.  Follow the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;Leave it on as long as you can in the shower, like 5 minutes, longer if you like.  My hair, has never looked better, it just does.&lt;br /&gt;I have bright red hair that I color.  I mean bright.  I never, Never, Never see my color in the shower washing down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;That alone is worth the price of admission!  My hair just looks healthier and feels better.  I don&#x27;t know why or how this product&lt;br /&gt;works it&#x27;s magic, why it isn&#x27;t in every shampoo, but it is great.  Follow the instructions.  It takes a lot of product, don&#x27;t be alarmed.&lt;br /&gt;Just do it!</li>
            <li> Wen Pomegranate (Gluten Free) Cleansing Conditioner 32oz.  If you are new to Wen then by all means purchase their products. My wife uses the Wen Pomegranate (Gluten Free) Cleansing  Conditioner and  she loves it, and it really does work as advertised. Also it is Gluten Free. Wen products are unique and are nothing like your commercial shampoos and conditioners that are full of all kinds of chemicals that can will ruin your hair.</li>
            <li> This haircare is great on your hair, I&#x27;d give it a try!  It also takes less time than shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> Feel funny when washing, but the after the third wash. My hair feel and look healthy.&lt;br /&gt;Would tell my friends.</li>
            <li> The best hair cleanser I have ever used. It takes a little longer to use and settle as regular shampoo but there is no need to extra condition&lt;br /&gt;So I guess the time remains the same. Wonderful smell!</li>
            <li> I have been using wen for over a year now and I love how it leaves my hair. I&#x27;m inidan wth long black hair, my hair is not thick or course, but its not super thin either. I apply wen daily to my har (as directed) and usually let my hair air dry. By the time my hair has dried, it is not dry (like other shampoos leave it) and most importantly its smooth. I love the fact that this product makes my hair look shiney without putting product in it. Also I noticed that I shed less hair in the shower with WEN compared to other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I love this product. This formula works best for my hair. I tried the sweet almond and it was unremarkable and did nothing for my hair. However, when the Pomegranate formula came out, I tried it and my hair loves it.  I have very fine, very curly, dense hair, and it makes my hair so soft and manageable. My hair looks so healthy, full and shiny, since I&#x27;ve been using Wen. The only con, in my opinion, is the cost, but I would still say it is worth the investment. I definitely recommend the Wen Cleansing Conditioner. I suggest trying the travel set with all the formulations to determine which one is best for your hair.</li>
            <li> this my absolute favorite  shampoo out of all of the different kinds of wen i wish it wer cheaper and in stores i would buy it for my whole family</li>
            <li> This is a superior product. It does not leave that waxy residue on your hair shaft like most shampoos do. The pomegranate smells wonderful. And I love not needing to use a separate conditioner.</li>
            <li> When I first used this product, I cleansed once and rinsed and I thought I was supposed to be done. My hair felt weird, it felt rubbery when I tried to run my fingers through it. I then looked at the back of the bottle and saw that you need to wash your hair a few times when its your first use. So I did. And I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently. My hair feels cleaner and feels softer, it looks shinier and fuller with more volume. I bought a bottle for my sister for Christmas. I saw the reviews and I was worried about trying this product, but then I remembered something. People are more inclined to share a bad story about a product or service than they are when they have had a good experience with a product or service.</li>
            <li> I have very long, fine hair, but I have a LOT of it. I also highlight it on a regular basis. with other products I have found that if I didn&#x27;t wash my hair everyday, it would look very oily, especially at the roots. With the WEN products, I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference. I noticed it with the very 1st wash!! my hair was soft, shiny and actually had some life to it! Also, the next day, my hair looked the same!! I decided to just rinse my hair in the shower, rather than wash again, and when it dried, it still looked and felt great!! I am converted!! I am a WEN girl now. It is worth the extra money, as I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair as often, but still get the great results!</li>
            <li> I LOVE Wen and was SO glad I could purchase these big sized bottles on Amazon. My hair soaks it up so I need more than they recommend but one of these lasted me almost three months. My hair feels amazing too!</li>
            <li> I love Wen cleansing conditioner. This isn&#x27;t my favorite kind because I don&#x27;t care for the smell but overall Wen is a good product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this product, I love all of Chaz Dean&#x27;s WEN hair products, my hair has never felt so soft and looked to great!  I&#x27;m a 60 year old woman with dark auburn hair and I&#x27;ve had so many people if I had done anything to it as the color is more red and shiny!  (My natural color - I never died my hair and I&#x27;m very fortunate not to have turned gray).</li>
            <li> My hair is a decent amount of highlighted curls sticking out here and there and making me look like a merino sheep if unstyled. And although this product makes it somewhat softer, I can never go without styling my hair no matter what I use. It&#x27;s still a mess. A softer mess. The only reason I keep buying this product is because it does make my hair look less dry after I style it with my InStyler.</li>
            <li> I am a true Wen addict.  I am over 50 with graying and thinning hair. I color every 4 weeks.  I cut my hair short because it was so sad.  I now have bouncy shoulder length hair that is shiny and relatively manageable.  My scalp feels better and color lasts longer.  It took more than a year of nothing but Wen, but is worth it.</li>
            <li> Wen product is great and consistent ! I love this product and ave used it over the past several years</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Not only has my hair never looked so good it has also never been so healthy.  This is not a band-aid product.  Your hair stays in perfect condition.  Since i started using my color lasts and no more split ends. This is the best hair product i&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;m a wen girl for good now. : - )</li>
            <li> I was kind of hesitant to purchase Wen, but my daughter in law talked me into it.  I have very thick, straight hair and was afraid it would make it look limp and oily like some of the commenters complained about, not at all, it actually stays clean longer and is less oily than it was with regular shampoo.  It&#x27;s a lot faster than using shampoo and conditioner and my hair combs out with no problem after I get out of the shower.  We have well water and I&#x27;ve always had problem getting the tangles out of my hair, but not with Wen.  Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Wen is an amazing product that works very well to keep hair healthy. I choose Pomegranate scent because it is not as strong as the others. My hair is very thick about shoulder length, this size lasts me almost a year using it 2 or 3 times a week.  Great product and price isn&#x27;t too shabby either.</li>
            <li> I love this product, makes your hair feel so good. My hair is really dry, but not with this product. I have used other Wen cleansing conditioners sweet almond mint. I can comb thought my hair so easy, my hair is long and thick. It does fell so thick when I use Wen.  I have used these products for over ! year.  Hurrrrrray!!! Love this product.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a good Gfree hair product (using non-gfree makes my hair fall out in handfulls, yikes!), this one does it all!!  Truely cleans your hair, I work out daily and can use this for clean hair without striping or drying out my dark curly hair.  Can&#x27;t live without this product!!</li>
            <li> I love the way my scalp and hair feel after shampooing.  The tingle is a refreshing clean feeling on my scalp and long hair to my butt is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen Cleansing Conditioner for two years.  I&#x27;m totally sold on it and it&#x27;s the only shampoo I use.  I particularly like the Pomegranate as it is mild and has a pleasant smell.  Works well for my type of hair, which is fine and has a tendency to frizz.  I&#x27;ve also tried the Sweet Almond and Cucumber.  All have been good, but Pomegranate is my favorite.</li>
