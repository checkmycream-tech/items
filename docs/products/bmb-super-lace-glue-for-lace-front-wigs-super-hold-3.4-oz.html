            <li>I had ordered another kind that I was waiting for</li>
            <li>The best lace glue I&#x27;ve tried so far!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best lace adhesive (glue) I have used .</li>
            <li>I love it ..</li>
            <li>love it&lt;</li>
            <li>It arrived on time which I was pleased about</li>
            <li>I am so glad .</li>
            <li>Purchased this glue in December 2012 and was quite pleased with what I received.</li>
            <li>I have spent a lot of money on lace wig glue products and have decided that this is one of the best I have found.</li>
            <li>Too easy</li>
            <li>It also cleans up easily.</li>
            <li>.YOU NEED STRONG HOLD GLUE.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS GLUE, I HAVE BEEN WEARING FULL CAP LACE WIGS  </li>
            <li>Hands down BMB is the best!!</li>
            <li>This product gives a tremendous hold of 4 or more weeks.</li>
            <li>Shipping was really Quick !</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean off.  </li>
            <li>enjoy knowing it isn&#x27;t going to move</li>
            <li>Not for long wearing purposes, but works great for securing a wig without concern.</li>
            <li>Never comes out clean when applying.</li>
            <li>but when I opened it, it wasn&#x27;t a full bottle which of course made me feel cheated.</li>
            <li>Will buy this glue again because it gives a good hold but will definitely try another seller as another reviewer also had a problem with their purchase.</li>
            <li>At $19.99 a bottle I expect it to be full.</li>
            <li>after using BMB Super Lace Glue, I&#x27;ve not used anything else; I love it because it dries clear and holds for more than a week, which is enough hold time for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very strong but does job if wanting for only a week or 2.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find in the 3.4 oz locally and am happy that amazon.com carries the larger size.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Like the price and shopping was fast.  </li>
            <li>THANKS BMB  </li>
            <li>I am very very happy there is an option to return and get my money back because this product is completely useless in the state it arrived in.</li>
            <li>But this time it seem to be a new item.</li>
            <li>I reside in a very humid Southern state and this products really holds.</li>
            <li>I have used it twice now and it clumps up while applying and doesnt hold like the first one I purchased last year.</li>
            <li>but after I received the other one it was a full bottle.</li>
            <li>This product is very easy to work with as opposed to some of the other more expensive and professional products.</li>
            <li>As far as the product itself</li>
            <li>THEY DELIVER THREE WEEK OF LONG LASTING SUPER HOLD.</li>
            <li>The bottle came full and the glue was free flowing and didn&#x27;t start to get thick until after about five months when it was almost empty.</li>
            <li>/&gt;best if on bare scalp verus on your hair</li>
            <li>Made a second purchase in June 2013 and the bottle came about two thirds full and the glue was thick.</li>

            <li> I have bought several glues in the past from this supplier. Sometimes they would come stiff and almost drying out, like it had been sitting in a warehouse . But this time it seem to be a new item. I was very pleased with this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this glue twice from this vendor both times 1/3 of the glue is gone when I received it. The glue itself holds great. I would recommend that this vendor take notice of that. I feel ripped off.</li>
            <li> I love it ..the best glue for lace wigs. I will continue to purchase this as long as the company sells it.</li>
            <li> Am I being PUNKED!! I received this product half empty and dried up to the point of no return. I am very very happy there is an option to return and get my money back because this product is completely useless in the state it arrived in. It looks as if it was being used then I was sent the unused portion. SMH (Shaking My Head)</li>
            <li> This is a very good product to use. There&#x27;s quite a bit in the bottle which should last for quite a while.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to work with as opposed to some of the other more expensive and professional products. I definitely recommend this for beginners.</li>
            <li> I tried other glue and was so disappointed with the results that I&#x27;d almost given up on finding a glue that would hold my unit without drying white and showing thru the lace...after using BMB Super Lace Glue, I&#x27;ve not used anything else; I love it because it dries clear and holds for more than a week, which is enough hold time for me. I can&#x27;t find in the 3.4 oz locally and am happy that amazon.com carries the larger size.</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of money on lace wig glue products and have decided that this is one of the best I have found. Easy to use and clean off.  Not for long wearing purposes, but works great for securing a wig without concern.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to handle and get dry.</li>
            <li> The best lace glue I&#x27;ve tried so far!</li>
            <li> Sticky...messy and bottle dries out after having been opened. You&#x27;ll need a vacuum pump &amp; one way valve to remove the air after replacing the cap. Otherwise it&#x27;ll harden.</li>
            <li> This is the best glue on the market and I have tried them all, Ghost Bond, Spirit Gum, MIty Tite, Durabond and AltraDerm. Hands down BMB is the best!!</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S MESSY. IT HOLDS FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS WHICH SOME PEOPLE SAY IT SHOULD BE FOR 4 WEEKS</li>
            <li> Never comes out clean when applying. Always l comes out with long steaks like thin fiber. Create a mess.wants to refund. Asked amazone and still waiting for return label. Never heard from manufacturer</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very strong but does job if wanting for only a week or 2.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Will back again.  Like the price and shopping was fast.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> love it&lt;br /&gt;very effective keeping wig in place. enjoy knowing it isn&#x27;t going to move around.&lt;br /&gt;best if on bare scalp verus on your hair</li>
            <li> get a little getting use to for application because of it&#x27;s gooey consistency but it holds tight for extended wear base on your body chemistry hold time may vary</li>
            <li> It arrived on time which I was pleased about but when I opened it, it wasn&#x27;t a full bottle which of course made me feel cheated. I had ordered another kind that I was waiting for so I thought that I would wait to see if that was just how it came but after I received the other one it was a full bottle. As far as the product itself yes it does what it&#x27;s supose to but I feel that if this is how it comes then it should be stated that its not a full bottle so a person can know what&#x27;s going on and not feel as it they were cheated on their purchace</li>
            <li> After trying 8 other types and brands BB IS #1. It holds tightest and the longest. Use a small painters brush to dip, swirl, and apply. Too easy</li>
            <li> works great have not had any problems</li>
            <li> This product gives a tremendous hold of 4 or more weeks.</li>
            <li> Great Product !!!!! Shipping was really Quick !</li>
            <li> This is by far the best lace adhesive (glue) I have used . It gives me a 4-5 week hold. I am so glad . I reside in a very humid Southern state and this products really holds. It also cleans up easily. It&#x27;s a good product. Actually, I say it is  the best product for the best hold.</li>
            <li> Purchased this glue in December 2012 and was quite pleased with what I received.The bottle came full and the glue was free flowing and didn&#x27;t start to get thick until after about five months when it was almost empty. Made a second purchase in June 2013 and the bottle came about two thirds full and the glue was thick. I have used it twice now and it clumps up while applying and doesnt hold like the first one I purchased last year. Will buy this glue again because it gives a good hold but will definitely try another seller as another reviewer also had a problem with their purchase. At $19.99 a bottle I expect it to be full.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS GLUE, I HAVE BEEN WEARING FULL CAP LACE WIGS  FOR FIVE YEARS. I  TRIED LOTS OF  DIFFERENT KINDS OF GLUES ,.BUT THEY FAIL TO DELIVER LONG LASTING WEAR , WITH MY BUSY LIFE STYLE INCLUDING HIGH IMPACT EXERCISING .YOU NEED STRONG HOLD GLUE.  THANKS BMB  THEY DELIVER THREE WEEK OF LONG LASTING SUPER HOLD.</li>
