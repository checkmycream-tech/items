            <li>, IT CAN OFTEN BE A GOOD SIGN</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard nothing but good things for this toothbrush</li>
            <li>And toothpaste tastes good and has fluoride, but the brush does the work.  </li>

            <li>I love this brush!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>and it really is amazing.</li>
            <li>this toothbrush is great, flossing while you brush is wonderful, will never use any other toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>BUT BEST IN ADULT SIZE</li>
            <li>This is by far the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I wanted everybody to know how great this brush is &amp; to know of the current option to stock up at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All the good reviews here about it are absolutely true.</li>
            <li>feeling like your teeth &amp; gums are being fully &amp; wonderfully embraced &amp; cleansed in a way no other brush has ever come close to &amp; I have tried many over the years.</li>
            <li>Nice and easy on the gums.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Have received better yearly dental health checks since I started using this brush.&lt;br /&gt;Stopped using my sonicare.</li>
            <li>There I saw that once one knows this brush work, the more one buys the cheaper it gets.  </li>
            <li>JUST MAKE SURE</li>
            <li>JUST MAKE SURE</li>
            <li>and I do floss, but this toothbrush is able to reach places that even those can not.  </li>
            <li>I am here on Amazon today to buy a dozen more because I want to send them to all my friends.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it q</li>
            <li>I was VERY excited about this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>HOPING THAT AS MORE AMAZON CUSTOMERS DISCOVER HOW GREAT THIS BRUSH IS, AMAZON WILL SOON OFFER MORE COST-EFFECTIVE PURCHASING OPTIONS as I love the simplicity &amp; efficiency of being able to get everything I need from Amazon but the current pricing of about $7-8 for 1 brush</li>
            <li>Always enjoy brushing with it</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t available anymore</li>
            <li>I love love love this toothbrush....especially the soft one.</li>
            <li>I do use a sonicare (a really good professional model)</li>
            <li>Very economical, as well.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and gets your teeth clean WOW!!!</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;d be amazed at how clean your teeth feel.  </li>
            <li>This allows me to clean between those teeth and all my others as well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how you can feel the flossing action as you brush.</li>
            <li>AS MOST PEOPLE EXERT TOO MUCH PRESSURE WHEN ALL THAT&#x27;S NEEDED IS SOME GOOD ROTATIONS FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES INCLUDING DOING MICRO-CIRCLES AT THE GUM LINE as another reviewer suggested.</li>
            <li>AS MOST PEOPLE EXERT TOO MUCH PRESSURE WHEN ALL THAT&#x27;S NEEDED IS SOME GOOD ROTATIONS FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES INCLUDING DOING MICRO-CIRCLES AT THE GUM LINE as another reviewer suggested.</li>
            <li>bought the youth size through Amazon given a fairly competitive total cost including free shipping option but had first checked out the manufacturer&#x27;s website which is where the friend who raved about this brush sent me to.  </li>
            <li>Mine is one of wife&#x27;s newly purchased and her favorite brsand.</li>
            <li>Works great, gets food trapped between teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although it&#x27;s a flossing toothbrush, I wouldn&#x27;t eliminate flossing with actual dental floss entirely, but it&#x27;s nice to have a tool that does more than one job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to discover that they had in the meantime added a temporary special pack of 6 adult brushes with 2 travel caps for a total cost of $12 + tax &amp; shipping.  </li>
            <li>I actually stumbled upon this toothbrush in a YouTube review and decided to check this out, since so many people were raving about it.</li>
            <li>I can only credit this toothbrush because a dentist will always say that it&#x27;s the brushing action that does most of the work, and yes, flossing is also important.  </li>
            <li>The bristles really do get way in between teeth as well as below the gumline, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt, it&#x27;s very gentle.  </li>
            <li>This brand is softer than the MouthWatcher brand, which has antimicrobial silver, so I make sure to rinse this brand w/ hot water before air dry, &amp; it has held up well in spite of that.  </li>
            <li>B005BU2PX4 One Sofresh Flossing Toothbrush Soft Full Size Assorted Colors]]</li>
            <li>That could only mean she noticed a good improvement because my gums were better.  </li>
            <li>and it is such a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how this has 5 great reviews, but this brush ended up being a total waste of money.  </li>
            <li>these seem to work really well.</li>
            <li>I really think this toothbrush really cleans your teeth well</li>
            <li>and it really gets in between your teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>YOU ALWAYS BRUSH GENTLY</li>
            <li>YOU ALWAYS BRUSH GENTLY</li>
            <li>Fast delivery will reorder.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>A nice toothbrush, I&#x27;m not sure it really feels like flossing, but it&#x27;s better than your average brush.</li>
            <li>Then again six months later, even more improvement, and one year later...</li>
            <li>highly recommend this</li>
            <li>Will never go back to any other kind of toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love to floss, but with a few of my teeth joined in a bridge I can&#x27;t floss in-between those.  </li>
            <li>The flossing action is very gentle, the soft brush doesn&#x27;t irritate or inflame sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>and it seems really hard to be able to order the colors that I choose.  </li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s odd to get so excited about a toothbrush, but this one is really that different</li>
            <li>UNLESS ONE IS A YOUNG CHILD, I went to stock up at http://sofreshoralcare.com/ .  </li>
            <li>HAD TRY THIS BRUSH SO FAR</li>
            <li>Got it for my 4 year old and myself.  </li>
            <li>I rather panicked and then thought of Amazon....who, as usual, quickly came to the rescue!</li>
            <li>IF IT ONLY HAPPENS INITIALLY as the design + mix of bristles enabling a more thorough &amp; deeper cleaning will often result in dislodging plaque that other brushes did not clear out.</li>

            <li>No other toothbrush does it does.  </li>
            <li>It very rapidly cleared up areas that even the hygienist &amp; every type of flossing &amp; other brush could never get clean because of the way my 3 lower front teeth run super close &amp; slightly twisted over the next.  </li>

            <li>The bristle design on this toothbrush is different than on regular toothbrushes, and the design makes it so that hard to reach areas are cleaned much better than with regular toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I wrote for this same brush that also comes up as &amp;#34;SoFresh Flossing Toothbrush, Adult Soft&amp;#34; with a different price as it is the identical item</li>
            <li>Used it exclusively for at least a full month and tried harder and harder to brush carefully, yet the surface areas of my teeth never seemed to feel clean after a brushing.  </li>
            <li>Those initially exposed areas can initially feel more painful simply because they were used to being covered by the plaque but it is well worth its removal as plaque will cause/worsen gum recession + gum disease &amp; even tooth decay.</li>

            <li>Well, I decided to try this toothbrush, and during the first few days of brushing, I could feel the bristles going below the gum line, and my gums would actually sting after brushing, although to me that meant something was happening.  </li>

            <li> Seriously, I felt like a plain square head, flat toothbrush used to do a better job at cleaning my teeth than this brush(of course I had to angle that to get between teeth).  </li>
            <li> That area has as a result always caused me the worst sensitivity problems as well as having the worst gum recession so to have the plaque so easily &amp; rapidly released is awesome as my doctor explained that plaque is the root cause of gum recession which in turn easily results in sensitivity as areas which were designed to be protected &amp; covered by the gum</li>

            <li> I stumbled across this at my local health food store and was curious as it just looked like a novelty.  </li>
            <li> I will keep buying this toothbrush as long as they keep making it.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Deep scaling\\&quot; is where they numb your gums so they can do a deeper than normal cleaning to get the tartar out, and without insurance, it costs $125 per quadrant, so $500 for the whole mouth.  </li>
            <li> About three years ago, my dental hygienist recommended that I get \\&quot;deep scaling\\&quot; because my gums had receded a bit due to tartar below the gum line.  </li>
            <li> Even though this toothbrush shows it&#x27;s blue green, the one that was sent was red.  </li>
            <li> So we went back to the conventional ORAL B fancy toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It gets down below the gum line  if you concentrate it there and do a  back and forth brushing movement.  </li>
            <li> My dentist advises the softest toothbrush for minimal enamel wear.</li>
            <li> And like the other reviewer, no I have no affiliations with the company, I just think everyone should know about this.  </li>
            <li> it cleans deeper into gums, between teeth, &amp; hard to reach areas in the back around gumline.</li>
            <li> They also seem to encourage me to brush a little longer.  </li>
            <li> I have gums that often bleed, sensitive teeth, and a crown that fell off a few years ago that has not been replaced and has left a snub tooth that is very hard (almost impossible) to brush around and between.  </li>
            <li> My only problem with this toothbrush is that it&#x27;s ridiculously expensive</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t mean like a toothbrush, I mean like a toothbrush, floss, and sonicare all</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. Have received better yearly dental health checks since I started using this brush.&lt;br /&gt;Stopped using my sonicare.</li>
            <li> these seem to work really well. A great idea.</li>
            <li> I actually stumbled upon this toothbrush in a YouTube review and decided to check this out, since so many people were raving about it. I really think this toothbrush really cleans your teeth well and it really gets in between your teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it&#x27;s a flossing toothbrush, I wouldn&#x27;t eliminate flossing with actual dental floss entirely, but it&#x27;s nice to have a tool that does more than one job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this toothbrush! It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> best toothbrush I have ever used.  flosses at the same time.  a very good cleaning!</li>
            <li> Always enjoy brushing with it</li>
            <li> My husband seems to like it.</li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush!!</li>
            <li> I am copying here the title &amp; review I wrote for this same brush that also comes up as &amp;#34;SoFresh Flossing Toothbrush, Adult Soft&amp;#34; with a different price as it is the identical item &amp; I wanted everybody to know how great this brush is &amp; to know of the current option to stock up at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the youth size through Amazon given a fairly competitive total cost including free shipping option but had first checked out the manufacturer&#x27;s website which is where the friend who raved about this brush sent me to.  There I saw that once one knows this brush work, the more one buys the cheaper it gets.  So once I had found THIS TRULY IS AN AWESOME BRUSH BUT BEST IN ADULT SIZE UNLESS ONE IS A YOUNG CHILD, I went to stock up at http://sofreshoralcare.com/ .  I was thrilled to discover that they had in the meantime added a temporary special pack of 6 adult brushes with 2 travel caps for a total cost of $12 + tax &amp; shipping.  I AM HOPING THAT AS MORE AMAZON CUSTOMERS DISCOVER HOW GREAT THIS BRUSH IS, AMAZON WILL SOON OFFER MORE COST-EFFECTIVE PURCHASING OPTIONS as I love the simplicity &amp; efficiency of being able to get everything I need from Amazon but the current pricing of about $7-8 for 1 brush seems ridiculous when it can be bought directly for much less &amp; they ship super fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT IS AWESOME ABOUT THE SoFRESH FLOSSING TOOTHRBUSHES IS THAT even though the design looks identical to brushes like the Nimbus (i.e. with the mix of shorter &amp; longer ultra-fine bristles), it brings an ideal combination of softness yet thoroughness of cleaning &amp; best of all a wonderful &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; feeling like your teeth &amp; gums are being fully &amp; wonderfully embraced &amp; cleansed in a way no other brush has ever come close to &amp; I have tried many over the years. EVERY PERSON I&#x27;VE HAD TRY THIS BRUSH SO FAR WAS ALSO IMMEDIATELY IMPRESSED &amp; EACH OF US AGREE THAT THIS IS THE FIRST BRUSH TO BE NOTICEABLY GREAT &amp; A JOY TO USE + DELIVERING THE BEST CLEANING EASILY &amp; COMFORTABLY.  It very rapidly cleared up areas that even the hygienist &amp; every type of flossing &amp; other brush could never get clean because of the way my 3 lower front teeth run super close &amp; slightly twisted over the next.  That area has as a result always caused me the worst sensitivity problems as well as having the worst gum recession so to have the plaque so easily &amp; rapidly released is awesome as my doctor explained that plaque is the root cause of gum recession which in turn easily results in sensitivity as areas which were designed to be protected &amp; covered by the gum end up exposed instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN CASE ANY OF YOU EXPERIENCE INITIALLY AGGRAVATED SENSITIVITY (which was not a problem in my case but given another reviewer for the youth brush mentioning this as a downside), IT CAN OFTEN BE A GOOD SIGN IF IT ONLY HAPPENS INITIALLY as the design + mix of bristles enabling a more thorough &amp; deeper cleaning will often result in dislodging plaque that other brushes did not clear out. Those initially exposed areas can initially feel more painful simply because they were used to being covered by the plaque but it is well worth its removal as plaque will cause/worsen gum recession + gum disease &amp; even tooth decay. JUST MAKE SURE YOU ALWAYS BRUSH GENTLY AS MOST PEOPLE EXERT TOO MUCH PRESSURE WHEN ALL THAT&#x27;S NEEDED IS SOME GOOD ROTATIONS FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES INCLUDING DOING MICRO-CIRCLES AT THE GUM LINE as another reviewer suggested.MFORTABLY.

            <li> Works great, gets food trapped between teeth.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are great!  I&#x27;ve used them for years!</li>
            <li> This brush WORKS!!!  ....and I don&#x27;t mean like a toothbrush, I mean like a toothbrush, floss, and sonicare all rolled into one.  I stumbled across this at my local health food store and was curious as it just looked like a novelty.  When I asked about it, the clerk said he hadn&#x27;t tried one but many people had told him it was the best toothbrush they had ever used.  I&#x27;ve always had dental issues, so I decided to give it a try.  Gosh, I&#x27;m so glad I did!  I just can&#x27;t tell you what a difference this has made!  I do use a sonicare (a really good professional model) and I do floss, but this toothbrush is able to reach places that even those can not.  The bristles really do get way in between teeth as well as below the gumline, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt, it&#x27;s very gentle.  I have gums that often bleed, sensitive teeth, and a crown that fell off a few years ago that has not been replaced and has left a snub tooth that is very hard (almost impossible) to brush around and between.  This toothbrush all by itself has solved all of those problems.  It&#x27;s like a miracle.  I am here on Amazon today to buy a dozen more because I want to send them to all my friends.  It&#x27;s just that good!  And like the other reviewer, no I have no affiliations with the company, I just think everyone should know about this.  I know it&#x27;s odd to get so excited about a toothbrush, but this one is really that different and it is such a huge improvement.  I hope this company stays in business forever, because I after using this, I could never go back to a regular toothbrush again.  I can&#x27;t even floss as well as the job this does.  Truly remarkable!</li>
            <li> it is a good performing toothbrush! Mine is one of wife&#x27;s newly purchased and her favorite brsand. Does intended functions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how you can feel the flossing action as you brush. Move stopped using my sonicare in favor of this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The best toothbrush on the market!!!</li>
            <li> This IS the best toothbrush I ever used.  All the good reviews here about it are absolutely true.No other toothbrush does it does.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I was VERY excited about this toothbrush.  Got it for my 4 year old and myself.  Used it exclusively for at least a full month and tried harder and harder to brush carefully, yet the surface areas of my teeth never seemed to feel clean after a brushing.  So we went back to the conventional ORAL B fancy toothbrush.  Seriously, I felt like a plain square head, flat toothbrush used to do a better job at cleaning my teeth than this brush(of course I had to angle that to get between teeth).  With the SoFresh Flosser toothbrush, I still felt the need to floss the tighter teeth(with good reason!) and the surfaces felt plaque covered after a 10-minute brushing.  Don&#x27;t know how this has 5 great reviews, but this brush ended up being a total waste of money.  Bummer.</li>
            <li> Great product.Fast delivery will reorder.</li>
            <li> Nice and easy on the gums.</li>
            <li> Love these!!!  Will keep purchasing!</li>
            <li> A nice toothbrush, I&#x27;m not sure it really feels like flossing, but it&#x27;s better than your average brush.</li>
            <li> The bristle design on this toothbrush is different than on regular toothbrushes, and the design makes it so that hard to reach areas are cleaned much better than with regular toothbrushes. I still floss but I wouldn&#x27;t do without this toothbrush. I like to order a lot of them and give them away to my family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B005BU2PX4 One Sofresh Flossing Toothbrush Soft Full Size Assorted Colors]]</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  It gets down below the gum line  if you concentrate it there and do a  back and forth brushing movement.  All my inflammation has disappeared.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard nothing but good things for this toothbrush and it really is amazing. My teeth never felt cleaner and the feeling stays throughout the day. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it .</li>
            <li> Have been using this toothbrush for years. Wasn&#x27;t available anymore were I had been used to buying it. I rather panicked and then thought of Amazon....who, as usual, quickly came to the rescue! This is the best toothbrush I have ever used and I hope they never stop making it. The flossing action is very gentle, the soft brush doesn&#x27;t irritate or inflame sensitive gums. Very economical, as well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It is very easy to use and gets your teeth clean WOW!!! Love it q</li>
            <li> These things are great!  Hold &#x27;em at a 45 degree angle for the backs of your teeth and you&#x27;d be amazed at how clean your teeth feel.  They also seem to encourage me to brush a little longer.  Will never go back to any other kind of toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My dentist advises the softest toothbrush for minimal enamel wear. This brand is softer than the MouthWatcher brand, which has antimicrobial silver, so I make sure to rinse this brand w/ hot water before air dry, &amp; it has held up well in spite of that.  Not a substitute for flossing (fave P.O.H. great price on Amazon), but it cleans deeper into gums, between teeth, &amp; hard to reach areas in the back around gumline.</li>
            <li> I will keep buying this toothbrush as long as they keep making it.  About three years ago, my dental hygienist recommended that I get \\&quot;deep scaling\\&quot; because my gums had receded a bit due to tartar below the gum line.  \\&quot;Deep scaling\\&quot; is where they numb your gums so they can do a deeper than normal cleaning to get the tartar out, and without insurance, it costs $125 per quadrant, so $500 for the whole mouth.  Well, I decided to try this toothbrush, and during the first few days of brushing, I could feel the bristles going below the gum line, and my gums would actually sting after brushing, although to me that meant something was happening.  Well, after six months of use, my hygienist asked \\&quot;Have you started flossing ?\\&quot;.  That could only mean she noticed a good improvement because my gums were better.  Then again six months later, even more improvement, and one year later... I have excellent dental health !!!  I can only credit this toothbrush because a dentist will always say that it&#x27;s the brushing action that does most of the work, and yes, flossing is also important.  And toothpaste tastes good and has fluoride, but the brush does the work.  But anyway, I am living proof that this toothbrush WORKS !!!  I tried posting a review on the SoFresh website, but couldn&#x27;t find a way to do it, so I&#x27;m doing it here.  AND, I have told my dentist about it, and no, I&#x27;m not getting paid by SoFresh to do any of this.  I&#x27;m just saying this product WORKS.</li>
            <li> this toothbrush is great, flossing while you brush is wonderful, will never use any other toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.  I love to floss, but with a few of my teeth joined in a bridge I can&#x27;t floss in-between those.  This allows me to clean between those teeth and all my others as well.  My only problem with this toothbrush is that it&#x27;s ridiculously expensive and it seems really hard to be able to order the colors that I choose.  Even though this toothbrush shows it&#x27;s blue green, the one that was sent was red.  But even saying that....I love love love this toothbrush....especially the soft one.</li>
