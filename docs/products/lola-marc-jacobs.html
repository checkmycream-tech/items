            <li>I contemplated returning it right away!!!  </li>
            <li>The bottle is cute and the scent is nice, but for it to &amp;#34;supposedly&amp;#34; be a Marc Jacobs perfume.....</li>
            <li>My wife loved the fragrance of the original Marc Jacobs perfume, but decided she wanted to try the newer Lola.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my girlfriend, I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>i love the smell.</li>
            <li>This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>Oh Lola is ok</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the perfect scent without being overpowering, but at the same time lasts all day.</li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>I love the sent and packaging. :)</li>
            <li>I just love it, and it lasts longer than many others I have used over the years.</li>

            <li>I love wearing this perfume.</li>

            <li>There has not been one time when I have worn it that I have not been able to recieve a compliment or inquiry as to the name of the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Frankly, men love it.</li>
            <li>I love purfume.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However Lola is sophisticated sexiness in a bottle</li>
            <li>(I guess they cost more than the parfum</li>
            <li>Marc Jacobs fragrances are my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I love it and so does my boyfriend.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love, LOVE this scent.</li>

            <li>I was so glad I got it for Christmas</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s lovely.</li>
            <li>WENT TO MACY&#x27;S FIRST AND BOUGHT THIS PERFUME, THEN WHILE WAITING TO PAY PULLLED OUT MY PHONE, GOT ON LINE AND FOUND IT $30.00 CHEAPER ON AMAZON!!!  </li>
            <li>So pretty &amp; smells good</li>
            <li>The bottle is very pretty, and looks nice on a side table.  </li>
            <li>It is light, feminine and sexy.</li>
            <li>It has a lovely light floral scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t expect to fit in a drawer or in your medicine cabinet with the top on</li>
            <li>Lola lingers strong all day as if I had just put it on.</li>
            <li>Nice scent, pretty bottle.</li>
            <li>I collect Marc Jacob perfume bottles because they are beautiful so the smell is actually an extra for me.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is overwhelming too sweet for me.</li>
            <li>I love that it is sweet but musky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have the large bottle since I use it almost every day.</li>
            <li>Huge difference and its not just my sense of smell</li>
            <li>Light floral scent</li>
            <li>Lola better but was able to smell this in the sample form and liked the smell enough to purchase.  </li>
            <li>I first bought this fragrance in 2008 when it first came out and loved.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, I feel very femenine wearing it, and price was much better than anywhere else, I tottally recommend it.</li>
            <li>great scent that lasts a really long time on your skin.</li>
            <li>Really unique bottle, stands out on my dressing mirror.</li>
            <li>I use it for nights out because it just seems so rich.</li>
            <li>I wear it as my fall/winter fragrance for special occasions and dates.</li>
            <li>It smells very feminine without that sickly sweet smell most perfumes have.</li>
            <li>I love Lola by Marc Jacobs so much.</li>
            <li>And at a great price, sent out and received quickly, not testers, in their original packaging.  </li>
            <li>Seriously Marc Jacobs makes the best perfume I&#x27;ve ever encountered...</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and she had no clue what she was opening.</li>
            <li>Lola is my new favorite scent</li>
            <li>It smells cheap and very nauseating sweet.  </li>
            <li>Not as light and playful as some, but very classic.</li>
            <li>The fragrance was light, very suttle and lasted all day.</li>
            <li>love it flowers smell soft</li>
            <li>This purchase of this product was definete worth it.</li>
            <li>A bit more of a mature smell.</li>
            <li>Very floral but sexy with a twist at the end I highly recommend</li>
            <li>My mother is 59, I am 24, and it seems to have just the right body for both of us.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my wife for her birthday, I must admit that I am a sucker for pretty bottles, but the aroma of this perfume is incredible.</li>
            <li>I loved it from a magazine sample, but in reality it turned out to be much more flowery than musky, which is not a good scent for me.  </li>
            <li>nice fragrance a little to strong for my wife</li>
            <li>Reasonable price, got here quick</li>
            <li>Very light and romantic.</li>
            <li>It seems lately all of the great fragrances are for men.  </li>
            <li>AT FIRST</li>
            <li>I fell in love with it instantaneously, and the flower that covers it only makes it cuter!</li>
            <li>bottle is pretty too</li>
            <li>This is my first time purchase perfume online.</li>
            <li>I wish it was longer lasting and had greater sillage.</li>
            <li>At first it smells kinda....</li>
            <li>I plan on purchasing more in the future!!</li>
            <li>The fragance is sweet and classy.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t exactly have a fantastic lasting power on me, but I like the softness.</li>
            <li>The product is a fine perfume and this specific one can not be found at any store at this price .</li>
            <li>The smell is sensational, but doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li>Arrived fast and had no flaws.</li>
            <li>I received this product and it did not smell like the real thing.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The shipping time was more than I expected.</li>
            <li>I was very cautious about ordering perfume on line...</li>
            <li>thanks to both amazon and the vendor.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore Lola by Marc Jacobs.  </li>
            <li>Very dissapointed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very sensual, floral smell that is not over powering.</li>
            <li>My wife really Likes this.</li>
            <li>item came in the sealed package, on time, and the price was better than other places (mall kiosks and online)</li>
            <li>I noticed that her original bottle of this I got her a while ago, was low.</li>
            <li>I tend to flock toward sweet scents, and this is definitely that, but with just a hint of musk at the end.</li>
            <li>Only need to spray one spray and it lasts the entire day- sometimes longer:)</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Spend a little more and buy from a store.</li>
            <li>I would order this perfume over and over again, it has such a fresh and inviting scent.</li>
            <li>I still have a little bit left from the way it used to smell and it was absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>This is going to me my new scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m interested if anyone else had a similar experience.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and flowery but not sweet.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend this for someone who enjoys flowery scents that are light and airy but not sickly sweet.</li>
            <li>Smells great however I believe this to be a fake as the scent does not last.  </li>
            <li>, not a heavy fragrance.</li>
            <li>Too flowery and young for me.</li>
            <li>old, like something is off.</li>
            <li>Its mild and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell of this perfume and recommend it to other guys looking for a christmas present for their wife.</li>
            <li>The scent is a little sweet, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>When I first bought this perfume, I did not really like it.</li>
            <li>This is the same product you find in the big name stores but much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Not great longevity on me, but I have this problem with many scents.  </li>
            <li>and I was so excited to find it at almost half the price of what you&#x27;d find it at Sephora or other retailers.</li>
            <li>The smell is not overwhelming but doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours.</li>

            <li> i used to work at bloomingdales and this was the most popular fragrance that everyone loved.</li>
            <li> Its a nice scent though.</li>
            <li> Nice packaging, bought it as a gift for a friend.</li>
            <li> Received it promptly in wonderful condition, unopened and for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This is a nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Excellent! Fan of the perfume, decent price, shipped when it said it would</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! :-)</li>
            <li> I contemplated returning it right away!!!  </li>
            <li> The bottle is cute and the scent is nice, but for it to &amp;#34;supposedly&amp;#34; be a Marc Jacobs perfume.....</li>
            <li> My wife loved the fragrance of the original Marc Jacobs perfume, but decided she wanted to try the newer Lola.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend, I love this perfume.</li>
            <li> i love the smell.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> Oh Lola is ok</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the perfect scent without being overpowering, but at the same time lasts all day.</li>
            <li> What more can I say?</li>
            <li> I love the sent and packaging. :)</li>
            <li> I just love it, and it lasts longer than many others I have used over the years.</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> Was pleased with the purchase and</li>
            <li> It smells even better when combined with the lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance</li>
            <li> Lovely scent.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I got this in the 3.4 oz bottle and love it.</li>
            <li> I love the dress of Marc Jacobs, 80% of my dress is Marc Jacobs.</li>
            <li> Love the scent.</li>
            <li> Sophisticated scent.</li>
            <li> I love wearing this perfume.</li>
            <li> and I love Marc Jacobs Daisy perfume.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume, always get compliments and asked &amp;#</li>
            <li> There has not been one time when I have worn it that I have not been able to recieve a compliment or inquiry as to the name of the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Frankly, men love it.</li>
            <li> I love purfume.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However Lola is sophisticated sexiness in a bottle</li>
            <li> (I guess they cost more than the parfum</li>
            <li> Marc Jacobs fragrances are my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I love it and so does my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love, LOVE this scent.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragance and such a great price compared to the department store prices!!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for Mother&#x27;s day - this is my mom&#x27;s favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> nice light scent.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume.</li>
            <li> I was so glad I got it for Christmas</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s lovely.</li>
            <li> WENT TO MACY&#x27;S FIRST AND BOUGHT THIS PERFUME, THEN WHILE WAITING TO PAY PULLLED OUT MY PHONE, GOT ON LINE AND FOUND IT $30.00 CHEAPER ON AMAZON!!!  </li>
            <li> So pretty &amp; smells good</li>
            <li> The bottle is very pretty, and looks nice on a side table.  </li>
            <li> It is light, feminine and sexy.</li>
            <li> It has a lovely light floral scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t expect to fit in a drawer or in your medicine cabinet with the top on</li>
            <li> Lola lingers strong all day as if I had just put it on.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, pretty bottle.</li>
            <li> I collect Marc Jacob perfume bottles because they are beautiful so the smell is actually an extra for me.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is overwhelming too sweet for me.</li>
            <li> I love that it is sweet but musky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have the large bottle since I use it almost every day.</li>
            <li> Huge difference and its not just my sense of smell</li>
            <li> Light floral scent</li>
            <li> Lola better but was able to smell this in the sample form and liked the smell enough to purchase.  </li>
            <li> I first bought this fragrance in 2008 when it first came out and loved.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, I feel very femenine wearing it, and price was much better than anywhere else, I tottally recommend it.</li>
            <li> great scent that lasts a really long time on your skin.</li>
            <li> Really unique bottle, stands out on my dressing mirror.</li>
            <li> I use it for nights out because it just seems so rich.</li>
            <li> I wear it as my fall/winter fragrance for special occasions and dates.</li>
            <li> It smells very feminine without that sickly sweet smell most perfumes have.</li>
            <li> I love Lola by Marc Jacobs so much.</li>
            <li> And at a great price, sent out and received quickly, not testers, in their original packaging.  </li>
            <li> Seriously Marc Jacobs makes the best perfume I&#x27;ve ever encountered...</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and she had no clue what she was opening.</li>
            <li> Lola is my new favorite scent</li>
            <li> It smells cheap and very nauseating sweet.  </li>
            <li> Not as light and playful as some, but very classic.</li>
            <li> The fragrance was light, very suttle and lasted all day.</li>
            <li> love it flowers smell soft</li>
            <li> This purchase of this product was definete worth it.</li>
            <li> A bit more of a mature smell.</li>
            <li> Very floral but sexy with a twist at the end I highly recommend</li>
            <li> My mother is 59, I am 24, and it seems to have just the right body for both of us.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife for her birthday, I must admit that I am a sucker for pretty bottles, but the aroma of this perfume is incredible.</li>
            <li> I loved it from a magazine sample, but in reality it turned out to be much more flowery than musky, which is not a good scent for me.  </li>
            <li> nice fragrance a little to strong for my wife</li>
            <li> Reasonable price, got here quick</li>
            <li> Very light and romantic.</li>
            <li> It seems lately all of the great fragrances are for men.  </li>
            <li> AT FIRST</li>
            <li> I fell in love with it instantaneously, and the flower that covers it only makes it cuter!</li>
            <li> bottle is pretty too</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchase perfume online.</li>
            <li> I wish it was longer lasting and had greater sillage.</li>
            <li> At first it smells kinda....</li>
            <li> I plan on purchasing more in the future!!</li>
            <li> The fragance is sweet and classy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t exactly have a fantastic lasting power on me, but I like the softness.</li>
            <li> The product is a fine perfume and this specific one can not be found at any store at this price .</li>
            <li> The smell is sensational, but doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> Arrived fast and had no flaws.</li>
            <li> I received this product and it did not smell like the real thing.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> The shipping time was more than I expected.</li>
            <li> I was very cautious about ordering perfume on line...</li>
            <li> thanks to both amazon and the vendor.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore Lola by Marc Jacobs.  </li>
            <li> Very dissapointed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very sensual, floral smell that is not over powering.</li>
            <li> My wife really Likes this.</li>
            <li> item came in the sealed package, on time, and the price was better than other places (mall kiosks and online)</li>
            <li> I noticed that her original bottle of this I got her a while ago, was low.</li>
            <li> I tend to flock toward sweet scents, and this is definitely that, but with just a hint of musk at the end.</li>
            <li> Only need to spray one spray and it lasts the entire day- sometimes longer:)</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Spend a little more and buy from a store.</li>
            <li> I would order this perfume over and over again, it has such a fresh and inviting scent.</li>
            <li> I still have a little bit left from the way it used to smell and it was absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> This is going to me my new scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m interested if anyone else had a similar experience.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and flowery but not sweet.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend this for someone who enjoys flowery scents that are light and airy but not sickly sweet.</li>
            <li> Smells great however I believe this to be a fake as the scent does not last.  </li>
            <li> , not a heavy fragrance.</li>
            <li> Too flowery and young for me.</li>
            <li> old, like something is off.</li>
            <li> Its mild and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the smell of this perfume and recommend it to other guys looking for a christmas present for their wife.</li>
            <li> The scent is a little sweet, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this perfume, I did not really like it.</li>
            <li> This is the same product you find in the big name stores but much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Not great longevity on me, but I have this problem with many scents.  </li>
            <li> and I was so excited to find it at almost half the price of what you&#x27;d find it at Sephora or other retailers.</li>
            <li> The smell is not overwhelming but doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t go on like an &amp;#34;eau du parfum&amp;#34; or last as long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s generally long-lasting, compared to other scents I&#x27;ve used, as well.</li>
            <li> and she likes that it lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been waiting on a non-floral perfume that matches my body chemistry since Obsession came out (yes, that long!) .  </li>
            <li> I have worn other fragrances before but they do not generate the same response.</li>
            <li> the parfum was what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Not a very pleasing fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The money spent on the bottle should have been spent on the fragrance.</li>
            <li> My favorite purfume and its discontinued :(</li>
            <li> She refuses to wear any other fragrance.</li>
            <li> IT WOULD BE A FAKE, BUT IT WAS THE REAL THING</li>
            <li> They seem to last, at least on me.  </li>
            <li> Too sour.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sickly sweet</li>
            <li> Had to buy one after using a little out of the one my mum bought for herself.</li>
            <li> However, it has become my everyday fragrance.</li>
            <li> this is one of the few fragrances I like</li>
            <li> Sadly I have been coming across the same smell of this perfume in the stores.  </li>
            <li> I usually hate how perfume is so overwhelming, after a while it actually makes me feel sick.</li>
            <li> I was late in ordering and did not expect it on time.</li>
            <li> Really not happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> Men, buy this for your wife (or girlfriend if you&#x27;re not married), you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> A tip for husbands, can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so confused!   </li>
            <li> Sorry I purchased it for her and not me.  </li>
            <li> I say she can&#x27;t go wrong with either, but she always turns my head when she walks by wearing her Lola.</li>
            <li> Fake.</li>
            <li> this was a fake.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is now a very expensive dresser decoration.</li>
            <li> So disappointed!</li>

            <li> Excellent! Fan of the perfume, decent price, shipped when it said it would</li>
            <li> Lovely scent.  Great price  Soft pink pepper/grapefruit scent-great for day wear.  Not great longevity on me, but I have this problem with many scents.  I would recommend people with perfume longevity problems might want to try Caron parfums and possibly Guerlain parfums.  They seem to last, at least on me.  Granted this is body chemistry issue, and as such varies case to case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing; if you can, on this site, change the person name ID from &amp;#34;Brad&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;Madeine.&amp;#34;  Brad is my husband and he has a different e-mail address.  My e-mail is jstmadeline@aol.com; I believe this is what is used for my perfumes.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Lola is a very nice fragrance. Its mild and long lasting. Had to buy one after using a little out of the one my mum bought for herself. I would purchase another again and again..</li>

I was very cautious about ordering perfume on line...however, I opted to take a chance after reading the various reviews on this one. Perfume arrived in perfect condition...sealed box, unopened bottle. Great value for the money!!! Will purchase again from this seller!</li>
            <li> My wife simply loves Lola. It is the third time I am buying Lola for her; she does not want anything else. In order to give her a break from Lola I got her Couture Couture last October, 2010. She loves it but she preferred Lola.   I actually likes Lola myself, I don&#x27;t wear it though.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my wife as a valentines day gift. I was late in ordering and did not expect it on time. estimated delivery date was 2 days after valentines day. I received the product the day before. Product was beautifully packaged and bottled. thanks to both amazon and the vendor. A tip for husbands, can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife on Valentines day. It&#x27;s something that she wanted for a while now. She was extremely happy to receive this on Valentines Day. It arrived just before and enough time for me to wrap it up and give it. Thank YOu</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped by a department store or Sephora every time I go to the mall to spray Lola on. I love it! I ordered it and received it and when I put it on it didn&#x27;t smell anything like the \\&quot;testers\\&quot; at the stores. I&#x27;m so confused!   At first it smells kinda....old, like something is off. I contemplated returning it right away!!!  About 10 - 15 minutes after I put it on it started to smell like the Lola I had put on in stores.   I don&#x27;t know why it did this and I&#x27;m interested if anyone else had a similar experience.</li>
            <li> I adore Marc Jacobs perfumes - except this one. I really love &amp;#34;Oh! Lola&amp;#34; ! But &amp;#34;Lola&amp;#34; has patchouli in it and I do not get along with patchouli - lol!</li>
            <li> Wonderful perfume. Smells great and the product is just as described.</li>
            <li> Totally my fault. I never tried out the perfume before buying it. I just went by the reviews and I love Marc Jacobs Daisy perfume. The fragrance is overwhelming too sweet for me.</li>
            <li> Met all my expectations! Love this perfume, always get compliments and asked &amp;#34;what are you wearing, you smell so good&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful! My favorite! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore Lola by Marc Jacobs.  The scent is light and flowery but not sweet.  I receive a lot of compliments even towards the end of the day so it has some lasting power.  The bottle is very pretty, and looks nice on a side table.  Would recommend this for someone who enjoys flowery scents that are light and airy but not sickly sweet.</li>
            <li> I bought Lola on a whim a couple of years ago. I wear it as my fall/winter fragrance for special occasions and dates. There has not been one time when I have worn it that I have not been able to recieve a compliment or inquiry as to the name of the fragrance. Frankly, men love it. I have worn other fragrances before but they do not generate the same response.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son&#x27;s female friend.  I love purfume.  Sorry I purchased it for her and not me.  This smell lasted in my nose for hours.  I just wanted to sit next to her.</li>
            <li> My wife was very happy with this perfume, i love it on her too, she gets lots of compliments too.</li>
            <li> Seriously Marc Jacobs makes the best perfume I&#x27;ve ever encountered... This is going to me my new scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so so sexy!!! I&#x27;m 30, and I put it on to party tonight and received complements on the smell.  Please note perfumes mix with each persons body differently altering the smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However Lola is sophisticated sexiness in a bottle</li>
            <li> ...the recipient of this gift was, of course, happy to get it given that it is her favorite fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item came in the sealed package, on time, and the price was better than other places (mall kiosks and online) I checked.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price, got here quick</li>
            <li> This is the same product you find in the big name stores but much cheaper. Smells great! Shipped well before estimated date.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this perfume. When we received it, we found it to be the same quality of a product purchased at our local department store. The package was also in good condition.</li>
            <li> This is a great scent. I would highly recommend it. I use it for nights out because it just seems so rich.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this fragrance daily for months, and I receive compliments on its scent all the time. I gave my mother Lola last Christmas, and ended up buying it for myself soon after. My mother is 59, I am 24, and it seems to have just the right body for both of us.</li>
            <li> Really not happy with this product.  It doesn&#x27;t last and smells nothing like the department store purchase.</li>
            <li> She refuses to wear any other fragrance. I am required by pain of death to purchase this for her every year.</li>
            <li> I loved it from a magazine sample, but in reality it turned out to be much more flowery than musky, which is not a good scent for me.  Unfortunately, it is now a very expensive dresser decoration.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife, she loves it, and me too. She smells wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;Also the packaging and bottle design are nice and beautiful, (I guess they cost more than the parfum itself)...&lt;br /&gt;Good price for its size!</li>
            <li> My wife loved the fragrance of the original Marc Jacobs perfume, but decided she wanted to try the newer Lola.  I say she can&#x27;t go wrong with either, but she always turns my head when she walks by wearing her Lola. Men, buy this for your wife (or girlfriend if you&#x27;re not married), you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Women, watch out - you&#x27;ll have men turning their heads and wanting to get closer wearing this stuff!  It&#x27;s that good!</li>
            <li> I noticed that her original bottle of this I got her a while ago, was low. Arrived quickly and she had no clue what she was opening. Smells Great!</li>
            <li> I use this perfume every day. It has a lovely light floral scent that is not overpowering. I&#x27;ve worn it for years.</li>
            <li> Officially smell amazing.</li>
            <li> Marc Jacobs fragrances are my favorite.  He nails them every time.</li>
            <li> Fake. Doesn&#x27;t go on like an &amp;#34;eau du parfum&amp;#34; or last as long. Spend a little more and buy from a store.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of Lola which is enclosed in a beautiful flower shaped bottle. The smell is not overwhelming but doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for girlfriend and she loved it. she is already talking about buying it again so there you have it.</li>
            <li> This perfume is distinctive and gorgeous.  It is not overpowering but it has staying power.  I always get compliments on it!</li>
            <li> Totally did not smell like Marc Jacobs Lola....either they changed the way they make it or this was a fake.  Very dissapointed.  It smells cheap and very nauseating sweet.  Sadly I have been coming across the same smell of this perfume in the stores.  I still have a little bit left from the way it used to smell and it was absolutely amazing.  Huge difference and its not just my sense of smell but my sisters agrees with me as well.  As well as my boyfriend......smells nothing like it should.</li>
            <li> I had the intention of buying Daisy, but after smelling and comparing the two I went with Lola. I love that it is sweet but musky. It&#x27;s not sickly sweet, I don&#x27;t want to smell like a child who got into candy. A bit more of a mature smell. I love it and so does my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> The bottle is cute and the scent is nice, but for it to &amp;#34;supposedly&amp;#34; be a Marc Jacobs perfume.....it does not last. I&#x27;ve had cheaper perfumes last longer than this one. So disappointed!</li>
            <li> Nice packaging, bought it as a gift for a friend. She loves it</li>
            <li> I love, love, love, LOVE this scent. I plan on purchasing more in the future!! I would definitely recommend this perfume.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, I feel very femenine wearing it, and price was much better than anywhere else, I tottally recommend it.</li>
            <li> Lola is my new favorite scent and I was so excited to find it at almost half the price of what you&#x27;d find it at Sephora or other retailers. It&#x27;s nice to have the large bottle since I use it almost every day.</li>
            <li> I loved the sample smell in the magazine, but when I used it on myself it didn&#x27;t smell very becoming. Maybe it just didnt mix with my chemistry. My fiance told me he didn&#x27;t like the smell. (We are in our mid 20&#x27;s) I gave it to my professor and she loves it however</li>
            <li> This is great perfume, and it was a better deal than in the store!</li>
            <li> I love Lola by Marc Jacobs so much. I have been wearing only this fragrance for over a year now. It stays on all day, and is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Came on time,  great perfume</li>
            <li> My favorite fragance and such a great price compared to the department store prices!!</li>
            <li> Smells great however I believe this to be a fake as the scent does not last.  The real version at sephora etc lasts all day with a few spritz, this the scent disappears almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume for 5 years now and each time I try another scent. I just don&#x27;t get the compliments and lovely scent from this Marc Jacobs Lola!</li>
            <li> Bought this for wife&#x27;s b-day. She loved the attractive bottle and the fragrance. It&#x27;s a very sensual, floral smell that is not over powering.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for Mother&#x27;s day - this is my mom&#x27;s favorite perfume. Received it promptly in wonderful condition, unopened and for a reasonable price. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> This is a nice fragrance.  I purchased this for a Christmas present for friend.  The smell is sensational, but doesn&#x27;t last very long.  If you are looking for a fragrance that lasts, then I would suggest a cologne.  Perfume doesn&#x27;t seem to linger as well.</li>
            <li> Good product. Only need to spray one spray and it lasts the entire day- sometimes longer:) nice light scent. Bottle is bulky- don&#x27;t expect to fit in a drawer or in your medicine cabinet with the top on</li>
            <li> MY daughter loves this perfume and this was a gift for her</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. I was so glad I got it for Christmas, it&#x27;s lovely. Very floral but sexy with a twist at the end I highly recommend</li>
            <li> My wife really Likes this.</li>
