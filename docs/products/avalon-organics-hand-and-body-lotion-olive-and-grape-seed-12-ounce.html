            <li>I love this product &amp; would buy again &amp; from this manufacturer.</li>
            <li>Avalon Organics reformulated this line and it now smells more like olive oil than it used to.  </li>
            <li>I still like their body wash, but the scent of the lotion lingers and I won&#x27;t be buying any more of it when I get through this bottle.  </li>
            <li>But I LOVE THIS stuff.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product I endorse whole heartedly.  </li>

            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>

            <li>;)</li>
            <li>tried the Peppermint lotion  from the same company and it was very rich.</li>
            <li>Suitable for your face if you have really dry skin, but keep it away from your eyes as it has a tendency to migrate.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and not real greasy.</li>
            <li>and then it feels very dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very hydrating.</li>
            <li>Amazon refunded my money very promptly and let me just dispose of the product.  </li>
            <li>I had a bottle that clearly stated &#x27;new with more essential oils&#x27; and it definitely felt different and was more moisturizing than this one.</li>
            <li>It works very well and makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>A bit disappointed but still a good product for safe use. .</li>
            <li>I high high hopes for this product but on first smell it was clear the essential oils had gone rancid and</li>
            <li>Back to the Body Shop&#x27;s higher end shea butter products I go.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance free has an odd scent.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin really soft.</li>
            <li>No heavy fragrance.</li>

            <li>I live in Alaska and dry skin is a real problem here.  </li>
            <li>After the first use I combined it half and half with another lotion, because it doesn&#x27;t have much smell to it, but that worked well.</li>
            <li>It keeps my dry skin moist and soft throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It really sunk in quickly &amp; it is not greasy.</li>

            <li> This is a bargain &amp; a half if you like all natural lotions!</li>
            <li> Although it has no added fragrance, at least one of its ingredients (maybe the grapeseed oil) has a faint but pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> , the bad: It&#x27;s very lightweight, so, if you have extremely dry skin, or even normal winter-dry skin, it isn&#x27;t going to be much help.</li>
            <li> Not enough for very dry hands though.</li>
            <li> It keeps my dry skin in check, no scales, no itches, no greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is an old formula or the newer formula.</li>
            <li> I usually apply a small amount of this lotion, to wet skin, and it leaves my skin feeling soft and moist, but not greasy.</li>
            <li> The first few second it feels like you put you hands in dirty mud</li>
            <li> The pumps sometimes poop out after a while, but I empty out every ounce, and even turn the bottle upside down when the time comes!</li>
            <li> My husband has severely dry skin, and hardly any lotion works for him, but this one does.</li>
            <li> When I got it the cap was a little lose and a little bit of lotion had leaked out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  angry at my self for not trying the cream before buying it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This lotion smells really bad</li>

            <li> This is a very nice fragrance free lotion.  It is light and smooth going on and a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion ever. It keeps my dry skin moist and soft throughout the day. It also smells good.</li>
            <li> Organics in the name and you would expect a better for you and the earth product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle never pumped so I have to take the lid off every time I want some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I recently did some research on the brand and will not be buying their stuff again.  I will find another brand that works just as well and is better for you and the environment.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. There is no scent and it nourishes skin. My husband has severely dry skin, and hardly any lotion works for him, but this one does.</li>
            <li> Pump didn&#x27;t work well when opened box.  Unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and not real greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  angry at my self for not trying the cream before buying it.&lt;br /&gt;It dose not smell good and it does feel good. The first few second it feels like you put you hands in dirty mud and then it feels very dry.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Peppermint lotion  from the same company and it was very rich. This one is not.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing with the Peppermint that it has very strong odor  of Peppermint but it is a great treatment for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> More than excellent product very good for all the skins and it can leave your skin smooth and beautiful. Thank you</li>
            <li> I usually apply a small amount of this lotion, to wet skin, and it leaves my skin feeling soft and moist, but not greasy. Although it has no added fragrance, at least one of its ingredients (maybe the grapeseed oil) has a faint but pleasant smell. I would give this lotion 5 stars if I could figure out how to open the pump dispenser. Instead of pumping out what I need, I have to unscrew the cap and use the tube as a dip stick.</li>
            <li> This is a bargain &amp; a half if you like all natural lotions! Very hydrating. It leaves my skin really soft. The moisture lasts a good while. Not tacky at all. Absorbs quickly. Suitable for your face if you have really dry skin, but keep it away from your eyes as it has a tendency to migrate. Great for tattoos after the initial healing stage.&lt;br /&gt;Will def. repurchase!</li>
            <li> To start with the good: this lotion is a very light moisturizer that does not irritate sensitive skin. Absorbs SUPER quickly. Non-greasy. No heavy fragrance. Pump doesn&#x27;t clog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the bad: It&#x27;s very lightweight, so, if you have extremely dry skin, or even normal winter-dry skin, it isn&#x27;t going to be much help. The fragrance free has an odd scent. I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s the grape seed because olives smell nothing like this. ;) It&#x27;s not unpleasant, exactly, just noticeable. If you like a scented lotion, I&#x27;d go with one of their essential oil flavored ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: It&#x27;s a great lotion to have near the sink, to use right after hand washing. Not enough for very dry hands though.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s organic and natural.  Healthy to your body and environment.  Products on the market are toxic to your health and environment.  Many of the ingredients are linked to cancer.  Try Avalon products you won&#x27;t regret.  Value your health.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells really bad I don&#x27;t even know how to describe it&#x27;s smell, I don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone..</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion. It is free of phthalate &amp; paraben-free. It is also organic. This works great on hands &amp; body. I love this product &amp; would buy again &amp; from this manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I high high hopes for this product but on first smell it was clear the essential oils had gone rancid and it was totally unusable.  Amazon refunded my money very promptly and let me just dispose of the product.  Understandably, I&#x27;m reticent to order it again.</li>
            <li> Awesome lotion. I purchased this lotion specifically because I have a friend with chemical/fragrance sensitivities and needed a non-scented lotion. It works very well and makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> When I got it the cap was a little lose and a little bit of lotion had leaked out. However, the product was really good. It&#x27;s 70% organic contains antioxidants, and it made my skin really soft. After the first use I combined it half and half with another lotion, because it doesn&#x27;t have much smell to it, but that worked well.</li>
            <li> Avalon Organics reformulated this line and it now smells more like olive oil than it used to.  I still like their body wash, but the scent of the lotion lingers and I won&#x27;t be buying any more of it when I get through this bottle.  Back to the Body Shop&#x27;s higher end shea butter products I go.  If you don&#x27;t mind the smell, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> GOOD ITEM ,I LOVE IT. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..</li>
            <li> I live in Alaska and dry skin is a real problem here.  My skin has always been very sensitve to cheap or scented lotions.  But I LOVE THIS stuff.  It keeps my dry skin in check, no scales, no itches, no greasy feel.  It soaks in completely after 2 minutes, but doesn&#x27;t stop working.  And and there is no scent, so no rash.  It&#x27;s made with organic ingredients so I feel good about putting it on my skin.  Remember, what goes ON your skin goes IN your skin and into your system, so watch what products you put on your skin and scalp.  This is a great product I endorse whole heartedly.  The pumps sometimes poop out after a while, but I empty out every ounce, and even turn the bottle upside down when the time comes!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is an old formula or the newer formula. I had a bottle that clearly stated &#x27;new with more essential oils&#x27; and it definitely felt different and was more moisturizing than this one. A bit disappointed but still a good product for safe use. .</li>
            <li> This was a gift from my lovely daughter!  It made my hands feel repaired &amp; almost silky!  It really sunk in quickly &amp; it is not greasy.</li>
