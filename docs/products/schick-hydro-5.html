    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This may work for some people, but I don&#x27;t think it was the best format for my face, and may have provided some irritation.</li>
            <li>I am a fusion guy, so when I got a chance to try these Schick Hydro 5 razors, I was really impressed.</li>

            <li>This might be a good razor for shaving legs, but not faces!</li>
            <li>Good item and like to buy another one.i am very happy to see this product.thanks.</li>
            <li>This is a great razor....</li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;ll be happy with quality, lotion, movement, and longevity of this razor.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a Schick disposable user before discovering Fusion proglide, so I had great hopes.</li>
            <li>The blades are great, and you don&#x27;t have to keep shaving over an area.</li>
            <li>it is great for trimming and getting close to the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This razor does a great job and my skin is still happy.</li>
            <li>Kudos to the guys over at Schick for making this great product.</li>
            <li>Best razor, I shave in the shower with just warm water with no problems.</li>
            <li>Great for body hair and shaving &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34</li>
            <li>My husband shaves every day and these are great razors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Mach 3 for probably about 10 years now, and was always happy with it.</li>
            <li>These things are great and leave my face feeling great.  </li>
            <li>And the best part is that I get twice as many shaves with the Hydro Blade as I eve</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many Razors both electric and blade and this one is the best.</li>
            <li>Really good blades.  </li>
            <li>This razor seemed a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its not as good as a braun 3 series shaver</li>
            <li>to be fair).</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have come to conclude that most of the 1 star reviews are incredibly misguided.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Clearly Fusion&#x27;s attachment mechanism is  superior</li>
            <li>This is the best razor available today at any price.</li>
            <li>and now I am a Schick Hydro five user they are just that good</li>
            <li>Shaves as close as the best razor available.</li>
            <li>So this is the cost of good close</li>
            <li>Gives a good shave, but like all main-brand razors, it is radically overpriced.</li>
            <li>Close shave, good value.</li>
            <li>Having been shaving for more years than I would care to count, I can say this shaver is okay at best.</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to my place in the Eternal Magic Kingdom of Love for those whose Hearts remained Faithfeel to the Gospel of XOXOXO Sermons of the Greatest Teacher that ever Told!</li>
            <li>The shave was comparable to what I had previously experienced but at a much more affordable price.</li>
            <li>Am I glad I eve did!</li>
            <li>I love this razor!</li>
            <li>It is the bet and most Wonderfeel shave on my super-tuff curly-cow-licked bearded face ever!</li>
            <li>The handle is very smooth and well finished, but that means that you don&#x27;t get a good grip.</li>
            <li>My face is baby smooth with a great shaving experience.</li>
            <li>Having tried the Schick Hydro 5 was amazing.  </li>
            <li>flip trimmer is effective at trimming sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Nice product, but</li>
            <li>For in the end, the Schick was EQUALLY effective at shaving close under the nose, and trimming the sideburns \\&quot;evenly\\&quot; with its flip-down assembly.</li>
            <li>(though I&#x27;m sure they are all equally as good).</li>
            <li>I can say that it truly does a nice job</li>
            <li>The Schick Hydro 5 had a good feel to the handle, had some weight to it, love the flex (motion) of the head, as well as the attachment method</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice close shave with some gimmicks.</li>
            <li>A nice close shave with no razor burn.  </li>
            <li>It delivers a nice close shave with no burn.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been my first experience with Shick, and I am very delighted.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy having great razors and these are way better than any I have ever had before.</li>
            <li>Cost was fantastic, good value.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, I love the Fusion Proglide.</li>
            <li>I truly find myself shaving more often with these razor&#x27;s than I ever have, and am loving it.</li>
            <li>Excellent performance in every respect except for one major flaw!  </li>
            <li>So in conclusion I say ladies (and gents) if you&#x27;re looking for a great razor for a great price look no further!</li>
            <li>The shave is pretty good, not as good as the proglide, but good enough that I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>But its very comfortable nevertheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it was very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I like it much better than the Gillette razors.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT :)</li>
            <li>Hope this review helped, feel free to comment! :)</li>
            <li>It costs 6 bucks to try the Hydro 5 and in my opinion most people will be glad they did.</li>
            <li>the price on Amazon was better than retail stores.</li>
            <li>The Fusion is a much better option.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The blades and shaver are also *cheaper than Gillettes but of *way better quality.</li>
            <li>The way it does this is by its supposed \\&quot;skin guards\\&quot; in between the razors and this ooey-gooey gel thing on the top of the razor.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m done shaving, most of the hair is gone and I&#x27;ve got a slimy gel coating on my face.</li>
            <li>I find it to be better than the Venus (which I had been using for years).</li>
            <li>Much better than Fusion.</li>
            <li>I love the item.i am agre to buy the item.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>I have used disposables for years.... and replacement style for many years before that.</li>
            <li>Overall this has been the best experience considering the performance and value of the product.  </li>
            <li>For many years I have been in love with Schick Quattro, both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li>I thought I couldn&#x27;t get a better, closer, smoother shave...</li>
            <li>and I love the moisturizing product on the blade head.</li>
            <li>Each blade lasts through many shaves..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Schick did provide a lubricant bar attached to the top of each blade.</li>
            <li>It seems like the more blades you have these days, the better.  </li>
            <li>but boy am I glad I did.</li>
            <li>Although this razor is marketed towards men, I love it as a ladies razor.  </li>
            <li>better shave than Gillette .</li>
            <li>With Gillette blades going higher and higher in price, This seems to be the best option in terms of cartridge razors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the combination of the two does the trick.</li>
            <li>I use it to shave my legs and with ONE PASS it shaves them smooth and silky!</li>
            <li>Save me a lot of time :)</li>
            <li>The Yuck Factor is really overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I love the cheapness and life of this blade.</li>
            <li>Love it i have bought 2 already</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in love.  </li>
            <li>Love the razors and design.</li>
            <li>The Schick is good for one blade, for me, about once every 8-days, so as good or better than the old Sensor 2).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>gives me a better shave &amp;#34;I</li>
            <li>Love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>My second best all time razor, for me the 3 blade version is a bit better.</li>
            <li>Way better than the quattro</li>
            <li>I have been a sensor user for many years, anything more than 2 blades seemed to make me break out and have to deal with razor burn.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get twice as many shaves that way.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to do that with any others.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s OK for the deal I got</li>
            <li>so I figured there&#x27;s no harm in trying it out, and I am glad</li>
            <li>blade top has a swivel feature so it will conform to any curves or crevices of the areas you wish to shave.  </li>
            <li>It was much better shave then the Gillette.  </li>
            <li>love the razor but</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed these razors and my wife has even used them a couple of times and she likes them also.  </li>
            <li>Need I say more.</li>
            <li>It swivels nicely and was a very quick, easy, and thorough shave.</li>
            <li>The Shick Hydro 5 Razor survives my strong beard and I have been able to shave with it more than 5, 6 times.</li>
            <li>This is true, the shave feels amazing.</li>
            <li>Great little razor at a great price.  </li>
            <li>great product true to description very fast shipping</li>
            <li>So, I asked my wife to go find a good solid razor, at a good price, and bring it in for me to try.  </li>
            <li>Up until that point every shave was smooth and enjoyable.   </li>
            <li>I have found that I enjoy shaving a lot more than I used to since I began using the Schick Hydro 5.  </li>
            <li>I recently bought this after seeing great reviews about more comfort, better shave, and being cheaper.</li>
            <li>I used it and have been in love since then, it shaves so close to my skin and leaves my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This has to be one of the most comfortable shaves ever.  </li>
            <li>you have easily irritated skin, try this razor.</li>
            <li>The heads pop off the handle too easily</li>
            <li>I am going 3 weeks strong with one razor.</li>
            <li>It gave me a smooth clean shave on my legs easily :).</li>
            <li>This is a really smooth feeling razor.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable grip.</li>
            <li>CHEAP.    </li>
            <li>Fabulous razor, and</li>
            <li>Getting a close and smooth shave is sometimes important to a man.  </li>
            <li>Great razor that last for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t compare the it shave quality as I can&#x27;t justify spending on Gillette unless they give it to me free to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But in order to get my Amazon order over $25 for the free shipping, I decided to buy this 5-bladed razor and two packs of blades.    </li>
            <li>I got this free as part of a sponsored program but don&#x27;t let that make you think my review isn&#x27;t genuine.  </li>
            <li>Smooth shave with no irretation.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even used some of the blades for my legs and they have never been so smooth.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a close comfortable shave, buy this product.</li>
            <li>Been using Gillette for years and then received one of these guys in the mail for free and decided to try.</li>
            <li>The shave was smooth and seemed to shave quite close.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also got it for free from Schick hydo .&lt;br</li>
            <li>; that it comes with locks in rather cheaply...</li>
            <li>It provides a clean comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>Great price and quick delivery on a solid razor.</li>
            <li>I am pretty satisfied with this razor.</li>
            <li>I recently bought this razor and had the best shave I ever had, left my skin feeling better than it did before my shave.</li>
            <li>did with the Fusion so blade, so I have reduced my monthly shaving costs by 75% a month (a significant $35),</li>
            <li>Great razor...used Gillett for a long time but price was getting out of hand.</li>
            <li>This razor is a significantly cheaper alternative to the Gillette Fusion Razor.</li>
            <li>It cuts stubb with one pass that Gillette Fusion requires two or three or even four passes to draw up and cut clean.</li>
            <li>I love this razor and I own three of them for various reasons</li>
            <li>now im clean shaven</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly, and gives a nice shave, better than many of the other brand name, multi-blade razors.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The \\&quot;Schick Hydro 5\\&quot; claims to be a special razor.  </li>
            <li>It just GLIDED right over my face, picking up every hair!</li>
            <li>fun isn&#x27;t exactly the word, but it made the experience better.</li>
            <li>great razor as expected.</li>
            <li>lube lasts for many shaves and feels like real aloe.&lt;br</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say that this razor is really any better than the Gillette Fusion.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, me being a \\&quot;hi-tech guy\\&quot;, the AAA-powered vibrator of the Gillette was indeed a cool feature to have...</li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary, this is not a bad razor, but I prefer the Gillette Fusion for now.</li>
            <li>Best shaved I have ever used this product is the first one I can say for sure that it will save you money and is going to last for a long time.</li>
            <li>I give this razor two stars because it does give a pretty clean, comfortable shave, but I will not buy another one.</li>
            <li>The shave is clean, smooth, pain-free and fast!</li>
            <li>I may remove a star IF I have to throw the blade out too quickly, but I doubt that will happen.</li>
            <li>but it quickly evens out over the life of the cartridge.  </li>
            <li>It definitely gives the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had, however the blades barely last a week and the refills are super-expensive.</li>
            <li>If it can change a loyal 15-year Gillette user like myself, perhaps it can change you as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find that the gel wears out quickly.</li>
            <li>No nicks or cuts and still gives a super shave.</li>
            <li>The 5 blade lubricated system is smooth and gets very close!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on my first one for over a month now and the refills are cheap</li>
            <li>I have been using the Shick Hydro 5 Razor since it first became available.  </li>
            <li>It may sound strange, but it&#x27;s quite nice to have to take my time</li>
            <li>vibrator &amp; convenient 6th blade were nice features to have, but they were just not enough to keep me loyal to Gillette.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like using 5 incredible sharp, large blades to shave with because that&#x27;s exactly what Schick Hydro 5 is.</li>
            <li>razor shaved my neck clean on the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Sometimes I think the blade is not cutting at all.</li>
            <li>I have to say, the additional cost is worth it for Hydro 5.</li>
            <li>the Schick Hydro-5 gave me a more comfortable shave, had longer lasting blades, and came at a lower price for the replacement cartridges.  </li>
            <li>a quick disclaimer, I use Edge Gel shaving cream, and always hot-shower first to soften my beard.</li>
            <li>We are talking a Grade A shave right out of the box.</li>
            <li>right?  </li>
            <li>anyway, I thoroughly rinsed right away to remove all the slime (and it took a bit of rinsing to do so).</li>
            <li>Exactly the opposite is true: the blade are so sharp that it takes incredible care when shaving with this razor.  </li>
            <li>All this not only resulted in a much more comfortable shave vs. the Gillette Fusion, but the cartridges lasted much longer as well.</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed was that it almost felt as though it wasn&#x27;t doing anything because of how smoothly it glided, but in just one or two passes, my face was completely smooth -- not a single bit of stubble remaining.&lt;br</li>
            <li>all that said however, I definitely DID miss Gillette&#x27;s nice \\&quot;6th blade\\&quot;, which is located on the very top of the razor for shaving hard-to-reach places, such as directly under the nose</li>
            <li>Definitely 5 stars based on the pros vs. my previous shaver which are, more affordable system (blades and shaver), better performance and seemingly better quality.</li>
            <li>Definitely 5 stars based on the pros vs. my previous shaver which are, more affordable system (blades and shaver), better performance and seemingly better quality.</li>
            <li>I used this razor for several months after getting two for free while on a cruise (they were provided for free in our cabin).</li>
            <li>These are comfortable to use and give such a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>so many of the others with many blades get dull quickly.....</li>
            <li>Therefore, I will definitely be using the much more preferred Schick Hydro-5 for my shaving needs from now on...and for only around $5 with free shipping (was $4.95 with free shipping at the time of this review)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper to replace the heads and a lot more comfortable than other leading brands.</li>
            <li>The Schick Hydro is a great option to use other than my old mach 3.  </li>
            <li>Overall: much better than buying a dozen Bic razors.</li>
            <li>First the lubricant on the Hydro 5 made shaving feel like there wasn&#x27;t any blades.</li>
            <li>After about two weeks I wore out the first blade which was about what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Sorry for all the exclamation points, but this product is truly this great!</li>
            <li>: This is my first non-electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think that many of those 1 star reviews are totally backwards.  </li>
            <li>After using Mach three blades for many years, I decided to take the plunge and try one of these multiple blade razors.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First it is no where near a maneuverable or comfortable against the contours of the face .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This razor is great if you want that late 80s</li>
            <li>, I decided to finally try Schick and their latest Hydro-5 razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can only imagine that it will make this \\&quot;standard\\&quot; Hydro-5 razor even better.</li>
            <li>A shave with this razor loeaves my skin baby soft and brazor burn pain free.</li>
            <li>This razor works almost as good as the Gillette Fusion razor but is harder to use for for any detailed facial hair grooming.</li>
            <li>;, so for those wondering, they ARE made in the US, Connecticut to be exact.sclaimer, I use Edge Gel shaving cream, and always hot-shower first to soften my beard.</li>
            <li>;, so for those wondering, they ARE made in the US, Connecticut to be exact.</li>
            <li>First the lubricant on the Hydro 5 made shaving feel like there wasn&#x27;t any blades.</li>
            <li>Yes, you&#x27;ll probably go over a couple times but with one swipe on a fresh blade you really feel the smoothness of this.  </li>
            <li>These are good at this price but it is not comfortable as Gillette 5 blade saving system</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much, but was very surprised about how smooth the shave was.</li>
            <li>i recived this from bzzagent.com  and its amazing simple to use simple to handle simple to shave simpleuly amazing .</li>
            <li>The lubricant and blades on this razor are so good that when shaving a second time against the grain no further shave gel is required.</li>
            <li>This turned out to be one of those decisions I wish I had made much sooner and many dollars earlier.</li>
            <li>The lubricant and blades on this razor are so good that when shaving a second time against the grain no further shave gel is required.</li>
            <li>As long as you avoid touching your face until it dries there shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.     </li>
            <li>I learned a long time ago that men&#x27;s razors were always better than the ones for women.&lt;br /&gt;Legs</li>
            <li>After using this gel just once, I immediately noticed that it was of a much better quality, and that I would never again be going back to buying the other \\&quot;standard\\&quot; store-bought brands of \\&quot;Gillette\\&quot; and \\&quot;Edge\\&quot;, (BOTH of which I had been using for many years).  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty smooth, on a blade that will last you 2 months</li>
            <li>This is not possible with the hydro as the blade will poop out easily every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(maybe if you aren&#x27;t &#x27;bush-hogging a forest&#x27;, it might stay on, but didn&#x27;t work for me), and the blades dulled far too quickly.  </li>
            <li>Very maneuverable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Words can&#x27;t really express how night and day the 2 blades feel.</li>
            <li>They were smooth like the fusion, but the big thing was they lasted a lot longer than the fusion blades.</li>
            <li>I had to buy these because the Gillette Fusion&#x27;s razors were costing me too much and were in no way durable.</li>
            <li>As for the gel, it really helps in the smoothness</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically, if you REALLY need a smoother and gentler shave for your skin without worrying about getting that close shave, go with the Schick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is much cheaper than equivalent Gillette(proglide?)</li>
            <li>Fast forward to 2014</li>
            <li>I received this product free for review, overall it&#x27;s an alright product.</li>
            <li>This razor was much smoother and closer.</li>
            <li>Replacement blades are MUCH cheaper.</li>
            <li>but the Hydro stuff wears out fast - buy another product without the hype of the Hydro.</li>
            <li>I guess you don&#x27;t really need anything too fancy.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care so much about the elegance of the housing of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In my case, this razor gave me much closer shave</li>
            <li>Since it doesn&#x27;t affect my shave negatively, this is a good thing.</li>
            <li>Slowly the shaver lost its ability to give a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far with the Hydro 5, the hairs wash right out effortlessly</li>
            <li>The blades can get pricey, but if you&#x27;ve got a hot date and want to look your best then break this bad boy out.  </li>
            <li>received the Fusion proshild as a free promotion and it was by far the most costly per shave and the most disappointing .</li>
            <li>Buy this one it is as good as fusion and a lot less overall in price</li>
            <li>When I shave against the grain, my skin is never completely silky smooth.</li>
            <li>not sure how long the cartridge will last but very happy with this purchase. .</li>
            <li>Nice close shave with no more burn.  </li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s more show and less function.</li>
            <li>With Gillette it seems nowadays you&#x27;re essentially paying for the brand image more so than the actual product.</li>
            <li>I may remove a star IF I have to throw the blade out too quickly, but I doubt that will happen.ease a shaver with a battery packed gimmick as well, if only to serve my missed placebo effect.    </li>
            <li>One issue with this particular package is that it doesn&#x27;t include a holder for the razor.  </li>
            <li>Still, it dries off in a decent amount of time if you leave it alone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shave with Gillete for years, but the blades were getting more and more expensive</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend doing this.</li>
            <li>highly recommend the Schick Hydro 5.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend doing this.</li>
            <li>you are not constantly replacing it, it does not dull quickly.</li>
            <li>so it seems the mechanism has the blades spaced a little better in terms of cleanup.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t purchased it yet, but I will eventually...for I really did like the vibrating feature on my old Gillette razor.  </li>
            <li>These Hydro 5 razors are not cheap, but they do the job well...much better than the 3 and 4 bladed razors from Schick/Bic/Wilkinson.</li>
            <li>Normally (even with some othe high-end razors)</li>
            <li>The head of the Schick Hydro 5 is quite large, so it requires some care, but the blades are so sharp that going over any curve on my face (e.g. over my chin) requires special care.  </li>
            <li>The head of the Schick Hydro 5 is quite large, so it requires some care, but the blades are so sharp that going over any curve on my face (e.g. over my chin) requires special care.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like using 5 incredible sharp, large blades to shave with because that&#x27;s exactly what Schick Hydro 5 is.blade&#x27; have it totally wrong.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product because you get 90% of the performance for less than half of the price!</li>
            <li>Pros: Sharp comfortable blades.</li>
            <li>No need to try the new ones with three, four, or five blades ...</li>
            <li>After reading up a bit, I found out that it takes a while to get used to a new razor when you switch.</li>
            <li>I also learned about a new trick to prolong the life of razor blades by keeping them soaked in Baby oil before and after shaving.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving by head bald roughly two to three times a week for the better part of the last 9+ years (since enlisting in the Marine Corps).</li>
            <li>Even on fresh stubble, this blade still makes it feel like a fresh shave after a few days of growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I was very surprised.</li>
            <li>have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The Schick doesn&#x27;t have the additional \\&quot;Precision Trimmer\\&quot; on the back, like the Fusion does, but I don&#x27;t really think that it is that big of a deal, as I rarely use the one on my Fusion</li>
            <li>Works OK, but I actually prefer the disposable razors that I&#x27;d been using previously.  </li>
            <li>And the extra large lubrication strip?</li>
            <li>have to be clean shaven for work&amp;#34;  and the blades easily last twice as long as the Gillete blades did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>My legs are left super soft and smooth with the closest shave that I&#x27;ve ever had with any other razor, minus the irritation, top that off with my pockets still having a little somethin somethin left over to spend</li>
            <li>I can only imagine that it will make this \\&quot;standard\\&quot; Hydro-5 razor even better.rchased it yet, but I will eventually...for I really did like the vibrating feature on my old Gillette razor.  </li>
            <li>So I will adjust my perception and adjust to it; partially because it&#x27;s a good thing, not something bad, and partially because everything else about this razor is so incredibly good.</li>
            <li>There is no way to conveniently closely shave the hairs directly under the nostrils.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care what my razor looks like as long as it gets the job done, and that&#x27;s EXACTLY what the Schick Hydro 5 does for me</li>
            <li>looked at the reviews on Amazon and was surprised to see all the one star reviews.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Second the design does not let you close nose- lip intersection or provide precision near the sideburns .</li>
            <li>this razor handle is much better quality than the disposable holder but the actual blades seem similar, they last about the same time</li>
            <li>I would re combed this to anyone who has sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This has honestly never happened before, and though I am not 100% sure its the razor, I have a hunch that it is.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and always have issues with irritation - until now.</li>
            <li>I have always had to use sensitive skin gel to try and avoid razor burn with my old razor</li>
            <li>Almost as good as Gillette, but for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li>the LEFT is the \\&quot;Schick Hydro-5\\&quot;, on the RIGHT is the standard \\&quot;Gillette Fusion-5\\&quot; (not the Pro-glide version).</li>
            <li>However, just as a minor \\&quot;inconvenience factor\\&quot;, it is still worthy enough to give the Schick Hydro a 1/2 Star deduction here, which \\&quot;officially\\&quot; makes this review a 4.5 Star review (not a 4.0 Star review as displayed</li>
            <li>The gel is a little much when you first use it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having said all that, I don&#x27;t particularly have a lot of facial hair that needs shaving.  </li>
            <li>I finally tried the Schick because of the extremely high cost of Gillette blades.</li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion blades are so close together, my hair gets stuck in the mechanism and the amount of washing and beating it would take to remove them, well, can&#x27;t blame the blades for becoming dull and the lubricant for washing away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: As of April/2012, Schick now offers a new 3-speed \\&quot;vibrating\\&quot; version of the above Hydro-5, called the \\&quot;Schick Hydro Power Select\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>But finding a cheaper product with a better quality build is not a good thing on Gillette&#x27;s behalf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(The part that flips back is the dark blue top lubricating strip with the white dots).</li>
            <li>/&gt;The big detractor for me (which some people may like) was that while new, the blades on the Schick leave a slimy residue on your face after shaving.</li>
            <li>Since the lubricant is water activated I rinse the blade on every other pass and of course before shaving the first time.</li>
            <li>Maybe it takes longer to get used to, but no other razor has.  </li>
            <li>Since the lubricant is water activated I rinse the blade on every other pass and of course before shaving the first time.</li>
            <li>shave is smoother, the blades last longer, I get less irritation on my scalp, I enjoy the feeling of the razor handle itself, AND it&#x27;s actually less expensive than the Fusion!&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to the guys over at Schick for making this great product.</li>
            <li>Schick&#x27;s solution to this is a bit awkward, which involves manually flipping down backwards the top plastic assembly for closer exposure to the top blade.</li>
            <li>Apparently, I have become used to the 6th blade for shaving under my nose.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I have to go over some tricky spots various times before I can completely get rid of the hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using twin blade generic razors for years with complete satisfaction.  </li>
            <li>A lot cheaper than Mach3 blades but nowhere near the same quality, durability and sharpness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used countless types of blades and razors and this by far trumps all.</li>
            <li>The Fusion is nice, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but this feels nicer</li>
            <li>This razor is better than the Fusion on my face, but it&#x27;s worse the the Fusion on my head.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice product, but I am skeptical.</li>
            <li>Prior to using this razor I always had to replace my razor blades because my strong beard made them dull after two or three shaves.</li>
            <li>I have been a loyal Gillette customer for many years and was shocked when I tried the Schick Hydro 5.</li>
            <li>Shaving with the Schick Hydro 5 is exactly like scraping 5 very sharp razor blades over one&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li>Since the 1980&#x27;s, I really had stayed with one single razor, the Gillette Sensor, actually.  </li>
            <li>They are not only thicker, deeper, &amp; slightly longer, but they are also more openly-spaced for less \\&quot;blockage\\&quot; of shaving cream &amp; hair while shaving.</li>
            <li>Yet curiously, the lower quality Gillette blades are still more expensive than the higher quality Schick blades...</li>
            <li>After using it, I can report that I got a close shave on the first use without any of the traditional cuts I expected when going back to a razor.  </li>
            <li>First off I want to start by saying that I&#x27;m a girl, a girl who&#x27;s sick of girly razors that do nothing more than look pretty and empty my pockets.</li>
            <li>The disposables I am used to get the job done easily, but this blade does seem to get the job done a little faster and with slightly less effort.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps if Gillette invested as much money into the &#x27;actual product&#x27; as they do on their very excessive advertising, they might actually have a higher quality razor to offer consumers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it made any sort of difference, but for some reason it made shaving a little more, I don&#x27;t know...</li>
            <li>Though NIVEA currently makes about 5 different varieties, the only one I have tried and can vouch for is the \\&quot;NIVEA Double Action Q10 Revitalizing Shaving Gel\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Although I usually shave at the sink and then don&#x27;t bother to rinse because I&#x27;m going to get right in the shower</li>
            <li>this wouldn&#x27;t have been that big of an issue, as I could just rinse it off my face right away (although that would negate any benefit from the soothing balm stuff) - but the few times that I touched up my shave outside of the shower, this gel stuff was bothersome enough that I did not opt to purchase replacement cartridges for this razor once mine wore out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price of the blades just keeps going higher and higher, too high for my meager budget</li>
            <li>so I thought I would try out this Schick razor because the blades cost only about half as much as Gillette&#x27;s Fusion blades.</li>
            <li>I wanted try to find something less expensive but good.  </li>
            <li>The Fusion is also very sharp and the main advantage I&#x27;ve found is that I don&#x27;t have to be quite so cautious with the Gillette Fusion.  </li>
            <li>But after being somewhat disappointed in their newest AAA-powered Gillette Fusion-5, (not only was the price for the replacement cartridges high, but I experienced noticeably duller blades after only a few shaves)</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> This may work for some people, but I don&#x27;t think it was the best format for my face, and may have provided some irritation.</li>
            <li> I am a fusion guy, so when I got a chance to try these Schick Hydro 5 razors, I was really impressed.</li>

            <li> then you will know for yourself just how good this razor is!</li>
            <li> This might be a good razor for shaving legs, but not faces!</li>
            <li> Good item and like to buy another one.i am very happy to see this product.thanks.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor....</li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;ll be happy with quality, lotion, movement, and longevity of this razor.</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a Schick disposable user before discovering Fusion proglide, so I had great hopes.</li>
            <li> The blades are great, and you don&#x27;t have to keep shaving over an area.</li>
            <li> it is great for trimming and getting close to the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor does a great job and my skin is still happy.</li>
            <li> Kudos to the guys over at Schick for making this great product.</li>
            <li> Best razor, I shave in the shower with just warm water with no problems.</li>
            <li> Great for body hair and shaving &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34</li>
            <li> My husband shaves every day and these are great razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Mach 3 for probably about 10 years now, and was always happy with it.</li>
            <li> These things are great and leave my face feeling great.  </li>
            <li> And the best part is that I get twice as many shaves with the Hydro Blade as I eve</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many Razors both electric and blade and this one is the best.</li>
            <li> Really good blades.  </li>
            <li> This razor seemed a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its not as good as a braun 3 series shaver</li>
            <li> to be fair).</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have come to conclude that most of the 1 star reviews are incredibly misguided.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Clearly Fusion&#x27;s attachment mechanism is  superior</li>
            <li> This is the best razor available today at any price.</li>
            <li> and now I am a Schick Hydro five user they are just that good</li>
            <li> Shaves as close as the best razor available.</li>
            <li> So this is the cost of good close</li>
            <li> Gives a good shave, but like all main-brand razors, it is radically overpriced.</li>
            <li> Close shave, good value.</li>
            <li> Having been shaving for more years than I would care to count, I can say this shaver is okay at best.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to my place in the Eternal Magic Kingdom of Love for those whose Hearts remained Faithfeel to the Gospel of XOXOXO Sermons of the Greatest Teacher that ever Told!</li>
            <li> The shave was comparable to what I had previously experienced but at a much more affordable price.</li>
            <li> Am I glad I eve did!</li>
            <li> I love this razor!</li>
            <li> It is the bet and most Wonderfeel shave on my super-tuff curly-cow-licked bearded face ever!</li>
            <li> The handle is very smooth and well finished, but that means that you don&#x27;t get a good grip.</li>
            <li> My face is baby smooth with a great shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Having tried the Schick Hydro 5 was amazing.  </li>
            <li> flip trimmer is effective at trimming sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Nice product, but</li>
            <li> For in the end, the Schick was EQUALLY effective at shaving close under the nose, and trimming the sideburns \\&quot;evenly\\&quot; with its flip-down assembly.</li>
            <li> (though I&#x27;m sure they are all equally as good).</li>
            <li> I can say that it truly does a nice job</li>
            <li> The Schick Hydro 5 had a good feel to the handle, had some weight to it, love the flex (motion) of the head, as well as the attachment method</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice close shave with some gimmicks.</li>
            <li> A nice close shave with no razor burn.  </li>
            <li> It delivers a nice close shave with no burn.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been my first experience with Shick, and I am very delighted.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy having great razors and these are way better than any I have ever had before.</li>
            <li> Cost was fantastic, good value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I love the Fusion Proglide.</li>
            <li> I truly find myself shaving more often with these razor&#x27;s than I ever have, and am loving it.</li>
            <li> Excellent performance in every respect except for one major flaw!  </li>
            <li> So in conclusion I say ladies (and gents) if you&#x27;re looking for a great razor for a great price look no further!</li>
            <li> The shave is pretty good, not as good as the proglide, but good enough that I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> But its very comfortable nevertheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it was very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I like it much better than the Gillette razors.  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT :)</li>
            <li> Hope this review helped, feel free to comment! :)</li>
            <li> It costs 6 bucks to try the Hydro 5 and in my opinion most people will be glad they did.</li>
            <li> the price on Amazon was better than retail stores.</li>
            <li> The Fusion is a much better option.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades and shaver are also *cheaper than Gillettes but of *way better quality.</li>
            <li> The way it does this is by its supposed \\&quot;skin guards\\&quot; in between the razors and this ooey-gooey gel thing on the top of the razor.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m done shaving, most of the hair is gone and I&#x27;ve got a slimy gel coating on my face.</li>
            <li> I find it to be better than the Venus (which I had been using for years).</li>
            <li> Much better than Fusion.</li>
            <li> I love the item.i am agre to buy the item.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> I have used disposables for years.... and replacement style for many years before that.</li>
            <li> Overall this has been the best experience considering the performance and value of the product.  </li>
            <li> For many years I have been in love with Schick Quattro, both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li> I thought I couldn&#x27;t get a better, closer, smoother shave...</li>
            <li> and I love the moisturizing product on the blade head.</li>
            <li> Each blade lasts through many shaves..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Schick did provide a lubricant bar attached to the top of each blade.</li>
            <li> It seems like the more blades you have these days, the better.  </li>
            <li> but boy am I glad I did.</li>
            <li> Although this razor is marketed towards men, I love it as a ladies razor.  </li>
            <li> better shave than Gillette .</li>
            <li> With Gillette blades going higher and higher in price, This seems to be the best option in terms of cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the combination of the two does the trick.</li>
            <li> I use it to shave my legs and with ONE PASS it shaves them smooth and silky!</li>
            <li> Save me a lot of time :)</li>
            <li> The Yuck Factor is really overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> I love the cheapness and life of this blade.</li>
            <li> Love it i have bought 2 already</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in love.  </li>
            <li> Love the razors and design.</li>
            <li> The Schick is good for one blade, for me, about once every 8-days, so as good or better than the old Sensor 2).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> gives me a better shave &amp;#34;I</li>
            <li> Love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> My second best all time razor, for me the 3 blade version is a bit better.</li>
            <li> Way better than the quattro</li>
            <li> I have been a sensor user for many years, anything more than 2 blades seemed to make me break out and have to deal with razor burn.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get twice as many shaves that way.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to do that with any others.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s OK for the deal I got</li>
            <li> so I figured there&#x27;s no harm in trying it out, and I am glad</li>
            <li> blade top has a swivel feature so it will conform to any curves or crevices of the areas you wish to shave.  </li>
            <li> It was much better shave then the Gillette.  </li>
            <li> love the razor but</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed these razors and my wife has even used them a couple of times and she likes them also.  </li>
            <li> Need I say more.</li>
            <li> It swivels nicely and was a very quick, easy, and thorough shave.</li>
            <li> The Shick Hydro 5 Razor survives my strong beard and I have been able to shave with it more than 5, 6 times.</li>
            <li> This is true, the shave feels amazing.</li>
            <li> Great little razor at a great price.  </li>
            <li> great product true to description very fast shipping</li>
            <li> So, I asked my wife to go find a good solid razor, at a good price, and bring it in for me to try.  </li>
            <li> Up until that point every shave was smooth and enjoyable.   </li>
            <li> I have found that I enjoy shaving a lot more than I used to since I began using the Schick Hydro 5.  </li>
            <li> I recently bought this after seeing great reviews about more comfort, better shave, and being cheaper.</li>
            <li> I used it and have been in love since then, it shaves so close to my skin and leaves my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has to be one of the most comfortable shaves ever.  </li>
            <li> you have easily irritated skin, try this razor.</li>
            <li> The heads pop off the handle too easily</li>
            <li> I am going 3 weeks strong with one razor.</li>
            <li> It gave me a smooth clean shave on my legs easily :).</li>
            <li> This is a really smooth feeling razor.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable grip.</li>
            <li> CHEAP.    </li>
            <li> Fabulous razor, and</li>
            <li> Getting a close and smooth shave is sometimes important to a man.  </li>
            <li> Great razor that last for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t compare the it shave quality as I can&#x27;t justify spending on Gillette unless they give it to me free to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But in order to get my Amazon order over $25 for the free shipping, I decided to buy this 5-bladed razor and two packs of blades.    </li>
            <li> I got this free as part of a sponsored program but don&#x27;t let that make you think my review isn&#x27;t genuine.  </li>
            <li> Smooth shave with no irretation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even used some of the blades for my legs and they have never been so smooth.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a close comfortable shave, buy this product.</li>
            <li> Been using Gillette for years and then received one of these guys in the mail for free and decided to try.</li>
            <li> The shave was smooth and seemed to shave quite close.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also got it for free from Schick hydo .&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; that it comes with locks in rather cheaply...</li>
            <li> It provides a clean comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> Great price and quick delivery on a solid razor.</li>
            <li> I am pretty satisfied with this razor.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this razor and had the best shave I ever had, left my skin feeling better than it did before my shave.</li>
            <li> did with the Fusion so blade, so I have reduced my monthly shaving costs by 75% a month (a significant $35),</li>
            <li> Great razor...used Gillett for a long time but price was getting out of hand.</li>
            <li> This razor is a significantly cheaper alternative to the Gillette Fusion Razor.</li>
            <li> It cuts stubb with one pass that Gillette Fusion requires two or three or even four passes to draw up and cut clean.</li>
            <li> I love this razor and I own three of them for various reasons</li>
            <li> now im clean shaven</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, and gives a nice shave, better than many of the other brand name, multi-blade razors.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The \\&quot;Schick Hydro 5\\&quot; claims to be a special razor.  </li>
            <li> It just GLIDED right over my face, picking up every hair!</li>
            <li> fun isn&#x27;t exactly the word, but it made the experience better.</li>
            <li> great razor as expected.</li>
            <li> lube lasts for many shaves and feels like real aloe.&lt;br</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say that this razor is really any better than the Gillette Fusion.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, me being a \\&quot;hi-tech guy\\&quot;, the AAA-powered vibrator of the Gillette was indeed a cool feature to have...</li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary, this is not a bad razor, but I prefer the Gillette Fusion for now.</li>
            <li> Best shaved I have ever used this product is the first one I can say for sure that it will save you money and is going to last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I give this razor two stars because it does give a pretty clean, comfortable shave, but I will not buy another one.</li>
            <li> The shave is clean, smooth, pain-free and fast!</li>
            <li> I may remove a star IF I have to throw the blade out too quickly, but I doubt that will happen.</li>
            <li> but it quickly evens out over the life of the cartridge.  </li>
            <li> It definitely gives the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had, however the blades barely last a week and the refills are super-expensive.</li>
            <li> If it can change a loyal 15-year Gillette user like myself, perhaps it can change you as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find that the gel wears out quickly.</li>
            <li> No nicks or cuts and still gives a super shave.</li>
            <li> The 5 blade lubricated system is smooth and gets very close!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on my first one for over a month now and the refills are cheap</li>
            <li> I have been using the Shick Hydro 5 Razor since it first became available.  </li>
            <li> It may sound strange, but it&#x27;s quite nice to have to take my time</li>
            <li> vibrator &amp; convenient 6th blade were nice features to have, but they were just not enough to keep me loyal to Gillette.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like using 5 incredible sharp, large blades to shave with because that&#x27;s exactly what Schick Hydro 5 is.</li>
            <li> razor shaved my neck clean on the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Sometimes I think the blade is not cutting at all.</li>
            <li> I have to say, the additional cost is worth it for Hydro 5.</li>
            <li> the Schick Hydro-5 gave me a more comfortable shave, had longer lasting blades, and came at a lower price for the replacement cartridges.  </li>
            <li> a quick disclaimer, I use Edge Gel shaving cream, and always hot-shower first to soften my beard.</li>
            <li> We are talking a Grade A shave right out of the box.</li>
            <li> right?  </li>
            <li> anyway, I thoroughly rinsed right away to remove all the slime (and it took a bit of rinsing to do so).</li>
            <li> Exactly the opposite is true: the blade are so sharp that it takes incredible care when shaving with this razor.  </li>
            <li> All this not only resulted in a much more comfortable shave vs. the Gillette Fusion, but the cartridges lasted much longer as well.</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed was that it almost felt as though it wasn&#x27;t doing anything because of how smoothly it glided, but in just one or two passes, my face was completely smooth -- not a single bit of stubble remaining.&lt;br</li>
            <li> all that said however, I definitely DID miss Gillette&#x27;s nice \\&quot;6th blade\\&quot;, which is located on the very top of the razor for shaving hard-to-reach places, such as directly under the nose</li>
            <li> Definitely 5 stars based on the pros vs. my previous shaver which are, more affordable system (blades and shaver), better performance and seemingly better quality.</li>
            <li> Definitely 5 stars based on the pros vs. my previous shaver which are, more affordable system (blades and shaver), better performance and seemingly better quality.</li>
            <li> I used this razor for several months after getting two for free while on a cruise (they were provided for free in our cabin).</li>
            <li> These are comfortable to use and give such a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> so many of the others with many blades get dull quickly.....</li>
            <li> Therefore, I will definitely be using the much more preferred Schick Hydro-5 for my shaving needs from now on...and for only around $5 with free shipping (was $4.95 with free shipping at the time of this review)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper to replace the heads and a lot more comfortable than other leading brands.</li>
            <li> The Schick Hydro is a great option to use other than my old mach 3.  </li>
            <li> Overall: much better than buying a dozen Bic razors.</li>
            <li> First the lubricant on the Hydro 5 made shaving feel like there wasn&#x27;t any blades.</li>
            <li> After about two weeks I wore out the first blade which was about what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Sorry for all the exclamation points, but this product is truly this great!</li>
            <li> : This is my first non-electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think that many of those 1 star reviews are totally backwards.  </li>
            <li> After using Mach three blades for many years, I decided to take the plunge and try one of these multiple blade razors.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First it is no where near a maneuverable or comfortable against the contours of the face .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor is great if you want that late 80s</li>
            <li> , I decided to finally try Schick and their latest Hydro-5 razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can only imagine that it will make this \\&quot;standard\\&quot; Hydro-5 razor even better.</li>
            <li> A shave with this razor loeaves my skin baby soft and brazor burn pain free.</li>
            <li> This razor works almost as good as the Gillette Fusion razor but is harder to use for for any detailed facial hair grooming.</li>
            <li> ;, so for those wondering, they ARE made in the US, Connecticut to be exact.sclaimer, I use Edge Gel shaving cream, and always hot-shower first to soften my beard.</li>
            <li> ;, so for those wondering, they ARE made in the US, Connecticut to be exact.</li>
            <li> First the lubricant on the Hydro 5 made shaving feel like there wasn&#x27;t any blades.</li>
            <li> Yes, you&#x27;ll probably go over a couple times but with one swipe on a fresh blade you really feel the smoothness of this.  </li>
            <li> These are good at this price but it is not comfortable as Gillette 5 blade saving system</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much, but was very surprised about how smooth the shave was.</li>
            <li> i recived this from bzzagent.com  and its amazing simple to use simple to handle simple to shave simpleuly amazing .</li>
            <li> The lubricant and blades on this razor are so good that when shaving a second time against the grain no further shave gel is required.</li>
            <li> This turned out to be one of those decisions I wish I had made much sooner and many dollars earlier.</li>
            <li> The lubricant and blades on this razor are so good that when shaving a second time against the grain no further shave gel is required.</li>
            <li> As long as you avoid touching your face until it dries there shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.     </li>
            <li> I learned a long time ago that men&#x27;s razors were always better than the ones for women.&lt;br /&gt;Legs</li>
            <li> After using this gel just once, I immediately noticed that it was of a much better quality, and that I would never again be going back to buying the other \\&quot;standard\\&quot; store-bought brands of \\&quot;Gillette\\&quot; and \\&quot;Edge\\&quot;, (BOTH of which I had been using for many years).  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty smooth, on a blade that will last you 2 months</li>
            <li> This is not possible with the hydro as the blade will poop out easily every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (maybe if you aren&#x27;t &#x27;bush-hogging a forest&#x27;, it might stay on, but didn&#x27;t work for me), and the blades dulled far too quickly.  </li>
            <li> Very maneuverable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Words can&#x27;t really express how night and day the 2 blades feel.</li>
            <li> They were smooth like the fusion, but the big thing was they lasted a lot longer than the fusion blades.</li>
            <li> I had to buy these because the Gillette Fusion&#x27;s razors were costing me too much and were in no way durable.</li>
            <li> As for the gel, it really helps in the smoothness</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically, if you REALLY need a smoother and gentler shave for your skin without worrying about getting that close shave, go with the Schick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is much cheaper than equivalent Gillette(proglide?)</li>
            <li> Fast forward to 2014</li>
            <li> I received this product free for review, overall it&#x27;s an alright product.</li>
            <li> This razor was much smoother and closer.</li>
            <li> Replacement blades are MUCH cheaper.</li>
            <li> but the Hydro stuff wears out fast - buy another product without the hype of the Hydro.</li>
            <li> I guess you don&#x27;t really need anything too fancy.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care so much about the elegance of the housing of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In my case, this razor gave me much closer shave</li>
            <li> Since it doesn&#x27;t affect my shave negatively, this is a good thing.</li>
            <li> Slowly the shaver lost its ability to give a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far with the Hydro 5, the hairs wash right out effortlessly</li>
            <li> The blades can get pricey, but if you&#x27;ve got a hot date and want to look your best then break this bad boy out.  </li>
            <li> received the Fusion proshild as a free promotion and it was by far the most costly per shave and the most disappointing .</li>
            <li> Buy this one it is as good as fusion and a lot less overall in price</li>
            <li> When I shave against the grain, my skin is never completely silky smooth.</li>
            <li> not sure how long the cartridge will last but very happy with this purchase. .</li>
            <li> Nice close shave with no more burn.  </li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s more show and less function.</li>
            <li> With Gillette it seems nowadays you&#x27;re essentially paying for the brand image more so than the actual product.</li>
            <li> I may remove a star IF I have to throw the blade out too quickly, but I doubt that will happen.ease a shaver with a battery packed gimmick as well, if only to serve my missed placebo effect.    </li>
            <li> One issue with this particular package is that it doesn&#x27;t include a holder for the razor.  </li>
            <li> Still, it dries off in a decent amount of time if you leave it alone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shave with Gillete for years, but the blades were getting more and more expensive</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend doing this.</li>
            <li> highly recommend the Schick Hydro 5.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend doing this.</li>
            <li> you are not constantly replacing it, it does not dull quickly.</li>
            <li> so it seems the mechanism has the blades spaced a little better in terms of cleanup.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t purchased it yet, but I will eventually...for I really did like the vibrating feature on my old Gillette razor.  </li>
            <li> These Hydro 5 razors are not cheap, but they do the job well...much better than the 3 and 4 bladed razors from Schick/Bic/Wilkinson.</li>
            <li> Normally (even with some othe high-end razors)</li>
            <li> The head of the Schick Hydro 5 is quite large, so it requires some care, but the blades are so sharp that going over any curve on my face (e.g. over my chin) requires special care.  </li>
            <li> The head of the Schick Hydro 5 is quite large, so it requires some care, but the blades are so sharp that going over any curve on my face (e.g. over my chin) requires special care.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like using 5 incredible sharp, large blades to shave with because that&#x27;s exactly what Schick Hydro 5 is.blade&#x27; have it totally wrong.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product because you get 90% of the performance for less than half of the price!</li>
            <li> Pros: Sharp comfortable blades.</li>
            <li> No need to try the new ones with three, four, or five blades ...</li>
            <li> After reading up a bit, I found out that it takes a while to get used to a new razor when you switch.</li>
            <li> I also learned about a new trick to prolong the life of razor blades by keeping them soaked in Baby oil before and after shaving.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving by head bald roughly two to three times a week for the better part of the last 9+ years (since enlisting in the Marine Corps).</li>
            <li> Even on fresh stubble, this blade still makes it feel like a fresh shave after a few days of growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I was very surprised.</li>
            <li> have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The Schick doesn&#x27;t have the additional \\&quot;Precision Trimmer\\&quot; on the back, like the Fusion does, but I don&#x27;t really think that it is that big of a deal, as I rarely use the one on my Fusion</li>
            <li> Works OK, but I actually prefer the disposable razors that I&#x27;d been using previously.  </li>
            <li> And the extra large lubrication strip?</li>
            <li> have to be clean shaven for work&amp;#34;  and the blades easily last twice as long as the Gillete blades did!&lt;br</li>
            <li> My legs are left super soft and smooth with the closest shave that I&#x27;ve ever had with any other razor, minus the irritation, top that off with my pockets still having a little somethin somethin left over to spend</li>
            <li> I can only imagine that it will make this \\&quot;standard\\&quot; Hydro-5 razor even better.rchased it yet, but I will eventually...for I really did like the vibrating feature on my old Gillette razor.  </li>
            <li> So I will adjust my perception and adjust to it; partially because it&#x27;s a good thing, not something bad, and partially because everything else about this razor is so incredibly good.</li>
            <li> There is no way to conveniently closely shave the hairs directly under the nostrils.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care what my razor looks like as long as it gets the job done, and that&#x27;s EXACTLY what the Schick Hydro 5 does for me</li>
            <li> looked at the reviews on Amazon and was surprised to see all the one star reviews.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Second the design does not let you close nose- lip intersection or provide precision near the sideburns .</li>
            <li> this razor handle is much better quality than the disposable holder but the actual blades seem similar, they last about the same time</li>
            <li> I would re combed this to anyone who has sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This has honestly never happened before, and though I am not 100% sure its the razor, I have a hunch that it is.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and always have issues with irritation - until now.</li>
            <li> I have always had to use sensitive skin gel to try and avoid razor burn with my old razor</li>
            <li> Almost as good as Gillette, but for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> the LEFT is the \\&quot;Schick Hydro-5\\&quot;, on the RIGHT is the standard \\&quot;Gillette Fusion-5\\&quot; (not the Pro-glide version).</li>
            <li> However, just as a minor \\&quot;inconvenience factor\\&quot;, it is still worthy enough to give the Schick Hydro a 1/2 Star deduction here, which \\&quot;officially\\&quot; makes this review a 4.5 Star review (not a 4.0 Star review as displayed</li>
            <li> The gel is a little much when you first use it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having said all that, I don&#x27;t particularly have a lot of facial hair that needs shaving.  </li>
            <li> I finally tried the Schick because of the extremely high cost of Gillette blades.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion blades are so close together, my hair gets stuck in the mechanism and the amount of washing and beating it would take to remove them, well, can&#x27;t blame the blades for becoming dull and the lubricant for washing away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: As of April/2012, Schick now offers a new 3-speed \\&quot;vibrating\\&quot; version of the above Hydro-5, called the \\&quot;Schick Hydro Power Select\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> But finding a cheaper product with a better quality build is not a good thing on Gillette&#x27;s behalf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (The part that flips back is the dark blue top lubricating strip with the white dots).</li>
            <li> /&gt;The big detractor for me (which some people may like) was that while new, the blades on the Schick leave a slimy residue on your face after shaving.</li>
            <li> Since the lubricant is water activated I rinse the blade on every other pass and of course before shaving the first time.</li>
            <li> Maybe it takes longer to get used to, but no other razor has.  </li>
            <li> Since the lubricant is water activated I rinse the blade on every other pass and of course before shaving the first time.</li>
            <li> shave is smoother, the blades last longer, I get less irritation on my scalp, I enjoy the feeling of the razor handle itself, AND it&#x27;s actually less expensive than the Fusion!&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to the guys over at Schick for making this great product.</li>
            <li> Schick&#x27;s solution to this is a bit awkward, which involves manually flipping down backwards the top plastic assembly for closer exposure to the top blade.</li>
            <li> Apparently, I have become used to the 6th blade for shaving under my nose.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I have to go over some tricky spots various times before I can completely get rid of the hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using twin blade generic razors for years with complete satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> A lot cheaper than Mach3 blades but nowhere near the same quality, durability and sharpness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used countless types of blades and razors and this by far trumps all.</li>
            <li> The Fusion is nice, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but this feels nicer</li>
            <li> This razor is better than the Fusion on my face, but it&#x27;s worse the the Fusion on my head.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product, but I am skeptical.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this razor I always had to replace my razor blades because my strong beard made them dull after two or three shaves.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal Gillette customer for many years and was shocked when I tried the Schick Hydro 5.</li>
            <li> Shaving with the Schick Hydro 5 is exactly like scraping 5 very sharp razor blades over one&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li> Since the 1980&#x27;s, I really had stayed with one single razor, the Gillette Sensor, actually.  </li>
            <li> They are not only thicker, deeper, &amp; slightly longer, but they are also more openly-spaced for less \\&quot;blockage\\&quot; of shaving cream &amp; hair while shaving.</li>
            <li> Yet curiously, the lower quality Gillette blades are still more expensive than the higher quality Schick blades...</li>
            <li> After using it, I can report that I got a close shave on the first use without any of the traditional cuts I expected when going back to a razor.  </li>
            <li> First off I want to start by saying that I&#x27;m a girl, a girl who&#x27;s sick of girly razors that do nothing more than look pretty and empty my pockets.</li>
            <li> The disposables I am used to get the job done easily, but this blade does seem to get the job done a little faster and with slightly less effort.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps if Gillette invested as much money into the &#x27;actual product&#x27; as they do on their very excessive advertising, they might actually have a higher quality razor to offer consumers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it made any sort of difference, but for some reason it made shaving a little more, I don&#x27;t know...</li>
            <li> Though NIVEA currently makes about 5 different varieties, the only one I have tried and can vouch for is the \\&quot;NIVEA Double Action Q10 Revitalizing Shaving Gel\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Although I usually shave at the sink and then don&#x27;t bother to rinse because I&#x27;m going to get right in the shower</li>
            <li> this wouldn&#x27;t have been that big of an issue, as I could just rinse it off my face right away (although that would negate any benefit from the soothing balm stuff) - but the few times that I touched up my shave outside of the shower, this gel stuff was bothersome enough that I did not opt to purchase replacement cartridges for this razor once mine wore out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price of the blades just keeps going higher and higher, too high for my meager budget</li>
            <li> so I thought I would try out this Schick razor because the blades cost only about half as much as Gillette&#x27;s Fusion blades.</li>
            <li> I wanted try to find something less expensive but good.  </li>
            <li> The Fusion is also very sharp and the main advantage I&#x27;ve found is that I don&#x27;t have to be quite so cautious with the Gillette Fusion.  </li>
            <li> But after being somewhat disappointed in their newest AAA-powered Gillette Fusion-5, (not only was the price for the replacement cartridges high, but I experienced noticeably duller blades after only a few shaves)</li>
            <li> It gives a decent shave but the head is far too bulky making it nearly impossible to get a clean shave around the lip and under your nose.</li>
            <li> after a year of using the Schick all I can say is WOW why on earth did I stick with that other brand for so long!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently grown a small beard; stubble really....  </li>
            <li> and we could all be on vacation a lot more and working less for Big Brother just to pay our taxes to pay for our Ridiculous Foriegn Wars and the Military Industiral Complex).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only razor that I ever found which was comfortable enough to shave this much with, that was tough enough to stand up to cutting that much hair was the Gillette, actually.  </li>
            <li> I am surprised how long they stay sharp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To make the blades last twice as long wipe after use, swish in cooking oil</li>
            <li> use if for my head which I shave every five days and my face everyday--seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li> Disappointing vs Gillette fusion Proglide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled to find the  Schick Hydro razor and 17 blades at major wholesale club, at half price of the Gillette&#x27;s fusion.  </li>
            <li> The 6th blade really makes getting into those hard to reach places possible.  </li>
            <li> Even while low, it took a few passes to clear me up.</li>
            <li> The blade is so sharp that if I am not extremely careful then I&#x27;ll shave off a bunch the skin on my face.  </li>
            <li> For $6-$7 this is worth at least a test drive!</li>
            <li> occasional facial cuts have been all but eliminated and the shave is extremely close.</li>
            <li> Needing to shave at least once a day I have found the Schick blades outlast the Gillette and at a much lower cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Needing to shave at least once a day I have found the Schick blades outlast the Gillette and at a much lower cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a nick in so long...</li>
            <li> My beard (I&#x27;m posting on my wife&#x27;s account, so no, she doesn&#x27;t have a beard) is so course and thick that I can grow a full beard in 7-10 days, and normally shave twice a day (from my eyeballs to my chest - the hair connects, so needless to say, my razors get a LOT of mileage daily).  </li>
            <li> It compares well to the other \\&quot;upper end\\&quot; blades that he&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li> I seems a little more difficult to maneuver this razor.</li>
            <li> The blades last longer than anything I&#x27;ve tried and the lubrication strip on the Razor lasts longer than any other.</li>
            <li> I have used it very long so</li>
            <li> My skin does not feel dry after shaving.</li>
            <li> For years I have chosen to Dry Shave (i.e. no shaving cream).  </li>
            <li> I still seemed to get these gnarly bumps and dry skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades really do cut the hairs close to the skin and make multiple passes unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend that you at least give it a try as well.  </li>
            <li> Gillette solves this problem with a single blade on the reverse side.</li>
            <li> On top of that the gel strip area is big, it&#x27;s annoying to have to flip it open every time I need to edge.</li>
            <li> , what to do about the sideburns and trimming,  it took a little bit of playing, but I figured out the flip back, lock the blade thing,  </li>
            <li> While in the military, any stubble could result in a bit of harassment from superiors.  </li>
            <li> It also leaves rough patches of \\&quot;half-cut\\&quot; hairs</li>
            <li> I have never had to be so careful when shaving as I have to be with this razor.  </li>
            <li> it was missing the extra cartridge</li>
            <li> you are looking to upgrade your current shaving cream/gel, I would also humbly recommend the German-made \\&quot;NIVEA For Men Shaving Gel\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> But the handle was trashed and the blades have been getting harder to find.  </li>
            <li> and I never really wanted anything fancy.  </li>
            <li> I used it on stubbly hair, and it still cleaned it with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li> I admit my facial hair is not that coarse or thick, but I could tell after about 10 days with the fusion it was time to replace the blade.</li>
            <li> Usually one blade on my fusion lasts 2 weeks before it starts to become a little more uncomfortable (up to 3-4 weeks when the power is used).</li>
            <li> Other than that, this is what my boy friend wanted for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I bought the Schick hoping it would fix this problem due to its acclaimed glide while shaving.</li>
            <li> The Schick Hydro 5 is incredibly sharp.  </li>
            <li> However this may have also added to the other design flaws..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit difficult to tell from a 2-dimentional picture, but the Schick blades are clearly of a higher quality.</li>
            <li> Schick Hydro 5 is incredibly sharp compare to Gillette.</li>
            <li> Anyway, disappointed when I got it with no spare blade but love the razor--</li>
            <li> However, after reading some of the other reviews here, I realized that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to be, and that \\&quot;slime\\&quot; is a soothing balm.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why this is, but when I use a disposable single blade razor I don&#x27;t get dry skin or bumps on my face.</li>
            <li> thing I hate is that my face is getting red after I shave with this, and it doesn&#x27;t feel as comfortable.</li>
            <li> (you&#x27;re going to break a head to force it off on a down-stroke), and the razors themselves made me think of the old Schick injectables - tough and holds an edge.  </li>
            <li> The leftover stubble kind of sucks though :(</li>
            <li> &quot; My only complaint is that I wish they&#x27;d make a purple one</li>
            <li> While I do miss the vibration from the Fusion Power, I can&#x27;t and wouldn&#x27;t down rate this product for not having that.</li>
            <li> While I do miss the vibration from the Fusion Power, I can&#x27;t and wouldn&#x27;t down rate this product for not having that.</li>
            <li> When I shave both down and upwards, the razor just slides.</li>
            <li> I use this down there, on legs, and on armpits with high-quality conditioner.</li>
            <li> hairs are hard and stiff and I feel like the blade loses its really close shave after a few shaves.</li>
            <li> So here&#x27;s my simple review on the Schick from someone who suffers from really sensitive</li>
            <li> yet less</li>
            <li> I know my method is odd, but imagine how it would be with some shaving</li>
            <li> I have no irritation and I can shave in half the time.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I worked them both, threw the Gillette in the trash, and went back to the local big-box pharmacy to stock up on blades (with the Sensor 2, I was using about 3-4 blades a month.</li>
            <li> 5 blades for closer shave and less irritation.</li>
            <li> So I looked at everything Walmart had, and decided to try this Schick, since the replacement blades were about half the price as the Mach 3&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though it&#x27;s a bit awkward to do at first (vs. Gillette&#x27;s convenient 6th blade)</li>
            <li> you have hard water don&#x27;t leave your blade in the humid area and dab the blades with dry towel and alcohol after use to prevent rust and blunt edges.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal Gillette customer for over 40 years and was shocked when I tried the Schick Hydro 5.</li>
            <li> Anything less, and I&#x27;ll destroy one blade per shave by the time I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anything less, and I&#x27;ll destroy one blade per shave by the time I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One small complaint is that the head is wide making under the nose harder to do.</li>
            <li> but I always still had a little at the end of my shave.  </li>
            <li> hard, rough hair and the Fusion blade would take quite a while to do the job if I let my beard grow out some.</li>
            <li> This blade wipes it away with a few strokes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll leave an update on longevity of the blade in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> if you haven&#x27;t tried 5 blades yet, you are missing out.  </li>
            <li> Hate to say it, but Gillette should stop worrying about chasing profits and go back to design a real razor.</li>
            <li> After completing my shave,  I usually give the Gillette&#x27;s handle a few robust taps  against the sink rim to flick out any gunk that did not rinse out.</li>
            <li> Oh I have a medium tough beard, maybe a little less.</li>
            <li> usually shave in the shower, so</li>
            <li> The amount of lubricant is totally excessive.</li>
            <li> I keep a small glass with 2&amp;#34; of cooking oil in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> My usual blades are the Gilette twin blade disposables.  </li>
            <li> I not sure that make senses or not.....</li>
            <li> /&gt;The five blade system does make shaving less irritating  </li>
            <li> The gel strip runs out way before it gets dull.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> handle has a comfy weight and grip to it.&lt;br /&gt;-The rubber strip at the bottom collects hairs and may be hard to get rid</li>
            <li> /&gt;To reiterate: if you have a hard time reconciling the 1 star reviews, then I suggest you may want to interpret them the way I have.  </li>
            <li> it starts to dull.</li>
            <li> It leaves a slimy residue all over your face that is hard to rinse off.</li>
            <li> I know it is supposed to be a soothing balm type thing, but the reality was that it was annoying, and at times left little balls of dried up goop on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no comparison really, everyone should switch or at least try YOU WILL NOT be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Combined with the excess of lubricant, it makes the razor very hard to handle.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-The head swivels to get under the neck and behind the jaw unlike nelcro.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li> this is a rather irritating event.  </li>
            <li> The comfort does not beat the Fusion though, and the shave is probably a tad worse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Jeeze Scotty, I am so tired of the old evil, wicked world where irrational religious crap leads US to terrorist organizations like ISIS.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Those claiming that using the Schick Hydro 5 is like using a &#x27;rusty blade&#x27; have it totally wrong.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical the the quality of the shave might compensate for the price up charge</li>
            <li> (5-blade razors often make this a difficult place to reach).</li>
            <li> It is expensive but it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong it</li>
            <li> This razor is still cutting like it did on day one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What an unpleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li> It was impossible to get a close shave with all the guards surrounding the blades.</li>
            <li> Not to say it&#x27;s bad or anything.</li>
            <li> My Mach 3 used to just tug and pull those hairs out, painfully.</li>
            <li> I hate to worry about that happening.</li>
            <li> I hate to shave.</li>
            <li> once i used the gillette i forgot how much i hated gillette.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this razor for two reasons:  1)</li>
            <li> but the day after is terrible.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t shave against the grain without getting a very nasty rash.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a really smooth feeling razor.  I like it much better than the Gillette razors.  I don&#x27;t get nicks on my skin, which is a relief.  I hate to worry about that happening.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor....so many of the others with many blades get dull quickly.....not this. The gel strip runs out way before it gets dull. LOVE IT :)</li>
            <li> Overall: much better than buying a dozen Bic razors. With the moisturizing gel I&#x27;ve stopped using lotion and aftershave.    Pros: Sharp comfortable blades. Very maneuverable. Moisturizing gel. Comfortable grip. Closer shave for sideburns... CHEAP.    Con: The moisturizing gel feels sticky and builds up on your skin. As long as you avoid touching your face until it dries there shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.     Hope this review helped, feel free to comment! :)</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal Gillette customer for over 40 years and was shocked when I tried the Schick Hydro 5. There was simply no comparison between the Gillette and the Schick. First the lubricant on the Hydro 5 made shaving feel like there wasn&#x27;t any blades. One shave in the direction of the grain gave me a shave as close or closer than the Pro glide, but a second shave against the grain made my skin feel like silk. The lubricant and blades on this razor are so good that when shaving a second time against the grain no further shave gel is required. Since the lubricant is water activated I rinse the blade on every other pass and of course before shaving the first time. Rinsing the blade before shaving activates the lubricant and I highly recommend doing this. The flip up lubricant strip makes shaving under the nose a snap. Needing to shave at least once a day I have found the Schick blades outlast the Gillette and at a much lower cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS VS Gillette:&lt;br /&gt;Closer shave&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper blade price&lt;br /&gt;Longer lasting blades&lt;br /&gt;Better lubricant&lt;br /&gt;Flip up lubricant strip for trimming&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS VS Gillette:&lt;br /&gt;No 6th blade for trimming&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;In today&#x27;s economy every dollar counts. I finally tried the Schick because of the extremely high cost of Gillette blades. This turned out to be one of those decisions I wish I had made much sooner and many dollars earlier. It costs 6 bucks to try the Hydro 5 and in my opinion most people will be glad they did.</li>
            <li> Fabulous razor, and the price on Amazon was better than retail stores. I enjoy having great razors and these are way better than any I have ever had before. I am surprised how long they stay sharp.</li>
            <li> I used this razor for several months after getting two for free while on a cruise (they were provided for free in our cabin). I had mixed feelings about it, and after they wore out, I went back to my Gillette Fusion razor ([[ASIN:B003987CL0 Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor, 1-count Package]]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Schick Hydro has 5 blades, the same as the Fusion, but they are spaced further apart. This may work for some people, but I don&#x27;t think it was the best format for my face, and may have provided some irritation. The Schick doesn&#x27;t have the additional \\&quot;Precision Trimmer\\&quot; on the back, like the Fusion does, but I don&#x27;t really think that it is that big of a deal, as I rarely use the one on my Fusion anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big detractor for me (which some people may like) was that while new, the blades on the Schick leave a slimy residue on your face after shaving. I know it is supposed to be a soothing balm type thing, but the reality was that it was annoying, and at times left little balls of dried up goop on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually shave in the shower, so this wouldn&#x27;t have been that big of an issue, as I could just rinse it off my face right away (although that would negate any benefit from the soothing balm stuff) - but the few times that I touched up my shave outside of the shower, this gel stuff was bothersome enough that I did not opt to purchase replacement cartridges for this razor once mine wore out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this is not a bad razor, but I prefer the Gillette Fusion for now.</li>
            <li> I received an open razor package, I&#x27;m hoping it can get replaced. Other than that, this is what my boy friend wanted for Christmas. Can&#x27;t wait till he can use it.</li>
            <li> Really good blades.  Almost as good as Gillette, but for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Great price and quick delivery on a solid razor.</li>
            <li> Getting a close and smooth shave is sometimes important to a man.  While in the military, any stubble could result in a bit of harassment from superiors.  So, I shaved with a razor.  After retirement I began to save with an electric my wife gave me for my birthday.  Slowly the shaver lost its ability to give a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So with growing hair on my neck that the electric shaver ignored, and noticeable stubble left after each shave, I decided to try a razor again.  This razor seemed a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Schick Hydro 5\\&quot; claims to be a special razor.  After using it, I can report that I got a close shave on the first use without any of the traditional cuts I expected when going back to a razor.  In addition I like the following about this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The five blade system does make shaving less irritating  .&lt;br /&gt;The flip trimmer is effective at trimming sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;This razor shaved my neck clean on the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Schick Hydro 5.  This product is a keeper.</li>
            <li> Having been shaving for more years than I would care to count, I can say this shaver is okay at best. The Fusion is a much better option.  Apparently, I have become used to the 6th blade for shaving under my nose.</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion Power vs. Schick Hydro 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Schick pros&lt;br /&gt;-Schick cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Words can&#x27;t really express how night and day the 2 blades feel. I have hard, rough hair and the Fusion blade would take quite a while to do the job if I let my beard grow out some. Even while low, it took a few passes to clear me up. This blade wipes it away with a few strokes. The Fusion is nice, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but this feels nicer and *performs better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades and shaver are also *cheaper than Gillettes but of *way better quality. The blades themselves feel stronger. With Gillette it seems nowadays you&#x27;re essentially paying for the brand image more so than the actual product. Not to say it&#x27;s bad or anything. But finding a cheaper product with a better quality build is not a good thing on Gillette&#x27;s behalf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll leave an update on longevity of the blade in a few weeks. I&#x27;d have to throw my Fusion blades out every 2-4 weeks like clockwork, assuming I use it whenever my beard gets unsightly which is every 4 days. Even when I let my beard grow out some, the blades just don&#x27;t hold up well after use. The Gillette Fusion blades are so close together, my hair gets stuck in the mechanism and the amount of washing and beating it would take to remove them, well, can&#x27;t blame the blades for becoming dull and the lubricant for washing away. So far with the Hydro 5, the hairs wash right out effortlessly so it seems the mechanism has the blades spaced a little better in terms of cleanup. Since it doesn&#x27;t affect my shave negatively, this is a good thing. I have a feeling they&#x27;ll last a while longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I do miss is the -vibration from the Gillette Fusion shaver. I&#x27;m not sure if it made any sort of difference, but for some reason it made shaving a little more, I don&#x27;t know...fun isn&#x27;t exactly the word, but it made the experience better. Whether it&#x27;s because of the sensation in my hand or the massaging feeling of the blade on my face, it&#x27;s something I do miss. Hopefully Schick will release a shaver with a battery packed gimmick as well, if only to serve my missed placebo effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, I recommend this product wholeheartedly. Definitely 5 stars based on the pros vs. my previous shaver which are, more affordable system (blades and shaver), better performance and seemingly better quality. While I do miss the vibration from the Fusion Power, I can&#x27;t and wouldn&#x27;t down rate this product for not having that. I may remove a star IF I have to throw the blade out too quickly, but I doubt that will happen.ease a shaver with a battery packed gimmick as well, if only to serve my missed placebo effect.

            <li> I am a fusion guy, so when I got a chance to try these Schick Hydro 5 razors, I was really impressed. They were smooth like the fusion, but the big thing was they lasted a lot longer than the fusion blades. I am going 3 weeks strong with one razor. I admit my facial hair is not that coarse or thick, but I could tell after about 10 days with the fusion it was time to replace the blade. I have not tried the fusion pro glide, but I have decided to stick with the Schick Hydro 5 razors because of the cost factor. Since they last longer, I do not have to buy them as often plus they are cheaper than the fusion blades.</li>
            <li> Great razor that last for a couple weeks. I prefer the disposable version for some reason. These Hydro 5 razors are not cheap, but they do the job well...much better than the 3 and 4 bladed razors from Schick/Bic/Wilkinson. I think you&#x27;ll be happy with quality, lotion, movement, and longevity of this razor.</li>
            <li> This razor is better than the Fusion on my face, but it&#x27;s worse the the Fusion on my head.  I might just have to keep two razors around.    One issue with this particular package is that it doesn&#x27;t include a holder for the razor.  Not necessarily a problem, but they do have razors that come with holders.</li>
            <li> I had to buy these because the Gillette Fusion&#x27;s razors were costing me too much and were in no way durable. So here&#x27;s my simple review on the Schick from someone who suffers from really sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette Fusion was giving me rashes every time I shaved against the grain so I knew it was time to switch. I bought the Schick hoping it would fix this problem due to its acclaimed glide while shaving. This is true, the shave feels amazing. When I shave both down and upwards, the razor just slides. Sometimes I think the blade is not cutting at all. The way it does this is by its supposed \\&quot;skin guards\\&quot; in between the razors and this ooey-gooey gel thing on the top of the razor. When I&#x27;m done shaving, most of the hair is gone and I&#x27;ve got a slimy gel coating on my face. This is where the downside comes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is in no way as close as the Gillette. Sometimes I have to go over some tricky spots various times before I can completely get rid of the hair. When I shave against the grain, my skin is never completely silky smooth. It also leaves rough patches of \\&quot;half-cut\\&quot; hairs so when I rub my skin, I can still feel the stubble. As for the gel, it really helps in the smoothness but it&#x27;s hard to wash off. Still, it dries off in a decent amount of time if you leave it alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, if you REALLY need a smoother and gentler shave for your skin without worrying about getting that close shave, go with the Schick. It&#x27;s cheaper to replace the heads and a lot more comfortable than other leading brands. The leftover stubble kind of sucks though :(</li>
            <li> My husband likes the performance of the blade. It compares well to the other \\&quot;upper end\\&quot; blades that he&#x27;s tried. It lasts well. Cost was fantastic, good value.</li>
            <li> I use this razor for my legs. I find it to be better than the Venus (which I had been using for years).</li>
            <li> Fusion has met its match and its price gauging for shaving razors.  Buy this one it is as good as fusion and a lot less overall in price</li>
            <li> Much better than Fusion. Blades stay sharper longer. Excellent price.</li>
            <li> Good item and like to buy another one.i am very happy to see this product.thanks.I love the item.i am agre to buy the item.</li>
            <li> I love this razor. It gave me a smooth clean shave on my legs easily :).</li>
            <li> These are good at this price but it is not comfortable as Gillette 5 blade saving system</li>
            <li> For $6-$7 this is worth at least a test drive! I have used disposables for years.... and replacement style for many years before that. Overall this has been the best experience considering the performance and value of the product.  The 5 blade lubricated system is smooth and gets very close! My face is baby smooth with a great shaving experience. No tug and pull like the cheapo disposables either. We are talking a Grade A shave right out of the box. After about two weeks I wore out the first blade which was about what I was expecting. Up until that point every shave was smooth and enjoyable.   For the money the performance is awesome.... especially considering that there are more expensive shavers on the market that do not perform as well as this one.  As I stated... for about $7 this is worth at least a test drive.... then you will know for yourself just how good this razor is!</li>
            <li> Goodbye, Mach 3! Goodbye irritation and nicks on my face. This razor has changed EVERYTHING about how I shave my face! It just GLIDED right over my face, picking up every hair! And this is even over 1 week without shaving! You don&#x27;t even need shaving cream! I just wanna scream how great this is! This wasn&#x27;t even any irritation when shaving my upper lip! My Mach 3 used to just tug and pull those hairs out, painfully. These 5 blades offer a closer shave without any cuts on my face! And the extra large lubrication strip? Genius! Sorry for all the exclamation points, but this product is truly this great! GO BUY IT!!</li>
            <li> I some times use a Philips rotary shaver which gives me a closer and smoother shave than Shick hydro 5. But the electric razor needs multiple passes, takes time and simply won&#x27;t shave a stubble hear and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: This is my first non-electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The head swivels to get under the neck and behind the jaw unlike nelcro.&lt;br /&gt;-The flip up lube strip allows you to shape sideburns and beard.&lt;br /&gt;-The lube lasts for many shaves and feels like real aloe.&lt;br /&gt;-The handle has a comfy weight and grip to it.&lt;br /&gt;-The rubber strip at the bottom collects hairs and may be hard to get rid off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-My hairs are hard and stiff and I feel like the blade loses its really close shave after a few shaves. But its very comfortable nevertheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have hard water don&#x27;t leave your blade in the humid area and dab the blades with dry towel and alcohol after use to prevent rust and blunt edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is much cheaper than equivalent Gillette(proglide?) but I can&#x27;t compare the it shave quality as I can&#x27;t justify spending on Gillette unless they give it to me free to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently I use foam but I will switch to shave soap and brush and let you know the results. I am also going to try Double Edge Safety Razor and see how it compares.</li>
            <li> Bought this based of a review. I am pretty satisfied with this razor. Its not as good as a braun 3 series shaver but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Excellent performance in every respect except for one major flaw!  There is no way to conveniently closely shave the hairs directly under the nostrils.  Gillette solves this problem with a single blade on the reverse side.</li>
            <li> First off I want to start by saying that I&#x27;m a girl, a girl who&#x27;s sick of girly razors that do nothing more than look pretty and empty my pockets. I don&#x27;t care what my razor looks like as long as it gets the job done, and that&#x27;s EXACTLY what the Schick Hydro 5 does for me and then some! My legs are left super soft and smooth with the closest shave that I&#x27;ve ever had with any other razor, minus the irritation, top that off with my pockets still having a little somethin somethin left over to spend and you&#x27;ve got a very happy girl! So in conclusion I say ladies (and gents) if you&#x27;re looking for a great razor for a great price look no further!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get the + 1 cartridge</li>
            <li> For many years I have been in love with Schick Quattro, both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s version. I thought I couldn&#x27;t get a better, closer, smoother shave... but I was wrong. The Hydro 5 is awesome and all I will use now. I like that the blades are alittle flatter and thinner and I love the moisturizing product on the blade head. Each blade lasts through many shaves.. you are not constantly replacing it, it does not dull quickly. I have never cut or knicked myself witht he Hydro 5 (or the Quattro, to be fair). These are comfortable to use and give such a smooth shave. My skin does not feel dry after shaving. I have no irritation whatsoever, even if I shave \\&quot;too soon.\\&quot; My only complaint is that I wish they&#x27;d make a purple one lol.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using twin blade generic razors for years with complete satisfaction.  No need to try the new ones with three, four, or five blades ... right?  But in order to get my Amazon order over $25 for the free shipping, I decided to buy this 5-bladed razor and two packs of blades.    What an unpleasant surprise.  Five blades are scratch and PULL.  And I did not find the shave any closer or cleaner.  This might be a good razor for shaving legs, but not faces!</li>
            <li> I have the Schick Hydro 5 and the Gillette Fusion.  Both are excellent razors  I bought the Schick Hydro 5 after reading an article that compared it to the Gillette Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at the reviews on Amazon and was surprised to see all the one star reviews.  A number of them said that shaving with the Schick Hydro 5 is like running a rusty blade over one&#x27;s face and often they make disparaging remarks about the fact the blades are made in China, as though that&#x27;s proof the blades are no good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have come to conclude that most of the 1 star reviews are incredibly misguided.  The Schick Hydro 5 is incredibly sharp.  I have never had to be so careful when shaving as I have to be with this razor.  The head of the Schick Hydro 5 is quite large, so it requires some care, but the blades are so sharp that going over any curve on my face (e.g. over my chin) requires special care.  The blade is so sharp that if I am not extremely careful then I&#x27;ll shave off a bunch the skin on my face.  I think that many of those 1 star reviews are totally backwards.  Using the Schick Hydro 5 is not at all like scraping a rusty blade over one&#x27;s face! Exactly the opposite is true: the blade are so sharp that it takes incredible care when shaving with this razor.  Shaving with the Schick Hydro 5 is exactly like scraping 5 very sharp razor blades over one&#x27;s face.  Use caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say that this razor is really any better than the Gillette Fusion.  The Fusion is also very sharp and the main advantage I&#x27;ve found is that I don&#x27;t have to be quite so cautious with the Gillette Fusion.  I have found that I enjoy shaving a lot more than I used to since I began using the Schick Hydro 5.  It may sound strange, but it&#x27;s quite nice to have to take my time shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To reiterate: if you have a hard time reconciling the 1 star reviews, then I suggest you may want to interpret them the way I have.  Those claiming that using the Schick Hydro 5 is like using a &#x27;rusty blade&#x27; have it totally wrong.  It&#x27;s not like using a rusty blade.  It&#x27;s like using 5 incredible sharp, large blades to shave with because that&#x27;s exactly what Schick Hydro 5 is.blade&#x27; have it totally wrong.  It&#x27;s not like using a rusty blade.  It&#x27;s like using 5 incredible sharp, large blades to shave with because that&#x27;s exactly what Schick Hydro 5 is.</li>
            <li> After using Mach three blades for many years, I decided to take the plunge and try one of these multiple blade razors.  I have a bald head and use this blade to shave the cranium.  I&#x27;ve recently grown a small beard; stubble really....  just over what one would call 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  Historically I&#x27;ve use the Mach III to trim the edges of the beard.  I&#x27;ve found that you can adjust the tip of this blade to expose only the metal without the guard and it then allows you to trim mustache/beard edges....  Awesome.  If you want a shave it&#x27;s pretty smooth, on a blade that will last you 2 months (if you take care of it), then get it.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> It gives a decent shave but the head is far too bulky making it nearly impossible to get a clean shave around the lip and under your nose. Five blades and they still tugged on the beard a bit. A lot cheaper than Mach3 blades but nowhere near the same quality, durability and sharpness.</li>
            <li> I found myself on a business trip and without a razor, so I purchased this atba local store.  It&#x27;s been my first experience with Shick, and I am very delighted.  I think I will never go back to the twin blade razor.</li>
            <li> Disappointing vs Gillette fusion Proglide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled to find the  Schick Hydro razor and 17 blades at major wholesale club, at half price of the Gillette&#x27;s fusion.  I found it just doesn&#x27;t measure up in in the following ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First it is no where near a maneuverable or comfortable against the contours of the face .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second the design does not let you close nose- lip intersection or provide precision near the sideburns . Whereas the  Gillette&#x27;s sleeker blade design and trim blade availability make this a breeze&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades bulky design and attachment mechanism does not lend it self to cleaning by comparison. After completing my shave,  I usually give the Gillette&#x27;s handle a few robust taps  against the sink rim to flick out any gunk that did not rinse out. This is not possible with the hydro as the blade will poop out easily every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly Fusion&#x27;s attachment mechanism is  superior yet less obtrusive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Schick did provide a lubricant bar attached to the top of each blade. This did work well, and as a result a close shave without a burn was possible. However this may have also added to the other design flaws..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a Schick disposable user before discovering Fusion proglide, so I had great hopes. For now it&#x27;s  back to four dollars a blade. Ugh!</li>
            <li> I am not a fan.  I used it for about a week.  Maybe it takes longer to get used to, but no other razor has.  I am going back to Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li> It seems like the more blades you have these days, the better.  Well, this is the case with the Schick Hydro 5.  It provides a clean comfortable shave.  I like the ergonomics of the handle which make it a breeze to hold.  The gel is a little much when you first use it but it quickly evens out over the life of the cartridge.  I got this free as part of a sponsored program but don&#x27;t let that make you think my review isn&#x27;t genuine.  This thing works like a champ.</li>
            <li> For years I have chosen to Dry Shave (i.e. no shaving cream).  Normally (even with some othe high-end razors) this is a rather irritating event.  Having tried the Schick Hydro 5 was amazing.  Just a splash of water and I am off.  It&#x27;s like my face is lathered up.  Smooth shave with no irretation.  I know my method is odd, but imagine how it would be with some shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have easily irritated skin, try this razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving by head bald roughly two to three times a week for the better part of the last 9+ years (since enlisting in the Marine Corps). We were issued Mach 3s in recruit training, I used those for a while, then I changed over to the Fusions... a noticeable improvement and had continued using them for several years. I only recently discovered the Schick Hydro 5 but boy am I glad I did. There&#x27;s no comparison! Really.&lt;br /&gt;My shave is smoother, the blades last longer, I get less irritation on my scalp, I enjoy the feeling of the razor handle itself, AND it&#x27;s actually less expensive than the Fusion!&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to the guys over at Schick for making this great product. I&#x27;ll never look back.</li>
            <li> Although this razor is marketed towards men, I love it as a ladies razor.  I thought that the razor came with an extra cartridge, but it does not.  The parenthesis with 1 razor + 1 cartridge is misleading!</li>
            <li> Nice product, but it was missing the extra cartridge</li>
            <li> better shave than Gillette .</li>
            <li> Several years ago, I discarded my three blade razor made by those guys in Cincinnati and subscribed to the online mail-order delivery. The shave was comparable to what I had previously experienced but at a much more affordable price. Fast forward to 2014 and I am invited to join a BzzCampaign by BzzAgent involving the Schick Hydro 5. I was skeptical the the quality of the shave might compensate for the price up charge but I was very surprised. Schick Hydro 5 has provided me with the smoothest shaving experience of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My occasional facial cuts have been all but eliminated and the shave is extremely close. I have to say, the additional cost is worth it for Hydro 5. I am grateful for the #hydrochallenge introducing me to Schick Hydro 5!</li>
            <li> this razor handle is much better quality than the disposable holder but the actual blades seem similar, they last about the same time</li>
            <li> I have used the Gillette Fusion blades and they just caused me irritation and red, burning skin. I recently bought this razor and had the best shave I ever had, left my skin feeling better than it did before my shave. With Gillette blades going higher and higher in price, This seems to be the best option in terms of cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> This razor is great if you want that late 80s George Michael stubble look. It was impossible to get a close shave with all the guards surrounding the blades.</li>
            <li> Nicest, cleanest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with a disposable razor. I would re combed this to anyone who has sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The blades are great, and you don&#x27;t have to keep shaving over an area. My husband is follically challenged and uses this on his head as well as his beard. I&#x27;ve even used some of the blades for my legs and they have never been so smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I love the Fusion Proglide. It definitely gives the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had, however the blades barely last a week and the refills are super-expensive. Enter the Hydro 5... The shave is pretty good, not as good as the proglide, but good enough that I&#x27;m happy with it. The blades last forever... I&#x27;ve been on my first one for over a month now and the refills are cheap so I can replace the blade the instant it starts to dull. This is a great product because you get 90% of the performance for less than half of the price!</li>
            <li> I use this down there, on legs, and on armpits with high-quality conditioner. I&#x27;m sure the combination of the two does the trick. Great razor! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Get this shaver! That&#x27;s All I have to say. I use it to shave my legs and with ONE PASS it shaves them smooth and silky! Save me a lot of time :)</li>
            <li> For over 15 years I used only Gillette razors. But after being somewhat disappointed in their newest AAA-powered Gillette Fusion-5, (not only was the price for the replacement cartridges high, but I experienced noticeably duller blades after only a few shaves), I decided to finally try Schick and their latest Hydro-5 razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please see picture above of my submitted \\&quot;comparison photo\\&quot; of the 2 blades*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the LEFT is the \\&quot;Schick Hydro-5\\&quot;, on the RIGHT is the standard \\&quot;Gillette Fusion-5\\&quot; (not the Pro-glide version). It&#x27;s a bit difficult to tell from a 2-dimentional picture, but the Schick blades are clearly of a higher quality. They are not only thicker, deeper, &amp; slightly longer, but they are also more openly-spaced for less \\&quot;blockage\\&quot; of shaving cream &amp; hair while shaving. All this not only resulted in a much more comfortable shave vs. the Gillette Fusion, but the cartridges lasted much longer as well. Yet curiously, the lower quality Gillette blades are still more expensive than the higher quality Schick blades...go figure.  Additionally, me being a \\&quot;hi-tech guy\\&quot;, the AAA-powered vibrator of the Gillette was indeed a cool feature to have...but, it was simply not enough to make-up for the lower overall quality of Gillette.  Perhaps if Gillette invested as much money into the &#x27;actual product&#x27; as they do on their very excessive advertising, they might actually have a higher quality razor to offer consumers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all that said however, I definitely DID miss Gillette&#x27;s nice \\&quot;6th blade\\&quot;, which is located on the very top of the razor for shaving hard-to-reach places, such as directly under the nose (5-blade razors often make this a difficult place to reach). Schick&#x27;s solution to this is a bit awkward, which involves manually flipping down backwards the top plastic assembly for closer exposure to the top blade. (The part that flips back is the dark blue top lubricating strip with the white dots). Though it&#x27;s a bit awkward to do at first (vs. Gillette&#x27;s convenient 6th blade) it&#x27;s by no means a deal-breaker.  For in the end, the Schick was EQUALLY effective at shaving close under the nose, and trimming the sideburns \\&quot;evenly\\&quot; with its flip-down assembly. However, just as a minor \\&quot;inconvenience factor\\&quot;, it is still worthy enough to give the Schick Hydro a 1/2 Star deduction here, which \\&quot;officially\\&quot; makes this review a 4.5 Star review (not a 4.0 Star review as displayed above).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillett&#x27;s vibrator &amp; convenient 6th blade were nice features to have, but they were just not enough to keep me loyal to Gillette.  The bottom line for me personally was, the Schick Hydro-5 gave me a more comfortable shave, had longer lasting blades, and came at a lower price for the replacement cartridges.  Therefore, I will definitely be using the much more preferred Schick Hydro-5 for my shaving needs from now on...and for only around $5 with free shipping (was $4.95 with free shipping at the time of this review) I would highly recommend that you at least give it a try as well.  If it can change a loyal 15-year Gillette user like myself, perhaps it can change you as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIDE NOTE: SHAVING GEL RECOMMENDATION.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to upgrade your current shaving cream/gel, I would also humbly recommend the German-made \\&quot;NIVEA For Men Shaving Gel\\&quot;. Though NIVEA currently makes about 5 different varieties, the only one I have tried and can vouch for is the \\&quot;NIVEA Double Action Q10 Revitalizing Shaving Gel\\&quot; (though I&#x27;m sure they are all equally as good). After using this gel just once, I immediately noticed that it was of a much better quality, and that I would never again be going back to buying the other \\&quot;standard\\&quot; store-bought brands of \\&quot;Gillette\\&quot; and \\&quot;Edge\\&quot;, (BOTH of which I had been using for many years).  Anyway...just a related suggestion. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: As of April/2012, Schick now offers a new 3-speed \\&quot;vibrating\\&quot; version of the above Hydro-5, called the \\&quot;Schick Hydro Power Select\\&quot;.  I haven&#x27;t purchased it yet, but I will eventually...for I really did like the vibrating feature on my old Gillette razor.  I can only imagine that it will make this \\&quot;standard\\&quot; Hydro-5 razor even better.rchased it yet, but I will eventually...for I really did like the vibrating feature on my old Gillette razor.  I can only imagine that it will make this \\&quot;standard\\&quot; Hydro-5 razor even better.</li>
            <li> So I bought this just over a week ago now and I&#x27;ve shaved a couple times with it. I can say that it truly does a nice job but the day after is terrible. I am not sure why this is, but when I use a disposable single blade razor I don&#x27;t get dry skin or bumps on my face. Using this product, I got just that. I use shaving cream and after shave and none of that helped. I still seemed to get these gnarly bumps and dry skin. This has honestly never happened before, and though I am not 100% sure its the razor, I have a hunch that it is. On the upside, I have yet to experience razor burn... It&#x27;s a nice product, but I am skeptical.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this razor for two reasons:  1) The amount of lubricant is totally excessive. It leaves a slimy residue all over your face that is hard to rinse off. And when you lift the razor off your face to shave a different location, it leaves a rope of slime. The Yuck Factor is really overwhelming.  2) The handle is very smooth and well finished, but that means that you don&#x27;t get a good grip. Combined with the excess of lubricant, it makes the razor very hard to handle.  I give this razor two stars because it does give a pretty clean, comfortable shave, but I will not buy another one.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor available today at any price. If you are looking for a close comfortable shave, buy this product.</li>
            <li> Best shaved I have ever used this product is the first one I can say for sure that it will save you money and is going to last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Been using Gillette for years and then received one of these guys in the mail for free and decided to try. I didn&#x27;t expect much, but was very surprised about how smooth the shave was. Schick has won me over!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Gillete Fusion Power for almost 2 years now. I recently bought this after seeing great reviews about more comfort, better shave, and being cheaper. My take on it is a bit different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now been using this for about 3 weeks. Usually one blade on my fusion lasts 2 weeks before it starts to become a little more uncomfortable (up to 3-4 weeks when the power is used). This razor is still cutting like it did on day one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I hate is that my face is getting red after I shave with this, and it doesn&#x27;t feel as comfortable. After reading up a bit, I found out that it takes a while to get used to a new razor when you switch. Hopefully that is the case and it gets better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/5 for now. I love the cheapness and life of this blade. The comfort does not beat the Fusion though, and the shave is probably a tad worse.</li>
            <li> Love it i have bought 2 already</li>
            <li> Works OK, but I actually prefer the disposable razors that I&#x27;d been using previously.  I seems a little more difficult to maneuver this razor.</li>
            <li> I have been a Gillette fusion user until I tried these and now I am a Schick Hydro five user they are just that good</li>
            <li> I received this product as a promotion from Schick and what sets this blade apart from the rest is the moisture strip and durability of the blades.  Of course there are plenty of choices out there, but after 10 shaves, I haven&#x27;t given it a second thought to replace the head.  If you are running into the dilemma of having to change out the head after only a handful of shaves, then this is the razor to try.  You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I received this product as a sample from BzzAgent.com and I&#x27;m in love.  The 6th blade really makes getting into those hard to reach places possible.  I truly find myself shaving more often with these razor&#x27;s than I ever have, and am loving it.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been using women razor and one day in college the staff handed these razors out to everyone. I used it and have been in love since then, it shaves so close to my skin and leaves my skin smooth. Unlike the \\&quot;women razors\\&quot; I don&#x27;t get cuts. I would recommend this razor to everyone men or women.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Gillette Fusion-Five shaver and blades for over eight years. The price of the blades just keeps going higher and higher, too high for my meager budget so I thought I would try out this Schick razor because the blades cost only about half as much as Gillette&#x27;s Fusion blades. Am I glad I eve did! I love this razor! It is the bet and most Wonderfeel shave on my super-tuff curly-cow-licked bearded face ever! The shave is clean, smooth, pain-free and fast! It cuts stubb with one pass that Gillette Fusion requires two or three or even four passes to draw up and cut clean. A shave with this razor loeaves my skin baby soft and brazor burn pain free. And the best part is that I get twice as many shaves with the Hydro Blade as I eve did with the Fusion so blade, so I have reduced my monthly shaving costs by 75% a month (a significant $35), which annualized is equal to about three days of paid vacation a year. Thank you Schick. Now I wish the rest of the US Fee Market would work the same way and we could all be on vacation a lot more and working less for Big Brother just to pay our taxes to pay for our Ridiculous Foriegn Wars and the Military Industiral Complex).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeeze Scotty, I am so tired of the old evil, wicked world where irrational religious crap leads US to terrorist organizations like ISIS. Beam me up, get me out of here as quicklyh as possible! I am looking forward to my place in the Eternal Magic Kingdom of Love for those whose Hearts remained Faithfeel to the Gospel of XOXOXO Sermons of the Greatest Teacher that ever Told!</li>
            <li> Love the razors and design.</li>
            <li> This razor will give the best shave in the world. I&#x27;ve used countless types of blades and razors and this by far trumps all.</li>
            <li> great razor as expected.</li>
            <li> if you haven&#x27;t tried 5 blades yet, you are missing out.  blades last 8-10 times longer than a double blade. glides over face and neck. I haven&#x27;t had a nick in so long...</li>
            <li> I love this razor and I own three of them for various reasons</li>
            <li> I hate to shave. I have sensitive skin and always have issues with irritation - until now. I&#x27;ve tried many Razors both electric and blade and this one is the best. I have no irritation and I can shave in half the time. The blades last longer than anything I&#x27;ve tried and the lubrication strip on the Razor lasts longer than any other. Highly recommend this. It is expensive but it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Great little razor at a great price.  Shaves as close as the best razor available.</li>
            <li> This razor works almost as good as the Gillette Fusion razor but is harder to use for for any detailed facial hair grooming.</li>
            <li> Since the &#x27;70&#x27;s, I&#x27;ve always been a Gillette person. Since the 1980&#x27;s, I really had stayed with one single razor, the Gillette Sensor, actually.  My beard (I&#x27;m posting on my wife&#x27;s account, so no, she doesn&#x27;t have a beard) is so course and thick that I can grow a full beard in 7-10 days, and normally shave twice a day (from my eyeballs to my chest - the hair connects, so needless to say, my razors get a LOT of mileage daily).  The only razor that I ever found which was comfortable enough to shave this much with, that was tough enough to stand up to cutting that much hair was the Gillette, actually.  THEN, they basically drop it from their blades-lineup. You can&#x27;t find Sensor 2 or 3&#x27;s in the store anymore (not around here, anyhow). So, I asked my wife to go find a good solid razor, at a good price, and bring it in for me to try.  She bought both the Gillette Mach 3 and the Schick Hydro 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, Hate to say it, but Gillette should stop worrying about chasing profits and go back to design a real razor. The Mach 3 was a JOKE. The heads pop off the handle too easily (maybe if you aren&#x27;t &#x27;bush-hogging a forest&#x27;, it might stay on, but didn&#x27;t work for me), and the blades dulled far too quickly.  The Schick Hydro 5 had a good feel to the handle, had some weight to it, love the flex (motion) of the head, as well as the attachment method (you&#x27;re going to break a head to force it off on a down-stroke), and the razors themselves made me think of the old Schick injectables - tough and holds an edge.  Schick still makes a terrific razor - and the Hydro 5 is it.  Needless to say, I worked them both, threw the Gillette in the trash, and went back to the local big-box pharmacy to stock up on blades (with the Sensor 2, I was using about 3-4 blades a month. With the Gillette Mach 3, I was chewing through them at a rate of about 7-8 a month. The Schick is good for one blade, for me, about once every 8-days, so as good or better than the old Sensor 2).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a quick disclaimer, I use Edge Gel shaving cream, and always hot-shower first to soften my beard. Anything less, and I&#x27;ll destroy one blade per shave by the time I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My current box of blades says &amp;#34;Made in USA, Imported into Canada&amp;#34;, so for those wondering, they ARE made in the US, Connecticut to be exact.sclaimer, I use Edge Gel shaving cream, and always hot-shower first to soften my beard.

            <li> Great razor...used Gillett for a long time but price was getting out of hand. Not only was this cheaper but gives you a closer shave.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, and gives a nice shave, better than many of the other brand name, multi-blade razors.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I learned a long time ago that men&#x27;s razors were always better than the ones for women.&lt;br /&gt;Legs, underarms, what a difference. It&#x27;s like going from to DSW to Prada !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice close shave with some gimmicks. I find that the gel wears out quickly. On top of that the gel strip area is big, it&#x27;s annoying to have to flip it open every time I need to edge. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it a close shave, but I think it&#x27;s more show and less function. I received this product free for review, overall it&#x27;s an alright product. If you&#x27;re into this sort of razor design then this is for you.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Shick Hydro 5 Razor since it first became available.  Prior to using this razor I always had to replace my razor blades because my strong beard made them dull after two or three shaves. The Shick Hydro 5 Razor survives my strong beard and I have been able to shave with it more than 5, 6 times. I also learned about a new trick to prolong the life of razor blades by keeping them soaked in Baby oil before and after shaving.  It works!</li>
            <li> Shave with Gillete for years, but the blades were getting more and more expensive it seemed. So I thought what the heck I&#x27;m going to try the Schick Hydro 5, the blade cartridges were way cheaper so what the heck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well after a year of using the Schick all I can say is WOW why on earth did I stick with that other brand for so long!!&lt;br /&gt;It gives me a better shave &amp;#34;I have to be clean shaven for work&amp;#34;  and the blades easily last twice as long as the Gillete blades did!&lt;br /&gt;There is no comparison really, everyone should switch or at least try YOU WILL NOT be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Love this shaver.  No nicks or cuts and still gives a super shave.</li>
            <li> My second best all time razor, for me the 3 blade version is a bit better.</li>
            <li> Way better than the quattro</li>
            <li> I have been a sensor user for many years, anything more than 2 blades seemed to make me break out and have to deal with razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was recently the recipient of a review unit on this razor, through BzzAgent.  As a reviewer, I felt I had to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First,  there is no way I was going to switch from my Sensor, I had been using it for years.  But the handle was trashed and the blades have been getting harder to find.  So I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has to be one of the most comfortable shaves ever.  the hydro gel in the blade works miracles, in that I did not even get the razor burn I get from my Sensor. The shave was smooth and seemed to shave quite close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, what to do about the sideburns and trimming,  it took a little bit of playing, but I figured out the flip back, lock the blade thing,  this makes it into a non floating head and removes the hydro gell bit.  it is great for trimming and getting close to the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying blades for this review unit, and have now officially switched</li>
            <li> Very good razor , did not leave any nicks and residue from the razor blade. I would recommend it . I also got it for free from Schick hydo .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> i recived this from bzzagent.com  and its amazing simple to use simple to handle simple to shave simpleuly amazing .</li>
            <li> Well did a head to head test with Gillette Fusion. Not even close. This razor was much smoother and closer. No nicks or burn. One small complaint is that the head is wide making under the nose harder to do. Turned the razor to the side and used side strokes, no problem. Oh I have a medium tough beard, maybe a little less. The replacement blades are 2/3 the cost of Fusion.&lt;br /&gt;Helpful tip:&lt;br /&gt;To make the blades last twice as long wipe after use, swish in cooking oil let drip. I keep a small glass with 2&amp;#34; of cooking oil in my bathroom. The oil lasts a month, so do the blades.&lt;br /&gt;Updated&lt;br /&gt;All razors give a close shave for different lengths of time. I prolong the life of blades by storing the razor in vegetable oil after each use. I get twice as many shaves that way. So this is the cost of good close shaves.&lt;br /&gt;Schick Hydro  07c  28-32 shaves&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Fusion proshild  18c  14-16 shaves&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Pro Glide  10c  28-32 shaves&lt;br /&gt;I received the Fusion proshild as a free promotion and it was by far the most costly per shave and the most disappointing .</li>
            <li> Gives a good shave, but like all main-brand razors, it is radically overpriced.</li>
            <li> This razor is a significantly cheaper alternative to the Gillette Fusion Razor. Replacement blades are MUCH cheaper. Go check it out for yourselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have VERY sensitive skin. I can&#x27;t shave against the grain without getting a very nasty rash. This razor does a great job and my skin is still happy.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal Gillette customer for many years and was shocked when I tried the Schick Hydro 5. There was simply no comparison between the Gillette and the Schick. First the lubricant on the Hydro 5 made shaving feel like there wasn&#x27;t any blades. One shave in the direction of the grain gave me a shave as close or closer than the Pro glide, but a second shave against the grain made my skin feel like silk. The lubricant and blades on this razor are so good that when shaving a second time against the grain no further shave gel is required. Since the lubricant is water activated I rinse the blade on every other pass and of course before shaving the first time. Rinsing the blade before shaving activates the lubricant and I highly recommend doing this. The flip up lubricant strip makes shaving under the nose a snap. Needing to shave at least once a day I have found the Schick blades outlast the Gillette and at a much lower cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Schick Hydro 5 is incredibly sharp compare to Gillette. The head of the Schick Hydro 5 is quite large, so it requires some care, but the blades are so sharp that going over any curve on my face (e.g. over my chin) requires special care. Kudos to the guys over at Schick for making this great product. I&#x27;ll never look back.</li>
            <li> Best razor, I shave in the shower with just warm water with no problems. Haven&#x27;t been able to do that with any others.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s OK for the deal I got but the Hydro stuff wears out fast - buy another product without the hype of the Hydro.</li>
            <li> Close shave, good value.</li>
            <li> My usual blades are the Gilette twin blade disposables.  They suit my needs and I never really wanted anything fancy.  I got this razor as part of a Schick promotion so I figured there&#x27;s no harm in trying it out, and I am glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades really do cut the hairs close to the skin and make multiple passes unnecessary.  Yes, you&#x27;ll probably go over a couple times but with one swipe on a fresh blade you really feel the smoothness of this.  I used it on stubbly hair, and it still cleaned it with minimal effort.  The blades can get pricey, but if you&#x27;ve got a hot date and want to look your best then break this bad boy out.  Even on fresh stubble, this blade still makes it feel like a fresh shave after a few days of growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade top has a swivel feature so it will conform to any curves or crevices of the areas you wish to shave.  The handle of the razor is alright, no complaints, but the &amp;#34;case&amp;#34; that it comes with locks in rather cheaply... just basic plastic molds, but I guess you don&#x27;t really need anything too fancy.  I keep mine in the shower, so I don&#x27;t care so much about the elegance of the housing of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said all that, I don&#x27;t particularly have a lot of facial hair that needs shaving.  The disposables I am used to get the job done easily, but this blade does seem to get the job done a little faster and with slightly less effort.  Great for body hair and shaving &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; (not that I would know about such things)</li>
            <li> I used Gillette Fusion for awhile but want to try something else....  I wanted try to find something less expensive but good.  In my case, this razor gave me much closer shave and it was very comfortable. It was much better shave then the Gillette.  It seem to work with my face......  I not sure that make senses or not..... I have used it very long so not sure how long the cartridge will last but very happy with this purchase. .</li>
            <li> My husband shaves every day and these are great razors. 5 blades for closer shave and less irritation. He loves his.</li>
            <li> ive been using schick for while but than went back to gillette just to try it again but before i did i threw the schick away. once i used the gillette i forgot how much i hated gillette. it cuts me up so i purchased this on from amazon and now im clean shaven</li>
            <li> love the razor but the title of this product makes it seem like you get a razor (handle and blade) + another spare blade--what you actually get is one handle and one disposable blade -- no spare blade.  Is it just me?  Anyway, disappointed when I got it with no spare blade but love the razor--use if for my head which I shave every five days and my face everyday--seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li> great product true to description very fast shipping</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Gillette Mach 3 for probably about 10 years now, and was always happy with it. That is until the last time I needed to buy replacement blades and paid attention to the price. So I looked at everything Walmart had, and decided to try this Schick, since the replacement blades were about half the price as the Mach 3&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was that it almost felt as though it wasn&#x27;t doing anything because of how smoothly it glided, but in just one or two passes, my face was completely smooth -- not a single bit of stubble remaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing I noticed was that my face had become quite slimy, almost like okra slime. Although I usually shave at the sink and then don&#x27;t bother to rinse because I&#x27;m going to get right in the shower anyway, I thoroughly rinsed right away to remove all the slime (and it took a bit of rinsing to do so). However, after reading some of the other reviews here, I realized that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to be, and that \\&quot;slime\\&quot; is a soothing balm. So I will adjust my perception and adjust to it; partially because it&#x27;s a good thing, not something bad, and partially because everything else about this razor is so incredibly good. It swivels nicely and was a very quick, easy, and thorough shave.</li>
            <li> I have been using a mach 3 razor for years with no intention of changing anything for the foreseeable future until I tried the Schick Hydro razors.  These things are great and leave my face feeling great.  A nice close shave with no razor burn.  Something that has plagued me for years and these are my answer.  I have really enjoyed these razors and my wife has even used them a couple of times and she likes them also.  The Schick Hydro is a great option to use other than my old mach 3.  I guess I am changing over and going to use these now. It delivers a nice close shave with no burn.  I have always had to use sensitive skin gel to try and avoid razor burn with my old razor but I always still had a little at the end of my shave.  This razor is the answer.  Nice close shave with no more burn.  Need I say more.</li>
