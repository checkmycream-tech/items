            <li>I have gone through so many makeup brushes that dropped hairs on my face.</li>
            <li>The powder brush picks up a good amount right away</li>
            <li>Gave this as a gift so all I can say is that my daughter was very excited when she opened this.</li>
            <li>, it gives me the ibbie jibbies LOL), but I&#x27;m sure normal people love this.  </li>
            <li>For the most part, these worked pretty good</li>
            <li>bought two sets, one was a gift - but the pouch has a very strong smell of chemicals, so I couldn&#x27;t give the gift with the pouch, and had to find a gift box they would fit into.</li>
            <li>Good set for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Super cute case they come in, too!</li>

            <li>best brushes i have used in a long time</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews on these brushes I was very excited to finally pay good money for good quality.</li>
            <li>Very good quality for the price, love that they are synthetic, and they aren&#x27;t too big for my needs.</li>
            <li>I am a beginner to make up, and this just makes me so excited!</li>
            <li>Well worth the price I paid!!</li>
            <li>My make up goes on more smoothly and looks as though it has blended  better.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft and feel great on my face.  </li>
            <li>Great quality, soft, dense and they don&#x27;t shed!</li>

            <li>The brushes are nice, exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>was hounding the internet trying to find out what each brush is for, and overlooked that there&#x27;s an insert giving you that important tip.&lt;br /&gt;Great price, cute case as well.</li>
            <li>I love that this company stands against animal cruelty and genuinely cares about their customers opinions.</li>
            <li>that goes into more depth about makeup techniques (available if you register on the manufacturer&#x27;s website).</li>
            <li>They are seriously so soft and a great kit for traveling.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t pay much attention, but this was coming from a girl that always had her make up on and looked good.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good investment, if you use makeup often and don&#x27;t wanna spend too much money on name brand brushes.</li>
            <li>It has a bow, which looks nice, but let&#x27;s face it, I am rarely going to take the time to tie.</li>
            <li>I really did make a good purchase.</li>
            <li>I wanted a good brush kit but didn&#x27;t want to spend too much money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are extremely easy to clean!</li>
            <li>Also easy to clean!</li>
            <li>Love the brushes, and the case is super cute.</li>
            <li>They are soft and rich and she loved the nice case too.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;s one of the best things I&#x27;ve spent my money on!  </li>
            <li>Definitely recommend if you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot but are searching for good brushes!</li>
            <li>Easy to care for.</li>
            <li>easy.  </li>
            <li>Great set of brushes that meets all general application needs.</li>
            <li>Beautiful set of 10 brushes, individually packaged within a satin chocolate case.</li>
            <li>I use bare minerals makeup and these brushes have ensured easy and flawless application at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>and they are fine now.  </li>
            <li>It literally takes me half the time to do my make up because of how flawlessly they help blend it in.</li>
            <li>Amy sent me an email to follow up and see how i was enjoying them as soon as they arrived and was quick to respond with a replacement set after I told her about the problem.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my new brush set!</li>
            <li>I also heard that synthetic hair won&#x27;t waste your products, so it&#x27;s great to know you can get the most out of your products!</li>
            <li>I was happy with the delivery time, and unlike many other reviews, I didn&#x27;t feel the smell was too strong.</li>
            <li>, she&#x27;s nineteen, mentioned that brushes make a huge difference in applying one&#x27;s make up.  </li>
            <li>But over all this would be a great set or someone just starting out with makeup or trying to add some brushes to their collection that won&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li>Just perfect for everyday makeup.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Rushes are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Missame is sending a replacement brush free of charge.</li>
            <li>Such a great value.</li>
            <li>And even comes with free shipping.</li>
            <li>I love the bamboo brushes they are worth the buy</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for an amazing product..</li>
            <li>(foundation glides on) and the blush brush really applies blush nicely</li>
            <li>I really enjoy these brushes.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>They are light</li>
            <li>Perfect for everyday makeup and beyond.</li>
            <li>would recommend these brushes to anyone that is looking for cruelty free animal hair make up brushes.</li>
            <li>I found that this set was more useful.</li>
            <li>and these fit the bill.</li>
            <li>The price is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I wanted brushes that were good quality, soft, but still affordable.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making such a great, cruelty-free product!!!</li>
            <li>fabulous!!!They are so soft and feel so good on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the different brush sizes and one of the things I loved about this set, is it had a pamphlet that described each brush and the function for it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The case is perfect; it&#x27;s small, yet easy to travel with</li>
            <li>Yeyy to that first of all!!</li>
            <li>The intro price really can&#x27;t be beat, grab them while you still can!!!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>Oh, I loved the fresh new smell when I got these brushes in the mail!</li>
            <li>I love the little guide that comes with them along with the beautiful satin case.</li>
            <li>I think my favorite of the bunch is the angled eyeshadow one, which is just the right size and texture to give me a nice even layer of shadow on my whole lid in basically one swipe, making quick workday makeup</li>
            <li>And another thing I like is since the tops are light, you can tell when they&#x27;re clean.</li>
            <li>And they work really well, so I am able to apply my makeup more quickly, evenly, and efficiently.</li>
            <li>They are so incredibly soft, the hairs do not fall out, they&#x27;re so easy to wash, and just overall a beautiful set to have!</li>
            <li>Very soft brushes and it seems as if the sizes were customized based on the owner&#x27;s experience with makeup (after she gave me more insight!).</li>
            <li>They come in a cute, functional bag that can fit comfortably in a large cosmetic bag, and they provide a clean, smooth surface.</li>
            <li>You just have make sure you wash them first before you use them(you</li>
            <li>and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price!</li>
            <li>I love this product and highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>Well, it was worth every dime!</li>
            <li>(2) One must clean the brushes before using.</li>
            <li>However, I would still clean the brushes before use.</li>
            <li>i liked it , i think it blends well and leaves a very soft finish</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also pretty easy to clean, which speaks well of the quality----generally the cheap brushes I wash</li>
            <li>Bristles are still nice and soft!  </li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft, and I love how they look!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so soft and the handles are fantastic!!</li>
            <li>But I really like the seller, they emailed me for my opinion about the product and kindly reminded me of how to take care of the brushes in a right way.</li>
            <li>seller was very nice and had good customer service, and tried to replace the pouches, but the replacements smelled even worse.</li>
            <li>brushes are great, soft and good quality, I really like them, especially because they are not animal hair.</li>
            <li>The special promo ($4.97) makes me feel like I robbed a bank.</li>
            <li>And the price was right!</li>
            <li>ELF brushes can also be about $3 each, but this set is way higher quality and much more worth it.</li>
            <li>I will do a full review on my blog skynynailartandbeauty.com and</li>
            <li>I love these brushes for the feel and texture of the bristles but the real test was the finished look.</li>
            <li>It put me very at ease and more eager to review this product.</li>
            <li>Love these brushes, they are made very well.</li>
            <li>The coverage is phenomenal and very was to achieve.</li>
            <li>are nice and soft but they do smell like spray paint like others</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never bought a full set of brushes before.</li>
            <li>I love it so much I&#x27;m thinking about ordering another one for travel.</li>
            <li>I have an easily irritated, sensitive face and these not only do not scratch, but produce beautiful</li>
            <li>The wood is sturdy and shaped to fit in your hand just right</li>
            <li>I had issue with the first set that was sent to me, but the seller was so amazing and reached out to me to send me out a new set!</li>
            <li>Other than that they are great.</li>
            <li>I love my new brushes!  </li>
            <li>They’re an exceptional quality for the price especially.</li>
            <li>A few brushes were still good to use, but MOST of the face brushes were just falling apart.</li>
            <li>Quick to arrive.  </li>
            <li>I think the set is well thought out, the shapes and sizes are all very practical and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The brushes work very well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The brushes are super soft!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I think this is the only vendor who reaches out to make sure you completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>The seller was extremely quick to respond and get the issue resolved.</li>
            <li>They do smell but after a quick cleaning its gone.</li>
            <li>They wash up very easy and so far have kept their shape.</li>
            <li>Very soft! :)</li>
            <li>However, functionality of the brushes is definitely high end, but a lot more affordable.</li>
            <li>I really love this purchase and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Very nice set of brushes - especially considering the price ( which is very reasonable).&lt;br /&gt;Excellent</li>
            <li>This is my very first brush set</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>Missame seems to be very interested in customer satisfaction which is also something i look for when buying a product.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoyed the flat top kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>I normally use sephora/clinique brushes and I feel like these brushes are better than both of those brands.  </li>
            <li>I ultimately decided on this set because the reviews were mostly good and the price was a happy medium, with the exact assortment I was looking for to replace my other brushes.  </li>
            <li>I have now been using them for several weeks, and I am very pleased with the quality of these brushes.  </li>
            <li>I love the flat top kabuki-ish brush for buffing in powder, the foundation brush is fab.</li>
            <li>The foundation brushes apply great, but the little brushes are more softer, but I  would definitely purchase more brushes as presents for others.</li>
            <li>High Quality make-up brushes, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re as good as the high end brushes out there and leaves a seamless application.</li>
            <li>am in love with my new brush set.</li>
            <li>Use it daily and love it!  </li>
            <li>I was sent personal emails to notify me of set I could afford, asking how the brushes worked, etc... phenomenal!</li>
            <li>highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>I love how soft these brushes are.!</li>
            <li>The hair is super soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>but to my surprise the owner of missamé contacted me directly and right a was offered to send a new brush and was very understanding and happy to help resolve the issue.</li>
            <li>love makeup brushes with the white tips because it helps you see the makeup on the brush, helps you see that it’s really clean, and just looks cool in contrast.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with my purchase, i got high quality brushes,  they are soft but  is a fact</li>
            <li>With mostly positive reviews, I thought it must be worth it!</li>
            <li>So you can fit all of these brushes (or the whole case) on your bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides the above reasons I&#x27;ll keep getting these - the woman I corresponded with was AMAZING.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, I really appreciated the printed brush guide and the free downloadable .pdf</li>
            <li>These brushes are amazing they came on time the only problem that I have with them is the case.</li>
            <li>The handles are a smooth, polished wood and give them a real sleek look.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price of the product -</li>
            <li>they are super-soft, and definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li>Never had such a nice set</li>
            <li>So worth the money      </li>
            <li>I will add that the powder brush picks up far more powder than I would like it to</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>They are so lush and well made my makeup goes on better and stays on longer.</li>
            <li>I will say they are worth every cent &#x27;</li>
            <li>The set is great, so far haven&#x27;t had any hairs fall out - the problem with my last set.  </li>
            <li>Soft brush and easy to clean...</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I am overwhelmed with each brush and don&#x27;t necessarily need every one, but nice to have extras.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth this price</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend these brushes for anyone that wants a really good quality brush set.</li>
            <li>I love how soft these brushes are.</li>
            <li>I bought the set as a  gift,  my  niece loved it,  I  recieved it in a  shorter time  than expected,  well packaged.  </li>
            <li>I find all brushes useful.</li>
            <li>They are amazingly soft brushes, great quality especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny and arrived in record time</li>
            <li>The brushes are very full and super soft.  </li>
            <li>Such a bummer, since they felt really nice right out of the box.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a nice variety of different sizes and angles of shapes of brushes in this set which is why I chose it over other sets and a really good value too.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are easy to clean and you can tell they’re perfectly clean because of the white tips.</li>
            <li>and I admit she was right.  </li>
            <li>Every size is just right.</li>
            <li>The flat top brush in particular, is a favorite -</li>
            <li>I feel like I can&#x27;t give this set a *perfect* review because both the kabuki and the flat-top brush arrived with a few stray hairs that were longer than the rest; I was able to take care of it with manicure scissors in just a minute, but it was a slight \\&quot;quality control\\&quot; concern.</li>
            <li>This is my first professional makeup brush set and it has everything that I need and more.</li>
            <li>These are my first professional brushes and I am so glad I bought them.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used these yet, but I can see that any one can make themselves pretty like skilled professional with these brushes.</li>
            <li>I think I would like the powder/kubuki brush to be a little more dense, but overall they are great.</li>
            <li>They are all very soft and dense, my favorite is the Kabuki brush, which has made applying my mineral foundation so much easier, I&#x27;m never using the brush</li>
            <li>I use bare minerals, so it&#x27;s not the most pricey out there</li>
            <li>Great for travel because I usually so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and compact; great for traveling.</li>
            <li>The carrying case is also really nice, it feels nice and silky-ish, only folds over twice, and ties closed with a ribbon.</li>
            <li>This set would make a great gift as well.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a bit of room for a few other brushes you may own as well in the case, if you roll the case with the additional brushes in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Brushes are pretty decent quality for being pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get these because I don&#x27;t really have a large collection of brushes but have never fancied paying a ton of money for a set</li>
            <li>The brushes are high quality they feel nice and solid.</li>
            <li>gave them their first washing before use</li>
            <li>and it shipped really fast!</li>
            <li>so well I find myself pulling for them for my first time make up application,  </li>
            <li>When I finally got to open the package and look at the brushes, it was really nice!</li>
            <li>All the bristles fell out after first use.</li>
            <li>The first time, the product took a year to outgas.</li>
            <li>I saw a better set of brushes at my local drugstore, and I bet those do not stink.</li>
            <li>They seem pretty well made.</li>
            <li>I really should return them!</li>
            <li>Not a lot of manufacturers (especially via Amazon) go the extra mile to make sure the customer is satisfied at all times.</li>
            <li>I also use powder foundation on a daily basis, so the smaller foundation brush is perfect for using at home or if I need to throw it into purse for touch ups later.</li>
            <li>She most definitely loves them!</li>
            <li>Its exactly what im expecting.</li>
            <li>First let me say that these were not for me, but my girlfriend.</li>
            <li>Also interested in seeing what else Missam&amp;eacute; will offer in the future since it&#x27;s now my girlfriend&#x27;s favorite brand.</li>
            <li>Life is short, buy the brushes :)</li>
            <li>No one wants those!  </li>
            <li>The bristles feel soft and comfortable on my face.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and precise.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves them!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really glad I found these vegan brushes at such an affordable price.</li>
            <li>The first time when I received them, I washed the brushes as instructed and one of the brushes&#x27; hair started falling out.</li>
            <li>You do need to wash them first before using.</li>
            <li>This is the first set of brushes I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li>But other than that I am satisfied!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will also say that the price for the brushes is pretty inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Love these and can&#x27;t say enough about them.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with these brushes, I have a wide variety of different shapes and sizes, which makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li>Super Soft!!  </li>
            <li>Compared to other brushes I&#x27;ve had that shed black fibers all over my face when I used them, that&#x27;s a pretty excellent change.</li>
            <li>&amp; Yes, I followed the directions clearly, and how to clean them before use.</li>
            <li>As good as and in some respects a lot better than expensive</li>
            <li>I love these so much that I reserve them for my personal use.</li>
            <li>I loved how the company actually emailed me shortly after my purchase with support of the product!</li>
            <li>and it was most probably coming from my expensive brushes I&#x27;d loved for years.  </li>
            <li>I will agree with other commenters that the carrying case has a strong chemical smell when first opening the package, which the company even admits to and provides instructions on how to clean it to remove the smell (I appreciate their honesty).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I got such an awesome product for a small price!</li>
            <li>Considering the average price per brush for comparable quality is from $8 - $15 per brush, this is an amazing deal.</li>
            <li>, the manufacturer (Missam&amp;eacute;) was in touch after I made the purchase and during the whole shipping process.</li>
            <li>The brushes stay soft and come clean easily with regular soap--no special/expensive &amp;#34;brush cleaner&amp;#34; required!</li>
            <li>The bristles are so unbelievably soft, full, and have not fallen out at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I can give a good review yet.  </li>
            <li>I washed the new set as instructed right away to see if there is a difference, and there absolutely is!</li>
            <li>I ordered these on special because I thought they were dupes of the Everyday Minerals brushes that I love.</li>
            <li>Super soft brushes with woden ends.</li>
            <li>Also less apt to harbor yucky things in the bristles.</li>
            <li>but I ordered my own without a pouch for much less.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally review things, but wow, these brushes are fantastic.</li>
            <li>Smaller (well shorter) brushes than I&#x27;m used to, but that&#x27;s easy to get over.</li>
            <li>They are super soft</li>
            <li>These brushes are super soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been shopping around (both in-stores and online) for certain makeup brushes and each were - in my opinion - unreasonably pricey.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend if you travel frequently, they are easy to pack!</li>
            <li>And as a new professional makeup brush user, the brush guide was a HUGE help for me.</li>
            <li>Play with different uses for the brushes and you will find new ways to love them.</li>
            <li>I had to give it 4 stars because my kabuki brushes have many loose bristles even after I washed them.</li>
            <li>They feel very high quality</li>
            <li>The brushes were very soft, and I can definitely tell that the bamboo was of good, lasting quality.</li>
            <li>I even got a personalized, handwritten letter with my recent replacement brush, which was a great little touch.</li>
            <li>This makeup brush set is amazing to use everyday.</li>
            <li>There is only one brush in this set I&#x27;ve yet to use (which is great because when ordering a set, you sometimes get a few duds that you&#x27;ll never need).</li>
            <li>Beauty routine becomes so much easier/quicker when you use missame quality brushes.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them that much.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  </li>
            <li>and I am very grateful.  </li>
            <li>They are all lightweight and work really well.</li>
            <li>she loves them so much.</li>
            <li>They exaggerate way too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and very picky about brushes.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush set.</li>
            <li>As an added bonus, I got free next day delivery.</li>
            <li>They came in fast.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much my wife</li>
            <li>Thanks amy</li>
            <li>I really like the blush brush and the kubuki brush.</li>
            <li>My friends would be stunned to know how much i paid for the set.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The receipt of the request Thanks</li>
            <li>Very professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t shed at all and really hold the product very well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks...</li>
            <li>These brushes are quality brushes I really like them a lot.</li>
            <li>I also really like the carrying case that they come in.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Very gooood</li>
            <li>I will say that the bag has a plastic smell upon arrival, but that really doesn&#x27;t bother me considering the deal.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>, they are of nice quality so don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase these especially if you&#x27;re just starting out with makeup.</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft!!!</li>
            <li>I had really high hopes, since the reviews were so positive...</li>
            <li>No shedding and ferrules are still nice and tight!  </li>
            <li>Definitely more than I expected!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just a normal valued customer!</li>
            <li>They are so easy to clean and even after use everyday they never dull out or feel scratchy.</li>
            <li>So, as with all of the other reviews, I would agree that this brush set has a very strong distinct odor, but I washed the brushes last night and the odor went away</li>
            <li>know it seems kind of silly, but the only suggestion I have for the seller is to raise the price to $35 or more so additional shopping is not needed for the free shipping since it&#x27;s fulfilled by Amazon directly.</li>
            <li>I just retired a very expensive set of brushes I bought more than 20 years ago that are still good</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had a chance to try it due to work, but very excited to.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this brushes and would recommend to absolute anyone.</li>
            <li>I received a special offer for these and got this brush set for only $12.99.  </li>
            <li>I  haven&#x27;t heard anything from  my niece  specially that she&#x27;s very critical when it comes to quality  of  </li>
            <li>Every brush you could possibly need included in this set -- and the price is right!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really soft after the first wash as directed to do before using.</li>
            <li>The brushed are soft and fine, allowing for even distribution of makeup.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how little they cost as I have some where one brush was more than this whole set.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for new brushes, give these a try!</li>
            <li>should with all brushes), You also may have to wash them more then once there was a slight smell with mine</li>
            <li>I love that it came with a black brush pouch.</li>
            <li>They compare to much more expensive brushes and are a way better deal.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used them extensively yet, but I&#x27;ve used and washed them a few times and they appear to be good quality</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my set for only about two weeks, but I already love it, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Very soft!</li>
            <li>, make sure none of the bristles are bent backwards when you close them back up in adorable little tote they come in or they&#x27;ll stay like that next time you use them).</li>
            <li>Most recently I had been using Bare Minerals, which are natural hair brushes--</li>
            <li>I washed my brushes in warm water with just a tiny drop of Bare Minerals Deep Cleansing Foam dissolved within.</li>

            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>They are comparable to my high end brushes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brushes themselves are high quality brushes.  </li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that I wish to change would be the size of the kabuki brush and the flat top brush.</li>
            <li>Certainly if you are chemically-sensitive, run far away from these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These brushes have very dense hairs and the hairs themselves are feather soft...</li>
            <li>It offers everything you need, without including too much.</li>
            <li>Thank you #Amy ng for your very prompt and professional service.</li>
            <li>They are extremely soft and I really like the quality and size of the brushes.</li>
            <li>They are ver soft and blend very well</li>
            <li>Those cheap brushes were too rough on my skin and the bristles kept sticking to my face when I put makeup on.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and work very well.</li>
            <li>The powder brushes are very dense and soft.</li>
            <li>give a very evenly professional looking makeup application and blending...</li>
            <li>(Bare Minerals&#x27; brushes are not, unfortunately.)</li>
            <li>Which I happen to do everyday. :)</li>
            <li>Other then that they were fine.</li>
            <li>They had an odd odor when they first arrived, but a good wash and a few days air</li>
            <li>I have used the brushes in both dry and wet applications, they are amazing</li>
            <li>The case is compact and easy to carry as a basic make-up essential.</li>
            <li>The bristles as stated above are super soft and do not fall out like some lower quality brushes ive purchased on here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had these for 4 months and any time I need new brushes, I&#x27;ll be buying Missame.</li>
            <li>So I thought I&#x27;d try some new brushes.  </li>
            <li>I wash them when they need it and they look like new again.  </li>
            <li>, I just unfortunatley will have to find a new case to put my brushes in because I won&#x27;t use them if I have to touch the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell of the brushes didn&#x27;t bother me,  they smelled like a new product.  </li>
            <li>and she sent me new brushes.</li>
            <li>Works well, the bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and do not shed.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft and seem well made.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are high quality and incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>Very soft on the skin, versatile set -</li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>Very soft, non-irritating</li>
            <li>Missame&#x27;s brushes are both cruelty-free and vegan, which are two major reasons I chose this particular seller, aside from the high quality.</li>
            <li>They are so soft!  </li>
            <li>The brushes are really soft!</li>
            <li>As directed, I washed them prior to first use and have had no problems at all.</li>
            <li>did have an issue with the first set of brushed I received as some of the brushes were shedding.</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft!</li>
            <li>I love the small compact case they come in.</li>
            <li>I was most excited about the brushes not leaving random strands everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>you first open it, it has a plastic smell to it, but as soon as you wash the case and brushes (as they recommend)</li>
            <li>I used the Missame&#x27; brushes for the first time this morning and wasn&#x27;t too impress; especially with my foundation and concealer application.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft comparable to the eco tools brush line!</li>
            <li>This is more of a personal preference of mine as I don&#x27;t think any other customers felt this way when they received their product.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>They are so soft!</li>
            <li>The smell was quite strong when I received the brushes, however the smell has since gone away in the few days</li>
            <li>This set had every type of brush I need for a natural, basic full face make-up, including five different brushes for just eyes, including a blending brush.</li>
            <li>I used the same mild baby shampoo that I always use to clean the brushes (since they had that &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; smell to them), but I&#x27;m not sure whether the hair on some of these brushes are just not stuck on well, or whether I&#x27;m washing incorrectly...</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not big nor super tiny.</li>
            <li>Handles feel a little cheap - but not a deal breaker.  </li>
            <li>:) It was like buying a little present for yourself.</li>
            <li>I cleaned my brushes the other day super thoroughly</li>
            <li>There is also a clear brush guide, so you know which brush is designed for what.</li>
            <li>It applies my liquid foundation seamlessly.</li>
            <li>Before I used them I noticed that they were really soft with sturdy handles.</li>
            <li>I aired out the pouches for 40 days, perfumed them, washed them twice, nothing has helped because they are made of vinyl.</li>
            <li>This is a complete set of quality brushes for the eyes and face, including foundation brushes, blending brushes, eye brushes, and even a kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>And this is a whole set of white tip brushes.</li>
            <li>Really soft brushes.</li>
            <li>I use them quite frequently and wish it were longer.</li>
            <li>so I was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>After washing them, the brush hairs were just as soft.</li>
            <li>The brushes work really well, especially with blending.</li>
            <li>They are so soft.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin, so soft and even bristles</li>
            <li>They are so soft and do not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>have never had a brush so so soft on my skin.</li>
            <li>I am a professional make up artist( I&#x27;m not paid for this review and don&#x27;t have anything to do with the company)</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and haven&#x27;t shed at all.</li>
            <li>They are extremely soft and not one hair has shed.</li>
            <li>Soft brushes.</li>
            <li>The bridles are soft but not flimsy.</li>
            <li>and the bristles are extremely soft (like really soft</li>
            <li>A young girl, I say young because I&#x27;m in my forties</li>
            <li>I did not notice any chemical smell when I first received the set, but I am not sensitive to issues like that.  </li>
            <li>I just began using them and already got the professional look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Truly professional look, without any professional talent.</li>
            <li>The brush set was complete.  </li>
            <li>I have so far tried the blush and powder brush.</li>
            <li>These brushes are soooo soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used some of the face brushes so far</li>
            <li>Extremely soft, but not flimsy.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a girl, I do have to say the brushes are amazingly soft...</li>
            <li>like rabbit fur soft...</li>
            <li>No shedding and soft</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft, polished wood finish handles and a brush for every make up task.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t express how much of a difference the quality of these brushes makes in the ease of applying and overall finish of my makeup.</li>
            <li>I sprayed mine with apple cider vinegar, then washed it in the sink with hand soap, and the smell was completely removed.</li>
            <li>I have washed them and they held up and are still soft.</li>
            <li>Soft, nice-looking makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>These make-up brushes are incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>They are really soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and attribute it to having exzema.</li>
            <li>The bristles haven&#x27;t given me any fall out and they are soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles are so, so soft.</li>
            <li>and they feel really soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and the ferrule is sturdy.</li>
            <li>With the M.A.C brushes, it only takes one application or two at the very most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used a couple so far and like them.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft.  </li>
            <li>It is absolutely classy with its&#x27; silk soft make up carrier.</li>
            <li>Really soft.</li>
            <li>and I have quite sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>Also, I find the eyeliner brush to be a bit too thick for doing nice defined lining, but that may just be personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I washed them with baby shampoo first and let them dry on their sides as instructed.  </li>
            <li>That is the main thing I look for in brushes, especially for my eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When I first received them, I was really excited about the delicate packaging and individually wrapped brushes.</li>
            <li>High quality and very low price.</li>
            <li>Purchased for travel but have high hopes for quality based on visual appearance.</li>
            <li>I was looking high and low for a travel brush set</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t keep the case brushes come in because they are usually cheap</li>
            <li>(Personally, I have a hard time touching silk items, I can&#x27;t describe it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try out the whole set for the next 2 weeks and do the multiple washing test to see how the hold up.</li>
            <li>Sorry, but for $40, the product had better be ready to use out of the package.</li>
            <li>Considering that it was my first time washing them, I can&#x27;t imagine them lasting for that long...</li>
            <li>the brush handles are thick and study, makes it easy to apply makeup.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are super soft and fluffy!</li>
            <li>Brushes are worth the price without the pouch, but I have to knock off a star due to having no way to properly store the brushes.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t use my brushes until a couple of days later though because I was busy with school and stuff.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a complete set.</li>
            <li>They are soft but sturdy enough to hold the powder.</li>
            <li>I bought this set to replace my Bare Minerals brushes, which I have had for almost 8 years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 52 and have ordered and purchased hundred of makeup brushes and even spent as much $90 for each brush and</li>
            <li>My only issue is that they&#x27;re natural, in a day when we&#x27;re leaning toward synthetic products.  </li>
            <li>Noticed slight shedding after first wash, but what else would you expect with synthetic bristles?</li>
            <li>In my opinion, this set is of equal quality with Ulta&#x27;s I.T. line of brushes, which is also of very high, professional quality, but for an average of $24 per brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the good far outweighs the bad, and I have no other complaints about the actual use of the brushes.</li>
            <li>They are very soft, and I have not noticed any bristles falling out of any of the brushes despite using them daily and washing them several times, with some brushes being washed daily.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t exact (Kabukis aren&#x27;t quite as thick) but they are far softer!</li>
            <li>My other worry was that the bamboo stick would make the brushes look not as high end</li>
            <li>I have used several different brands of makeup brushes, including Clinique, Mac, Bare Minerals, and lots of drug-store brands.</li>
            <li>- the handles aren&#x27;t loose, the bristles are soft and they don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>quality was okay, but the smells was very bad, full of chemical!</li>

            <li> Fantastic set of brushes!  </li>
            <li> I have gone through so many makeup brushes that dropped hairs on my face.</li>
            <li> The powder brush picks up a good amount right away</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift so all I can say is that my daughter was very excited when she opened this.</li>
            <li> , it gives me the ibbie jibbies LOL), but I&#x27;m sure normal people love this.  </li>
            <li> For the most part, these worked pretty good</li>
            <li> bought two sets, one was a gift - but the pouch has a very strong smell of chemicals, so I couldn&#x27;t give the gift with the pouch, and had to find a gift box they would fit into.</li>
            <li> Good set for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Super cute case they come in, too!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re exactly what she wanted, with a beautiful carrying case included, so we&#x27;re all super</li>
            <li> They are so soft and make up goes on beautifully</li>
            <li> Beautifully assembled and complete makeup brush set.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised with how beautiful they look in person.  </li>
            <li> best brushes i have used in a long time</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews on these brushes I was very excited to finally pay good money for good quality.</li>
            <li> Very good quality for the price, love that they are synthetic, and they aren&#x27;t too big for my needs.</li>
            <li> I am a beginner to make up, and this just makes me so excited!</li>
            <li> Well worth the price I paid!!</li>
            <li> My make up goes on more smoothly and looks as though it has blended  better.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft and feel great on my face.  </li>
            <li> Great quality, soft, dense and they don&#x27;t shed!</li>
            <li> Great brushes..very soft!</li>
            <li> The seller is super amazing and sweet, and these have lifetime warranty!</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice, exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> was hounding the internet trying to find out what each brush is for, and overlooked that there&#x27;s an insert giving you that important tip.&lt;br /&gt;Great price, cute case as well.</li>
            <li> I love that this company stands against animal cruelty and genuinely cares about their customers opinions.</li>
            <li> that goes into more depth about makeup techniques (available if you register on the manufacturer&#x27;s website).</li>
            <li> They are seriously so soft and a great kit for traveling.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t pay much attention, but this was coming from a girl that always had her make up on and looked good.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good investment, if you use makeup often and don&#x27;t wanna spend too much money on name brand brushes.</li>
            <li> It has a bow, which looks nice, but let&#x27;s face it, I am rarely going to take the time to tie.</li>
            <li> I really did make a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I wanted a good brush kit but didn&#x27;t want to spend too much money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are extremely easy to clean!</li>
            <li> Also easy to clean!</li>
            <li> Love the brushes, and the case is super cute.</li>
            <li> They are soft and rich and she loved the nice case too.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;s one of the best things I&#x27;ve spent my money on!  </li>
            <li> Definitely recommend if you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot but are searching for good brushes!</li>
            <li> Easy to care for.</li>
            <li> easy.  </li>
            <li> Great set of brushes that meets all general application needs.</li>
            <li> Beautiful set of 10 brushes, individually packaged within a satin chocolate case.</li>
            <li> I use bare minerals makeup and these brushes have ensured easy and flawless application at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> and they are fine now.  </li>
            <li> It literally takes me half the time to do my make up because of how flawlessly they help blend it in.</li>
            <li> Amy sent me an email to follow up and see how i was enjoying them as soon as they arrived and was quick to respond with a replacement set after I told her about the problem.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my new brush set!</li>
            <li> I also heard that synthetic hair won&#x27;t waste your products, so it&#x27;s great to know you can get the most out of your products!</li>
            <li> I was happy with the delivery time, and unlike many other reviews, I didn&#x27;t feel the smell was too strong.</li>
            <li> , she&#x27;s nineteen, mentioned that brushes make a huge difference in applying one&#x27;s make up.  </li>
            <li> But over all this would be a great set or someone just starting out with makeup or trying to add some brushes to their collection that won&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> Just perfect for everyday makeup.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Rushes are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Missame is sending a replacement brush free of charge.</li>
            <li> Such a great value.</li>
            <li> And even comes with free shipping.</li>
            <li> I love the bamboo brushes they are worth the buy</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for an amazing product..</li>
            <li> (foundation glides on) and the blush brush really applies blush nicely</li>
            <li> I really enjoy these brushes.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> They are light</li>
            <li> Perfect for everyday makeup and beyond.</li>
            <li> would recommend these brushes to anyone that is looking for cruelty free animal hair make up brushes.</li>
            <li> I found that this set was more useful.</li>
            <li> and these fit the bill.</li>
            <li> The price is fabulous.</li>
            <li> I wanted brushes that were good quality, soft, but still affordable.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making such a great, cruelty-free product!!!</li>
            <li> fabulous!!!They are so soft and feel so good on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the different brush sizes and one of the things I loved about this set, is it had a pamphlet that described each brush and the function for it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The case is perfect; it&#x27;s small, yet easy to travel with</li>
            <li> Yeyy to that first of all!!</li>
            <li> The intro price really can&#x27;t be beat, grab them while you still can!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Oh, I loved the fresh new smell when I got these brushes in the mail!</li>
            <li> I love the little guide that comes with them along with the beautiful satin case.</li>
            <li> I think my favorite of the bunch is the angled eyeshadow one, which is just the right size and texture to give me a nice even layer of shadow on my whole lid in basically one swipe, making quick workday makeup</li>
            <li> And another thing I like is since the tops are light, you can tell when they&#x27;re clean.</li>
            <li> And they work really well, so I am able to apply my makeup more quickly, evenly, and efficiently.</li>
            <li> They are so incredibly soft, the hairs do not fall out, they&#x27;re so easy to wash, and just overall a beautiful set to have!</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes and it seems as if the sizes were customized based on the owner&#x27;s experience with makeup (after she gave me more insight!).</li>
            <li> They come in a cute, functional bag that can fit comfortably in a large cosmetic bag, and they provide a clean, smooth surface.</li>
            <li> You just have make sure you wash them first before you use them(you</li>
            <li> and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> I love this product and highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Well, it was worth every dime!</li>
            <li> (2) One must clean the brushes before using.</li>
            <li> However, I would still clean the brushes before use.</li>
            <li> i liked it , i think it blends well and leaves a very soft finish</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also pretty easy to clean, which speaks well of the quality----generally the cheap brushes I wash</li>
            <li> Bristles are still nice and soft!  </li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft, and I love how they look!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so soft and the handles are fantastic!!</li>
            <li> But I really like the seller, they emailed me for my opinion about the product and kindly reminded me of how to take care of the brushes in a right way.</li>
            <li> seller was very nice and had good customer service, and tried to replace the pouches, but the replacements smelled even worse.</li>
            <li> brushes are great, soft and good quality, I really like them, especially because they are not animal hair.</li>
            <li> The special promo ($4.97) makes me feel like I robbed a bank.</li>
            <li> And the price was right!</li>
            <li> ELF brushes can also be about $3 each, but this set is way higher quality and much more worth it.</li>
            <li> I will do a full review on my blog skynynailartandbeauty.com and</li>
            <li> I love these brushes for the feel and texture of the bristles but the real test was the finished look.</li>
            <li> It put me very at ease and more eager to review this product.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes, they are made very well.</li>
            <li> The coverage is phenomenal and very was to achieve.</li>
            <li> are nice and soft but they do smell like spray paint like others</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought a full set of brushes before.</li>
            <li> I love it so much I&#x27;m thinking about ordering another one for travel.</li>
            <li> I have an easily irritated, sensitive face and these not only do not scratch, but produce beautiful</li>
            <li> The wood is sturdy and shaped to fit in your hand just right</li>
            <li> I had issue with the first set that was sent to me, but the seller was so amazing and reached out to me to send me out a new set!</li>
            <li> Other than that they are great.</li>
            <li> I love my new brushes!  </li>
            <li> They’re an exceptional quality for the price especially.</li>
            <li> A few brushes were still good to use, but MOST of the face brushes were just falling apart.</li>
            <li> Quick to arrive.  </li>
            <li> I think the set is well thought out, the shapes and sizes are all very practical and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The brushes work very well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The brushes are super soft!&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I think this is the only vendor who reaches out to make sure you completely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> The seller was extremely quick to respond and get the issue resolved.</li>
            <li> They do smell but after a quick cleaning its gone.</li>
            <li> They wash up very easy and so far have kept their shape.</li>
            <li> Very soft! :)</li>
            <li> However, functionality of the brushes is definitely high end, but a lot more affordable.</li>
            <li> I really love this purchase and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very nice set of brushes - especially considering the price ( which is very reasonable).&lt;br /&gt;Excellent</li>
            <li> This is my very first brush set</li>
            <li> Very pretty.</li>
            <li> Missame seems to be very interested in customer satisfaction which is also something i look for when buying a product.</li>
            <li> and I really enjoyed the flat top kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> I normally use sephora/clinique brushes and I feel like these brushes are better than both of those brands.  </li>
            <li> I ultimately decided on this set because the reviews were mostly good and the price was a happy medium, with the exact assortment I was looking for to replace my other brushes.  </li>
            <li> I have now been using them for several weeks, and I am very pleased with the quality of these brushes.  </li>
            <li> I love the flat top kabuki-ish brush for buffing in powder, the foundation brush is fab.</li>
            <li> The foundation brushes apply great, but the little brushes are more softer, but I  would definitely purchase more brushes as presents for others.</li>
            <li> High Quality make-up brushes, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re as good as the high end brushes out there and leaves a seamless application.</li>
            <li> am in love with my new brush set.</li>
            <li> Use it daily and love it!  </li>
            <li> I was sent personal emails to notify me of set I could afford, asking how the brushes worked, etc... phenomenal!</li>
            <li> highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> I love how soft these brushes are.!</li>
            <li> The hair is super soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> but to my surprise the owner of missamé contacted me directly and right a was offered to send a new brush and was very understanding and happy to help resolve the issue.</li>
            <li> love makeup brushes with the white tips because it helps you see the makeup on the brush, helps you see that it’s really clean, and just looks cool in contrast.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my purchase, i got high quality brushes,  they are soft but  is a fact</li>
            <li> With mostly positive reviews, I thought it must be worth it!</li>
            <li> So you can fit all of these brushes (or the whole case) on your bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides the above reasons I&#x27;ll keep getting these - the woman I corresponded with was AMAZING.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, I really appreciated the printed brush guide and the free downloadable .pdf</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing they came on time the only problem that I have with them is the case.</li>
            <li> The handles are a smooth, polished wood and give them a real sleek look.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price of the product -</li>
            <li> they are super-soft, and definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> Never had such a nice set</li>
            <li> So worth the money      </li>
            <li> I will add that the powder brush picks up far more powder than I would like it to</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> They are so lush and well made my makeup goes on better and stays on longer.</li>
            <li> I will say they are worth every cent &#x27;</li>
            <li> The set is great, so far haven&#x27;t had any hairs fall out - the problem with my last set.  </li>
            <li> Soft brush and easy to clean...</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I am overwhelmed with each brush and don&#x27;t necessarily need every one, but nice to have extras.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth this price</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these brushes for anyone that wants a really good quality brush set.</li>
            <li> I love how soft these brushes are.</li>
            <li> I bought the set as a  gift,  my  niece loved it,  I  recieved it in a  shorter time  than expected,  well packaged.  </li>
            <li> I find all brushes useful.</li>
            <li> They are amazingly soft brushes, great quality especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth every penny and arrived in record time</li>
            <li> The brushes are very full and super soft.  </li>
            <li> Such a bummer, since they felt really nice right out of the box.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a nice variety of different sizes and angles of shapes of brushes in this set which is why I chose it over other sets and a really good value too.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are easy to clean and you can tell they’re perfectly clean because of the white tips.</li>
            <li> and I admit she was right.  </li>
            <li> Every size is just right.</li>
            <li> The flat top brush in particular, is a favorite -</li>
            <li> I feel like I can&#x27;t give this set a *perfect* review because both the kabuki and the flat-top brush arrived with a few stray hairs that were longer than the rest; I was able to take care of it with manicure scissors in just a minute, but it was a slight \\&quot;quality control\\&quot; concern.</li>
            <li> This is my first professional makeup brush set and it has everything that I need and more.</li>
            <li> These are my first professional brushes and I am so glad I bought them.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used these yet, but I can see that any one can make themselves pretty like skilled professional with these brushes.</li>
            <li> I think I would like the powder/kubuki brush to be a little more dense, but overall they are great.</li>
            <li> They are all very soft and dense, my favorite is the Kabuki brush, which has made applying my mineral foundation so much easier, I&#x27;m never using the brush</li>
            <li> I use bare minerals, so it&#x27;s not the most pricey out there</li>
            <li> Great for travel because I usually so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and compact; great for traveling.</li>
            <li> The carrying case is also really nice, it feels nice and silky-ish, only folds over twice, and ties closed with a ribbon.</li>
            <li> This set would make a great gift as well.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a bit of room for a few other brushes you may own as well in the case, if you roll the case with the additional brushes in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Brushes are pretty decent quality for being pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these because I don&#x27;t really have a large collection of brushes but have never fancied paying a ton of money for a set</li>
            <li> The brushes are high quality they feel nice and solid.</li>
            <li> gave them their first washing before use</li>
            <li> and it shipped really fast!</li>
            <li> so well I find myself pulling for them for my first time make up application,  </li>
            <li> When I finally got to open the package and look at the brushes, it was really nice!</li>
            <li> All the bristles fell out after first use.</li>
            <li> The first time, the product took a year to outgas.</li>
            <li> I saw a better set of brushes at my local drugstore, and I bet those do not stink.</li>
            <li> They seem pretty well made.</li>
            <li> I really should return them!</li>
            <li> Not a lot of manufacturers (especially via Amazon) go the extra mile to make sure the customer is satisfied at all times.</li>
            <li> I also use powder foundation on a daily basis, so the smaller foundation brush is perfect for using at home or if I need to throw it into purse for touch ups later.</li>
            <li> She most definitely loves them!</li>
            <li> Its exactly what im expecting.</li>
            <li> First let me say that these were not for me, but my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> Also interested in seeing what else Missam&amp;eacute; will offer in the future since it&#x27;s now my girlfriend&#x27;s favorite brand.</li>
            <li> Life is short, buy the brushes :)</li>
            <li> No one wants those!  </li>
            <li> The bristles feel soft and comfortable on my face.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and precise.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves them!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really glad I found these vegan brushes at such an affordable price.</li>
            <li> The first time when I received them, I washed the brushes as instructed and one of the brushes&#x27; hair started falling out.</li>
            <li> You do need to wash them first before using.</li>
            <li> This is the first set of brushes I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> But other than that I am satisfied!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will also say that the price for the brushes is pretty inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Love these and can&#x27;t say enough about them.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with these brushes, I have a wide variety of different shapes and sizes, which makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> Super Soft!!  </li>
            <li> Compared to other brushes I&#x27;ve had that shed black fibers all over my face when I used them, that&#x27;s a pretty excellent change.</li>
            <li> &amp; Yes, I followed the directions clearly, and how to clean them before use.</li>
            <li> As good as and in some respects a lot better than expensive</li>
            <li> I love these so much that I reserve them for my personal use.</li>
            <li> I loved how the company actually emailed me shortly after my purchase with support of the product!</li>
            <li> and it was most probably coming from my expensive brushes I&#x27;d loved for years.  </li>
            <li> I will agree with other commenters that the carrying case has a strong chemical smell when first opening the package, which the company even admits to and provides instructions on how to clean it to remove the smell (I appreciate their honesty).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I got such an awesome product for a small price!</li>
            <li> Considering the average price per brush for comparable quality is from $8 - $15 per brush, this is an amazing deal.</li>
            <li> , the manufacturer (Missam&amp;eacute;) was in touch after I made the purchase and during the whole shipping process.</li>
            <li> The brushes stay soft and come clean easily with regular soap--no special/expensive &amp;#34;brush cleaner&amp;#34; required!</li>
            <li> The bristles are so unbelievably soft, full, and have not fallen out at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I can give a good review yet.  </li>
            <li> I washed the new set as instructed right away to see if there is a difference, and there absolutely is!</li>
            <li> I ordered these on special because I thought they were dupes of the Everyday Minerals brushes that I love.</li>
            <li> Super soft brushes with woden ends.</li>
            <li> Also less apt to harbor yucky things in the bristles.</li>
            <li> but I ordered my own without a pouch for much less.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally review things, but wow, these brushes are fantastic.</li>
            <li> Smaller (well shorter) brushes than I&#x27;m used to, but that&#x27;s easy to get over.</li>
            <li> They are super soft</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been shopping around (both in-stores and online) for certain makeup brushes and each were - in my opinion - unreasonably pricey.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend if you travel frequently, they are easy to pack!</li>
            <li> And as a new professional makeup brush user, the brush guide was a HUGE help for me.</li>
            <li> Play with different uses for the brushes and you will find new ways to love them.</li>
            <li> I had to give it 4 stars because my kabuki brushes have many loose bristles even after I washed them.</li>
            <li> They feel very high quality</li>
            <li> The brushes were very soft, and I can definitely tell that the bamboo was of good, lasting quality.</li>
            <li> I even got a personalized, handwritten letter with my recent replacement brush, which was a great little touch.</li>
            <li> This makeup brush set is amazing to use everyday.</li>
            <li> There is only one brush in this set I&#x27;ve yet to use (which is great because when ordering a set, you sometimes get a few duds that you&#x27;ll never need).</li>
            <li> Beauty routine becomes so much easier/quicker when you use missame quality brushes.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them that much.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  </li>
            <li> and I am very grateful.  </li>
            <li> They are all lightweight and work really well.</li>
            <li> she loves them so much.</li>
            <li> They exaggerate way too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and very picky about brushes.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush set.</li>
            <li> As an added bonus, I got free next day delivery.</li>
            <li> They came in fast.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much my wife</li>
            <li> Thanks amy</li>
            <li> I really like the blush brush and the kubuki brush.</li>
            <li> My friends would be stunned to know how much i paid for the set.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The receipt of the request Thanks</li>
            <li> Very professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t shed at all and really hold the product very well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Thanks...</li>
            <li> These brushes are quality brushes I really like them a lot.</li>
            <li> I also really like the carrying case that they come in.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Very gooood</li>
            <li> I will say that the bag has a plastic smell upon arrival, but that really doesn&#x27;t bother me considering the deal.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> , they are of nice quality so don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase these especially if you&#x27;re just starting out with makeup.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft!!!</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes, since the reviews were so positive...</li>
            <li> No shedding and ferrules are still nice and tight!  </li>
            <li> Definitely more than I expected!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a normal valued customer!</li>
            <li> They are so easy to clean and even after use everyday they never dull out or feel scratchy.</li>
            <li> So, as with all of the other reviews, I would agree that this brush set has a very strong distinct odor, but I washed the brushes last night and the odor went away</li>
            <li> know it seems kind of silly, but the only suggestion I have for the seller is to raise the price to $35 or more so additional shopping is not needed for the free shipping since it&#x27;s fulfilled by Amazon directly.</li>
            <li> I just retired a very expensive set of brushes I bought more than 20 years ago that are still good</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to try it due to work, but very excited to.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this brushes and would recommend to absolute anyone.</li>
            <li> I received a special offer for these and got this brush set for only $12.99.  </li>
            <li> I  haven&#x27;t heard anything from  my niece  specially that she&#x27;s very critical when it comes to quality  of  </li>
            <li> Every brush you could possibly need included in this set -- and the price is right!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really soft after the first wash as directed to do before using.</li>
            <li> The brushed are soft and fine, allowing for even distribution of makeup.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how little they cost as I have some where one brush was more than this whole set.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for new brushes, give these a try!</li>
            <li> should with all brushes), You also may have to wash them more then once there was a slight smell with mine</li>
            <li> I love that it came with a black brush pouch.</li>
            <li> They compare to much more expensive brushes and are a way better deal.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them extensively yet, but I&#x27;ve used and washed them a few times and they appear to be good quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my set for only about two weeks, but I already love it, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Very soft!</li>
            <li> , make sure none of the bristles are bent backwards when you close them back up in adorable little tote they come in or they&#x27;ll stay like that next time you use them).</li>
            <li> Most recently I had been using Bare Minerals, which are natural hair brushes--</li>
            <li> I washed my brushes in warm water with just a tiny drop of Bare Minerals Deep Cleansing Foam dissolved within.</li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend them.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that I wish to change would be the size of the kabuki brush and the flat top brush.</li>
            <li> Certainly if you are chemically-sensitive, run far away from these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These brushes have very dense hairs and the hairs themselves are feather soft...</li>
            <li> It offers everything you need, without including too much.</li>
            <li> Thank you #Amy ng for your very prompt and professional service.</li>
            <li> They are extremely soft and I really like the quality and size of the brushes.</li>
            <li> They are ver soft and blend very well</li>
            <li> Those cheap brushes were too rough on my skin and the bristles kept sticking to my face when I put makeup on.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and work very well.</li>
            <li> The powder brushes are very dense and soft.</li>
            <li> give a very evenly professional looking makeup application and blending...</li>
            <li> (Bare Minerals&#x27; brushes are not, unfortunately.)</li>
            <li> Which I happen to do everyday. :)</li>
            <li> Other then that they were fine.</li>
            <li> They had an odd odor when they first arrived, but a good wash and a few days air</li>
            <li> I have used the brushes in both dry and wet applications, they are amazing</li>
            <li> The case is compact and easy to carry as a basic make-up essential.</li>
            <li> The bristles as stated above are super soft and do not fall out like some lower quality brushes ive purchased on here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for 4 months and any time I need new brushes, I&#x27;ll be buying Missame.</li>
            <li> So I thought I&#x27;d try some new brushes.  </li>
            <li> I wash them when they need it and they look like new again.  </li>
            <li> , I just unfortunatley will have to find a new case to put my brushes in because I won&#x27;t use them if I have to touch the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell of the brushes didn&#x27;t bother me,  they smelled like a new product.  </li>
            <li> and she sent me new brushes.</li>
            <li> Works well, the bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and do not shed.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft and seem well made.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are high quality and incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> Very soft on the skin, versatile set -</li>
            <li> Very soft.</li>
            <li> Very soft, non-irritating</li>
            <li> Missame&#x27;s brushes are both cruelty-free and vegan, which are two major reasons I chose this particular seller, aside from the high quality.</li>
            <li> They are so soft!  </li>
            <li> The brushes are really soft!</li>
            <li> As directed, I washed them prior to first use and have had no problems at all.</li>
            <li> did have an issue with the first set of brushed I received as some of the brushes were shedding.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft!</li>
            <li> I love the small compact case they come in.</li>
            <li> I was most excited about the brushes not leaving random strands everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> you first open it, it has a plastic smell to it, but as soon as you wash the case and brushes (as they recommend)</li>
            <li> I used the Missame&#x27; brushes for the first time this morning and wasn&#x27;t too impress; especially with my foundation and concealer application.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft comparable to the eco tools brush line!</li>
            <li> This is more of a personal preference of mine as I don&#x27;t think any other customers felt this way when they received their product.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> They are so soft!</li>
            <li> The smell was quite strong when I received the brushes, however the smell has since gone away in the few days</li>
            <li> This set had every type of brush I need for a natural, basic full face make-up, including five different brushes for just eyes, including a blending brush.</li>
            <li> I used the same mild baby shampoo that I always use to clean the brushes (since they had that &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; smell to them), but I&#x27;m not sure whether the hair on some of these brushes are just not stuck on well, or whether I&#x27;m washing incorrectly...</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not big nor super tiny.</li>
            <li> Handles feel a little cheap - but not a deal breaker.  </li>
            <li> :) It was like buying a little present for yourself.</li>
            <li> I cleaned my brushes the other day super thoroughly</li>
            <li> There is also a clear brush guide, so you know which brush is designed for what.</li>
            <li> It applies my liquid foundation seamlessly.</li>
            <li> Before I used them I noticed that they were really soft with sturdy handles.</li>
            <li> I aired out the pouches for 40 days, perfumed them, washed them twice, nothing has helped because they are made of vinyl.</li>
            <li> This is a complete set of quality brushes for the eyes and face, including foundation brushes, blending brushes, eye brushes, and even a kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> And this is a whole set of white tip brushes.</li>
            <li> Really soft brushes.</li>
            <li> I use them quite frequently and wish it were longer.</li>
            <li> so I was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> After washing them, the brush hairs were just as soft.</li>
            <li> The brushes work really well, especially with blending.</li>
            <li> They are so soft.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin, so soft and even bristles</li>
            <li> They are so soft and do not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> have never had a brush so so soft on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am a professional make up artist( I&#x27;m not paid for this review and don&#x27;t have anything to do with the company)</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and haven&#x27;t shed at all.</li>
            <li> They are extremely soft and not one hair has shed.</li>
            <li> Soft brushes.</li>
            <li> The bridles are soft but not flimsy.</li>
            <li> and the bristles are extremely soft (like really soft</li>
            <li> A young girl, I say young because I&#x27;m in my forties</li>
            <li> I did not notice any chemical smell when I first received the set, but I am not sensitive to issues like that.  </li>
            <li> I just began using them and already got the professional look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Truly professional look, without any professional talent.</li>
            <li> The brush set was complete.  </li>
            <li> I have so far tried the blush and powder brush.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soooo soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used some of the face brushes so far</li>
            <li> Extremely soft, but not flimsy.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a girl, I do have to say the brushes are amazingly soft...</li>
            <li> like rabbit fur soft...</li>
            <li> No shedding and soft</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft, polished wood finish handles and a brush for every make up task.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t express how much of a difference the quality of these brushes makes in the ease of applying and overall finish of my makeup.</li>
            <li> I sprayed mine with apple cider vinegar, then washed it in the sink with hand soap, and the smell was completely removed.</li>
            <li> I have washed them and they held up and are still soft.</li>
            <li> Soft, nice-looking makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> These make-up brushes are incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> They are really soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and attribute it to having exzema.</li>
            <li> The bristles haven&#x27;t given me any fall out and they are soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles are so, so soft.</li>
            <li> and they feel really soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and the ferrule is sturdy.</li>
            <li> With the M.A.C brushes, it only takes one application or two at the very most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used a couple so far and like them.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft.  </li>
            <li> It is absolutely classy with its&#x27; silk soft make up carrier.</li>
            <li> Really soft.</li>
            <li> and I have quite sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> Also, I find the eyeliner brush to be a bit too thick for doing nice defined lining, but that may just be personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I washed them with baby shampoo first and let them dry on their sides as instructed.  </li>
            <li> That is the main thing I look for in brushes, especially for my eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I first received them, I was really excited about the delicate packaging and individually wrapped brushes.</li>
            <li> High quality and very low price.</li>
            <li> Purchased for travel but have high hopes for quality based on visual appearance.</li>
            <li> I was looking high and low for a travel brush set</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t keep the case brushes come in because they are usually cheap</li>
            <li> (Personally, I have a hard time touching silk items, I can&#x27;t describe it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try out the whole set for the next 2 weeks and do the multiple washing test to see how the hold up.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but for $40, the product had better be ready to use out of the package.</li>
            <li> Considering that it was my first time washing them, I can&#x27;t imagine them lasting for that long...</li>
            <li> the brush handles are thick and study, makes it easy to apply makeup.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are super soft and fluffy!</li>
            <li> Brushes are worth the price without the pouch, but I have to knock off a star due to having no way to properly store the brushes.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use my brushes until a couple of days later though because I was busy with school and stuff.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a complete set.</li>
            <li> They are soft but sturdy enough to hold the powder.</li>
            <li> I bought this set to replace my Bare Minerals brushes, which I have had for almost 8 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 52 and have ordered and purchased hundred of makeup brushes and even spent as much $90 for each brush and</li>
            <li> My only issue is that they&#x27;re natural, in a day when we&#x27;re leaning toward synthetic products.  </li>
            <li> Noticed slight shedding after first wash, but what else would you expect with synthetic bristles?</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this set is of equal quality with Ulta&#x27;s I.T. line of brushes, which is also of very high, professional quality, but for an average of $24 per brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the good far outweighs the bad, and I have no other complaints about the actual use of the brushes.</li>
            <li> They are very soft, and I have not noticed any bristles falling out of any of the brushes despite using them daily and washing them several times, with some brushes being washed daily.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t exact (Kabukis aren&#x27;t quite as thick) but they are far softer!</li>
            <li> My other worry was that the bamboo stick would make the brushes look not as high end</li>
            <li> I have used several different brands of makeup brushes, including Clinique, Mac, Bare Minerals, and lots of drug-store brands.</li>
            <li> - the handles aren&#x27;t loose, the bristles are soft and they don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> quality was okay, but the smells was very bad, full of chemical!</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with the flat top brush in the set.</li>
            <li> She loves how not only are the brushes synthetic and softer (assuming other brushes use animal hair?), but also the light bamboo handle is higher quality and less common than the other brands out there.</li>
            <li> I seriously got my money&#x27;s worth with this set.</li>
            <li> Here in my hot little hands way before they were due here.</li>
            <li> It has been a while since I bought this set, only because I&#x27;m not a frequent make up user.</li>
            <li> These will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I also really like the size and feel of the handles, which are substantial without being too long; I need to be very close to the mirror when I do my makeup due to poor eyesight, and so long-handled brushes end up continually bumping into my mirror, and that&#x27;s not an issue with these.</li>
            <li> Not a single hair fell from any brush other than my concealer brush (which is being replaced at no charge)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It came in a day earlier than I had expected</li>
            <li> I use all of the brushes for my everyday makeup they&#x27;re soft, they don&#x27;t shed but they did come with a paint smell</li>
            <li> but minus the animal since these are technically vegan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> had a minor issue with one brush.</li>
            <li> but I guess I&#x27;ll be keeping them for however long</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s so soft tho , so if u were searching for something a little bit rough for blending that&#x27;s not the set for u</li>
            <li> Looked more expensive than price too!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t go back to any other brushes but these for applying my make up.</li>
            <li> Laid the brushes out to dry and the smell is all gone and the sent of them now is</li>
            <li> I left the case outside overnight while the brushes dried inside and have had no scent problems since.</li>
            <li> I have have lots of brushes, but a few of my staple brushes were starting to get loose handles and starting to shed.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and normally have a bad reaction to new beauty products.</li>
            <li> So wanting to bring my makeup game to the next level, I started shopping around for new brushes; I looked at some cheap ones and I looked at some expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> There are all of the brushes that you will needed without the filler and fluff that some sets put in just to up their brush count like the foam applicator or mascara wand on the long handle.  </li>
            <li> Saw these those brushes read all the reviews and thought what do I have to loose?</li>
            <li> AND if you need a replacement brush later on down the line they&#x27;ll work with you to maintain your satisfaction.</li>
            <li> They have ABSOLUTELY NO SMELL now after a single washing and neither does the case after a rub down with a moist wash cloth with the same soap.</li>
            <li> The apication results of these brushes are equal to, if not better, that the brands listened above.</li>
            <li> The second time, the product never got rid of the stink after outgassing for a year and a half on my porch.</li>
            <li> Well, after using my brushes from Ulta and Target, I realized my eyelids were becaming very dry and irritated, once they became puffy.</li>
            <li> , they were very soft and fluffy!!</li>
            <li> I got my brushes in the mail earlier than I expected!!!</li>
            <li> hated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked at how well made these were and love the case.  </li>
            <li> I received quality brushes as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used plenty of cheap brushes from Wal-Mart and Target, but was left disappointed.</li>
            <li> It appears that the brushes soak up the liquid foundation/concealer such that very little is transferred to the skin.  </li>
            <li> The second thing I noticed was that the carrying case looked very classy and expensive.</li>
            <li> like what other people were saying in there reviews.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but after reading the reviews, I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I just received them the other day and couldn&#x27;t wait to try them out.</li>
            <li> other than that they look and feel like the description says.</li>
            <li> As some other reviewers have said, they do come with a scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other (smaller) brush sets in the past, and they just didn&#x27;t meet all of my needs.</li>
            <li> Like other reviews said, there was a manufacturing smell when I received it, but I didn&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> As a result, some of the bristles of the brushes start to rub up against the other brushes or rub up against the pouch and they can start fraying or become misshapened.</li>
            <li> but it is an investment and obviously less expensive than some of the higher end cosmetic brushes</li>
            <li> only gripe is that the brush pouch fits the brushes a little too &amp;#34;perfectly,&amp;#34; as in there&#x27;s very little to no room for the brushes to move around.</li>
            <li> The new product smell wasn&#x27;t near as bad as I anticipated from other reviews I had read.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing was the ad said a guide would come with the set and there was no guide.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is I didn&#x27;t receive instructions for each brush as indicated on the description page but that didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that the case doesn&#x27;t have a Velcro closer.  </li>
            <li> The case rolls up to be small for travel but for everyday I just leave it open on my dresser which is so convenient.  </li>
            <li> after a wash and few days out of the packaging, there is absolutely no packaging smell, so no worries.</li>
            <li> Yes there is a slight</li>
            <li> For some reason the case has an odd odor of melted plastic.</li>
            <li> The brushes have to be dried upside down.</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes a little over a year ago.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a little disappointed that these brushes haven&#x27;t (thus far) met the standard that I expected.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I have been uses these for a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> I bought these for my girlfriend for Christmas and everyday since then</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not cheap.  </li>
            <li> I did leave them laid out for a few days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these babies nearly everyday for almost 3 weeks now.</li>
            <li> Have had them for a few months now and have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I did let the brushes air out for a few days before washing and using.</li>
            <li> would recommend this 100% to anyone who wears makeup everyday.</li>
            <li> what a waste of $ after using and cleaning these brushes for a month...</li>
            <li> but a few of the brushes were shedding quite a lot.</li>
            <li> My only issue was that a few of the brushes were packaged poorly so the bristles are bent.</li>
            <li> I have use them everyday for the past month</li>
            <li> Ordered them&#x27; yes they did have a smell&#x27;but nothing a little shampoo and hair conditioner couldn&#x27;t fix!</li>
            <li> and i mean slight odor, but it never bothered me.  </li>
            <li> It was very little shading</li>
            <li> Lets face it, in 2014 not many companies take the time to that sort of thing.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this was an error or if it doesn&#x27;t come with the order.</li>
            <li> Not sure what happened,</li>
            <li> I mean very little.  </li>
            <li> so I think I&#x27;ve used almost all of them at least once.  </li>
            <li> Even thick concealer comes off without issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was afraid they would be smelly, due to the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they may last :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always owned MAC, SmashBox and Victoria&#x27;s Secret brushes.</li>
            <li> overall reaction of this brush set: crap quality, meaning \\&quot;F.\\</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed, because I carefully read through the reviews.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say no more!!!!</li>
            <li> She already owned two expensive MAC brushes, and does not see a difference between these and those.</li>
            <li> These brushes beat the expensive ones you find at the mall.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t as insane as some of these other viewers posted.</li>
            <li> The only thing bad is the smell of the brown travel case, just a horrible oily smell</li>
            <li> Still afraid to put them on my face.</li>
            <li> the were scratchy and shed like crazy.  </li>
            <li> All these 5-Star reviews can&#x27;t be wrong!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very skeptical about this brush set.  </li>
            <li> but they aren&#x27;t really bad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the smell is that bad</li>
            <li> but maybe I got a bad batch?</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> I opened the package, and this awful, gasoline-y, toxic smell came from the package.</li>
            <li> Disgusting.</li>
            <li> Opening the package was the worst chemical smell.</li>
            <li> Buy this product you won&#x27;t be disappointed! !</li>

            <li> I love, love, love these brushes! I own a $40 MAC brush to apply my liquid foundation and honestly, I can&#x27;t stand it in comparison to these brushes. These brushes have very dense hairs and the hairs themselves are feather soft... I just love how they feel on my skin. I am obsessed with the flat top brush in the set. It applies my liquid foundation seamlessly. Also, the customer service is on point! They will follow-up with you once they show you&#x27;ve received the brushes to ensure you feel like you got what you paid for AND if you need a replacement brush later on down the line they&#x27;ll work with you to maintain your satisfaction. I even got a personalized, handwritten letter with my recent replacement brush, which was a great little touch. Lets face it, in 2014 not many companies take the time to that sort of thing. Purchase, purchase, purchase... you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I got my brushes in the mail earlier than I expected!!! Yeyy to that first of all!! Then I proceeded to wash them as instructed, after drying for a couple days, they were very soft and fluffy!! My makeup application was beautiful and I love the contouring brush!! Hope they last me forever!! I would recommend these to everyone!!</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes!! Love them! They are very nice &amp; affordable!</li>
            <li> Amazing Brush Set! Beauty routine becomes so much easier/quicker when you use missame quality brushes. Customer Service send out a care letter included with package as well as follow up message....very helpful tips on how to take care of the set. Very happy with my purchase! Thank You!</li>
            <li> These are great makeup brushes for the price. You just have make sure you wash them first before you use them(you should with all brushes), You also may have to wash them more then once there was a slight smell with mine but nothing  like what other people were saying in there reviews. Other then that they were fine. It was very little shading I mean very little.  After I wash the brushes the smell went away. Before I used them I noticed that they were really soft with sturdy handles. The design of the brushes reminded me of tarte makeup brushes. Some of the brushes are sorter then standered makeup brushes making the good for travel and fit easily into a makeup bag. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them that much. Just 2 eye brushes and those picked up product well. I&#x27;m going to try out the whole set for the next 2 weeks and do the multiple washing test to see how the hold up. I will do a full review on my blog skynynailartandbeauty.com and then up date my review post here with more info. But over all this would be a great set or someone just starting out with makeup or trying to add some brushes to their collection that won&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> Great product. High quality. Super soft brushes with woden ends. My makeup glides on easily with the perfect amount of color. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love them as if now! Noticed slight shedding after first wash, but what else would you expect with synthetic bristles?</li>
            <li> I received a special offer for these and got this brush set for only $12.99.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  After given the brushes a try I am in love!  They are so soft!  That is the main thing I look for in brushes, especially for my eye makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I gave them their first washing before use so we will see how well they hold up after repeated washes.</li>
            <li> brushes are great, soft and good quality, I really like them, especially because they are not animal hair. bought two sets, one was a gift - but the pouch has a very strong smell of chemicals, so I couldn&#x27;t give the gift with the pouch, and had to find a gift box they would fit into. I aired out the pouches for 40 days, perfumed them, washed them twice, nothing has helped because they are made of vinyl. seller was very nice and had good customer service, and tried to replace the pouches, but the replacements smelled even worse. Brushes are worth the price without the pouch, but I have to knock off a star due to having no way to properly store the brushes. If you don&#x27;t care about the pouch, then no problem. But I was specifically looking for a set with storage/travel pouch.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LOVE THIS PRODUCT. It has elevated the way my makeup routine and I am very grateful.  I took a chance with this vendor and will be coming back to shop there again.  Well worth the price of the product - and it shipped really fast!</li>
            <li> They are so soft and make up goes on beautifully</li>
            <li> This is a complete set of quality brushes for the eyes and face, including foundation brushes, blending brushes, eye brushes, and even a kabuki brush. It offers everything you need, without including too much. So you can fit all of these brushes (or the whole case) on your bathroom counter. There are also two smaller brushes, which are especially great for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love makeup brushes with the white tips because it helps you see the makeup on the brush, helps you see that it’s really clean, and just looks cool in contrast. And this is a whole set of white tip brushes. The handles are a nice quality and feel good in the hand. They are all lightweight and work really well. The bristles are so unbelievably soft, full, and have not fallen out at all. The brushes are easy to clean and you can tell they’re perfectly clean because of the white tips. The carrying case is also really nice, it feels nice and silky-ish, only folds over twice, and ties closed with a ribbon. There is also a clear brush guide, so you know which brush is designed for what. Perfection. And they work really well, so I am able to apply my makeup more quickly, evenly, and efficiently. This can make your makeup look better, even when you’re in a rush. I think it’s safe to say that these are the nicest makeup brushes I’ve ever gotten. They’re an exceptional quality for the price especially.</li>
            <li> Really good quality stuff</li>
            <li> Really soft brushes. I love them!</li>
            <li> Excellent price. High Quality make-up brushes, easy to clean. I had been looking for shorter brushes and these are perfect for travel and save me room in my bathroom. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but after reading the reviews, I gave it a try. The bag is so cute! I love how it has a brush guide for each brushes. The brushes are really soft! They&#x27;re not big nor super tiny. Just perfect for everyday makeup. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and everything&#x27;s still intact! Best purchase so far!</li>
            <li> The brushes are beautiful and almost perfect! My only issue was that a few of the brushes were packaged poorly so the bristles are bent. I&#x27;ve tried everything and nothing is fixing them. Otherwise, the remaining 5 or 6 are fantastic!! My makeup looks beautifully blended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting used to these brushes, but I&#x27;m enjoying the look I&#x27;m getting when using them.&lt;br /&gt;I was hounding the internet trying to find out what each brush is for, and overlooked that there&#x27;s an insert giving you that important tip.&lt;br /&gt;Great price, cute case as well.</li>
            <li> I did alot of research before purchasing these brushes. I wanted brushes that were good quality, soft, but still affordable. I think for the price, it exceeded expectations. I love that this company stands against animal cruelty and genuinely cares about their customers opinions. This is my very first brush set and I am not disappointed. The only thing that I wish to change would be the size of the kabuki brush and the flat top brush. I use them quite frequently and wish it were longer. My other worry was that the bamboo stick would make the brushes look not as high end, so I was overall hesitant to purchase this brush set. However, functionality of the brushes is definitely high end, but a lot more affordable. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love my Missame brush set, I purchased the brush set to carry in my purse for touch up applications but the brushes is constructed so well I find myself pulling for them for my first time make up application,  I love the feel of the brushes and the packaging is awesome.</li>
            <li> It has been a while since I bought this set, only because I&#x27;m not a frequent make up user. Anyway, the shipping was awesome! It came in a day earlier than I had expected so I was very pleasantly surprised. I couldn&#x27;t use my brushes until a couple of days later though because I was busy with school and stuff. When I finally got to open the package and look at the brushes, it was really nice! The brushes are super soft and fluffy! After washing them, the brush hairs were just as soft. The brushes work really well, especially with blending. I definitely would recommend this to others!</li>
            <li> Love my new brushes they are very good for the price a paid.</li>
            <li> Love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very skeptical about this brush set.  I have always used animal hair brushes that are quite pricey so the synthetic was a bit worrying and I thought it would be like some of the drugstore brushes which I have tried and hated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked at how well made these were and love the case.  The proof was in the application and these are amazing.  As good as and in some respects a lot better than expensive brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been uses these for a few weeks now.  No shedding of bristles.  Easy to clean.  And still great application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> Wonderful brushes...they are super-soft, and definitely worth buying. I don&#x27;t know how I used to apply make-up without them before! Thank you Amy Ng...and amazing customer service!. Definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these brushes! I just received them the other day and couldn&#x27;t wait to try them out. I use bare minerals makeup and these brushes have ensured easy and flawless application at a reasonable price. The bristles are so soft, the handles are sturdy, the case is perfect for storing them and to top it off, I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding! The new product smell wasn&#x27;t near as bad as I anticipated from other reviews I had read. As directed, I washed them prior to first use and have had no problems at all. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased these brushes and have even referred some friends to them. Thank you Missame and Amazon!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for the price. I think I would like the powder/kubuki brush to be a little more dense, but overall they are great. Definitely recommend if you travel frequently, they are easy to pack!</li>
            <li> I love these makeup brushes. They are so soft. Using a quality brush makes all the difference in your final makeup look. These are possibly the best makeup brushes I have found in this price range. They compare to much more expensive brushes and are a way better deal. I have really sensitive skin, so soft and even bristles are very important to me. Would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a complete set.</li>
            <li> These brushes are absolutely gorgeous  Never had such a nice set and I&#x27;ve had a lot of brushes.  Best part no loose hairs</li>
            <li> it looks so good but i haven&#x27;t try!!!</li>
            <li> Great brushes at a reasonable price. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These brushes work great with my make-up and are very easy to clean. Totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> Very strong smell&lt;br /&gt;Bristles fall out with each use</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;m glad the kit came with a description for each brush.</li>
            <li> AMAZING! Superseded my expectation. Theses brushes feel great and the blend very well. I&#x27;ve always owned MAC, SmashBox and Victoria&#x27;s Secret brushes. The apication results of these brushes are equal to, if not better, that the brands listened above.</li>
            <li> Love them! They are such a great value and my makeup goes on perfectly! Thanks for making such a great, cruelty-free product!!!</li>
            <li> They are so soft and do not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> EDITED UPDATED ! PLEASE READ !  These brushes are amazing.I had issue with the first set that was sent to me, but the seller was so amazing and reached out to me to send me out a new set! I washed the new set as instructed right away to see if there is a difference, and there absolutely is! These are the most amazing and softest brushes! The seller is super amazing and sweet, and these have lifetime warranty! So worth the money      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I got a good use of them 1 time. All the bristles fell out after first use. Literally imagine your foundation on your face with lots of tiny hairs. &amp; Yes, I followed the directions clearly, and how to clean them before use. One of the brushes top silver part even fell of the handle ):  I&#x27;m so disappointed, because I carefully read through the reviews. &amp; Thought this would&#x27;ve been a good purchase. Even brushes at CVS gets more uses before stuff starts falling apart and breaking.  I bought this in November I believe, and hadn&#x27;t opened it until Christmas. I thought I would give it some time to review. A few brushes were still good to use, but MOST of the face brushes were just falling apart. T_T</li>
            <li> I bought these for my girlfriend for Christmas and everyday since then she has thanked me. she loves them so much.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Even my husband noticed the improvement of my make-up application...and that is saying something.  He HATES make-up!  Nicely packaged.  I am looking forward to even better results as well, I travel a lot and the travel case is very handy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like.  All too small...not the best quality.</li>
            <li> Quick to arrive.  Brushes are even better than I thought they&#x27;d be so I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.  Use it daily and love it!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Rushes are fantastic.  Great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> Wonderful set of brushes. I LOVE them and inexpensive ......</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!! I tried a friend&#x27;s on a whim as I&#x27;d forgotten mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had a brush so so soft on my skin. I have an easily irritated, sensitive face and these not only do not scratch, but produce beautiful results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are extremely easy to clean! Even thick concealer comes off without issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the above reasons I&#x27;ll keep getting these - the woman I corresponded with was AMAZING. She went above and beyond to gice me a great experience! I was sent personal emails to notify me of set I could afford, asking how the brushes worked, etc... phenomenal! Not to mention they are packaged beautifully and extremely high quality.</li>
            <li> I feel like I can&#x27;t give this set a *perfect* review because both the kabuki and the flat-top brush arrived with a few stray hairs that were longer than the rest; I was able to take care of it with manicure scissors in just a minute, but it was a slight \\&quot;quality control\\&quot; concern. Also, I find the eyeliner brush to be a bit too thick for doing nice defined lining, but that may just be personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the good far outweighs the bad, and I have no other complaints about the actual use of the brushes. I also really like the size and feel of the handles, which are substantial without being too long; I need to be very close to the mirror when I do my makeup due to poor eyesight, and so long-handled brushes end up continually bumping into my mirror, and that&#x27;s not an issue with these. I think my favorite of the bunch is the angled eyeshadow one, which is just the right size and texture to give me a nice even layer of shadow on my whole lid in basically one swipe, making quick workday makeup even easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I really appreciated the printed brush guide and the free downloadable .pdf that goes into more depth about makeup techniques (available if you register on the manufacturer&#x27;s website). This was a really solid purchase, and one that I would make again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these brushes! I am a professional make up artist( I&#x27;m not paid for this review and don&#x27;t have anything to do with the company) I think the set is well thought out, the shapes and sizes are all very practical and easy to clean. Also less apt to harbor yucky things in the bristles.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! Great quality! Good price! Excellent customer service team who wants you to be fully satisfied.  I am!!</li>
            <li> My mother wanted my makeup brushes so instead of giving her mine I wanted her to have her very own. I love that it came with a black brush pouch. I wish I saw this for myself but I ordered my own without a pouch for much less. It was $9 free shipping!! So it was not a loss in the end. We are both happy now!! The brushes work very well and is easy to clean. I will add that the powder brush picks up far more powder than I would like it to but it distributes the powder on my face evenly...</li>
            <li> High quality and very low price. The brushes are soft and haven&#x27;t shed at all. There are some reviews that say they smell but they aren&#x27;t really bad. You just have to wash them. They exaggerate way too much. You will not regret buying these brushes. I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and very picky about brushes. I am very satisfied!</li>
            <li> My wife love her brushes.</li>
            <li> Great deal and just what I asked for!</li>
            <li> I ordered the make up brushes for one of my granddaughters. She loves the brushes!! Very pleased with of quality of them!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this brush set. The quality is amazing and the price unbeatable. Happy customer here :)</li>
            <li> Good brushes these are ! Happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Absolutely love my Missame brushes. They are extremely soft and not one hair has shed. Great product</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes a little over a year ago.  They have held up great! No shedding and ferrules are still nice and tight!  Bristles are still nice and soft!  I loved the danty holder they arrived in.  Great for protecting the brushes during travel.  Also love the bamboo handles.  Very pretty. I love these so much that I reserve them for my personal use.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! The Kabuki brush&#x27;s bristles started falling out shortly after I started using it. Missame is sending a replacement brush free of charge. Excellent service, excellent product, excellent price. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set of brushes and I am so happy with the quality and the price was very reasonable. I am very happy with the customer service they provided me. I contacted them about replacing one of the brushes and they replaced at no extra cost to me. I highly recommend it to anyone. Thank you #Amy ng for your very prompt and professional service.</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes at a great price. ALso great  customer service!</li>
            <li> Beautifully assembled and complete makeup brush set.  Incredible customer service follow up by manufacturer to assess satisfaction with set.  Outstanding care instructions!  Purchased for travel but have high hopes for quality based on visual appearance. Great price even if they don&#x27;t last.  Note this is not a mini travel set</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! They are soft but sturdy enough to hold the powder. This was definitely a great buy. I also like that they contact you when the package is delivered to make sure that it arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li> Great brush set. Worth the money. Soft brushes. Got to me in 2 days. Love it! B</li>
            <li> Great brush set! Very soft!</li>
            <li> i really liked the brushes. soft and easy to use. great price!&lt;br /&gt;it would be nice if the set can have one lipstick brush.  highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally review things, but wow, these brushes are fantastic. Best thing about them - they don&#x27;t shed!! I cleaned my brushes the other day super thoroughly and they didn&#x27;t shed at all. Compared to other brushes I&#x27;ve had that shed black fibers all over my face when I used them, that&#x27;s a pretty excellent change. And another thing I like is since the tops are light, you can tell when they&#x27;re clean. I&#x27;ve had these for 4 months and any time I need new brushes, I&#x27;ll be buying Missame.</li>
            <li> Works well, the bristles are very soft. Cute packaging.</li>
            <li> Smaller (well shorter) brushes than I&#x27;m used to, but that&#x27;s easy to get over. I&#x27;ve only used &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; makeup brushes, and these are the best by far.  Superior quality, well worth the investment.  As an added bonus, I got free next day delivery.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. I love the little guide that comes with them along with the beautiful satin case. They are high quality. So glad I purchased them!</li>
            <li> I opened the package, and this awful, gasoline-y, toxic smell came from the package. The brushes stink to high-heaven. I have smelled this smell only twice before. The first time, the product took a year to outgas. The second time, the product never got rid of the stink after outgassing for a year and a half on my porch. I know that smell. This is the sort of smell that one does not wash out. (2) One must clean the brushes before using. Why? Because the manuafacturer chose to release these brushes without doing a proper job on them -- lazybones. Sorry, but for $40, the product had better be ready to use out of the package. (3) These brushes are high maintenance. Wash after every use? No way. (4) The brushes have to be dried upside down. Did they tell prospective Buyers before purchase? No. (5) The brushes are a lot smaller than Buyer is led to believe. (6) I saw a better set of brushes at my local drugstore, and I bet those do not stink. I will be purchasing those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall reaction of this brush set: crap quality, meaning \\&quot;F.\\&quot; This brush set is going back to Amazon. Certainly if you are chemically-sensitive, run far away from these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not understand how so many people can like these brushes. I wonder if a lot of these reviews are padded. These brushes have the cooties. Disgusting.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these brushes! I use them with my face contouring kit and it works perfectly! Very soft! :)</li>
            <li> I have already returned. I did not like quality of brushes. Hair flimsy, and smaller than I thought when I received them. I would not recommend. 1 star</li>
            <li> So far a very nice set of brushes, in a nicely packaged ensemble!</li>
            <li> Definitely good quality for the price. I don&#x27;t have any complaints. I don&#x27;t think the smell is that bad and it goes away after washing.</li>
            <li> These brushes are actually amazing. They came in the mail within 2 days after ordering. They came in fast. I absolutely love them. If you&#x27;re looking for good quality brushes, these are it!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes for the feel and texture of the bristles but the real test was the finished look. Exactly what I&#x27;d hoped for and a great price, too.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very nice. The bridles are soft but not flimsy. I usually don&#x27;t keep the case brushes come in because they are usually cheap and I have my own, but this one is very nice and I decided to leave the brushes in it.</li>
            <li> great brushes. gf was very happy with them</li>
            <li> Wonderful brushes! I was so excited to get these because I don&#x27;t really have a large collection of brushes but have never fancied paying a ton of money for a set however I was very pleased with these brushes and for the price that they are, they are of nice quality so don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase these especially if you&#x27;re just starting out with makeup.</li>
            <li> I washed them like three times and have had them airing our for a month. Still afraid to put them on my face. They smell like poison. other than that they look and feel like the description says.</li>
            <li> Incredibly nice brushes and great roll up holder. I now look forward to putting on my makeup at the brushes make it almost a spa experience. They are so lush and well made my makeup goes on better and stays on longer. I really love this purchase and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Got for my gf as a gift. She seems to love them. They seem pretty well made.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much my wife she&#x27;s happy with the product</li>
            <li> Love it!!! I can&#x27;t say no more!!!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited about getting this brushes but when I received it and tried it on , it just started pulling off almost immediately but great customer service though .. Thanks amy</li>
            <li> Good set for a very reasonable price. I am no makeup expert but this is serving my purpose while I am learning.</li>
            <li> I freakin love these brushes, I&#x27;ve had them for about a month and I am completely satisfied. The look and feel of them is wonderful. The wood is sturdy and shaped to fit in your hand just right and the bristles are extremely soft (like really soft, make sure none of the bristles are bent backwards when you close them back up in adorable little tote they come in or they&#x27;ll stay like that next time you use them). I&#x27;m very impressed with quality and the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have an issue with the first set of brushed I received as some of the brushes were shedding. Amy sent me an email to follow up and see how i was enjoying them as soon as they arrived and was quick to respond with a replacement set after I told her about the problem. She has provided some of the best customer service I&#x27;ve come across and really cares about the satisfaction of her customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PICK THESE!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my purchase, i got high quality brushes,  they are soft but  is a fact, the smell is like a spray paint or gum and disappeared when I washed them as the seller advice. Delivery was fast and excellent follow up costumer satisfacción by the seller.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for make up brushes for some time and if I did find them they were to exspensive.So decidedto look on amazon&#x27;glad I did! Saw these those brushes read all the reviews and thought what do I have to loose? Ordered them&#x27; yes they did have a smell&#x27;but nothing a little shampoo and hair conditioner couldn&#x27;t fix! Laid the brushes out to dry and the smell is all gone and the sent of them now is fabulous!!!They are so soft and feel so good on my skin. I will say they are worth every cent &#x27;honestly I would buy another set if I needed to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonya</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed. The brushes are high quality they feel nice and solid. The hairs stay on they don&#x27;t shed all over my face. I just love them</li>
            <li> Very good quality. No chemical smell (I sent another set back because of the smell).</li>
            <li> A young girl, I say young because I&#x27;m in my forties, she&#x27;s nineteen, mentioned that brushes make a huge difference in applying one&#x27;s make up.  I didn&#x27;t pay much attention, but this was coming from a girl that always had her make up on and looked good.  So I thought I&#x27;d try some new brushes.  I bought the Missame set after reading reviews on Amazon and I admit she was right.  My make up goes on more smoothly and looks as though it has blended  better.  I use bare minerals, so it&#x27;s not the most pricey out there but it&#x27;s not cheap.  The brushes make a huge difference! I did not notice any chemical smell when I first received the set, but I am not sensitive to issues like that.  I did leave them laid out for a few days just incase, but have no issues at all.  The brushes are great.  I appreciate that they sent a manual on what brushes to use for different applications, not that I do that but it was good to have an idea.  If you&#x27;re looking for new brushes, give these a try!</li>
            <li> Fantastic tools for the best makeup. I just began using them and already got the professional look.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend them without hesitation . Love them.</li>
            <li> I was eager to purchase this because it was supposed to be an eco-friendly product. I haven&#x27;t used the brushes yet and was inclined to return them because the sheer smell from them was making me nauseous. Opening the package was the worst chemical smell. I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was makeup case or the brushes but it reeked. I put them in a room and haven&#x27;t used them yet. I really should return them!</li>
            <li> I seriously got my money&#x27;s worth with this set. This is my first professional makeup brush set and it has everything that I need and more. The travel case for the brushes is really cute and will probably come in handy (though it smells a bit like paint?). And as a new professional makeup brush user, the brush guide was a HUGE help for me. Otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t know what the heck I was doing with which brush. The quality of these brushes is incredible. The hair is super soft and easy to clean. I&#x27;ve been using these babies nearly everyday for almost 3 weeks now. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so soft tho , so if u were searching for something a little bit rough for blending that&#x27;s not the set for u&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But i liked it , i think it blends well and leaves a very soft finish</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! Great quality, nice packaging, awesome brush guide and you can find how to care for them with a video on YouTube as well as Missame website. I loved how the company actually emailed me shortly after my purchase with support of the product! A great company with exceptional customer service. These are my first professional brushes and I am so glad I bought them.</li>
            <li> The search is over! Found the perfect makeup brushes, that put just the right amount of makeup on face and eyes. Truly professional look, without any professional talent. Well-made variety of brushes for every kind of makeup -- all at a great price. Highly recommended product and seller.</li>
            <li> I am beyond pleased with these brushes. They are so incredibly soft, the hairs do not fall out, they&#x27;re so easy to wash, and just overall a beautiful set to have! I use them for my every day makeup and stage makeup-- they are phenomenal! Thank you for such a great product!!!</li>
            <li> The set is great, so far haven&#x27;t had any hairs fall out - the problem with my last set.  They had an odd odor when they first arrived, but a good wash and a few days air and they are fine now.  The brush set was complete.  The only negative thing was the ad said a guide would come with the set and there was no guide.  The cloth carrying case is nice.&lt;br /&gt;Update. I posted this review yesterday and got an email that afternoon that they had read my review and would be sending me the instruction guide.  NOW THAT IS CUSTOMER SERVICE!  I have changed their rating from four to five stars.  They take care of their customers!</li>
            <li> So of course I bought these for a girl. She&#x27;s 21, and she loves them. She already owned two expensive MAC brushes, and does not see a difference between these and those. So that&#x27;s good for me!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. I have so far tried the blush and powder brush. What a big different. The powder brush picks up a good amount right away so you don&#x27;t need to keep dipping. And it leaves a flawless finish unlike my old powder brush. Good deal for the 10 Pcs. Great customer service as well.</li>
            <li> After my mom asked for mineral makeup brushes for Mother&#x27;s Day, I found these. They&#x27;re exactly what she wanted, with a beautiful carrying case included, so we&#x27;re all super happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, the manufacturer (Missam&amp;eacute;) was in touch after I made the purchase and during the whole shipping process. It put me very at ease and more eager to review this product. Not a lot of manufacturers (especially via Amazon) go the extra mile to make sure the customer is satisfied at all times.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, very fast delivery. Thank you</li>
            <li> These brushes are soooo soft. Makeup application is a breeze now. The smell didn&#x27;t bother me at all but  I washed the brushes like the directions said to and it was gone. I really like the blush brush and the kubuki brush. Great for travel because I usually so my makeup on the go. Nice quality. Great job Missamé!</li>
            <li> Love love the brushes  Some brushes the bristles come out but these are great  Love all the sizes  You won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> I looked for a good set of makeup brushes for weeks until i found these, and i am very happy with them! Very good quality for the price, love that they are synthetic, and they aren&#x27;t too big for my needs. They are all very soft and dense, my favorite is the Kabuki brush, which has made applying my mineral foundation so much easier, I&#x27;m never using the brush it came with again! As some other reviewers have said, they do come with a scent. Just wash them as suggested by Amy, who will get in contact with you when you purchase this product. I left the case outside overnight while the brushes dried inside and have had no scent problems since. Missame seems to be very interested in customer satisfaction which is also something i look for when buying a product. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used some of the face brushes so far and I really enjoyed the flat top kabuki brush. It&#x27;s small and compact; great for traveling. Also I used it with a liquid foundation and it gave me a really flawless finish. So far to great!!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are lovely.  A great value.  Soft brush and easy to clean...I was surprised with how beautiful they look in person.  My friends would be stunned to know how much i paid for the set.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these brushes for about a month now and they are fantastic! I love the variety of eye shadow brushes! I also use powder foundation on a daily basis, so the smaller foundation brush is perfect for using at home or if I need to throw it into purse for touch ups later. Great product and I&#x27;d highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> They are great brushes! Extremely soft, but not flimsy. I can&#x27;t wait to experiment more with these brushes. Such a great value.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my wife. She most definitely loves them!</li>
            <li> These are wonderful brushes!  Fast shipping, and a great product!  Super cute case they come in, too!</li>
            <li> The brush quality is outstanding! These are very well-crafted and perfect for a home set or on-th-go makeup application. Furthermore, the customer service I received was incredible. Product arrived the next day and I received emails on brush care and customer satisfaction within the week. Missamé really takes the time to ensure they have a quality product and happy consumers.</li>
            <li> good price for this assortment of useful brushes</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice, exactly what I needed! I like the case they come in as well. Not only was the product great, but seller service was very good as well.</li>
            <li> The brushes are awesome.  They&#x27;re very easy to work with.  I&#x27;m so glad I made the purchase. Great customer service!</li>
            <li> I really love it. Its exactly what im expecting.</li>
            <li> Received as a gift from the hubs and I absolutely love this brush set.  Yes there is a slight and i mean slight odor, but it never bothered me.  The quality of these brushes is amazing.  I normally use sephora/clinique brushes and I feel like these brushes are better than both of those brands.  Awesome quality.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy!</li>
            <li> quality was okay, but the smells was very bad, full of chemical!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They&#x27;re really soft after the first wash as directed to do before using. They&#x27;re as good as the high end brushes out there and leaves a seamless application.</li>
            <li> Really liked the brush set. They feel grate on my skin when I us them. Really happy I bought them.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing, shipping was great. I use all of the brushes for my everyday makeup they&#x27;re soft, they don&#x27;t shed but they did come with a paint smell but that&#x27;s why you have to wash them before you use them after that the smell is gone. the handles are so easy to hold great product !</li>
            <li> Love these brushes, they are made very well. They are extremely soft and I really like the quality and size of the brushes. The customer service has been great too.</li>
            <li> The receipt of the request Thanks</li>
            <li> Very nice set of brushes - especially considering the price ( which is very reasonable).&lt;br /&gt;Excellent customer service.&lt;br /&gt;Thinking of getting another set for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. I have very sensitive skin and normally have a bad reaction to new beauty products. The Missamé brushes did not cause my face to breakout. These are great!</li>
            <li> This set is amazing.. very soft and gives you the most perfect finish!</li>
            <li> First let me say that these were not for me, but my girlfriend. She loves how not only are the brushes synthetic and softer (assuming other brushes use animal hair?), but also the light bamboo handle is higher quality and less common than the other brands out there. I&#x27;ve researched a lot of different brushes online, and am amazed this set was only $30... And even comes with free shipping. If you&#x27;re a guy, these make great gifts for any of the ladies in your life. If you&#x27;re a girl, I do have to say the brushes are amazingly soft... like rabbit fur soft... but minus the animal since these are technically vegan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it seems kind of silly, but the only suggestion I have for the seller is to raise the price to $35 or more so additional shopping is not needed for the free shipping since it&#x27;s fulfilled by Amazon directly. Also interested in seeing what else Missam&amp;eacute; will offer in the future since it&#x27;s now my girlfriend&#x27;s favorite brand.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these brushes. I bought two sets. One for me and one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> These are a great value!</li>
            <li> Love them! No shedding and soft</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my new brush set! They are of good quality, don&#x27;t &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; and clean up easily. They were package well for shipment and arrive in a timely manner.  All good!</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 sets of these brushes one for me and one for my sister.  They arrived really fast and there was excellent follow up communication by the seller.  The brushes are of really good quality, the handles are sturdy with a nice weight and the bristles are nice and soft.  There&#x27;s a nice variety of different sizes and angles of shapes of brushes in this set which is why I chose it over other sets and a really good value too.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Got these as a Christmas gift for my niece and she loved them!</li>
            <li> Great delivery service, and I love the bamboo brushes they are worth the buy</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my mother-in-law.  She loved it!</li>
            <li> I received quality brushes as expected. I am very happy with them.</li>
            <li> really love this brush set, help me do makeup more professional, the design is very good and quality. I recommend this Missame for everyone, the customer service and guideline is so great</li>
            <li> Love the brushes. All have made the application process easier and provide a finished, flawless look. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Lovely brushes! Great quality, soft, dense and they don&#x27;t shed! Awesome purchase!</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft! Make-up applies beautifully.Lots of angled brushes to help you with your eyes.Nicest brushes I&#x27;ve ever used! Easy to care for.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! Fast shipping, great customer service. Wonderful!</li>
            <li> these are pretty great. They&#x27;re sturdy, they don&#x27;t shed, and they do a good job. They&#x27;re also pretty easy to clean, which speaks well of the quality----generally the cheap brushes I wash and they fall apart. I use them a lot and have had no problems with them.</li>
            <li> best brushes i have used in a long time</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> These come packaged so beautifully. They are wonderful quality, sturdy, and i have yet to experience any bristles falling out. I love the small compact case they come in. Perfect for travel!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it.</li>
            <li> The most excellent make up brush set I have had. The brushes are soft, polished wood finish handles and a brush for every make up task. I would highly recommend them. Thank you, Amy.</li>
            <li> Got my order quickly and the product looks great. Haven&#x27;t had a chance to try it due to work, but very excited to. :) Looks like a nice set with good sizes. Might order another tiny brush seperately just for eyebrow use but this covers everything else.</li>
            <li> I love this set, the brushes are absolutely wonderful , the price is right, quality excellent, just amazing!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This makeup brush set is amazing to use everyday. The brushed are soft and fine, allowing for even distribution of makeup. The brushes are easy to handle and have a beautiful carrying case. Great for home or travel! Get this product!</li>
            <li> Best brushes I&#x27;ve ever used. Perfect sizes for every need. Quality.  I received these brushes as a birthday gift from my granddaughter and she always gives great gifts.  These are the best brushes I have ever used.  I&#x27;ve been using them for two years and they have never lost a bristle. I wash them when they need it and they look like new again.  Recommend to all.</li>
            <li> Brushes are pretty decent quality for being pretty cheap. I think it&#x27;s a good investment, if you use makeup often and don&#x27;t wanna spend too much money on name brand brushes. It gets the job done. The foundation brushes apply great, but the little brushes are more softer, but I  would definitely purchase more brushes as presents for others. Over all, very satisfied</li>
            <li> I saw all the wonderful reviews about these brushes and really appreciated that the brushes were vegan so, I figured I would give them a try!  When I received them, the company gave me instructions on my first use and they give great customer service.  The brushes are very soft and feel great on my face.  They feel and look like good quality!  Look forward to doing my makeup again!</li>
            <li> I am a beginner to make up, and this just makes me so excited! It has a great selection of brushes, and the quality is amazing! I also heard that synthetic hair won&#x27;t waste your products, so it&#x27;s great to know you can get the most out of your products! The brushes are so soft, and I love how they look! These are perfect for everyone!!!</li>
            <li> I like these brushes. Have had them for a few months now and have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I love this brushes I&#x27;m so happy i purchased them!  😉</li>
            <li> Well have to say my brushes are amazing I got to say im very satisfied with my purchase..will be recommending them to friends.</li>
            <li> I just retired a very expensive set of brushes I bought more than 20 years ago that are still good but I wanted to try &amp;#34;newer technology&amp;#34;.  Should have tried newer technology years ago.  I washed them with baby shampoo first and let them dry on their sides as instructed.  They are very soft and do not shed.  The handles are sturdy. The foundation brush is great.  I&#x27;ve always used a sponge to apply foundation and blend but using the brush to blend makes all the difference in the world. Who knew?  The only negative is I didn&#x27;t receive instructions for each brush as indicated on the description page but that didn&#x27;t bother me. I fully expect this set to be the last I will ever buy except I will be buying another set or two as gifts.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews on these brushes I was very excited to finally pay good money for good quality. I was most excited about the brushes not leaving random strands everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with my new brush set. The coverage is phenomenal and very was to achieve. The blending is amazing and over all amazing quality. Not a single hair fell from any brush other than my concealer brush (which is being replaced at no charge)&lt;br /&gt;I did experience a faulty concealer brush, and recently posted a 3 star review.. but to my surprise the owner of missamé contacted me directly and right a was offered to send a new brush and was very understanding and happy to help resolve the issue. Very professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely happy with my purchase and will be purchasing more from this company!</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I purchased this brush set. The price is right, the customer service is fantastic, and the brushes work wonderfully. They come in a cute, functional bag that can fit comfortably in a large cosmetic bag, and they provide a clean, smooth surface. The company truly cares about their customers &amp; the quality of their product. Life is short, buy the brushes :)</li>
            <li> Loved these have not used them all but work good!!</li>
            <li> These are great brushes for a phenomenal price. I am overwhelmed with each brush and don&#x27;t necessarily need every one, but nice to have extras. Still learning each brush&#x27;s use. They don&#x27;t shed at all and really hold the product very well. Nice blending of foundation and powder. Excellent, exceeded my expectations!!</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes!  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my kit and am ordering another set for me. Play with different uses for the brushes and you will find new ways to love them. I get a flawless foundation application with these!  note: after a wash and few days out of the packaging, there is absolutely no packaging smell, so no worries.</li>
            <li> I love this brushes, my make up look flawless, I will recommend this brushes to anybody, brushes dont sheed.</li>
            <li> These brushes are really nice - the handles feel well made. The bristles do not shed. Even the pouch they come in is cute! Very happy.</li>
            <li> I have used several different brands of makeup brushes, including Clinique, Mac, Bare Minerals, and lots of drug-store brands. Most recently I had been using Bare Minerals, which are natural hair brushes--the were scratchy and shed like crazy.  So wanting to bring my makeup game to the next level, I started shopping around for new brushes; I looked at some cheap ones and I looked at some expensive ones.  I ultimately decided on this set because the reviews were mostly good and the price was a happy medium, with the exact assortment I was looking for to replace my other brushes.  I have now been using them for several weeks, and I am very pleased with the quality of these brushes.  They are very soft, and I have not noticed any bristles falling out of any of the brushes despite using them daily and washing them several times, with some brushes being washed daily.  The brushes stay soft and come clean easily with regular soap--no special/expensive &amp;#34;brush cleaner&amp;#34; required! I can&#x27;t express how much of a difference the quality of these brushes makes in the ease of applying and overall finish of my makeup. The assortment is perfect for someone like me who highlights/contours or experiments with various eyeshadow applications.  I will agree with other commenters that the carrying case has a strong chemical smell when first opening the package, which the company even admits to and provides instructions on how to clean it to remove the smell (I appreciate their honesty). I sprayed mine with apple cider vinegar, then washed it in the sink with hand soap, and the smell was completely removed. For beginners, the set also comes with a paper that explains what each brush is used for.  I have used the brushes in both dry and wet applications, they are amazing and I&#x27;m so happy that I bought them (which was kind of a splurge for my budget, but totally worth it).</li>
            <li> Got these for my wife (she picked it out) and she is very happy with the quality and feel of the set.  Thanks...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth this price</li>
            <li> This is the first time ordering from this company and I&#x27;m impressed. The brushes are very full and super soft.  The company also included a instructional booklet. It would be nice if they had a extended 24 brush set. I would buy it in heartbeat! I would definitely recommend these brushes for anyone that wants a really good quality brush set.</li>
            <li> I just got my brushes in the mail today and they are really nice looking brushes and the bristles are nice and soft but they do smell like spray paint like others said</li>
            <li> Great selection of brushes. They are super soft</li>
            <li> I love how soft these brushes are. They are designed nicely. I have washed them and they held up and are still soft. They are comparable to my high end brushes.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes!  Super Soft!!  Great buy!</li>
            <li> Love this set of makeup brushes! Has all the basic brushes that i need on a daily basis to do my makeup. The brushes are super soft!&lt;br /&gt;When you first open it, it has a plastic smell to it, but as soon as you wash the case and brushes (as they recommend) then you&#x27;re all set to go! :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE my makeup brush set..it&#x27;s amazing it make my makeup go on smoothly,and the hairs on the brushes NEVER fall out..I plan on buy another set just for when this set is being cleaned..Thank you so much for an amazing product..oh and I love the storage bag and the brush covers too</li>
            <li> I ordered these on special because I thought they were dupes of the Everyday Minerals brushes that I love. They aren&#x27;t exact (Kabukis aren&#x27;t quite as thick) but they are far softer! Love the brushes, and the case is super cute. And the price was right! The special promo ($4.97) makes me feel like I robbed a bank. The current sale price of $39.99 is a steal for these brushes! (I paid more than that for a Sonia Kashuk set that is already falling part after a month.) Considering the average price per brush for comparable quality is from $8 - $15 per brush, this is an amazing deal.</li>
            <li> Soft, nice-looking makeup brushes. Every brush you could possibly need included in this set -- and the price is right!</li>
            <li> Soft and great quality, very happy with these brushes. And it made it even better that there was a sale and coupon for them.</li>
            <li> These brushes are quality brushes I really like them a lot.</li>
            <li> I know nothing about makeup brushes, but my wife said these are excellent.  Who am I to argue?</li>
            <li> These brushes are absolutely wonderful.  I&#x27;ve always purchased the cheapest brushes that I could find, and I have to say that I can truly tell a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, the case it comes in is lovely (Personally, I have a hard time touching silk items, I can&#x27;t describe it, it gives me the ibbie jibbies LOL), but I&#x27;m sure normal people love this.  If it weren&#x27;t for the material, I would love the case.  I like the idea of the case, I just unfortunatley will have to find a new case to put my brushes in because I won&#x27;t use them if I have to touch the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes themselves are high quality brushes.  The bristles almost feel hair-like.  I love the different brush sizes and one of the things I loved about this set, is it had a pamphlet that described each brush and the function for it.  So, if you are like me and have no clue what brush is supposed to do what, you&#x27;ll appreciate that this unlocks the mystery to brushes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really am happy with this purchase!  IT&#x27;s one of the best things I&#x27;ve spent my money on!  Well worth the price I paid!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful brush set! My three favorite brushes: I love the flat top kabuki-ish brush for buffing in powder, the foundation brush is fab. (foundation glides on) and the blush brush really applies blush nicely (a nice diffused look). All of the brushes are well-made and I haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding! Well-worth the price!</li>
            <li> Great quality and affordable</li>
            <li> They are ver soft and blend very well they are the best brushes I have ever had</li>
            <li> I will be sending them back. Not what I had hoped.  Smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush set.  I am a make brush addict.  I have have lots of brushes, but a few of my staple brushes were starting to get loose handles and starting to shed.  This set was a great option.  There are all of the brushes that you will needed without the filler and fluff that some sets put in just to up their brush count like the foam applicator or mascara wand on the long handle.  No one wants those!  The brushes are very soft and seem well made.  My only complaint would be that the case doesn&#x27;t have a Velcro closer.  It has a bow, which looks nice, but let&#x27;s face it, I am rarely going to take the time to tie.</li>
            <li> What a fantastic set of brushes! Packaged perfectly! thank you. :)</li>
            <li> These brushes are high quality and incredibly soft. Makeup blends beautifully. There&#x27;s no shedding and the fabric brush roll is lightweight for travel.</li>
            <li> This brush set has the perfect collection of basic brushes.  I like the brush handles are thick and study, makes it easy to apply makeup.  The bristles feel soft and comfortable on my face.  So far no shedding and they blend wonderfully.  It comes with an elegant satin brush case which fits perfectly in your purse or travel bag.  Great price for such amazing quality!  I love this product and highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> These make-up brushes are incredibly soft. I love putting on my make-up for the day when the brushes feel like these do! They are such a great value!</li>
            <li> The case for the brushes is very pretty &amp; the brushes are good quality.</li>
            <li> Beautiful presentation. The brushes come in a really nice brown silk brush roll. The set includes a great range of brushes. Very happy with my purchase. I did let the brushes air out for a few days before washing and using.</li>
            <li> LOVE these brushes!!! They&#x27;re so soft and the handles are fantastic!! High quality and great application!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. Got mine a couple weeks ago, and I love them. I also really like the carrying case that they come in.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy these brushes. They are really soft. Easy to clean. The case is really nice with good stitching. They are light and I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. The case is compact and easy to carry as a basic make-up essential. The brushes are compact, yet elegant and beautiful. The bristles are soft and precise. Perfect for everyday makeup and beyond.</li>
            <li> I am learning to use those brushes. The quality is nice</li>
            <li> Very good brushes! I haven&#x27;t used them extensively yet, but I&#x27;ve used and washed them a few times and they appear to be good quality - the handles aren&#x27;t loose, the bristles are soft and they don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> Good quality and value.</li>
            <li> Fabulous quality!  Love them.</li>
            <li> Great brushes. Excellent quality and truly soft. Well, after using my brushes from Ulta and Target, I realized my eyelids were becaming very dry and irritated, once they became puffy. I have sensitive skin and attribute it to having exzema. After figuring out the brushes were causing my eyes to become that way, I immediately stopped using eyes hadow all together. I went to Amazon and saw Missam&amp;eacute;&#x27;s brush set. With mostly positive reviews, I thought it must be worth it! The owner Amy Ng, even sent me a lovely email to see if I had gotten the item and gave a handy tip on brush care. Well, it was worth every dime! My eyes are much better and are no longer irritated or dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this 100% to anyone who wears makeup everyday. Buy this now!</li>
            <li> The brush set was a gift for my mom. She absolutely loves them! They are soft and rich and she loved the nice case too. Very nice gift. Looked more expensive than price too! Thanks</li>
            <li> These brushes did not disappoint. Yes, they had a smell but it wasn&#x27;t as insane as some of these other viewers posted. The bristles haven&#x27;t given me any fall out and they are soft. I really did make a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no makeup artist but I&#x27;m very pleased. I replaced my MAC and Bobbi Brown brushes when I learned from my allergist who specializes in contact dermatitis that I had a nickel allergy and it was most probably coming from my expensive brushes I&#x27;d loved for years.  These have been great - no shedding on my face (like a Sephora kabuki brush I bought once on a business trip when I forgot my travel brushes), no weird smell (which I had read in reviews but I did follow the cleaning instructions), and they look nice. I kept the brush description tucked in the case so I think I&#x27;ve used almost all of them at least once.  They work well and I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
            <li> I ordered the brush set and it came on time, as promised.  The smell of the brushes didn&#x27;t bother me,  they smelled like a new product.  I know I will get the desired results from these brushes.</li>
            <li> ممتازة جدا&lt;br /&gt; Very gooood</li>
            <li> Great brushes, and really impressed with this vendor&#x27;s customer service.  I think this is the only vendor who reaches out to make sure you completely satisfied.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love my set. I&#x27;ve never bought a full set of brushes before. Most separately or as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;I love my set!</li>
            <li> Great brushes! All these brushes are perfect for applying various types of make-up. There are a lot of brushes out there, but nothing compares to these!</li>
            <li> I love this and would love another discounted set.  My 21 yr old daughter will love this for Christmas in her stocking!!!</li>
            <li> Oh, I loved the fresh new smell when I got these brushes in the mail! The second thing I noticed was that the carrying case looked very classy and expensive. I don&#x27;t eat meat and I&#x27;m really glad I found these vegan brushes at such an affordable price. These brushes beat the expensive ones you find at the mall. I&#x27;ve used plenty of cheap brushes from Wal-Mart and Target, but was left disappointed. Those cheap brushes were too rough on my skin and the bristles kept sticking to my face when I put makeup on. Missame brushes are perfect and they don&#x27;t do anything like that. These brushes are super soft.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, exceptional quality.&lt;br /&gt;I love that these brushes are not made of animal hair and are cruelty free.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these brushes to anyone that is looking for cruelty free animal hair make up brushes.</li>
            <li> i received this product on time. The bristles are so, so soft. They feel very high quality and it was a joy working with them. The smell was quite strong when I received the brushes, however the smell has since gone away in the few days I have had the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is perfect; it&#x27;s small, yet easy to travel with and it&#x27;s tied with a bow! Very nice; I highly enjoyed opening the makeup brushes because of that. :) It was like buying a little present for yourself. This set would make a great gift as well.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a bit of room for a few other brushes you may own as well in the case, if you roll the case with the additional brushes in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this brushes and would recommend to absolute anyone.</li>
            <li> Beautiful set of 10 brushes, individually packaged within a satin chocolate case. In my opinion, this set is of equal quality with Ulta&#x27;s I.T. line of brushes, which is also of very high, professional quality, but for an average of $24 per brush. I bought this set to replace my Bare Minerals brushes, which I have had for almost 8 years. Missame&#x27;s brushes are both cruelty-free and vegan, which are two major reasons I chose this particular seller, aside from the high quality. (Bare Minerals&#x27; brushes are not, unfortunately.) This set had every type of brush I need for a natural, basic full face make-up, including five different brushes for just eyes, including a blending brush. It also comes with a brush identification guide for beginners, as well as cleaning and care instructions for the case and brushes themselves. The care is very easy. I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes ! After doing a lot of research for some good quality makeup brushes, I am SO happy I picked these... I&#x27;m 52 and have ordered and purchased hundred of makeup brushes and even spent as much $90 for each brush and what a waste of $ after using and cleaning these brushes for a month... Don&#x27;t hesitate ladies...get while the getting is good..</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift so all I can say is that my daughter was very excited when she opened this. The product looked nice and I don&#x27;t have feedback from her yet.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these brushes! it&#x27;s amazing the quality brush you get for the price! Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> Amazing set of brushes!!</li>
            <li> I love my new brushes!  I was on the hunt for a while, wanting something nice that didn&#x27;t cost a lot.</li>
            <li> I really love those brushes , the wuality is really good and the price too,m</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and work very well. I&#x27;ve had other (smaller) brush sets in the past, and they just didn&#x27;t meet all of my needs. There is only one brush in this set I&#x27;ve yet to use (which is great because when ordering a set, you sometimes get a few duds that you&#x27;ll never need). I love that they are vegan.&lt;br /&gt;I had a minor issue with one brush. The seller was extremely quick to respond and get the issue resolved.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;VERY happy with the Missamé 10-piece makeup brush set! I&#x27;d been shopping around (both in-stores and online) for certain makeup brushes and each were - in my opinion - unreasonably pricey. With this set I received 10 high-quality brushes for the price of one brush that I was contemplating buying from Mac.Also love the case they come in plus the brush guide outlining what else brush is intended for.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great brushes!  I was very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> For the most part, these worked pretty good and they feel really soft. I like them a lot. The first time when I received them, I washed the brushes as instructed and one of the brushes&#x27; hair started falling out. Yeah, I didn&#x27;t like that, so I got in contact with the seller and she sent me new brushes. I haven&#x27;t test them, yet, since I moved and my sister hasn&#x27;t sent them to me.  I will update later when I finally get them.</li>
            <li> Brush bristles are great!  Handles feel a little cheap - but not a deal breaker.  Very nice case - makes traveling and storage easy.  I didn&#x27;t notice an overly chemical smell at all.  Really great for the price.</li>
            <li> I like some of the brushes but not all of them (ie. don&#x27;t care for the foundation brushes)</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. I have use them everyday for the past month and I have to say I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Great brushes..very soft! You do need to wash them first before using. I used my facial cleanser..did the trick!</li>
            <li> AWESOME! Very good quality.</li>
            <li> This is the first set of brushes I&#x27;ve ever bought. I was afraid they would be smelly, due to the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They did smell when I got them, however I read directions and washed. I washed my brushes in warm water with just a tiny drop of Bare Minerals Deep Cleansing Foam dissolved within. They have ABSOLUTELY NO SMELL now after a single washing and neither does the case after a rub down with a moist wash cloth with the same soap.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great. I can&#x27;t believe I got such an awesome product for a small price! The bristles are soft and the ferrule is sturdy. These will last a long time. Fast shipping and great customer service as well!</li>
            <li> I bought the set as a  gift,  my  niece loved it,  I  recieved it in a  shorter time  than expected,  well packaged.  the set was in a  very nice  casing. I  haven&#x27;t heard anything from  my niece  specially that she&#x27;s very critical when it comes to quality  of  make up.  she must be  happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I really liked the brushes.  I have been using them for several weeks.  The brushes are shipped with a very nice satin type fabric case.  The problem is that the smell of insecticide is very strong both on the brushes and on the case.  I left the case open for about a week hoping the smell would dissipate but it did not.  I then washed the brushes and threw away the case.  This did solve the problem but it would have been nice to have the case for both storage and when I travel.</li>
            <li> Great brushes and customer service. I was originally unsure about how to use these as a makeup newbie, but Amy was good about giving advice! Very soft brushes and it seems as if the sizes were customized based on the owner&#x27;s experience with makeup (after she gave me more insight!). Definitely recommend if you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot but are searching for good brushes!</li>
            <li> So, as with all of the other reviews, I would agree that this brush set has a very strong distinct odor, but I washed the brushes last night and the odor went away (thank god)!  I gave this product 3-stars not because of the odor, but because of the quality of the brushes.  I&#x27;m a M.A.C. user and I absolutely love their brushes.  I used the Missame&#x27; brushes for the first time this morning and wasn&#x27;t too impress; especially with my foundation and concealer application.  It appears that the brushes soak up the liquid foundation/concealer such that very little is transferred to the skin.  This means that I had to use several applications of the foundation/concealer to achieve the look that I wanted.  With the M.A.C brushes, it only takes one application or two at the very most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a little disappointed that these brushes haven&#x27;t (thus far) met the standard that I expected.  I will continue to use them and update my review accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  The pamphlet that details which brush is best used for what was not included in my package.  Not sure if this was an error or if it doesn&#x27;t come with the order.</li>
            <li> When I first received them, I was really excited about the delicate packaging and individually wrapped brushes. The brushes were very soft, and I can definitely tell that the bamboo was of good, lasting quality. Everything was good until I washed them! I used the same mild baby shampoo that I always use to clean the brushes (since they had that &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; smell to them), but I&#x27;m not sure whether the hair on some of these brushes are just not stuck on well, or whether I&#x27;m washing incorrectly... but a few of the brushes were shedding quite a lot. Considering that it was my first time washing them, I can&#x27;t imagine them lasting for that long... I had really high hopes, since the reviews were so positive... but maybe I got a bad batch? Not sure what happened, but I guess I&#x27;ll be keeping them for however long they may last :( Such a bummer, since they felt really nice right out of the box.</li>
            <li> Love theses brushes, almost more than one gal needs!  My only issue is that they&#x27;re natural, in a day when we&#x27;re leaning toward synthetic products.  Having said that, these are both a fabulous price and great quality, so I bury my guilt.</li>
            <li> I am sooooo happy with these brushes!!! Made of quality material, definitely comparable to high-end brushes. Very soft on the skin, versatile set - I find all brushes useful. LOVE THEM. The intro price really can&#x27;t be beat, grab them while you still can!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this set and another set to do prom makeup this weekend. I found that this set was more useful. Out of the 6 sets I have I would have to say these are my favorite. They do smell but after a quick cleaning its gone.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing they came on time the only problem that I have with them is the case. For some reason the case has an odd odor of melted plastic. But other than that I am satisfied! The brushes are so soft comparable to the eco tools brush line!</li>
            <li> This makeup brush set is Great!!! The brushes are so soft!!!</li>
            <li> The brush are so soft .they are so great they work amazingly on my skin they have what u need.it&#x27;s really a great set</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; excellent seller</li>
            <li> Amazing! Loving them! The washing tip was awesome and my brushes don&#x27;t stop feeling amazing! Definitely more than I expected!</li>
            <li> Just got this set and they&#x27;re awesome! I was looking high and low for a travel brush set and these fit the bill. They&#x27;re the perfect size and the perfect amount of brushes. I wanted some larger brushes for powder and liquid foundation, not to mention a blush brush and some eyeshadow brushes. The powder brushes are very dense and soft. Like other reviews said, there was a manufacturing smell when I received it, but I didn&#x27;t mind. I did wash them just to get rid of the smell a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that the brush pouch fits the brushes a little too &amp;#34;perfectly,&amp;#34; as in there&#x27;s very little to no room for the brushes to move around. As a result, some of the bristles of the brushes start to rub up against the other brushes or rub up against the pouch and they can start fraying or become misshapened. This is more of a personal preference of mine as I don&#x27;t think any other customers felt this way when they received their product. I&#x27;m probably just a brush snob.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will also say that the price for the brushes is pretty inexpensive. You&#x27;re getting 10 brushes for around $38-$40, which calculates to about $4 a brush. ELF brushes can also be about $3 each, but this set is way higher quality and much more worth it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used these yet, but I can see that any one can make themselves pretty like skilled professional with these brushes.</li>
            <li> I have used a couple so far and like them.  I&#x27;m not sure I can give a good review yet.  I wondered which one your use for eyebrows?</li>
            <li> Wow!  The quality and price point for these brushes is amazing! They&#x27;re soft.  They&#x27;re sturdy. They work!  The flat top brush in particular, is a favorite - it applies foundation flawlessly. Kudos to the designer and manufacturer!  I hope they decide to expand their line. I&#x27;m ordering a backup set.</li>
            <li> Good quality. Great price! The only thing bad is the smell of the brown travel case, just a horrible oily smell and I had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> Great set for the price. Also easy to clean!</li>
            <li> This is the first set of make up brushes I have bought and they are really great quality for the price. I love that they come with a description of what each brush is for. I also appreciate that the seller sent a follow up email to make sure I got them and was happy with them.</li>
            <li> They are amazingly soft brushes, great quality especially for the price. I won&#x27;t go back to any other brushes but these for applying my make up. Which I happen to do everyday. :)</li>
            <li> I just picked it up at the post office today. It looks nice in quality and the pouch color is great. Each brush is in its own plastic wrap.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell if the function is good or not  since I just got them. I&#x27;ll continue my review after I try them. But I really like the seller, they emailed me for my opinion about the product and kindly reminded me of how to take care of the brushes in a right way. I love their services!!</li>
            <li> I wanted a good brush kit but didn&#x27;t want to spend too much money. I was happy with the delivery time, and unlike many other reviews, I didn&#x27;t feel the smell was too strong. However, I would still clean the brushes before use. I&#x27;ve had my set for only about two weeks, but I already love it, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> These are some of the SOFTEST brushes I have ever used! And I&#x27;m impressed with the quality of them. The handles are a smooth, polished wood and give them a real sleek look. The bristles as stated above are super soft and do not fall out like some lower quality brushes ive purchased on here. And to top it all off they come with a cute pouch to store them in.</li>
            <li> Just rec&#x27;d my missame brush set in the mail today. It is absolutely classy with its&#x27; silk soft make up carrier. It also comes with information on how to use each individual brush. I love it so much I&#x27;m thinking about ordering another one for travel. The cost might be a bit steep for some, including me but it is an investment and obviously less expensive than some of the higher end cosmetic brushes so I need not complain. But I must say, it is a beautifully wrapped package set and beautiful soft brushes. I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Great value, brushes are quality</li>
            <li> Absolutely love love love these brushes. I was actually thinking about buying a Sigma brush when I came across this 10 piece brush set for the same price as one! So glad I did. Best set and super fast shipping. Will be buying from this seller again for sure!!!! Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes that meets all general application needs. With these I can dedicate a brush to blush, contour, highlighting shadow, and crease shadow. Love them. I will say that the bag has a plastic smell upon arrival, but that really doesn&#x27;t bother me considering the deal.</li>
            <li> I love this brushes! They are so soft!</li>
            <li> High quality. The price is fabulous. Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> These are the best brushes ever!  I can&#x27;t believe how little they cost as I have some where one brush was more than this whole set.  My makeup even looks smoother.  The chemical smell disappears if you just leave the case open for a while.  The case rolls up to be small for travel but for everyday I just leave it open on my dresser which is so convenient.  I highly recommend them.  All these 5-Star reviews can&#x27;t be wrong!</li>
            <li> Great brushes and very affordable! I had to give it 4 stars because my kabuki brushes have many loose bristles even after I washed them. Other than that they are great.</li>
            <li> Fantastic set of brushes!  They are seriously so soft and a great kit for traveling.  I use a TON of makeup brushes of all kinds, so it&#x27;s great to have this set with the easy and on-the-go pouch so I can wrap it up and take it with me wherever I may need them!  Like I said, very soft and feel as if they are great quality!</li>
            <li> Very soft. Stayed in shape after cleaning. Very impressed for the price!</li>
            <li> Best brushes I have ever used!!</li>
            <li> amazing product, love it</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping. Here in my hot little hands way before they were due here. Really soft. Comes with a nice guide with the function of each brush and I received an email from the owner in regards to the purchase. Love these and can&#x27;t say enough about them. Great price for the quality!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with these brushes, I have a wide variety of different shapes and sizes, which makes it easy to use. They wash up very easy and so far have kept their shape.</li>
            <li> Nice quality brushes. Perfect set. Every size is just right.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift; no complaints yet.</li>
            <li> These brushes were by far the best iv ever bought!!! They are so easy to clean and even after use everyday they never dull out or feel scratchy. Definitely worth every penny and arrived in record time might I add. I don&#x27;t get paid to write these reviews I&#x27;m just a normal valued customer! Buy this product you won&#x27;t be disappointed! !</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!  They are perfect for me.</li>

            <li> Great set of brushes! &amp;#60;EXCELLENT QUALITY&amp;#62; Fast delivery and great customer service!</li>
            <li> I have gone through so many makeup brushes that dropped hairs on my face. These brushes are of great quality and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love how soft these brushes are.! It literally takes me half the time to do my make up because of how flawlessly they help blend it in. 👍👍👍</li>
            <li> Great Buy!! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Very soft, non-irritating and I have quite sensitive skin...give a very evenly professional looking makeup application and blending...I&#x27;m very pleased with this product at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> very nice product, very nicely packaged , have not used them yet but I can already see they are of very nice quality, thank you</li>
