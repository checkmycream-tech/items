            <li>I was told that it worked nicely.</li>
            <li>This helps to control it nicely.</li>
            <li>honestly anything helps.</li>
            <li>Okay .very nice cleared all the bumps .</li>
            <li>I will always recommend it and welcome first timers to give it a chance.</li>
            <li>I would like to add that technique is also a very important part of shaving and should not be neglected.</li>
            <li>and I feel more confident than ever...</li>
            <li>I went to the doctor because my face had not gotten any better after 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>AFTER YOUR SHAPE MOST IMPORTANTLY!  </li>
            <li>But this stuff works even better.</li>
            <li>feel better about my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>its cheap!  </li>
            <li>I wish I had learned about is sooner in my life, it would have helped me in so many ways.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely better than nothing.</li>
            <li>and I am feeling  better</li>
            <li>Whatever genes you&#x27;re wearing, they can sure make for some denim blues in the form of bumps, burns, and nicks.</li>
            <li>I keep way more layers of skin than I ever did with Five-Bladezilla, but I do get bumps from time to time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, my experience has been okay, but it&#x27;s not the cure-all I was hoping to discover:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>interesting part of the instructions states that you should remove any in-grown hairs.</li>
            <li>In my experience, my most unsightly bumps are from (1.)</li>
            <li>Now that&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I will buy some more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li>They would burn upon application and results were minimal at best.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re out a great deal of money, I buy it at the discount store near me and it costs about 4 dollars.</li>
            <li>and you should be fine.</li>
            <li>But, this product is awesome for less servere razor bumps, ingrown hair, and razor burn too.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>were.&lt;br /&gt;After 2 days razor bumps are going away, but I HAVE A HUGE FREAKING RASH ON MY NECK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not making a HUGE difference</li>
            <li>He is light complexion and</li>
            <li>It keeps my face looking smooth.</li>
            <li>Now my skin is looking smooth and bump free.</li>
            <li>Neck is smooth, even skin tone, no worries.</li>
            <li>It makes your bump go away and smooth out the area.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read reviews here touting how cheap Bump Stopper-2 is.</li>
            <li>But this product did seem to help while he finished up the bag of really cheap razors</li>
            <li>I always steered clear of this because I thought it can&#x27;t be that good if it&#x27;s inexpensive and available everywhere</li>
            <li>the first day I used I felt itching and seeing more bumps than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t still find the original in the market.</li>
            <li>I have my own remedies (Hydrocortisone and Lanacane work well), but I&#x27;m always looking for something new.</li>
            <li>It should be used after a shower or face clean.</li>
            <li>I like it better than I do the sensitive because it controls my bumps better</li>
            <li>I bought it because I saw so many positive reviews on here.</li>
            <li>Remember to apply it RIGHT after your first shave...that&#x27;s the most important.</li>
            <li>What it DOES do is prevent razor bumps from forming in the first place and allows your hairs to cleanly pass through your skin without creating pus-filled zits on their way out!</li>
            <li>So, I picked up Bump Stopper-2 Razor Bump Treatment, Double Strength Formula after reading good reviews here.  </li>
            <li>So far, nice product.  </li>
            <li>most of my life because I am a very hairy</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give true review for this product since I bought it for a family member.</li>
            <li>really good stuff...worked out for my razor bumps on the back of my head.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff works so fast.</li>
            <li>Then take a very warm wash cloth and place it on my face for 30 sec, immediatiatly apply tend skin after removing the wash cloth.</li>
            <li>This product is tremendous.</li>
            <li>I use a double edge safety razor (a 1934 Gillette Bostonian, if you must know) and a litany of shave products that make for an excellent daily man spa in my beard garden.</li>
            <li>Depending on the severity of the bumps and/or how quickly you want to get rid of them, you can apply this once in the morning or at night until the bumps disappear.</li>
            <li>It runs out quickly and at 25 bucks a bottle</li>
            <li>I bought the remainder of them last time and am glad i did cuz this stuff sell out quick even on the internet!</li>
            <li>Love this and would reccommend it to anyone trying to get that baby bottom smooth neck back!</li>
            <li>Fresh razors, exfoliation, milk compresses, salacylic acid, prescription hydrocortisone and antibiotic creams</li>
            <li>It has the appearance of a light, flesh-colored paste that only a sociopath could love.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, and I have tried so many products, which did not work.</li>
            <li>Out of desparation, and based on other reviews, I tried this product, and much to my great surprise, it really, truly works.</li>
            <li>I found this over 20 yrs ago and thru the processes of trying other products I always come back to the best for me.</li>
            <li>Hey you get what you pay for right.</li>
            <li>However, I use this product once in the evening right before bed</li>
            <li>I had high hopes that bump stopper 2 would work after reading the many positive reviews, however, after 2 weeks of consistent use (morning, night and after shaving)</li>
            <li>Sure, you can pay sky-high prices for items in your shave kit arsenal, but the value you get from an alum block, styptic pencil, or many pre-shaves and soaps goes far beyond what this tiny tub affords.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great on our bikini area, just not for African American beards.</li>
            <li>and I must say that my nestle crunch neck has cleared up ever since I first applied it.</li>
            <li>I would advise to use it even if your bumps are mostly gone, as it prevents it from coming back.</li>
            <li>I shave with an electric shaver in the shower first</li>
            <li>This product seems to marketed mostly towards African Americans.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using tend skin for years and recently found this product, it works better than tend skin and any others I&#x27;ve used, and</li>
            <li>Along with careful shaving \\&quot;with the grain\\&quot; as much as possible, he uses this product with great success.  </li>
            <li>This product works pretty well</li>
            <li>To get rid of rashes i been using hot towels to ease the itching and swelling as well as steroid cream \\&quot;Triamcinolone\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time that day after I shaved.</li>
            <li>For the first couple weeks the product seemed to work.</li>
            <li>When I first bought this product it worked as advertised.</li>
            <li>Product works well and heals the bumps fast!</li>
            <li>It worked well the first time and it worked again.</li>
            <li>is that there is no weird smell or funkiness to the cream leaving it applicable at any time to the skin.</li>
            <li>Generic hydrocortisone cream worked better for my razor bumps than this did.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I finally found it.</li>
            <li>You see results within the first 24 to 48 hours.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not the type of person who can shave every day, if i&#x27;m lucky I might be able to get away with every other day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for 6 months at least and have had such AWESOME RESULTS  </li>
            <li>The bumps and itching would have been unbearable with my regular shaving by Sunday at the absolute latest.</li>
            <li>worked really well the first week and after that felt like it got a tolerance to it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honesty, your nose will curl at first sight of Bump Stopper-2--the color and consistency really suggest it--but relax.</li>
            <li>But over time it seemed to be less effective.</li>
            <li>I had large patches of rashes were</li>
            <li>Tend skin dry&#x27;s out my face if I use it more than two days straight.</li>
            <li>now I ordered this product and after daily use I have notice a huge inprovement in my skin the scars have lightened  </li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>but I used Bump Stopper 2 on my bikini area, so maybe not so much.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and this stuff does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much, don&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
            <li>but I absolutely dont recomend it</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
            <li>This product worked very well for me</li>
            <li>I am very prone to ingrown hairs and have tried everything to combat them.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>It is important to keep in mind that this works differently for everybody.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really does what it says.</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>time I ordered  online and delivery was fast as promised.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>i  still moisturize for the first 24 hours and then apply a light amount of this formula on key areas in which i normally get razor bumps.</li>
            <li>(Something about that whole \\&quot;If</li>
            <li>I have a whole routine,,,,</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>You need to really use sparingly a couple times a day on your bear and neck area - as needed.</li>
            <li>I have used other products and to me, they work much better.</li>
            <li>Four days later two bumps that have been on my cheek since high school started to smooth out and look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The directions say to use Bump Stopper-2 sparingly, and you&#x27;ll find a light touch on the cream goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The more you use it, the less the bumps becomes over time.     </li>
            <li>I understand black facial hair can bit more coarse and curly which causes more severe razor bumps.</li>
            <li>If you search for info on resorcinol you should easily find the WHO report which has detailed information on this subject, written by an international panel of experts.  </li>
            <li>However, using this product has significantly reduced the bumps as long as it is used correctly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>One is rather easily removed with tweezers; the other is appeased through compliance.</li>
            <li>I still get an ingrown from time to time, but even when I do this helps clear them up much faster.</li>
            <li>probably won&#x27;t look right to you when you open it.</li>
            <li>It soothes the existing bumps and prevents new ones from appearing.</li>
            <li>I tried Tend Skin and MiN New York Solution 2.  </li>
            <li>When the new woman looked at my skin***she gave me a jar of bump stopper.  </li>
            <li>, she is my new eye brow lady and chin waxer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d become pretty accustomed to having chronic razor bumps, and occasionally they&#x27;d flare up more than usual.</li>
            <li>Typically it is considered safe for topicsl use in low concentrations..</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, the world health organization recommends against using large amounts of resorcinol topically on areas where the chemical may enter the blood stream (ie, nicks and cuts from shaving, or acne).  </li>
            <li>Solution 2-Same formula as Tend Skin only it comes in a bottle with a little roller ball on top</li>
            <li>thus far I will continue with this product in hope that my skin will completely clear up</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t done anything thus far.</li>
            <li>the general consensus is that resorcinol is probably safe for topical use as long as the concentration in your bloodstream remains low.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s very diligent about applying it regularly and it keeps the skin conditioned so bumps/</li>
            <li>Bump Stopper 2 Double Strength Treatment works very well.  </li>
            <li>Personally I do not use this as an aftershave like some have posted they do (I prefer bump patrol), so I can&#x27;t speak much about it in regards to that aspect.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely cure the problem but it helps.</li>
            <li>I get bumps quite frequently from ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>You are supposed to apply it twice daily and after shaving, and I find if I slack off, the bumps come back right away.</li>
            <li>Remember, a little goes a long way; more will do nothing for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results</li>
            <li>It gave my face a serious rash that hurts and is even more embarrassing to look at than the razor bumps and ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>give this a try, even if you&#x27;re not black.</li>
            <li>And considering that this stuff is so inexpensive, next to that high, rubbing alcohol knockoff called Tend Skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone with a similar problem.</li>
            <li>But seriously, it&#x27;s cool for laundry and carpets, but \\&quot;test some of this stuff on your skin and see what happens\\&quot; does not sound comforting.</li>
            <li>(I have heard that using this product in large quantities will dry out the skin, but I cannot verify that.</li>
            <li>I found that Bump Stopper-2 reducedthe appearance of my razor burn, usually where my collar sits against my neckline, but it did not really clear up the problem for me any more than a one-dollar tube of Hydrocortisone does from Wal-Team-America-Superstore.</li>
            <li>burn, usually where my collar sits against my neckline, but it did not really clear up the problem for me any more than a one-dollar tube of Hydrocortisone does from Wal-Team-America-Superstore.</li>
            <li>I tried so many different things, including Tend Skin, which is as high as a giraffe&#x27;s behind.</li>
            <li>At first applied it seemed to soothre but few seconds later it burned so much</li>
            <li>In many other countries resorcinol is banned outright or strictly limited for topical use in nonprescription products, however in the US there are no limitations for topical use (a policy which some claim needs to be revised).  </li>
            <li>The good thing is that since it&#x27;s effective in preventing/getting rid of those nasty bumps, in the same process it helps expose the ingrown hairs that are persistent and stay behind (making them easy to pluck out).   </li>
            <li>This stuff works great, I had been looking for a solution to stop painful ingrown hairs along my neck and chin area for years.</li>
            <li>I presently use a Alum Blok &amp; Clubman Gel directly aftershaving with Bump Fighter Razor then finish up with Bump Stopper for the problem areas.</li>
            <li>I tried buying everything from sensitive skin electric razors, to similar bump products like bump patrol and tend skin to no avail.</li>
            <li>For one reason or another, some of us are just unlucky (genetically, that is): sensitive skin, coarse hair, curly hair.</li>
            <li>Felt like it made razor bumps worse, my face was better when I stopped using.</li>
            <li>However, I would urge caution in using this product frequently as it has a high concentration of resorcinol (the active ingredient).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased these before and a small amount of use will quickly bring about results.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the first product that has actually given me enough confidence to take up wet shaving again.</li>
            <li>No burn, smells not bad, and a little goes a long time.</li>
            <li>By the next day (today actually) my face was totally clear.</li>
            <li>Most of the time I have to switch back and forth between my Schick Hydro and electric to try and minimize the unsightly bumps and irritating burn.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps I should have gotten the Sensitive Formula, which has the same ingredients as the Double Strength, but with one extra one (Resorcin).  </li>
            <li>Does dry face out at first so be careful and sparing in amount used initially.</li>
            <li>It has potentially beneficial ingredients not commonly found in other products and everyone&#x27;s skin will respond differently.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Works great and is teriffic at stopping the razor burn.</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how good this stuff works.</li>

            <li> The price was good and the product arrived on time.</li>

            <li> About as effective as you can get for a non-prescription anit-bump treatment, and at a fair price.</li>
            <li> good price good stuff:)</li>
            <li> Try it, you will love it!</li>
            <li> I feel like I haven&#x27;t seen amazing results with this cream</li>
            <li> I was told that it worked nicely.</li>
            <li> This helps to control it nicely.</li>
            <li> honestly anything helps.</li>
            <li> Okay .very nice cleared all the bumps .</li>
            <li> I will always recommend it and welcome first timers to give it a chance.</li>
            <li> I would like to add that technique is also a very important part of shaving and should not be neglected.</li>
            <li> and I feel more confident than ever...</li>
            <li> I went to the doctor because my face had not gotten any better after 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> AFTER YOUR SHAPE MOST IMPORTANTLY!  </li>
            <li> But this stuff works even better.</li>
            <li> feel better about my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> its cheap!  </li>
            <li> I wish I had learned about is sooner in my life, it would have helped me in so many ways.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely better than nothing.</li>
            <li> and I am feeling  better</li>
            <li> Whatever genes you&#x27;re wearing, they can sure make for some denim blues in the form of bumps, burns, and nicks.</li>
            <li> I keep way more layers of skin than I ever did with Five-Bladezilla, but I do get bumps from time to time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, my experience has been okay, but it&#x27;s not the cure-all I was hoping to discover:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> interesting part of the instructions states that you should remove any in-grown hairs.</li>
            <li> In my experience, my most unsightly bumps are from (1.)</li>
            <li> Now that&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I will buy some more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> They would burn upon application and results were minimal at best.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re out a great deal of money, I buy it at the discount store near me and it costs about 4 dollars.</li>
            <li> and you should be fine.</li>
            <li> But, this product is awesome for less servere razor bumps, ingrown hair, and razor burn too.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> were.&lt;br /&gt;After 2 days razor bumps are going away, but I HAVE A HUGE FREAKING RASH ON MY NECK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not making a HUGE difference</li>
            <li> He is light complexion and</li>
            <li> It keeps my face looking smooth.</li>
            <li> Now my skin is looking smooth and bump free.</li>
            <li> Neck is smooth, even skin tone, no worries.</li>
            <li> It makes your bump go away and smooth out the area.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read reviews here touting how cheap Bump Stopper-2 is.</li>
            <li> But this product did seem to help while he finished up the bag of really cheap razors</li>
            <li> I always steered clear of this because I thought it can&#x27;t be that good if it&#x27;s inexpensive and available everywhere</li>
            <li> the first day I used I felt itching and seeing more bumps than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t still find the original in the market.</li>
            <li> I have my own remedies (Hydrocortisone and Lanacane work well), but I&#x27;m always looking for something new.</li>
            <li> It should be used after a shower or face clean.</li>
            <li> I like it better than I do the sensitive because it controls my bumps better</li>
            <li> I bought it because I saw so many positive reviews on here.</li>
            <li> Remember to apply it RIGHT after your first shave...that&#x27;s the most important.</li>
            <li> What it DOES do is prevent razor bumps from forming in the first place and allows your hairs to cleanly pass through your skin without creating pus-filled zits on their way out!</li>
            <li> So, I picked up Bump Stopper-2 Razor Bump Treatment, Double Strength Formula after reading good reviews here.  </li>
            <li> So far, nice product.  </li>
            <li> most of my life because I am a very hairy</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give true review for this product since I bought it for a family member.</li>
            <li> really good stuff...worked out for my razor bumps on the back of my head.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff works so fast.</li>
            <li> Then take a very warm wash cloth and place it on my face for 30 sec, immediatiatly apply tend skin after removing the wash cloth.</li>
            <li> This product is tremendous.</li>
            <li> I use a double edge safety razor (a 1934 Gillette Bostonian, if you must know) and a litany of shave products that make for an excellent daily man spa in my beard garden.</li>
            <li> Depending on the severity of the bumps and/or how quickly you want to get rid of them, you can apply this once in the morning or at night until the bumps disappear.</li>
            <li> It runs out quickly and at 25 bucks a bottle</li>
            <li> I bought the remainder of them last time and am glad i did cuz this stuff sell out quick even on the internet!</li>
            <li> Love this and would reccommend it to anyone trying to get that baby bottom smooth neck back!</li>
            <li> Fresh razors, exfoliation, milk compresses, salacylic acid, prescription hydrocortisone and antibiotic creams</li>
            <li> It has the appearance of a light, flesh-colored paste that only a sociopath could love.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, and I have tried so many products, which did not work.</li>
            <li> Out of desparation, and based on other reviews, I tried this product, and much to my great surprise, it really, truly works.</li>
            <li> I found this over 20 yrs ago and thru the processes of trying other products I always come back to the best for me.</li>
            <li> Hey you get what you pay for right.</li>
            <li> However, I use this product once in the evening right before bed</li>
            <li> I had high hopes that bump stopper 2 would work after reading the many positive reviews, however, after 2 weeks of consistent use (morning, night and after shaving)</li>
            <li> Sure, you can pay sky-high prices for items in your shave kit arsenal, but the value you get from an alum block, styptic pencil, or many pre-shaves and soaps goes far beyond what this tiny tub affords.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great on our bikini area, just not for African American beards.</li>
            <li> and I must say that my nestle crunch neck has cleared up ever since I first applied it.</li>
            <li> I would advise to use it even if your bumps are mostly gone, as it prevents it from coming back.</li>
            <li> I shave with an electric shaver in the shower first</li>
            <li> This product seems to marketed mostly towards African Americans.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using tend skin for years and recently found this product, it works better than tend skin and any others I&#x27;ve used, and</li>
            <li> Along with careful shaving \\&quot;with the grain\\&quot; as much as possible, he uses this product with great success.  </li>
            <li> This product works pretty well</li>
            <li> To get rid of rashes i been using hot towels to ease the itching and swelling as well as steroid cream \\&quot;Triamcinolone\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time that day after I shaved.</li>
            <li> For the first couple weeks the product seemed to work.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this product it worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> Product works well and heals the bumps fast!</li>
            <li> It worked well the first time and it worked again.</li>
            <li> is that there is no weird smell or funkiness to the cream leaving it applicable at any time to the skin.</li>
            <li> Generic hydrocortisone cream worked better for my razor bumps than this did.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I finally found it.</li>
            <li> You see results within the first 24 to 48 hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the type of person who can shave every day, if i&#x27;m lucky I might be able to get away with every other day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 6 months at least and have had such AWESOME RESULTS  </li>
            <li> The bumps and itching would have been unbearable with my regular shaving by Sunday at the absolute latest.</li>
            <li> worked really well the first week and after that felt like it got a tolerance to it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honesty, your nose will curl at first sight of Bump Stopper-2--the color and consistency really suggest it--but relax.</li>
            <li> But over time it seemed to be less effective.</li>
            <li> I had large patches of rashes were</li>
            <li> Tend skin dry&#x27;s out my face if I use it more than two days straight.</li>
            <li> now I ordered this product and after daily use I have notice a huge inprovement in my skin the scars have lightened  </li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> but I used Bump Stopper 2 on my bikini area, so maybe not so much.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and this stuff does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much, don&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
            <li> but I absolutely dont recomend it</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
            <li> This product worked very well for me</li>
            <li> I am very prone to ingrown hairs and have tried everything to combat them.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> It is important to keep in mind that this works differently for everybody.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really does what it says.</li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> time I ordered  online and delivery was fast as promised.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> i  still moisturize for the first 24 hours and then apply a light amount of this formula on key areas in which i normally get razor bumps.</li>
            <li> (Something about that whole \\&quot;If</li>
            <li> I have a whole routine,,,,</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> You need to really use sparingly a couple times a day on your bear and neck area - as needed.</li>
            <li> I have used other products and to me, they work much better.</li>
            <li> Four days later two bumps that have been on my cheek since high school started to smooth out and look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The directions say to use Bump Stopper-2 sparingly, and you&#x27;ll find a light touch on the cream goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The more you use it, the less the bumps becomes over time.     </li>
            <li> I understand black facial hair can bit more coarse and curly which causes more severe razor bumps.</li>
            <li> If you search for info on resorcinol you should easily find the WHO report which has detailed information on this subject, written by an international panel of experts.  </li>
            <li> However, using this product has significantly reduced the bumps as long as it is used correctly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> One is rather easily removed with tweezers; the other is appeased through compliance.</li>
            <li> I still get an ingrown from time to time, but even when I do this helps clear them up much faster.</li>
            <li> probably won&#x27;t look right to you when you open it.</li>
            <li> It soothes the existing bumps and prevents new ones from appearing.</li>
            <li> I tried Tend Skin and MiN New York Solution 2.  </li>
            <li> When the new woman looked at my skin***she gave me a jar of bump stopper.  </li>
            <li> , she is my new eye brow lady and chin waxer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d become pretty accustomed to having chronic razor bumps, and occasionally they&#x27;d flare up more than usual.</li>
            <li> Typically it is considered safe for topicsl use in low concentrations..</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, the world health organization recommends against using large amounts of resorcinol topically on areas where the chemical may enter the blood stream (ie, nicks and cuts from shaving, or acne).  </li>
            <li> Solution 2-Same formula as Tend Skin only it comes in a bottle with a little roller ball on top</li>
            <li> thus far I will continue with this product in hope that my skin will completely clear up</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t done anything thus far.</li>
            <li> the general consensus is that resorcinol is probably safe for topical use as long as the concentration in your bloodstream remains low.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s very diligent about applying it regularly and it keeps the skin conditioned so bumps/</li>
            <li> Bump Stopper 2 Double Strength Treatment works very well.  </li>
            <li> Personally I do not use this as an aftershave like some have posted they do (I prefer bump patrol), so I can&#x27;t speak much about it in regards to that aspect.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely cure the problem but it helps.</li>
            <li> I get bumps quite frequently from ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> You are supposed to apply it twice daily and after shaving, and I find if I slack off, the bumps come back right away.</li>
            <li> Remember, a little goes a long way; more will do nothing for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results</li>
            <li> It gave my face a serious rash that hurts and is even more embarrassing to look at than the razor bumps and ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> give this a try, even if you&#x27;re not black.</li>
            <li> And considering that this stuff is so inexpensive, next to that high, rubbing alcohol knockoff called Tend Skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone with a similar problem.</li>
            <li> But seriously, it&#x27;s cool for laundry and carpets, but \\&quot;test some of this stuff on your skin and see what happens\\&quot; does not sound comforting.</li>
            <li> (I have heard that using this product in large quantities will dry out the skin, but I cannot verify that.</li>
            <li> I found that Bump Stopper-2 reducedthe appearance of my razor burn, usually where my collar sits against my neckline, but it did not really clear up the problem for me any more than a one-dollar tube of Hydrocortisone does from Wal-Team-America-Superstore.</li>
            <li> burn, usually where my collar sits against my neckline, but it did not really clear up the problem for me any more than a one-dollar tube of Hydrocortisone does from Wal-Team-America-Superstore.</li>
            <li> I tried so many different things, including Tend Skin, which is as high as a giraffe&#x27;s behind.</li>
            <li> At first applied it seemed to soothre but few seconds later it burned so much</li>
            <li> In many other countries resorcinol is banned outright or strictly limited for topical use in nonprescription products, however in the US there are no limitations for topical use (a policy which some claim needs to be revised).  </li>
            <li> The good thing is that since it&#x27;s effective in preventing/getting rid of those nasty bumps, in the same process it helps expose the ingrown hairs that are persistent and stay behind (making them easy to pluck out).   </li>
            <li> This stuff works great, I had been looking for a solution to stop painful ingrown hairs along my neck and chin area for years.</li>
            <li> I presently use a Alum Blok &amp; Clubman Gel directly aftershaving with Bump Fighter Razor then finish up with Bump Stopper for the problem areas.</li>
            <li> I tried buying everything from sensitive skin electric razors, to similar bump products like bump patrol and tend skin to no avail.</li>
            <li> For one reason or another, some of us are just unlucky (genetically, that is): sensitive skin, coarse hair, curly hair.</li>
            <li> Felt like it made razor bumps worse, my face was better when I stopped using.</li>
            <li> However, I would urge caution in using this product frequently as it has a high concentration of resorcinol (the active ingredient).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased these before and a small amount of use will quickly bring about results.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the first product that has actually given me enough confidence to take up wet shaving again.</li>
            <li> No burn, smells not bad, and a little goes a long time.</li>
            <li> By the next day (today actually) my face was totally clear.</li>
            <li> Most of the time I have to switch back and forth between my Schick Hydro and electric to try and minimize the unsightly bumps and irritating burn.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I should have gotten the Sensitive Formula, which has the same ingredients as the Double Strength, but with one extra one (Resorcin).  </li>
            <li> Does dry face out at first so be careful and sparing in amount used initially.</li>
            <li> It has potentially beneficial ingredients not commonly found in other products and everyone&#x27;s skin will respond differently.</li>
            <li> Im not entirely sure how too explain how this products works product although another reviewer mentioned the possibility of adverse health effects due to the key active ingredient  and conflicting studies pointing in two directions  but putting that aside i couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better product.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate, and using a dab vs. a glob made little difference as far as dryness goes.</li>
            <li> My only suggestion is to look at Walgreens or other pharmacy stores first because after I bought this, I kept seeing this in stores for almost half the price.</li>
            <li> visited a local barbershop, long story short</li>
            <li> Bump Stopper worked moderately well, as did Tend Skin, but did not completely take care of the problem; Bump Stopper-2 is the only thing that eliminated the ingrown hairs and redness.</li>
            <li> So instead I started to only use it before going to sleep and it had just about the same effect (without the dry skin).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have sensitive skin, and I don&#x27;t groom my skin with an overpriced five-blade vibrating super stick either.</li>
            <li> After dealing with burning and bumps for as long as I&#x27;ve been shaving, I finally find something that works against that.  </li>
            <li> a black guy/31/no history of sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It smells a little smokey, but from someone who has an easily offended nose, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad or powerful or menthally like a lot of others.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I should of not been cheap and waste my money.</li>
            <li> had this bump a long time because i picked it since i thought it was a pimple</li>
            <li> My husband has been using bump stopper for 1-2 years after a long struggle with shaving.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Bump Stopper for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long since stopped shaving with a razor.  </li>
            <li> I have been  using Bump Stopper  for long time, but I always buy it from Walgreens .&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend it if your ingrown hairs/bumps aren&#x27;t too severe and just a minor problem to you.</li>
            <li> So I suspect that one of the ingredients may be an allergen for some, but I am not clear which ingredient it is.</li>
            <li> for day-to-day little shaving bumps and burns, in addition to in-grown battle wounds, I have not seen profound results, and believe me, I&#x27;ve struggled with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really had an issue with razor bumps, however, I dry shaved twice recently using an electric razor and my face was visibly irritated.</li>
            <li> Although truth be told, everyone&#x27;s face skin is probably different than their other skin (legs, arms, etc.)</li>
            <li> Very small amount for the price, doesn&#x27;t work very well for bikini-area bumps.</li>
            <li> One week into treatment, my razor bumps and ingrowns have all but disappeared, with no new problems.</li>
            <li> missed an appointment on a Wednesday to my usual young lady that does my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> My skin is not that sensitive, so whatever is in this is not safe \\&quot;for</li>
            <li> I only use 2 about half the time, when I think about it at night.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have colored print but black and white print on its body.</li>
            <li> I noticed that using this twice a day (morning and evening) leaves my skin very dry.</li>
            <li> only catch is you MUST use it after every shave, and everyday in the morning and evening.</li>
            <li> No real problems for me in this</li>
            <li> Plain and simply, this product didn&#x27;t seem to do anything for me at all.</li>
            <li> I had tiny little bumps not many at all on each side of the back of my head..</li>
            <li> I had small bumps from shaving just above my knee and thighs.  </li>
            <li> applied it twice a day after removing facial hair and within 2 weeks all razor bumps and even small pimples i had on my cheeks were gone...</li>
            <li> The other days, it&#x27;s just one at the start of the day.</li>
            <li> but it became pretty useless after a while.</li>
            <li> Item worked but its a small amount and leaves a white residue.</li>
            <li> instructions carry a warning to apply to a small test area before regular use.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s cheaper than other alternatives I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> The other options I mentioned, which don&#x27;t work as well, are 5 times that price.</li>
            <li> the neck area was dark due to the bumps.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I have been plagued with acne, hair bumps, dark spots...</li>
            <li> Resorcinol is a potential carcinogen, has negative effects on the thyroid and is a known skin sensitizer.</li>
            <li> Occasionaly I will get a couple smaller bumps but never the large painful ones.  </li>
            <li> Only thing that sucks is you have to use it FAITHFULLY everyday to keep them away but other than that no complaints!</li>
            <li> BUT YOU MUST USE AT LAST ONCE EVERY DAY OR EVERY OTHER DAY AT LEAST!  </li>
            <li> A dollar for less razor burn?</li>
            <li> A dollar for less razor burn?</li>
            <li> My beard is trouble, and this is one product that has reduced my face skin problems, its not flawless, and its not a miracle cream, but it really helps if you have razor bumps and ingrown hair problems.</li>
            <li> I have had dark scars on my chin sides of my face and neck for a few years</li>
            <li> , it does not make a MESS.</li>
            <li> Bumps go down and in a few days, away.     </li>
            <li> After making a trip to the local Barber shop I got into a conversation about my painful ingrown hair problem with the barber and he suggested High Times Bump Stopper.</li>
            <li> ; Little tip: after shaving &amp;#34;dry pat&amp;#34; shaved area before putting on.  </li>
            <li> I still have a few bumps</li>
            <li> So, I would get itchy bumps if I didn&#x27;t shave every two days, ever since I started shaving a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few years and it never disappoints.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 15 years and its the only thing that stops those irritating bumps after shaving.</li>
            <li> But alas, I also have coarse hair that curls:</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not cheap.</li>
            <li> I have a few small bumps on my cheeks because I shave the few hairs off my face with a eye brow archer.</li>
            <li> Appears to work, just a little messy!</li>
            <li> I stopped for a while using it on the back of my neck, and although the bumps weren&#x27;t as bad as they were in the past, I went back to using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this daily without fail for one month</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for little over a week and the bumps are few and no burn!!  </li>
            <li> This product comes in a small jar and it is creamy not oily.</li>
            <li> I apply a small amount and rub on bumps.</li>
            <li> Love this product I have horrible course hair on my chin and have to shave often causing razor bumbs</li>
            <li> Bump Stopper has made that a problem of the past.  </li>
            <li> I use it nightly before bed, and usually after every shave with the Braun.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it before in the past, but could not find it in stores</li>
            <li> this item is hard to find in my area.</li>
            <li> While it was cheap, it did something terrible.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I would still recommend others to at least try it.</li>
            <li> and i did without question only because i was desperate.</li>
            <li> Since using this product my bumps have slowly disappeared.</li>
            <li> After years of struggling with razor bumps that would make shaving into a (literally) bloody chore and cause my skin to break out afterwards due to incessant ingrown hairs, Bump Stopper-2 has finally given my skin the reprieve it&#x27;s been hoping for since puberty.</li>
            <li> I purchased the high time bump stopper for the red, painful, ugly razor bumps on my neck.</li>
            <li> Frustrating, and this did very little for me.</li>
            <li> What sucks is that it seemed to be working before it gave me a red, bumpy and painful rash.  </li>
            <li> But this stuff worked, and I mean IMMEDIATELY!</li>
            <li> Totally frustrating.  </li>
            <li> I stopped at a random shop.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know what was wrong with this one.....</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the safety razor helps.</li>
            <li> Writing department: Fail (epic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was wrong, it does work, and works well, so give it a try.</li>
            <li> It does help get rid of bumps, but there is a weird smell.</li>
            <li> I put it on both in the morning and at night and no more ugly razor bumps!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like writing bad or even mediocre reviews.</li>
            <li> Oh and it smells bad too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Min</li>
            <li> : I tried them all, and still I had persistent, ugly razor bumps and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> the triple whammy of bad genefication!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn when you apply, and doesn&#x27;t have an awful odor like some products do.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have had dark scars on my chin sides of my face and neck for a few years now I ordered this product and after daily use I have notice a huge inprovement in my skin the scars have lightened  I still have a few bumps but im happy with the results thus far I will continue with this product in hope that my skin will completely clear up I would recommend this product to men and women who may have bumps and scars. I have been using this daily without fail for one month and I feel more confident than ever...</li>
            <li> Works both as a preventive measure as well as  treatment for an existing razor burn. It soothes the existing bumps and prevents new ones from appearing. I use it on my bikini line and my boyfriend uses it after shaving. All around great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been experiencing razor bumps and ingrown hairs for a while.  I just got over acne (I&#x27;m 25), but now it looks like it never went away.  However, razor bumps and ingrown hairs hurt.  And they&#x27;re just as embarrassing as acne.  I tried Tend Skin and MiN New York Solution 2.  Both did similar things - exposed the trapped hairs, but didn&#x27;t really treat the problem.  So, I picked up Bump Stopper-2 Razor Bump Treatment, Double Strength Formula after reading good reviews here.  Big mistake.  While it was cheap, it did something terrible.  It gave my face a serious rash that hurts and is even more embarrassing to look at than the razor bumps and ingrown hairs.  I regret buying this stuff.  Perhaps I should have gotten the Sensitive Formula, which has the same ingredients as the Double Strength, but with one extra one (Resorcin).  What sucks is that it seemed to be working before it gave me a red, bumpy and painful rash.  Be cautious and test this on your skin before you put it on your face.  Although truth be told, everyone&#x27;s face skin is probably different than their other skin (legs, arms, etc.) so even testing the product might not be helpful.  Edit: I went to the doctor because my face had not gotten any better after 24 hours.  He prescribed some allergy medicine for the itching and then some Prednisone for the swelling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a week now and I&#x27;m impressed with the quick results. It really works. I had used Bump-Patrol before and wasn&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 4 years now and I must say that my nestle crunch neck has cleared up ever since I first applied it. You notice a DRASTIC difference from when you apply it before bed and wake up in the morning. Only thing that sucks is you have to use it FAITHFULLY everyday to keep them away but other than that no complaints! Doesn&#x27;t burn when you apply, and doesn&#x27;t have an awful odor like some products do. Love this and would reccommend it to anyone trying to get that baby bottom smooth neck back!</li>
            <li> I bought it because I saw so many positive reviews on here. I&#x27;ve tried what feels like everything under the sun and I cannot get rid of razor bumps. Frustrating, and this did very little for me.</li>
            <li> ...but I used Bump Stopper 2 on my bikini area, so maybe not so much. Fresh razors, exfoliation, milk compresses, salacylic acid, prescription hydrocortisone and antibiotic creams: I tried them all, and still I had persistent, ugly razor bumps and ingrown hairs. Out of desparation, and based on other reviews, I tried this product, and much to my great surprise, it really, truly works. I followed the directions to the letter, and within 3 days the condition of my skin was visibly improved. One week into treatment, my razor bumps and ingrowns have all but disappeared, with no new problems. The price is reasonable and this stuff does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!! I&#x27;ve been using this product for 6 months at least and have had such AWESOME RESULTS  that I just had to make my 1st review ever on any product. I never do this... Lol... So if this tells you anything.&lt;br /&gt;LISTEN  UP! &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; Little tip: after shaving &amp;#34;dry pat&amp;#34; shaved area before putting on.  This will leave your face, legs, chest, w/e feeling moisturized, hydrated, and PROTECTED FROM RAZOR BURN. BUT YOU MUST USE AT LAST ONCE EVERY DAY OR EVERY OTHER DAY AT LEAST!  AND ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS USE THE DAY OR NIGHT BEFORE YOUR SHAVE AND ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS IMMEDIATELY AFTER YOUR SHAPE MOST IMPORTANTLY!  &amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60; LISTEN UP!</li>
            <li> After years of struggling with razor bumps that would make shaving into a (literally) bloody chore and cause my skin to break out afterwards due to incessant ingrown hairs, Bump Stopper-2 has finally given my skin the reprieve it&#x27;s been hoping for since puberty. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It does not STING, it does not STINK, it does not make a MESS. What it DOES do is prevent razor bumps from forming in the first place and allows your hairs to cleanly pass through your skin without creating pus-filled zits on their way out! Hallelujah! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only catch is you MUST use it after every shave, and everyday in the morning and evening. No hassle, though... Just do it whenever you brush your teeth and you should be fine. Now I just have to hope that they keep making the stuff until I die at the age of 120!</li>
            <li> if you have skin that is irritated by shaving: this is the product for you! my husband swears by it! and i can see the results! one box lasts around one month.. its a good deal</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d become pretty accustomed to having chronic razor bumps, and occasionally they&#x27;d flare up more than usual. I decided to try Bump Stopper 2 and voila! I put it on both in the morning and at night and no more ugly razor bumps!</li>
            <li> After dealing with burning and bumps for as long as I&#x27;ve been shaving, I finally find something that works against that.  I shave my head and face every 3 - 4 days.  Most of the time I have to switch back and forth between my Schick Hydro and electric to try and minimize the unsightly bumps and irritating burn.  Totally frustrating.  I&#x27;ve been using this for little over a week and the bumps are few and no burn!!  Are you kidding me!?  So far, nice product.  I hope it continues to work because if it does I&#x27;m stocking up big time.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes that bump stopper 2 would work after reading the many positive reviews, however, after 2 weeks of consistent use (morning, night and after shaving) I still had razor bumps. The appearance of the bumps may have lessened somewhat but not nearly enough.     That being said, I would still recommend others to at least try it. It has potentially beneficial ingredients not commonly found in other products and everyone&#x27;s skin will respond differently.</li>
            <li> I bought all kinds of stuff for my husband&#x27;s neck area. He is light complexion and the neck area was dark due to the bumps. A coworker told me about this and i cannot tell you how remarkable this stuff worked. My husband says look it works. Thanks so much, don&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
            <li> I found this over 20 yrs ago and thru the processes of trying other products I always come back to the best for me. I presently use a Alum Blok &amp; Clubman Gel directly aftershaving with Bump Fighter Razor then finish up with Bump Stopper for the problem areas. Although Clubman states it can be used on entire face or spot treatment. It just seems in my case Bump Stopper works best (twice a day)I&#x27;ll continue using these products together.</li>
            <li> this item is hard to find in my area. I bought the remainder of them last time and am glad i did cuz this stuff sell out quick even on the internet! good price good stuff:)</li>
            <li> I used to have problems with bumps. However, using this product has significantly reduced the bumps as long as it is used correctly. I use it after 3-4 times after a shave. It should be used after a shower or face clean. The more you use it, the less the bumps becomes over time.     I would advise to use it even if your bumps are mostly gone, as it prevents it from coming back.</li>
            <li> Felt like it made razor bumps worse, my face was better when I stopped using. I used it two or three times, I&#x27;ll never use it again.</li>
            <li> I use this product in conjunction with tend skin. I shave with an electric shaver in the shower first (Panasonic)as soon as I hop out I grab the tweezers and pluck any existing hair that was missed or embedded under my skin. Then take a very warm wash cloth and place it on my face for 30 sec, immediatiatly apply tend skin after removing the wash cloth. Before going to bed that same night repeat wash cloth and tend skin method. Then the following day after your morning shower apply Bump stopper 2. This method will keep your face from drying out and keep the ingrowns from occuring as well as pimples.  I&#x27;m not the type of person who can shave every day, if i&#x27;m lucky I might be able to get away with every other day. Tend skin dry&#x27;s out my face if I use it more than two days straight. I hope this helps you all out. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how good this stuff works. I was browsing Amazon and came across this product. It&#x27;s the same one I purchased at the drug store. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about 4 years now, and it doesn&#x27;t even take a day to see the results. When using it regularly, you won&#x27;t even see any bumps. I used it on my face for a while and haven&#x27;t had any bumps since. I stopped for a while using it on the back of my neck, and although the bumps weren&#x27;t as bad as they were in the past, I went back to using it. Same results. Bumps go down and in a few days, away.     The dermatologist gave me a cream some 11 years ago and it worked so well. But this stuff works even better. Great product.</li>
            <li> So got the product tested on hand for about a week. Said ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then placed it on neck are where the razor bumps were.&lt;br /&gt;After 2 days razor bumps are going away, but I HAVE A HUGE FREAKING RASH ON MY NECK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So testing may not be enough because different parts of the skin may react differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has any solutions please tell me.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0000532PW Bump Stopper-2 Razor Bump Treatment, Double Strength Formula - .5 oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot begin to tell you how this product worked &#x27;overnight&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been plagued with acne, hair bumps, dark spots...most of my life because I am a very hairy woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after numberous visits to dermatologists, spending thusands over the years on skin care products, nothing seemed to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I missed an appointment on a Wednesday to my usual young lady that does my eyebrows.  I stopped at a random shop.  When the new woman looked at my skin***she gave me a jar of bump stopper.  Needeless to say, she is my new eye brow lady and chin waxer.  SMILE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it immediately and noticed results the next day.  Four days later two bumps that have been on my cheek since high school started to smooth out and look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel better about my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told in six week, if I follow the instructions to the T, I will have smoother clearer skin.</li>
            <li> Been using for a week. Hasn&#x27;t done anything thus far.</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks.  I used to get razor burn all the time, but now it&#x27;s under control.  It smells a little smokey, but from someone who has an easily offended nose, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad or powerful or menthally like a lot of others.</li>
            <li> At first applied it seemed to soothre but few seconds later it burned so much I had to wash my face.tried several times,same result.I may be alergic to something in this but I absolutely dont recomend it</li>
            <li> This product seems to marketed mostly towards African Americans. I understand black facial hair can bit more coarse and curly which causes more severe razor bumps. But, this product is awesome for less servere razor bumps, ingrown hair, and razor burn too. It keeps my face looking smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using tend skin for years and recently found this product, it works better than tend skin and any others I&#x27;ve used, and its cheap!  However, I would urge caution in using this product frequently as it has a high concentration of resorcinol (the active ingredient).  In many other countries resorcinol is banned outright or strictly limited for topical use in nonprescription products, however in the US there are no limitations for topical use (a policy which some claim needs to be revised).  Resorcinol is a potential carcinogen, has negative effects on the thyroid and is a known skin sensitizer. Typically it is considered safe for topicsl use in low concentrations.. HOWEVER, the world health organization recommends against using large amounts of resorcinol topically on areas where the chemical may enter the blood stream (ie, nicks and cuts from shaving, or acne).  If you search for info on resorcinol you should easily find the WHO report which has detailed information on this subject, written by an international panel of experts.  Personally I am still using this product but in moderation and cautiously.. the general consensus is that resorcinol is probably safe for topical use as long as the concentration in your bloodstream remains low.</li>
            <li> Seems to work as advertised. Did reduce my razor bumps and irritation.</li>
            <li> worked really well the first week and after that felt like it got a tolerance to it. had this bump a long time because i picked it since i thought it was a pimple</li>
            <li> I had small bumps from shaving just above my knee and thighs.  I&#x27;ve been using the product once to twice daily and they are almost gone.</li>
            <li> visited a local barbershop, long story short my face was covered in razor bumps. My friend told me to try bump stopper-2 and i did without question only because i was desperate. applied it twice a day after removing facial hair and within 2 weeks all razor bumps and even small pimples i had on my cheeks were gone...i def recommend this product</li>
            <li> My husband has been using bump stopper for 1-2 years after a long struggle with shaving.  Before finding Bump Stopper, his neck would break out with red bumps almost immediately after shaving, then the ingrown hairs would follow. It seems to be caused by his course hairs that grow in all different directions.  Along with careful shaving \\&quot;with the grain\\&quot; as much as possible, he uses this product with great success.  He&#x27;s very diligent about applying it regularly and it keeps the skin conditioned so bumps/ingrown hairs don&#x27;t develop.</li>
            <li> Best thing for razor bumps on all skin types! No burn, smells not bad, and a little goes a long time.</li>
            <li> I use this in place of After Shave Lotion every day.  It has been instrumental along with bump patrol in ridding razor bumps.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
            <li> This product works pretty well incase your having a flare up of scalp folliculitis like I do sometimes.  I also use it after shaving sometimes to reduce irritation. Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> I had tiny little bumps not many at all on each side of the back of my head..I get them every now and then from edging my hair. I put this product on both sides on the bumps. It caused both sides where i edged a week ago to swell and rash up in 24 hrs. I had large patches of rashes were i had used this product. My skin is not that sensitive, so whatever is in this is not safe \\&quot;for me anyhow\\&quot;. I tried this product 3 times about 60 days apart just to see because i didn&#x27;t believe it was causing the rash. After the third time \\&quot;now\\&quot; i cant even go outside... its embarrassing! Looks like i got bit by something that didn&#x27;t cause puss bumps but inflamed skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a black guy/31/no history of sensitive skin. To get rid of rashes i been using hot towels to ease the itching and swelling as well as steroid cream \\&quot;Triamcinolone\\&quot;. Also taking Benadryl.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I should of not been cheap and waste my money. I saw the 25 dollar solution like princereigns but didnt have the cash to put out. Hey you get what you pay for right.</li>
            <li> So, I would get itchy bumps if I didn&#x27;t shave every two days, ever since I started shaving a few years ago. I&#x27;m 35, mind you, but always used clippers. Anyway, I&#x27;ve been locked into shaving because of these ingrown hairs. I tried so many different things, including Tend Skin, which is as high as a giraffe&#x27;s behind. And really, it&#x27;s only glorified alcohol. But this stuff worked, and I mean IMMEDIATELY! The last time I shaved was Thursday of last week. I used this for the first time that day after I shaved. It&#x27;s now Friday morning of the following week. The bumps and itching would have been unbearable with my regular shaving by Sunday at the absolute latest. Tend Skin would have bought me an additional day. But I haven&#x27;t gone this lone (over a week now) without a shave since I started shaving, and I&#x27;m not itching, and there are no bumps!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I don&#x27;t even use the stuff as directed all the time. You&#x27;re supposed to use 2 applications a day. I only use 2 about half the time, when I think about it at night. The other days, it&#x27;s just one at the start of the day. Still, I have no complaints at all! And considering that this stuff is so inexpensive, next to that high, rubbing alcohol knockoff called Tend Skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My plan is to switch back to using clippers. Bump Stopper has made that possible!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really had an issue with razor bumps, however, I dry shaved twice recently using an electric razor and my face was visibly irritated. It looked like i had an acne breakout but I had never had one so severe so I figured it could be razor bumps (that along with the itching and burning sensation in the area). I found this product and decided to give it a try. By the next day (today actually) my face was totally clear.</li>
            <li> i used this for a bit and it works well.  the scent isnt really pleasant but not a deal breaker either.</li>
            <li> It says it&#x27;s shows  improvement in 48hrs, it&#x27;s been a week since I&#x27;ve started using this. Nothing. My razor bumps are still the Same. Will not purchase again</li>
            <li> This product worked very well for me and it&#x27;s the first product that has actually given me enough confidence to take up wet shaving again. I would like to add that technique is also a very important part of shaving and should not be neglected.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product. I have been using it for a few years and it never disappoints. I will always recommend it and welcome first timers to give it a chance. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is tremendous. Give it a try! You won&#x27;t be disappointed. I wish I had learned about is sooner in my life, it would have helped me in so many ways.</li>
            <li> Bump Stopper 2 Double Strength Treatment works very well.  It exfoliates the area and releases ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I purchased the high time bump stopper for the red, painful, ugly razor bumps on my neck. For the first couple weeks the product seemed to work. But after extended use my body seemed to become immune to it and it no longer worked. It is easy to apply and goes on smoothly.  Although this is not the best product I think for razor bumps.  After years of research and trial and error I discovered Tend Skin.  Tend skin works the best on my razor bumps.  With habitual use my razor bumps have almost gone away. Occasionaly I will get a couple smaller bumps but never the large painful ones.  Try tend skin and see if it works for you.  I purchased it also using amazon.</li>
            <li> Very small amount for the price, doesn&#x27;t work very well for bikini-area bumps. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I just got it...hope it works.</li>
            <li> I recommend ask a pharmacist before use any medicine!</li>
            <li> I have a few small bumps on my cheeks because I shave the few hairs off my face with a eye brow archer. Since using this product my bumps have slowly disappeared. Now my skin is looking smooth and bump free. This product comes in a small jar and it is creamy not oily. I apply a small amount and rub on bumps. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this product it worked as advertised. But over time it seemed to be less effective. Maybe my skin just got used to it but it became pretty useless after a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased these before and a small amount of use will quickly bring about results. A good product to have on hand.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give true review for this product since I bought it for a family member. I was told that it worked nicely.</li>
            <li> Love this product I have horrible course hair on my chin and have to shave often causing razor bumbs but once I used this product it cleared my bumbs away almost instantly!!! I use this product twice a day pm and am  love it love it!!!</li>
            <li> I am very prone to ingrown hairs and have tried everything to combat them. Bump Stopper worked moderately well, as did Tend Skin, but did not completely take care of the problem; Bump Stopper-2 is the only thing that eliminated the ingrown hairs and redness. You are supposed to apply it twice daily and after shaving, and I find if I slack off, the bumps come back right away. But if I stick to it, my skin is perfect! I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Bump Stopper for as long as I can remember.  I&#x27;ve long since stopped shaving with a razor.  I&#x27;m an electric kinda guy.  Regardless, I always had ingrown hair issues on my neck.  Bump Stopper has made that a problem of the past.  I use it nightly before bed, and usually after every shave with the Braun.  Neck is smooth, even skin tone, no worries.</li>
            <li> really good stuff...worked out for my razor bumps on the back of my head.</li>
            <li> It works really well. I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> Personally I do not use this as an aftershave like some have posted they do (I prefer bump patrol), so I can&#x27;t speak much about it in regards to that aspect. However, I use this product once in the evening right before bed and it works great for me in preventing the bumps. The change in bumps and ingrown formation is about 90%. The good thing is that since it&#x27;s effective in preventing/getting rid of those nasty bumps, in the same process it helps expose the ingrown hairs that are persistent and stay behind (making them easy to pluck out).   It is important to keep in mind that this works differently for everybody. I noticed that using this twice a day (morning and evening) leaves my skin very dry. So instead I started to only use it before going to sleep and it had just about the same effect (without the dry skin).</li>
            <li> Item worked but its a small amount and leaves a white residue.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this product. I think it works.. or maybe it just soothes and is making me think it&#x27;s working? It&#x27;s not making a HUGE difference but it&#x27;s definitely better than nothing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 15 years and its the only thing that stops those irritating bumps after shaving. I tell all my friends about how great this product is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really does what it says. Work really well y recommend this to any person who has problem with under skin hair</li>
            <li> Product works well and heals the bumps fast!</li>
            <li> Works great and is teriffic at stopping the razor burn. Does dry face out at first so be careful and sparing in amount used initially.</li>
            <li> I like it better than I do the sensitive because it controls my bumps better</li>
            <li> I have been  using Bump Stopper  for long time, but I always buy it from Walgreens .&lt;br /&gt;This time I ordered  online and delivery was fast as promised.&lt;br /&gt;But the first day I used I felt itching and seeing more bumps than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;Then I immediately get one from Walgreens and I am feeling  better now.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what was wrong with this one.....</li>
            <li> This is my second time using this product in 4 years. It worked well the first time and it worked again.</li>
            <li> Im not entirely sure how too explain how this products works product although another reviewer mentioned the possibility of adverse health effects due to the key active ingredient  and conflicting studies pointing in two directions  but putting that aside i couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better product. it simply works. After a close shave with a razor i  still moisturize for the first 24 hours and then apply a light amount of this formula on key areas in which i normally get razor bumps. Except that when i am using this product razor bumps are almost non existent. Continual use is recommended in order to prevent further ingrown prevents the itching or burning associated with razors bumps. Another +  is that there is no weird smell or funkiness to the cream leaving it applicable at any time to the skin.</li>
            <li> I loved this product! I&#x27;ve used it before in the past, but could not find it in stores so I ordered it offline instead. I started seeing results within days. I highly recommend it. It makes your bump go away and smooth out the area.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great, I had been looking for a solution to stop painful ingrown hairs along my neck and chin area for years. I tried buying everything from sensitive skin electric razors, to similar bump products like bump patrol and tend skin to no avail. They would burn upon application and results were minimal at best. After making a trip to the local Barber shop I got into a conversation about my painful ingrown hair problem with the barber and he suggested High Times Bump Stopper. He too had an ingrown hair problem and swore by it. After buying it on Amazon I saw results after about a week. The pain went away and so did the redness and bumps that were constantly on my neck. I still get an ingrown from time to time, but even when I do this helps clear them up much faster. I highly recommend this to anyone with a similar problem.</li>
            <li> For one reason or another, some of us are just unlucky (genetically, that is): sensitive skin, coarse hair, curly hair. Whatever genes you&#x27;re wearing, they can sure make for some denim blues in the form of bumps, burns, and nicks. Unfortunately, I have sensitive skin, and I don&#x27;t groom my skin with an overpriced five-blade vibrating super stick either. I use a double edge safety razor (a 1934 Gillette Bostonian, if you must know) and a litany of shave products that make for an excellent daily man spa in my beard garden. But alas, I also have coarse hair that curls: the triple whammy of bad genefication! Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the safety razor helps. I keep way more layers of skin than I ever did with Five-Bladezilla, but I do get bumps from time to time. I have my own remedies (Hydrocortisone and Lanacane work well), but I&#x27;m always looking for something new. Enter Bump Stopper-2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my experience has been okay, but it&#x27;s not the cure-all I was hoping to discover:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read reviews here touting how cheap Bump Stopper-2 is. At $5.80-$7.50 for 100g of product? I don&#x27;t think so. Sure, you can pay sky-high prices for items in your shave kit arsenal, but the value you get from an alum block, styptic pencil, or many pre-shaves and soaps goes far beyond what this tiny tub affords. I wonder if Bump Stopper-1 was cheaper...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look, Smell, and Feel&lt;br /&gt;Bump Stopper-2 probably won&#x27;t look right to you when you open it. It has the appearance of a light, flesh-colored paste that only a sociopath could love. The directions say to use Bump Stopper-2 sparingly, and you&#x27;ll find a light touch on the cream goes a long way. And while it looks pasty, it goes on smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honesty, your nose will curl at first sight of Bump Stopper-2--the color and consistency really suggest it--but relax. It doesn&#x27;t at all. In the amount that you will use, you will find it rather scentless. No real problems for me in this area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions&lt;br /&gt;The instructions carry a warning to apply to a small test area before regular use. This so reminded me of a carpet or garment warning: \\&quot;Test on an inconspicuous area before....\\&quot; So I suspect that one of the ingredients may be an allergen for some, but I am not clear which ingredient it is. But seriously, it&#x27;s cool for laundry and carpets, but \\&quot;test some of this stuff on your skin and see what happens\\&quot; does not sound comforting. Writing department: Fail (epic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond that, the instructions say to use the product sparingly twice daily and after shaves. (I have heard that using this product in large quantities will dry out the skin, but I cannot verify that. Yes, I tried. I live in a very dry climate, and using a dab vs. a glob made little difference as far as dryness goes. So no, you can&#x27;t use this as an antiperspirant.) Remember, a little goes a long way; more will do nothing for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results&lt;br /&gt;One interesting part of the instructions states that you should remove any in-grown hairs. In my experience, my most unsightly bumps are from (1.) in-grown hairs and (2.) my wife telling me to take out the garbage. One is rather easily removed with tweezers; the other is appeased through compliance. For the in-grown problem that requires tweezers, I find that the bumps lessen greatly without any product whatsoever, Bump Stopper-2 included. Yes, once the irritant is gone, the bump stops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;As for day-to-day little shaving bumps and burns, in addition to in-grown battle wounds, I have not seen profound results, and believe me, I&#x27;ve struggled with this. I don&#x27;t like writing bad or even mediocre reviews. (Something about that whole \\&quot;If you can&#x27;t say anything nice...\\&quot; stuff my Southern mother drilled into me and my Coke-filled bottles.) Perhaps the best way to describe my experience with this product is that it is like products that promise to \\&quot;reduce the appearance of\\&quot; one thing or another. I found that Bump Stopper-2 reducedthe appearance of my razor burn, usually where my collar sits against my neckline, but it did not really clear up the problem for me any more than a one-dollar tube of Hydrocortisone does from Wal-Team-America-Superstore. A dollar for less razor burn? Now that&#x27;s cheap!the appearance of my razor burn, usually where my collar sits against my neckline, but it did not really clear up the problem for me any more than a one-dollar tube of Hydrocortisone does from Wal-Team-America-Superstore. A dollar for less razor burn? Now that&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li> I Am a woman using this on my legs to reduce ingrown hairs and red bumps after depilatory-ing. It doesn&#x27;t completely cure the problem but it helps. I have a whole routine,,,, (I have curly hair on my head, and I guess now on my legs too so the hairs curl in and get ingrown.) however, they should sell this in a larger size for women because this jar is tiny! And if I use if every day on 2 legs, then it runs out in about a week.</li>
            <li> Plain and simply, this product didn&#x27;t seem to do anything for me at all. Generic hydrocortisone cream worked better for my razor bumps than this did.</li>
            <li> This product does not get the job done as I was expecting. I have used other products and to me, they work much better.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t still find the original in the market. It doesn&#x27;t have colored print but black and white print on its body. That&#x27;s the one that works.</li>
            <li> Use this all the time...best thing for razor bumps. Remember to apply it RIGHT after your first shave...that&#x27;s the most important. Depending on the severity of the bumps and/or how quickly you want to get rid of them, you can apply this once in the morning or at night until the bumps disappear.</li>
            <li> Very good product that always produces good results for me.  I get bumps quite frequently from ingrown hairs.  This helps to control it nicely.</li>
            <li> This seemed to work very nicely for my husband and his razor burn.  I think it was cause of the razors he was using, because he switched and he doesn&#x27;t have razor burn anymore.  But this product did seem to help while he finished up the bag of really cheap razors lol.  My only suggestion is to look at Walgreens or other pharmacy stores first because after I bought this, I kept seeing this in stores for almost half the price.</li>
            <li> My beard is trouble, and this is one product that has reduced my face skin problems, its not flawless, and its not a miracle cream, but it really helps if you have razor bumps and ingrown hair problems. i do recommend it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all, after following the directions stringently.</li>
            <li> This is a trick that white girls know... This stuff works great on our bikini area, just not for African American beards.</li>
            <li> Okay .very nice cleared all the bumps .</li>
            <li> This product is marketed toward African American men, but I&#x27;m white and I use it and it works great for me. I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s the only thing that does and it&#x27;s cheaper than other alternatives I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried them all. Let me list a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PrinceReigns-worked but you have to apply it once a day for a week then twice a day after that. It runs out quickly and at 25 bucks a bottle it&#x27;s not cheap. One bottle lasted me a month, but I couldn&#x27;t afford to keep spending 25 a month on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TendSkin-all this is is alcohol with aspirin in it. It didn&#x27;t work for me and stings like the dickens if you put it on after shaving, which the directions suggest. Oh and it smells bad too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Min Solution 2-Same formula as Tend Skin only it comes in a bottle with a little roller ball on top so it&#x27;s easier to apply. Didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So give this a try, even if you&#x27;re not black. I always steered clear of this because I thought it can&#x27;t be that good if it&#x27;s inexpensive and available everywhere, I&#x27;ll go with the pricier alternative you can only buy at salons(TendSkin and PrinceReigns) I was wrong, it does work, and works well, so give it a try. And if it doesn&#x27;t work for you it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re out a great deal of money, I buy it at the discount store near me and it costs about 4 dollars. The other options I mentioned, which don&#x27;t work as well, are 5 times that price.</li>
            <li> Appears to work, just a little messy!</li>
            <li> The price was good and the product arrived on time. I&#x27;m sure I will buy some more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> I feel like I haven&#x27;t seen amazing results with this cream but I have seen some results and honestly anything helps. I would recommend it if your ingrown hairs/bumps aren&#x27;t too severe and just a minor problem to you.</li>
            <li> Great stuff if u are having shaving bumps</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a product like this for years. I am so glad I finally found it. It really works. You need to really use sparingly a couple times a day on your bear and neck area - as needed. I can finally shave with a razor again.</li>
            <li> This product was above my expectations. I have extremely sensitive skin, and I have tried so many products, which did not work. This treatment works instantly, and gets the job done. There are no bumps....none, after use! It does what it says! Try it, you will love it!</li>
            <li> About as effective as you can get for a non-prescription anit-bump treatment, and at a fair price.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff works so fast. You see results within the first 24 to 48 hours. I would recommend this to anyone that has and issues with razor bumps.</li>
            <li> It does help get rid of bumps, but there is a weird smell.</li>
    </ol>
