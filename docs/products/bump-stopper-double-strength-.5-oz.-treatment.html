            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products to get rid of my shaving bumps.  This is by far the best and most effective.  I&#x27;ve used it for years now.  If you follow the instructions and use it after every time you shave and twice a day you will find it does indeed prevent shaving bumps.  Few products actually deliver on their promises.  This one does.</li>
            <li> THIS WORKS AND ITS THE BEST HANDS DOWN!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i HAVE USED OTHER SO CALLED BUMP STOPPING PRODUCTS BUT THEY WILL MAKE YOUR SKIN PEEL NOT BUMP STOPPER.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 2 years and it works amazingly. It&#x27;s the only product that keeps razor bumps at bay for me.</li>
            <li> Works great. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it keeps me irritation/bump free.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bump Stopper for over 15 years. It is the only product that I have found that does not irritate my skin and has lessen greatly my ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I use this all of the time after I shave and it works as advertised.  I definitely recommend this product to people who have a lot of issues with razor bumps.</li>
            <li> Wish that the old formula that was not water based is brought back. Good product nonetheless.</li>
            <li> I got this product through a recommendation from my brother. It had worked wonders for him. Now as I have extremely sensitive skin, i had never had bumps on my face until I used a razor, rather than the typical shave I get when I go get a haircut at the barber. This started the bumps problem. However, my brother has always had bumps, barbershop or not and this fixed it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got around to trying it, it worked for a while and then stopped. I guess my skin got used to it and it wasn&#x27;t as effective. It works for a bit but not as much as it should really and I&#x27;m sure the results will vary based on who is using it. My brother and I are both black, and so I again it will vary depending on the person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> I suffer from a rough bear that often get ingrown hairs.  I have tried tons of products to help combat this problem and get rid of the bumps and this stuff honestly helps out big time.  I&#x27;d say it gets rid of about 90% of razor bumps.  You do need to use it at least once a day (twice is better) and it definitely isn&#x27;t inexpensive, but does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It obviously works because when I run out and stop using it, bumps start developing again.</li>
            <li> Great product, plain and simple.  The price should lower more with the quantity ordered.  The cream helps a lot with my bumps and ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> My husband has really really super coarse hair on his face and neck and this really did help the bumps to go away! Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to cream for the summer to prevent razor bumps.... I buy it 6 packages at a time.</li>
            <li> This bump stopper is one of those products you may think wouldn&#x27;t really with, but I can tell you that it does. I get minor to moderate razor burn on my neck and a small dab of this makes the red bumps disappear in a day. My wife started using it on her bikini area and says it works better than anything she has used before. Bottom line...if you get razor burn, this stuff will literally make a night and day difference.</li>
            <li> I heard some advices from some users however it did not work for me. Just a mass in my hair and need to wash whenever I pour...</li>
            <li> i use this with the hihg time bump stopper plus to see if it will also give me some help to my face .</li>
            <li> my husband was so happy to have these, they stopped selling them in the store around here and it was nice to order them in multiples. i wish the prive was alittle lower but still a good deal.</li>
            <li> The product certainly made the razor bumps better, but it didn&#x27;t solve my problem.  I started with 200 or so bumps after a bikini wax/shaving adventure gone wrong.  The look of the bumps improved by about 75% after two weeks, but that still left 50 or so bumps that didn&#x27;t go away even after two weeks of putting on product.  Redness decreased noticeably as well, but not enough that I would feel comfortable going to the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The creme is also messy if you&#x27;re putting in around the bikini area...it stained some of my underwear a light tan color.  That said, the subsequent container I bought had white formula (not tan), and it didn&#x27;t stain, so I guess it depends on the color of the creme.</li>
            <li> Fast and as described.</li>
            <li> I do use it 3 or 4 times a week and it does keep my razor bumps  in check... finally have a clear face again!!!</li>
