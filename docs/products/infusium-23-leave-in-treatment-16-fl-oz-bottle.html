            <li>The children&#x27;s detanglers work much better.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>This is amazing for those with damaged hair, frequent fly aways, or those that want to spray something in, comb through, and leave the house.  </li>
            <li>My kids love the product too.</li>
            <li>It tames my &amp;#34;frizzies&amp;#34; and helps curls to hold better.  </li>
            <li>The best leave in treatment for dry hair!  </li>
            <li>Keeps hair healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also started using it on my daughter&#x27;s fine, straight hair as a de-tangler with great success.</li>
            <li>The best thing is usually when you put on these kinda products they leave your hair greasy/oil</li>
            <li>Perhaps I don&#x27;t have the post-perm &#x27;dosage&#x27; quite right yet....or need to towel-dry.hair first?</li>
            <li>This allows it to dry nicely.  </li>
            <li>I recently tried this product and I love it.  </li>
            <li>it makes my hair feel healthy and strong with no sticky or heavy residue.  </li>
            <li>I then just brush it out and it stays looking healthy and styled without a flat iron.</li>
            <li>but it really is.  </li>
            <li>Used the stuff my whole life...</li>
            <li>I really wish I didn&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li>I love that this is &amp;#34;leave-in&amp;#34; because I use a bit more if I slick back my hair then if I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>The spray manages to remove the snarzles and tangles that normally would take me minutes to brush.  </li>
            <li>A Hairdresser totally fried my virgin hair somehow and Nothing was helping no matter how much I conditioned or put stuff in my hair.</li>
            <li>I put some of this on my hair thinking it probably wouldnt do anything, and it made it SO soft and literally fixed my fried hair within the first-second application of it.</li>
            <li>The curls are soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>When I use this product the frizz is decreased dramatically and my curls are nicely  defined.  </li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this is an essential hair care product after shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>It was frustrating to detangle and I was advised by more than one person to try Infusium.</li>
            <li>When I spray this in wet and then comb my hair straight in the exact part/style I want it, I leave the house and get to work with it looking the exact same only hard and dry.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says - no more, no less.  </li>
            <li>I spray this on my hair after I wash it and let it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li>The result is the same regardless of how I style my hair (blow dry, natural, flat iron, or roller set).  </li>

            <li> A little goes a long way and depending on how much hair you have, a 16 oz bottle could easily last a year.  </li>
            <li> I even tried olive oil and it didnt touch it, just left it oily and dry at the same time.</li>
            <li> A bottle will last you a very long time -- maybe a year.</li>
            <li> I expected the same fragrance and smoothness results that it produced following the home perm it accompanied, but not so much...yet.  </li>
            <li> My hair kinks in weird places and is super fine and thin.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this leave in conditioner for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> I have long curly hair that tends to frizz.  </li>
            <li> I am using this for a long long time.</li>
            <li> Wll continue to use for a very long time.</li>
            <li> but it tends to give body to your hair so if you have dry, wispy hair this helps give it weight.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I could live without it as I have fine curly hair that is painful to try and comb and would turn into dreadlocks given half a chance.</li>
            <li> I have hair that forms a tight spiral pattern when dried naturally.  </li>
            <li> Itj ust makes it soft and silky without the icky feel.</li>
            <li> When I get out of the shower I spray my hair with the leave in conditioner, brushing through my hair is a breeze it only takes  a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> I just add some to my wet hair after the shower and leave it in.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s goes on after any conditioning treatments, and I&#x27;ll seldom need to use any other styling products.  </li>
            <li> I also use Redken, Matrix, Kerestase, and other rinse out conditioners.</li>
            <li> Well, I did and I was more than disappointed.</li>
            <li> The other thing I like about the product is that it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking greasy or shiny after the hair dries.  </li>
            <li> , it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I take it with me to the pool and out to the beach because without it, my hair feels sticky and stiff.  </li>
            <li> I think it must protect my hair too, because in the 5 years or so since I discovered it, I have very few split ends.</li>
            <li> I have thick, hard to manage hair.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Leave-In treatment for at least 30 years.  </li>
            <li> I put it in a spray bottle and add a small amount of &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10!</li>

            <li> I have been using the Leave-In treatment for at least 30 years.  I must be satisfied or I wouldn&#x27;t keep buying it.  It does exactly what it says - no more, no less.  It hydrates my hair, gives it body and I think my hair has been healthier for using this treatment.  After it dries you cannot (nor can anyone else) tell you have anything in your hair.  It is not a styling gel but it tends to give body to your hair so if you have dry, wispy hair this helps give it weight.  A little goes a long way and depending on how much hair you have, a 16 oz bottle could easily last a year.  This is a remarkable hair product in my opinion!  I hope you agree after trying it.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy curly hair.  This is a leave in treatment by John Frieda that I have used for years and works wonders.  Definitely recommend all John Frieda products.</li>
            <li> This stuff is miracle hair juice! A Hairdresser totally fried my virgin hair somehow and Nothing was helping no matter how much I conditioned or put stuff in my hair. I even tried olive oil and it didnt touch it, just left it oily and dry at the same time. I put some of this on my hair thinking it probably wouldnt do anything, and it made it SO soft and literally fixed my fried hair within the first-second application of it. MY hair isnt perfect but this stuff saved it from falling out. It was constantly breaking and sooo frizzy and straw-like from the damage and this stuff saved my hair big time. The best thing is usually when you put on these kinda products they leave your hair greasy/oil but this doesnt. Itj ust makes it soft and silky without the icky feel. I can feel my hair being repaired the second I put it on. Great Product and cheap!</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for awhile and love what how it works.  Just leave it in and your hair will feel softer and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m another woman who&#x27;s used Infusium 23 for close to 30 years.  I ALWAYS use it.  It&#x27;s goes on after any conditioning treatments, and I&#x27;ll seldom need to use any other styling products.  I have hair that forms a tight spiral pattern when dried naturally.  It can also be rather frizzy.  Infusium smooths it.  The curls are soft and shiny.  I also don&#x27;t need to use mousse or anything else that makes my hair \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot;.  It ups the level of softness, and smoothness, I get from any products I use before I put it on.  The result is the same regardless of how I style my hair (blow dry, natural, flat iron, or roller set).  Once there was only one variety of Infusium 23.  Now it comes in several formulas.  I prefer the (moistur)ologie.  I also use Redken, Matrix, Kerestase, and other rinse out conditioners.</li>
            <li> My daughter always had a head of matted hair. It was frustrating to detangle and I was advised by more than one person to try Infusium. Well, I did and I was more than disappointed. The children&#x27;s detanglers work much better. Not only did Infusium not help detangle my daughter&#x27;s hair, it left a sticky residue for me to wash off. I still have nearly an entire bottle left that will go unused.</li>
            <li> I used to use infusium all the time, but shaved my head a decade ago &amp; just recently started growing my hair out again. I love that this is &amp;#34;leave-in&amp;#34; because I use a bit more if I slick back my hair then if I don&#x27;t. Always loved infusium</li>
            <li> My stylist gave me another product that didn&#x27;t work as well.  I went back to Infusium 23.  But the stores listed as carriers on website didn&#x27;t have the specific product I wanted.  The on-line price was quite acceptable however.</li>
            <li> I have been using this leave in conditioner for as long as I can remember.  My mom used to spray it on her hair when we would go to the beach or the pool.  So I decided to see what was so good About it and I loved the results.  I spray this on my hair after I wash it and let it dry naturally.  I have long curly hair that tends to frizz.  When I use this product the frizz is decreased dramatically and my curls are nicely  defined.  Wll continue to use for a very long time.</li>
            <li> This is a leave in conditioner that works great!  It is not a styling gel so to compare it to that just doesn&#x27;t work, you would be unsatisfied because you don&#x27;t get the same results.  I have thick, hard to manage hair.  When I get out of the shower I spray my hair with the leave in conditioner, brushing through my hair is a breeze it only takes  a few seconds.  The spray manages to remove the snarzles and tangles that normally would take me minutes to brush.  The other thing I like about the product is that it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking greasy or shiny after the hair dries.  Awesome product!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t do without my Infusium 23 leave-in treatment.  Have been using it for years.  I put it in a spray bottle and add a small amount of &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10! with Keratin&amp;#34;.  Just 3 or 4 spritzes on my medium length hair and the tangles just melt away.  I take it with me to the pool and out to the beach because without it, my hair feels sticky and stiff.  This allows it to dry nicely.  I think it must protect my hair too, because in the 5 years or so since I discovered it, I have very few split ends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been using Infusium 23 for 30+ years. I don&#x27;t think I could live without it as I have fine curly hair that is painful to try and comb and would turn into dreadlocks given half a chance. I&#x27;ve also started using it on my daughter&#x27;s fine, straight hair as a de-tangler with great success. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this is an essential hair care product after shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I just add some to my wet hair after the shower and leave it in.  it makes my hair feel healthy and strong with no sticky or heavy residue.  This is not a styling gel.  I love that you cant feel it in your hair -- my hair feels clean !!!  highly recommended.  A bottle will last you a very long time -- maybe a year.</li>
            <li> This is amazing for those with damaged hair, frequent fly aways, or those that want to spray something in, comb through, and leave the house.  I never thought this would be a styling product as well but it really is.  My hair kinks in weird places and is super fine and thin.  When I spray this in wet and then comb my hair straight in the exact part/style I want it, I leave the house and get to work with it looking the exact same only hard and dry.  I then just brush it out and it stays looking healthy and styled without a flat iron.</li>
            <li> The best leave in treatment for dry hair!  Used it for years.  Definitely recommend.</li>

            <li> Used the stuff my whole life...it works...arrived on time.</li>
            <li> This product made no difference. My hair is still gross and frizzy. I really wish I didn&#x27;t buy it, it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I recently tried this product and I love it.  It tames my &amp;#34;frizzies&amp;#34; and helps curls to hold better.  A great value and smells fantastic!</li>
