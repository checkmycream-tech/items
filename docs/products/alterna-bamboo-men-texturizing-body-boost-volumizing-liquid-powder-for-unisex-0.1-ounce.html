            <li>Best hair product available for people with fine hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing amazing amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing hair product.</li>
            <li>Best to purchase on line, they charge far more in salons (mark up!)</li>
            <li>and I loved what it did to my hair and how easy it was to use.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff, it is magic if you have fine/thin hair!  </li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I thought this would be an ok product to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this product.</li>
            <li>It provides lots of volume at the roots better than some of their spray products.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff...</li>
            <li>Overall, this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>Some people like to be able to run their hands through their hair with ease, this is not for those people.</li>
            <li>It may be because my hair is longer, but what it tells you to do is to &amp;#34;activate&amp;#34; by shaking the bottle then pouring some in your hand, rubbing the powder then rubbing it into our hair, I would rub the powder towards the top of my head and in the roots.</li>
            <li>but with more $&amp;@% in your hair.</li>
            <li>Maybe this product would work better for those with thinner/shorter hair.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more if available when I run out of the supply I have.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super for adding non-gloppy texture to your hair, and if you&#x27;re like me and have very fine hair, &amp; at the end of any given summer day look like you&#x27;ve doused your head in grease, this product will stop that from happening.  </li>
            <li>I have super fine hair</li>
            <li>But it still is worth the volume!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I should have bought it right away from her, but luckily I was able to find it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Since everything you read on the Internet is supposed to be true, I immediately rushed to amazon to purchase this body boosting miracle.</li>
            <li>love love this product and would not be without, specially having a short bob-hair cut.</li>
            <li>works excellent for fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very straight, fine hair and this product</li>
            <li>Creates a great beachy look the next day perfect for casual days.</li>
            <li>It really adds volume and is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>The Indie product worked well to give my hair a nice tousled appearance</li>
            <li>Gives roots a great boost without feeling stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it to give my top a &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34;, since I need volume, but it MUST be use sparingly, otherwise it&#x27;ll become really sticky and umanageable.  </li>
            <li>It produces a very clean natural look and really gives the hair definition without looking gelled up at all.</li>
            <li>It is a texturizing powder, works great with my fine, thin, straight hair.</li>
            <li>I just ordered my second--my first lasted almost 9 months.</li>
            <li>Let me just start by saying I love big hair.</li>
            <li>Takes very little product, so lasts a LONG time, and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a men&#x27;s product, but certainly men could use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a couple times and you don&#x27;t need to use much.  </li>
            <li>applying it may be a slight issue as it is a very fine powder</li>
            <li>I get better results flipping my head upside down and assaulting it with a bottle of hairspray.</li>
            <li>But the main thing is that it make your hair tacky and sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>My advice - go very LIGHTLY with this product, a little bit goes a LONG way, especially if you have very fine hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;You have to shake it before using it and apply (gently dust) directly onto the area where the volume is desired.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it works right after you apply it, but if you look in the mirror a couple minutes later, you&#x27;re pretty much back to where you started,</li>
            <li>It does have a definite texture to it, and if you use too much it will make your hair a little sticky feeling, but still better than hairspray.</li>
            <li>But when I sprinkle this on my roots and work it in my hair, I get big sexy lift all day, even the next day until my next wash.</li>
            <li>I first tried it at my local salon when asked if I wanted any product on my haircut.</li>
            <li>You need a huge container in order to use as the directions eXplained waste of money and makes you&#x27;re</li>
            <li>I have thin hair and this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>If I brush my hair at night before going to bed, my style is usually somewhat still in place and only needs refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and struggle to find products that don&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it oily and limp.</li>
            <li>powder really isn&#x27;t like anything I&#x27;ve tried before, it offers a fairly unique set of characteristics that dampen some of the negatives of other hair products (stiff/conjoined hair, excessive shine etc).</li>
            <li>I apply to my upper root areas and tease with fingertips for a cool, messy, tousled look.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff for my thin hair.</li>
            <li>Probably better suited for thin hair.</li>

            <li> The powder dissolves in your hands so quick, it was hard how much to use, but the instructions say just use a small amount..  </li>
            <li> must for anyone, men and women, who wants to use very little products, but desires a finished and styled look for their short hair.</li>
            <li> or you&#x27;ll be left with a white residue on your hair all day long. . .</li>
            <li> Sprinkle just a little directly on you hair, then massage it in, spreading it throughout your hair.  </li>
            <li> I hope it remains &#x27;the real thing&#x27; in the container, it really sucks getting screwed.</li>
            <li> this gives me a lot of volume without having greasy residue after a long day.</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact, you can barely see it when it&#x27;s on the hair, but the form lasts for a few days and you can reshape it at any moment and it&#x27;ll still have the same spring to it.</li>
            <li> My hair is short but thick and a little coarse and straight.</li>
            <li> Also, start with completely dry hair.  </li>
            <li> The main negative for this product is that it makes your hair feel very rough, almost gritty, due to the particles latching to your hair follicles.</li>
            <li> Still, it feels minimal on your head and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair</li>
            <li> Or you can sprinkle a very small amount directly onto your scalp, at the root of your hair, then massage it in.  </li>
            <li> Keep in mind that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Unlike any other hair product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not great on thick, coarse straight hair.</li>
            <li> And it only takes a VERY small portion to accomplish the task.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to wash out (not complaining - the Indie powder was also hard to wash out - just mentioning for anybody that&#x27;s thinking about trying this type of product).</li>
            <li> hair look dull and lack of shine</li>
            <li> You use hardly anything each time, but it gives your hair volume and it is easier to style.  </li>
            <li> One bottle lasts 6 months, for me, at least.</li>
            <li> I know this is an expensive product, but I don&#x27;t use it all the time, only when my hair separates and looks thin in the crown.</li>
            <li> My friend who recommended the product has thick, wavy hair and this product works for her.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also expensive but a little goes</li>

            <li> what, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> (difficult for my hair - it&#x27;s basically a helmet if I don&#x27;t work at it).</li>
            <li> I used to use Isis texturizing powder, but kept getting &#x27;fake&#x27; stuff online, so I tried this stuff.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love with product, but it must be used sparingly!  Sprinkle just a little directly on you hair, then massage it in, spreading it throughout your hair.  I mainly use it to give my top a &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34;, since I need volume, but it MUST be use sparingly, otherwise it&#x27;ll become really sticky and umanageable.  Comb it in, if you must.  Lasts all day and even into the next day.  Or you can sprinkle a very small amount directly onto your scalp, at the root of your hair, then massage it in.  One bottle lasts 6 months, for me, at least.</li>
            <li> This stuff works!  (I am a woman.)  I have very straight, fine hair and this product do give my hair more body and fullness. My friend who recommended the product has thick, wavy hair and this product works for her.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible. I hate root lifts because my hair always goes flat immediately after. But when I sprinkle this on my roots and work it in my hair, I get big sexy lift all day, even the next day until my next wash. I&#x27;ve never used anything like this. It&#x27;s amazing amazing amazing. Love it.</li>
            <li> You need a huge container in order to use as the directions eXplained waste of money and makes you&#x27;re hair look dull and lack of shine</li>
            <li> I have chemical sensitivity and I thought this would be an ok product to use. While it didn&#x27;t make me sick, it did have a funky smell to it (at least for me). But the main thing is that it make your hair tacky and sticky feeling. I tried dispersing a very tiny amount and distributing evenly but I just couldn&#x27;t get it to work no matter what, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Amazing hair product. Always guarantees a good hair day. I apply to my upper root areas and tease with fingertips for a cool, messy, tousled look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product. Unlike any other hair product I&#x27;ve tried. Gives roots a great boost without feeling stiff or sticky. Creates a great beachy look the next day perfect for casual days. Keep in mind that a little goes a long way. Will definitely be ordering again and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> This item does a great job of providing boost and volume and it lasts all day.  If I brush my hair at night before going to bed, my style is usually somewhat still in place and only needs refreshing.  This is a good product that does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a couple times and you don&#x27;t need to use much.  It provides lots of volume at the roots better than some of their spray products.  No issue the next day in styling.</li>
            <li> This products helps my thinning hair look fuller. I just ordered my second--my first lasted almost 9 months.</li>
            <li> I know this is an expensive product, but I don&#x27;t use it all the time, only when my hair separates and looks thin in the crown. But it works like magic! You cannot see it, but it makes the roots of your hair stiffer so that your hair seems thicker than it is. And it only takes a VERY small portion to accomplish the task. I will be buying more if available when I run out of the supply I have.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and struggle to find products that don&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it oily and limp. This liquid powder is THE BOMB. Takes very little product, so lasts a LONG time, and it works perfectly. I love this stuff...</li>
            <li> I have super fine hair this gives me a lot of volume without having greasy residue after a long day. Need to refluff your hair just rub at the scalp boom! Instant volume!! It&#x27;s a must try!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes it would be like the volumizing spray from Alterna. The powder dissolves in your hands so quick, it was hard how much to use, but the instructions say just use a small amount..  My hair actually felt sticky after I used it.  It does add voume, but I just prefer the spray type volumizers.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, it is magic if you have fine/thin hair!  Best to purchase on line, they charge far more in salons (mark up!)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for my thin hair. It really adds volume and is so easy to use. Best hair product available for people with fine hair.</li>
            <li> one of the best products EVER.  my sister-in-law told me about it.  I have thin hair and this stuff is amazing.  You use hardly anything each time, but it gives your hair volume and it is easier to style.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> My advice - go very LIGHTLY with this product, a little bit goes a LONG way, especially if you have very fine hair like I have.  Also, start with completely dry hair.  It&#x27;s super for adding non-gloppy texture to your hair, and if you&#x27;re like me and have very fine hair, &amp; at the end of any given summer day look like you&#x27;ve doused your head in grease, this product will stop that from happening.  Stays put until you wash it out, helps keep some lift and shape to your hair but doesn&#x27;t smell gross or stick your hairs together like hairspray or mousse tends to.  It does have a definite texture to it, and if you use too much it will make your hair a little sticky feeling, but still better than hairspray.</li>
            <li> My stylist used this product on my short hair the last time I was in and I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;I should have bought it right away from her, but luckily I was able to find it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I must for anyone, men and women, who wants to use very little products, but desires a finished and styled look for their short hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is short but thick and a little coarse and straight. My hair stylist used a similar product from Indie but I neglected to buy it at the time of my haircut. The Indie product worked well to give my hair a nice tousled appearance (difficult for my hair - it&#x27;s basically a helmet if I don&#x27;t work at it). I thought this would function in the same way. It sorted of worked but I had to keep fiddling with my hair to keep it from going back to being a helmet. It is difficult to wash out (not complaining - the Indie powder was also hard to wash out - just mentioning for anybody that&#x27;s thinking about trying this type of product). It&#x27;s also expensive but a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep trying to work with this stuff but it&#x27;s not great on thick, coarse straight hair. Probably better suited for thin hair.</li>
            <li> Works on baby fine hair! Great&lt;br /&gt;Actual texture!! Product I will continue to buy and use. Easy to find! Amazon!</li>
            <li> The wrong picture is with this review request! It is a texturizing powder, works great with my fine, thin, straight hair. It&#x27;s not a men&#x27;s product, but certainly men could use it. I used to use Isis texturizing powder, but kept getting &#x27;fake&#x27; stuff online, so I tried this stuff. I hope it remains &#x27;the real thing&#x27; in the container, it really sucks getting screwed.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is an excellent product. I first tried it at my local salon when asked if I wanted any product on my haircut. It produces a very clean natural look and really gives the hair definition without looking gelled up at all. In fact, you can barely see it when it&#x27;s on the hair, but the form lasts for a few days and you can reshape it at any moment and it&#x27;ll still have the same spring to it. It holds solid without looking solid at all. The main negative for this product is that it makes your hair feel very rough, almost gritty, due to the particles latching to your hair follicles. Some people like to be able to run their hands through their hair with ease, this is not for those people. Still, it feels minimal on your head and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.&lt;br /&gt;This powder really isn&#x27;t like anything I&#x27;ve tried before, it offers a fairly unique set of characteristics that dampen some of the negatives of other hair products (stiff/conjoined hair, excessive shine etc).</li>
            <li> Let me just start by saying I love big hair. Like BIG. I came across this product from a blog that raved about it. Since everything you read on the Internet is supposed to be true, I immediately rushed to amazon to purchase this body boosting miracle. It may be because my hair is longer, but what it tells you to do is to &amp;#34;activate&amp;#34; by shaking the bottle then pouring some in your hand, rubbing the powder then rubbing it into our hair, I would rub the powder towards the top of my head and in the roots. Yes, it works right after you apply it, but if you look in the mirror a couple minutes later, you&#x27;re pretty much back to where you started, but with more $&amp;@% in your hair. Maybe this product would work better for those with thinner/shorter hair. I don&#x27;t know because I don&#x27;t have either. I get better results flipping my head upside down and assaulting it with a bottle of hairspray.</li>
            <li> Love the product! Wonderful when you want to achieve volume but you don&#x27;t have a lot of hair. You do have to wash your hair the same night or the next morning or you&#x27;ll be left with a white residue on your hair all day long. . . But it still is worth the volume!</li>
            <li> My stylist used it in her salon and I loved what it did to my hair and how easy it was to use.  I found it in Ulta store, but it was way more expensive then Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;You have to shake it before using it and apply (gently dust) directly onto the area where the volume is desired.  You will know when you used too much.&lt;br /&gt;I love love this product and would not be without, specially having a short bob-hair cut.</li>
            <li> works excellent for fine thin hair.  applying it may be a slight issue as it is a very fine powder but once you get it on it works wonders.</li>
