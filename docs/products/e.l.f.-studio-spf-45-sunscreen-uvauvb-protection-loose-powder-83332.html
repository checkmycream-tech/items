    <ol>
            <li>It is the perfect sunscreen!</li>
            <li>Has also sunscreen which is superb.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect solution.</li>
            <li>And the price is excellent!</li>
            <li>however it is one of the best cosmetic, if not the best cosmetic purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li>Great value!</li>
            <li>This is the best powder coverage with sunscreen!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Genius product at an awesome price.</li>
            <li>Superb product!!  </li>
            <li>and it is the best of any I have tried.</li>
            <li>This product is a perfect setting powder to add protection over my makeup or my lotion sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a solution to sunscreen lotions always burning my eyes, and it solved that problem perfectly.  </li>
            <li>It is an excellent powder!</li>
            <li>so im very happy with this powder</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product for the price!  </li>
            <li>her best w/out breaking her bank account</li>
            <li>I apply it with the puff it comes with, even on brow bones and eyelids and it is a perfect invisible application.  </li>
            <li>which arrived in perfect condition.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a bright orange,YUCK!!</li>
            <li>A VERY GOOD PRODUCT  WILL BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li>Great product but the description says translucent, but the product says sheer...other than that it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li>If you are fair, you wear sunblock OVER sunblock!</li>
            <li>The feel of the product is great; however, I have very fair skin, and</li>
            <li>For my medium skin, it blends in beautifully.  </li>
            <li>It was great.  </li>
            <li>just pat it on the face and arms and works great.  </li>
            <li>Great alternative to lotion.</li>
            <li>This powder is a great value.</li>
            <li>this worked great.</li>
            <li>Works great for sun protection.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s a good thing.  </li>
            <li>I have light olive skin and it blends wonderfully.</li>
            <li>This powder SPF is light and translucent, and perfect over makeup.</li>
            <li>what is this powder good for, then?&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li>Great coverage and easy application!</li>
            <li>I liked that this was a powder sunscreen and thought it would be good to just to reapply on top of makeup each day, what I didn&#x27;t expect was the best setting powder ever, even better than my MAC.</li>
            <li>BLENDS NICE AND GOOD PROTECTION</li>
            <li>I am fair and this works nicely for me.</li>
            <li>very effective and safe to leave in the car.  </li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and this sheer formula works great!  </li>
            <li>Sunscreen powder, love it!</li>
            <li>The price is outstanding for the value!</li>
            <li>-this one also helps us stay healthy!</li>
            <li>This worked amazing.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if it was a translucent powder</li>
            <li>The powder itself does kind of melt</li>
            <li>a bit so maybe not the best choice for very oily face or humid areas.</li>
            <li>To make it easier for me to reapply, I use this in conjunction with additional powdered zinc, bronzer, and setting powder to make my own &amp;#34;correctly colored&amp;#34; sunscreen powder.  </li>
            <li>Nice lightweight finish that removes shine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is the easiest product to use, just brush it on, I use my own brush and put in on over my make-up</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice to be protected by the UVA/UVB</li>
            <li>In Hawaii&#x27;s humid climate, it does a nice job keeping my skin nice and matte.  </li>
            <li>It works well with any foundation or on its own.</li>
            <li>love love love it!!  </li>
            <li>However, since I always do a full face make-up (you’re welcome, world)</li>
            <li>I was on very strong medication that required me to wear sunscreen.</li>
            <li>the more SPF the better!  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin and this powder looks fine on me.</li>
            <li>I have very fair, very sensitive skin and am allergic to about 90% of all cosmetics - they cause inflammation and redness for me --  </li>
            <li>The container is large so it is not as portable but great price and product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light weight feel that I forget that I&#x27;ve put it on as soon as Im done applying it.</li>
            <li>I *love*</li>
            <li>I love that it has the spf built in already</li>
            <li>and I use it on top of my cc cream as added insurance that I am protecting my skin.  </li>
            <li>(yes, even with the preventative sunscreen use) and this can look chalky on me for most of the year if I don’t mix it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product....</li>
            <li>- so I give it 5 stars on the assumption that it has the added benefit of sunscreen, but even without it, I love this powder.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always worn foundation, but now I just wear tinted moisturizer and this powder, and I love the look.</li>
            <li>I use my lotion sunscreen all over and apply this as blush on the areas most prone to sunburn.</li>
            <li>Nice packaging and smooth as silk.</li>
            <li>/&gt;E.L.F. has become a favorite brand of mine.</li>
            <li>So glad to find sunscreen that is in powder form instead of goopy liquids or gels, which I despise.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this powder.</li>
            <li>If you are purchasing it and are of the fairer side, I would recommend it for sure.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line is, I love it.</li>
            <li>If you are putting it all over your face, make sure you blend the neck.  </li>
            <li>it being more tinted than advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After reading reviews I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Cheap, effective and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>(calamine!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a pretty good value, and there&#x27;s a lot there.</li>
            <li>Color is good year round for my warm skin (fair in winter, tanned in summers) and so cheap!</li>
            <li>A nude hue to it offers great coverage for lighter complexions.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I bought this just to fulfill an order for free shipping</li>
            <li>I love e.l.f. products, and was extremely excited to discover this powder SPF on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Another plus - The powder does not look cakes nor does it settle in my pores and it&#x27;s extremely easy for me to re-apply it throughout the day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to apply, it doesn&#x27;t look cakey</li>
            <li>/&gt;so easy.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m hardcore about sunscreen; particularly now after all these years in the sun, I have freckles and brown spots all over my once gorgeous</li>
            <li>Light and easy.</li>
            <li>if you have fine hairs anywhere on your face, they will pick up the powder, too.</li>
            <li>It also works just fine for my medium color skin.</li>
            <li>Titanium and Zinc are the most effective natural SPF you can put on your face.</li>
            <li>Since this contains zinc as one of the ingredients, it’s too light by itself for my skin-tone.  </li>
            <li>Still a great product outside of color issues.</li>
            <li>As a light weight finishing powder, for people</li>
            <li>I can barely afford the doctor myself, so it is so nice to have an affordable powder sunblock to combat it!</li>
            <li>than i expected, which is normally good, but this one is kind of bulky for my travel bag.  </li>
            <li>Very nice powder, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>This is a great handy little product to have around!</li>
            <li>and I am pretty fair skinned, but it goes on very translucent.</li>
            <li>Natural finish, great product and the prince is just amazing, i Will definitely buy again.  </li>
            <li>But heck - for $6 it&#x27;s worth a try if you&#x27;re on the fence!</li>
            <li>in mind that you shouldn&#x27;t be applying this powder looking for significant coverage.</li>
            <li>It has a higher SPF than most powder products and since my sunscreens and make up have a chemical sunscreen (octinoxate) in them, this powder gives me the additional benefit of a barrier sunscreen (titanium dioxide).  </li>
            <li>For my daughter&#x27;s more porcelain complexion, it can ONLY be used more like a blush/bronzer, but she is doesn&#x27;t want more coverage than that, anyway.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is a high level of SPF in a powder form and can be reapplied easily.</li>
            <li>Colorless powdered zinc is much smoother, softer and would be a better color for fair to light or possibly medium skin.</li>
            <li>I wish I had bought it right away!  </li>
            <li>Most popular sunscreen powders cost more than 10 times the price of this little gem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works great as a SPF supplement and probably for light intermittent sun exposure, but usually sunscreens need a certain amount to be effective.  </li>
            <li>It really comes in elegant box that reminds me of something that Marilyn Monroe or Jackie Kennedy would have on their dressing table to powder their nose.</li>
            <li>its a definite buy im fair skinned</li>
            <li>/&gt;Something folks should probably consider is that this product probably shouldn&#x27;t be used alone for protection in full sun exposure.  </li>
            <li>I love elf products and wanted to really like this sunscreen as an item I could use after makeup application thru-</li>
            <li>Great for active kids too.</li>
            <li>On the plus side though, it is super</li>
            <li>I use it in place of foundation, over moisturizer, for days when I will be outside more, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>It is rare for me to spend a day at beach and not come home with the bright red nose, no matter how often I reapply sunscreen.</li>
            <li>If I need to put on sunscreen quickly or reapply it makes it&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would prefer if this product was translucent as I am very fair and do not love the hue of this product.  </li>
            <li>PRETTY DARN CHEAP</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky this is the right color for</li>
            <li>Additionally, the color was very warm and turned orange on my slightly oily skin within an hour.</li>
            <li>and it worked out great not too heavy</li>
            <li>Most of the sun damage we experience is not just from the beach but from daily sun and light exposure.</li>
            <li>Unlike many mineral MUs, this is completely matte--not a bit of shimmer or luminosity.</li>
            <li>but so far I&#x27;ve only used the provided application pad and it works great.</li>
            <li>so it works worth any skin color.</li>
            <li>just using this one product is such a nice change....</li>
            <li>It surprisingly didn&#x27;t make either of us look pink.</li>
            <li>A pretty AMAZING product for only $6!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much coverage, if you want something full coverage this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Good: in a sifter instead of a bristle-shedding brush tube like so many powder sunscreens, cheap (cheap enough that I see it&#x27;s been added to add-ons in the week since I bought it), and easy to see if you&#x27;ve applied it, due to</li>
            <li>It felt all right (not suffocating).</li>
            <li>I use this as a setting powder, the puff is so soft and the powder goes on so easily and stays in place all day.</li>
            <li>If it matches your skin tone, I imagine this would be a great product, especially for the wonderfully low price.</li>
            <li>The applicator is soft and makes the product easy to apply.</li>
            <li>this is a great product,very affordable hard to find,powder with sunscreen</li>
            <li>Nearly Naked, finally top off with this power with Elf kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>so I haven’t experienced any separation or oxidation color changes, at least until after about 12 hours of wear.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be exactly what was described.</li>
            <li>,it sheer so most people can wear it.will order again for sure.good seller.thank you.</li>
            <li>It is a bright enough red that I have to use it as a blush.</li>
            <li>#2 Check yourself in direct sun and fluorescent lighting, to make sure the tint looks natural.  </li>
            <li>This is a fine powder with a little bit of color but not enough to color your face or use as a foundation unless you are quite fair.</li>
            <li>Which is nice because I go through an average of 5 blotting papers a day to cut the shine in my t-zone as it is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought e.l.f. products in the past and they are good for the price that you pay.  </li>
            <li>For people that are on medication that makes their skin super sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li>I certainly wouldn&#x27;t call it translucent.</li>
            <li>I am so grateful to e.l.f. products-they are decent well made products, yet very affordable!</li>
            <li>This works really well and for the price</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>i think been use very diapointed.maybe buy from some one else .to</li>
            <li>I really like this powder.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t mind so much (it does help control oil/shininess)</li>
            <li>I really needed a powder sunscreen to apply over makeup.</li>
            <li>This suncreen is very matte and the highlighter adds a bit of dimension.</li>
            <li>I use this on the whole family.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have an issue with tanning</li>
            <li>Product was much too orange for me-</li>
            <li>SPF powder shouldn&#x27;t cost much.  </li>
            <li>but I really like it.  </li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>However, I can see this color obviously not working for everyone&#x27;s skin toned - so those of you with warm undertones or darker skin might want to try a different powder.</li>
            <li>Great product in theory, but the powder&#x27;s tint was quite dark, almost like a loose powder foundation.</li>
            <li>only criticism is the packaging is a pain--it&#x27;s pretty messy and you end up wasting a fair amount of powder.  </li>
            <li>It is quality makeup at down right cheap prices.</li>
            <li>I used to use BareMinerals mineral SPF that came in a brush (and was much more expensive), and while the brush was a nice feature, I prefer this product to that one by far.</li>
            <li>All in all, not worth deducting a star, but I will probably transfer the product into a better container.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t break out my sensitive skin, which I assume is because ZnO is actually pretty helpful</li>
            <li>I wish it came in multiple colors for easier matching, but it doesn&#x27;t, and it&#x27;s difficult to tell if it will be a match from the pictures, so I recommend that if you want this product, it might be best to buy it in a store.</li>
            <li>This is no different--it&#x27;s a decent powder and a decent quantity.  </li>
            <li>I am a brown skin african american and at first this seem too light for my</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product to anyone spending time in the sun.</li>
            <li>It does not break out my sensitive skin, and it lasts much longer than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this instead of my normal cream sunscreen topped with my mineral foundation.....</li>
            <li>I wear sunscreen 50 normally and reapply every hour, but still get color of freckly...</li>
            <li>I add a little highlighter to make it look more natural.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels heavier than just a setting or foundation powder would, but I can live with that for the protection.  </li>
            <li>thou said new on it</li>
            <li>explained it was my new powder ,</li>
            <li>All I know is I live in TX.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be great with all of the sun protection, but this powder has aged my face by a least 10 yrs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really love this product and recommend it highly to anyone with sensitive, red, thin, easily burnt skin.</li>
            <li>Neither of us have any issues with irritation and we both have Very sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very natural looking and</li>
            <li>/&gt;To reiterate, my box looks exactly as pictured and has the same labeling, but the color of the powder does not match the illustration on the box.</li>
            <li>Leaves no color, but just enough coverage for our hot summers in California.</li>
            <li>However my skin was so sensitive I could not wear normal sunscreen.</li>
            <li>While I’m pretty pale, especially during the MN winters, I tan easily</li>
            <li>It can get cluggy easily, and then has to be washed, dried, etc.  </li>
            <li>the powder might go on better with a brush, but with the spongy felt type applicator it is a very very pale color.  </li>
            <li>that way you won&#x27;t make a huge mess.</li>
            <li>hi try look nice on put the one i got was half empty .even</li>
            <li>I spent two weeks in the strong southern sun and my scalp didn&#x27;t get burned at all.</li>
            <li>I WAS SURPRISED AT THE COST</li>
            <li>I have a 1yr old boy with no hair</li>
            <li>So far, I have found that it does not cake.</li>
            <li>It never bothered my sensitive skin or ruined my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It absolutely protects my skin from getting burned, which in Southern California happens in about 5 minutes without sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s far from it.</li>
            <li>I did reapply frequently as I would with any sun</li>
            <li>and I am pleasantly surprised by how invisible it is.  </li>
            <li>The powder has a peachy kind of tint which looks terrible on my fair skin.</li>
            <li>(I believe it&#x27;s only sold on their website, besides being available here and from some other resellers.)</li>
            <li>Wish the container was a bit smaller not very travel friendly.</li>
            <li>I have used far more expensive products, but this one works absolutely as well w/out the cost!</li>
            <li>because I don&#x27;t believe that this powder alone can give enough sun protection as a main sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li>Overall, a decent face powder.</li>
            <li>But if you apply it lightly, with a big fluffy brush, it should still be wearable.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super messy</li>
            <li>This is great for people that are normally unable to wear sunscreens because they are sensitive to the ingredients in conventional sunscreen bases.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li>But I use it everyday, and reapply multiple times per day, so I&#x27;m going through it pretty fast.</li>
            <li>It has higher SPF protection than most mineral powders and it rivals the very expensive powders that I normally use.</li>
            <li>I got it in the mail and screwed off the top of the lid which is very hard to do.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine it looking good on any skintone unless you apply very little, which would make it pretty much useless as a sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I would prefer to tap some out and use a brush like Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>I hate liquid sunscreen on my face, so I use as many products with SPF on it as possible, but sometimes you need more protection.</li>
            <li>This powder is not fine enough, so &amp;#34;sheer&amp;#34; is a stretch - especially if you use enough for the 45 SPF rating to be accurate.</li>
            <li>I really prefer this powder to any other sunscreen.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have stated, this powder is very tinted.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mind paying a little more than the MSRP since other options are either difficult to find or much more</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found another loose powder with such a high SPF.</li>
            <li>First, this works well as an everyday sunscreen.</li>
            <li>As I live an extremely active lifestyle in Hawaii, I am a MAJOR sunscreen junkie...</li>
            <li>The only negative this early is how little is contained in the tub (a bit more than 1 TBS), but it&#x27;s only $6, so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>So even though this powder is way too dark for me, it doesn&#x27;t look particularly unnatural.</li>
            <li>SO PLEASED!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using mineral makeup, the top original companies for 15+ years and it completely healed my adult acne and  is the cure for everything I hated about other foundation&#x27;s...</li>

            <li> And the price is excellent!</li>
            <li> however it is one of the best cosmetic, if not the best cosmetic purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> Great value!</li>
            <li> This is the best powder coverage with sunscreen!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Genius product at an awesome price.</li>
            <li> Superb product!!  </li>
            <li> and it is the best of any I have tried.</li>
            <li> This product is a perfect setting powder to add protection over my makeup or my lotion sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a solution to sunscreen lotions always burning my eyes, and it solved that problem perfectly.  </li>
            <li> It is an excellent powder!</li>
            <li> so im very happy with this powder</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for the price!  </li>
            <li> her best w/out breaking her bank account</li>
            <li> I apply it with the puff it comes with, even on brow bones and eyelids and it is a perfect invisible application.  </li>
            <li> which arrived in perfect condition.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a bright orange,YUCK!!</li>
            <li> A VERY GOOD PRODUCT  WILL BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> Great product but the description says translucent, but the product says sheer...other than that it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> If you are fair, you wear sunblock OVER sunblock!</li>
            <li> The feel of the product is great; however, I have very fair skin, and</li>
            <li> For my medium skin, it blends in beautifully.  </li>
            <li> It was great.  </li>
            <li> just pat it on the face and arms and works great.  </li>
            <li> Great alternative to lotion.</li>
            <li> This powder is a great value.</li>
            <li> this worked great.</li>
            <li> Works great for sun protection.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s a good thing.  </li>
            <li> I have light olive skin and it blends wonderfully.</li>
            <li> This powder SPF is light and translucent, and perfect over makeup.</li>
            <li> what is this powder good for, then?&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li> Great coverage and easy application!</li>
            <li> I liked that this was a powder sunscreen and thought it would be good to just to reapply on top of makeup each day, what I didn&#x27;t expect was the best setting powder ever, even better than my MAC.</li>
            <li> BLENDS NICE AND GOOD PROTECTION</li>
            <li> I am fair and this works nicely for me.</li>
            <li> very effective and safe to leave in the car.  </li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and this sheer formula works great!  </li>
            <li> Sunscreen powder, love it!</li>
            <li> The price is outstanding for the value!</li>
            <li> -this one also helps us stay healthy!</li>
            <li> This worked amazing.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice if it was a translucent powder</li>
            <li> The powder itself does kind of melt</li>
            <li> a bit so maybe not the best choice for very oily face or humid areas.</li>
            <li> To make it easier for me to reapply, I use this in conjunction with additional powdered zinc, bronzer, and setting powder to make my own &amp;#34;correctly colored&amp;#34; sunscreen powder.  </li>
            <li> Nice lightweight finish that removes shine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is the easiest product to use, just brush it on, I use my own brush and put in on over my make-up</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice to be protected by the UVA/UVB</li>
            <li> In Hawaii&#x27;s humid climate, it does a nice job keeping my skin nice and matte.  </li>
            <li> It works well with any foundation or on its own.</li>
            <li> love love love it!!  </li>
            <li> However, since I always do a full face make-up (you’re welcome, world)</li>
            <li> I was on very strong medication that required me to wear sunscreen.</li>
            <li> the more SPF the better!  </li>
            <li> I have fair skin and this powder looks fine on me.</li>
            <li> I have very fair, very sensitive skin and am allergic to about 90% of all cosmetics - they cause inflammation and redness for me --  </li>
            <li> The container is large so it is not as portable but great price and product.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It has a nice light weight feel that I forget that I&#x27;ve put it on as soon as Im done applying it.</li>
            <li> I *love*</li>
            <li> I love that it has the spf built in already</li>
            <li> and I use it on top of my cc cream as added insurance that I am protecting my skin.  </li>
            <li> (yes, even with the preventative sunscreen use) and this can look chalky on me for most of the year if I don’t mix it.  </li>
            <li> I love this product....</li>
            <li> - so I give it 5 stars on the assumption that it has the added benefit of sunscreen, but even without it, I love this powder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always worn foundation, but now I just wear tinted moisturizer and this powder, and I love the look.</li>
            <li> I use my lotion sunscreen all over and apply this as blush on the areas most prone to sunburn.</li>
            <li> Nice packaging and smooth as silk.</li>
            <li> /&gt;E.L.F. has become a favorite brand of mine.</li>
            <li> So glad to find sunscreen that is in powder form instead of goopy liquids or gels, which I despise.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this powder.</li>
            <li> If you are purchasing it and are of the fairer side, I would recommend it for sure.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line is, I love it.</li>
            <li> If you are putting it all over your face, make sure you blend the neck.  </li>
            <li> it being more tinted than advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Cheap, effective and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> (calamine!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a pretty good value, and there&#x27;s a lot there.</li>
            <li> Color is good year round for my warm skin (fair in winter, tanned in summers) and so cheap!</li>
            <li> A nude hue to it offers great coverage for lighter complexions.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I bought this just to fulfill an order for free shipping</li>
            <li> I love e.l.f. products, and was extremely excited to discover this powder SPF on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Another plus - The powder does not look cakes nor does it settle in my pores and it&#x27;s extremely easy for me to re-apply it throughout the day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to apply, it doesn&#x27;t look cakey</li>
            <li> /&gt;so easy.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hardcore about sunscreen; particularly now after all these years in the sun, I have freckles and brown spots all over my once gorgeous</li>
            <li> Light and easy.</li>
            <li> if you have fine hairs anywhere on your face, they will pick up the powder, too.</li>
            <li> It also works just fine for my medium color skin.</li>
            <li> Titanium and Zinc are the most effective natural SPF you can put on your face.</li>
            <li> Since this contains zinc as one of the ingredients, it’s too light by itself for my skin-tone.  </li>
            <li> Still a great product outside of color issues.</li>
            <li> As a light weight finishing powder, for people</li>
            <li> I can barely afford the doctor myself, so it is so nice to have an affordable powder sunblock to combat it!</li>
            <li> than i expected, which is normally good, but this one is kind of bulky for my travel bag.  </li>
            <li> Very nice powder, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> This is a great handy little product to have around!</li>
            <li> and I am pretty fair skinned, but it goes on very translucent.</li>
            <li> Natural finish, great product and the prince is just amazing, i Will definitely buy again.  </li>
            <li> But heck - for $6 it&#x27;s worth a try if you&#x27;re on the fence!</li>
            <li> in mind that you shouldn&#x27;t be applying this powder looking for significant coverage.</li>
            <li> It has a higher SPF than most powder products and since my sunscreens and make up have a chemical sunscreen (octinoxate) in them, this powder gives me the additional benefit of a barrier sunscreen (titanium dioxide).  </li>
            <li> For my daughter&#x27;s more porcelain complexion, it can ONLY be used more like a blush/bronzer, but she is doesn&#x27;t want more coverage than that, anyway.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is a high level of SPF in a powder form and can be reapplied easily.</li>
            <li> Colorless powdered zinc is much smoother, softer and would be a better color for fair to light or possibly medium skin.</li>
            <li> I wish I had bought it right away!  </li>
            <li> Most popular sunscreen powders cost more than 10 times the price of this little gem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works great as a SPF supplement and probably for light intermittent sun exposure, but usually sunscreens need a certain amount to be effective.  </li>
            <li> It really comes in elegant box that reminds me of something that Marilyn Monroe or Jackie Kennedy would have on their dressing table to powder their nose.</li>
            <li> its a definite buy im fair skinned</li>
            <li> /&gt;Something folks should probably consider is that this product probably shouldn&#x27;t be used alone for protection in full sun exposure.  </li>
            <li> I love elf products and wanted to really like this sunscreen as an item I could use after makeup application thru-</li>
            <li> Great for active kids too.</li>
            <li> On the plus side though, it is super</li>
            <li> I use it in place of foundation, over moisturizer, for days when I will be outside more, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> It is rare for me to spend a day at beach and not come home with the bright red nose, no matter how often I reapply sunscreen.</li>
            <li> If I need to put on sunscreen quickly or reapply it makes it&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would prefer if this product was translucent as I am very fair and do not love the hue of this product.  </li>
            <li> PRETTY DARN CHEAP</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky this is the right color for</li>
            <li> Additionally, the color was very warm and turned orange on my slightly oily skin within an hour.</li>
            <li> and it worked out great not too heavy</li>
            <li> Most of the sun damage we experience is not just from the beach but from daily sun and light exposure.</li>
            <li> Unlike many mineral MUs, this is completely matte--not a bit of shimmer or luminosity.</li>
            <li> but so far I&#x27;ve only used the provided application pad and it works great.</li>
            <li> so it works worth any skin color.</li>
            <li> just using this one product is such a nice change....</li>
            <li> It surprisingly didn&#x27;t make either of us look pink.</li>
            <li> A pretty AMAZING product for only $6!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much coverage, if you want something full coverage this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Good: in a sifter instead of a bristle-shedding brush tube like so many powder sunscreens, cheap (cheap enough that I see it&#x27;s been added to add-ons in the week since I bought it), and easy to see if you&#x27;ve applied it, due to</li>
            <li> It felt all right (not suffocating).</li>
            <li> I use this as a setting powder, the puff is so soft and the powder goes on so easily and stays in place all day.</li>
            <li> If it matches your skin tone, I imagine this would be a great product, especially for the wonderfully low price.</li>
            <li> The applicator is soft and makes the product easy to apply.</li>
            <li> this is a great product,very affordable hard to find,powder with sunscreen</li>
            <li> Nearly Naked, finally top off with this power with Elf kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> so I haven’t experienced any separation or oxidation color changes, at least until after about 12 hours of wear.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be exactly what was described.</li>
            <li> ,it sheer so most people can wear it.will order again for sure.good seller.thank you.</li>
            <li> It is a bright enough red that I have to use it as a blush.</li>
            <li> #2 Check yourself in direct sun and fluorescent lighting, to make sure the tint looks natural.  </li>
            <li> This is a fine powder with a little bit of color but not enough to color your face or use as a foundation unless you are quite fair.</li>
            <li> Which is nice because I go through an average of 5 blotting papers a day to cut the shine in my t-zone as it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought e.l.f. products in the past and they are good for the price that you pay.  </li>
            <li> For people that are on medication that makes their skin super sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li> I certainly wouldn&#x27;t call it translucent.</li>
            <li> I am so grateful to e.l.f. products-they are decent well made products, yet very affordable!</li>
            <li> This works really well and for the price</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> i think been use very diapointed.maybe buy from some one else .to</li>
            <li> I really like this powder.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t mind so much (it does help control oil/shininess)</li>
            <li> I really needed a powder sunscreen to apply over makeup.</li>
            <li> This suncreen is very matte and the highlighter adds a bit of dimension.</li>
            <li> I use this on the whole family.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have an issue with tanning</li>
            <li> Product was much too orange for me-</li>
            <li> SPF powder shouldn&#x27;t cost much.  </li>
            <li> but I really like it.  </li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> However, I can see this color obviously not working for everyone&#x27;s skin toned - so those of you with warm undertones or darker skin might want to try a different powder.</li>
            <li> Great product in theory, but the powder&#x27;s tint was quite dark, almost like a loose powder foundation.</li>
            <li> only criticism is the packaging is a pain--it&#x27;s pretty messy and you end up wasting a fair amount of powder.  </li>
            <li> It is quality makeup at down right cheap prices.</li>
            <li> I used to use BareMinerals mineral SPF that came in a brush (and was much more expensive), and while the brush was a nice feature, I prefer this product to that one by far.</li>
            <li> All in all, not worth deducting a star, but I will probably transfer the product into a better container.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t break out my sensitive skin, which I assume is because ZnO is actually pretty helpful</li>
            <li> I wish it came in multiple colors for easier matching, but it doesn&#x27;t, and it&#x27;s difficult to tell if it will be a match from the pictures, so I recommend that if you want this product, it might be best to buy it in a store.</li>
            <li> This is no different--it&#x27;s a decent powder and a decent quantity.  </li>
            <li> I am a brown skin african american and at first this seem too light for my</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product to anyone spending time in the sun.</li>
            <li> It does not break out my sensitive skin, and it lasts much longer than I anticipated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this instead of my normal cream sunscreen topped with my mineral foundation.....</li>
            <li> I wear sunscreen 50 normally and reapply every hour, but still get color of freckly...</li>
            <li> I add a little highlighter to make it look more natural.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels heavier than just a setting or foundation powder would, but I can live with that for the protection.  </li>
            <li> thou said new on it</li>
            <li> explained it was my new powder ,</li>
            <li> All I know is I live in TX.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be great with all of the sun protection, but this powder has aged my face by a least 10 yrs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> really love this product and recommend it highly to anyone with sensitive, red, thin, easily burnt skin.</li>
            <li> Neither of us have any issues with irritation and we both have Very sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very natural looking and</li>
            <li> /&gt;To reiterate, my box looks exactly as pictured and has the same labeling, but the color of the powder does not match the illustration on the box.</li>
            <li> Leaves no color, but just enough coverage for our hot summers in California.</li>
            <li> However my skin was so sensitive I could not wear normal sunscreen.</li>
            <li> While I’m pretty pale, especially during the MN winters, I tan easily</li>
            <li> It can get cluggy easily, and then has to be washed, dried, etc.  </li>
            <li> the powder might go on better with a brush, but with the spongy felt type applicator it is a very very pale color.  </li>
            <li> that way you won&#x27;t make a huge mess.</li>
            <li> hi try look nice on put the one i got was half empty .even</li>
            <li> I spent two weeks in the strong southern sun and my scalp didn&#x27;t get burned at all.</li>
            <li> I WAS SURPRISED AT THE COST</li>
            <li> I have a 1yr old boy with no hair</li>
            <li> So far, I have found that it does not cake.</li>
            <li> It never bothered my sensitive skin or ruined my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It absolutely protects my skin from getting burned, which in Southern California happens in about 5 minutes without sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s far from it.</li>
            <li> I did reapply frequently as I would with any sun</li>
            <li> and I am pleasantly surprised by how invisible it is.  </li>
            <li> The powder has a peachy kind of tint which looks terrible on my fair skin.</li>
            <li> (I believe it&#x27;s only sold on their website, besides being available here and from some other resellers.)</li>
            <li> Wish the container was a bit smaller not very travel friendly.</li>
            <li> I have used far more expensive products, but this one works absolutely as well w/out the cost!</li>
            <li> because I don&#x27;t believe that this powder alone can give enough sun protection as a main sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li> Overall, a decent face powder.</li>
            <li> But if you apply it lightly, with a big fluffy brush, it should still be wearable.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super messy</li>
            <li> This is great for people that are normally unable to wear sunscreens because they are sensitive to the ingredients in conventional sunscreen bases.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li> But I use it everyday, and reapply multiple times per day, so I&#x27;m going through it pretty fast.</li>
            <li> It has higher SPF protection than most mineral powders and it rivals the very expensive powders that I normally use.</li>
            <li> I got it in the mail and screwed off the top of the lid which is very hard to do.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine it looking good on any skintone unless you apply very little, which would make it pretty much useless as a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I would prefer to tap some out and use a brush like Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> I hate liquid sunscreen on my face, so I use as many products with SPF on it as possible, but sometimes you need more protection.</li>
            <li> This powder is not fine enough, so &amp;#34;sheer&amp;#34; is a stretch - especially if you use enough for the 45 SPF rating to be accurate.</li>
            <li> I really prefer this powder to any other sunscreen.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, this powder is very tinted.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind paying a little more than the MSRP since other options are either difficult to find or much more</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found another loose powder with such a high SPF.</li>
            <li> First, this works well as an everyday sunscreen.</li>
            <li> As I live an extremely active lifestyle in Hawaii, I am a MAJOR sunscreen junkie...</li>
            <li> The only negative this early is how little is contained in the tub (a bit more than 1 TBS), but it&#x27;s only $6, so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> So even though this powder is way too dark for me, it doesn&#x27;t look particularly unnatural.</li>
            <li> SO PLEASED!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using mineral makeup, the top original companies for 15+ years and it completely healed my adult acne and  is the cure for everything I hated about other foundation&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> I think both sides of the previous reviews are true - it is a little pink/orange, but that may not be a problem for you.  </li>
            <li> I just received this today, and it looks really orange in the tub, but when applied it looks quite neutral on my pale complexion.</li>
            <li> And if it&#x27;s useless as a sunscreen, well, there are plenty of better (and often cheaper) loose and pressed powders you could use, some of which are from the same company.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it would work with dark skin either, as there was a pretty noticeable color it left behind which I imagine would show up against any skin tones and be pretty stark against very dark or very light skin.</li>
            <li> It gives me a flat powdered look and rubs off on anything that touches my face.</li>
            <li> Love that is a dry application rather than the usual greasy thick options.</li>
            <li> I usually only use this alone long after my skincare products have had a chance to dry and sink in, or over dry bb cream.</li>
            <li> The SPF has kept me protected through long days.</li>
            <li> This works well for my skin since I am Irish and have pink undertones.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t keep face matte for long.</li>
            <li> And it seems to last longer than any of my other makeup.  </li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin, and this is making me break out less than other products</li>
            <li> It actually appears very pink when you receive it.</li>
            <li> powder is chalky and makes my skin look somewhat dry.</li>
            <li> This powder goes on sheer, I apply with a big fluffy brush, not the sponge that comes with it.  </li>
            <li> Some people mentioned that it had a dark pigment, the one I received says &amp;#34;sheer&amp;#34; and it really is sheer.  </li>
            <li> inevitably, it will be too dark for some people.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> : not even close to translucent, orange-ish and too dark for my NW15 skin, and the inactive ingredients include Vitamin A, which some recent studies indicate may be counterproductive in sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Most SPF powders are very expensive, so I wanted to try this inexpensive one from e.l.f., but couldn&#x27;t find it in stores</li>
            <li> Loose powder, UHHHMAAAZZZIN.</li>
            <li> I meant to get the HD loose powder one.</li>
            <li> I usually buy a much more expensive powder (Urban decay Razor Sharp), but, after seeing the other reviews, decided to see how well this compared.</li>
            <li> A bit of melt is not that bad, though, I kind of like the slightly dewy look it gives me.</li>
            <li> I usually use this product to set my makeup, and it works as well for that purpose as any other more expensive powder.</li>
            <li> The compact is a twist-off and is a little cumbersome to open.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a pink shade.</li>
            <li> I had expected to use a brush to blend it in, but a brush is not needed.</li>
            <li> but the tint is very pink, like a pink stucco house in the Southwest.</li>
            <li> It comes with a massive powder puff but very little powder comes out of the holes.  </li>
            <li> Take off 1 star for not having other color options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and the zinc in this</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in the hopes of using it this summer, but even though it claims to be translucent, it still shows up and will not blend in, possibly due to my darker skin tone.  </li>
            <li> And can be worn alone without any other</li>
            <li> It arrived with the other powder I ordered from e.l.f.</li>
            <li> I am the palest person I&#x27;ve ever met, but I have very pink undertones.</li>
            <li> Very pale color so must use prior to bronzer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting him down for a nap with the sunblock on b/c its just a powder unlike the other sunscreens I have that never fully rub in.</li>
            <li> Is a little darker than expected</li>
            <li> Therefore, if you apply this lightly, it&#x27;s hard to know if you&#x27;re getting enough</li>
            <li> The color is a bit dark.</li>
            <li> It was too dark for my pasty-pale skin</li>
            <li> Also can&#x27;t just slap it on without a mirror since it is so dark.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t because the color is too dark on me.</li>
            <li> this &amp;#34;sheer&amp;#34; powder had too dark of a pigment for me.</li>
            <li> I use this on top of a base.  </li>
            <li> The matt look on top of my base</li>
            <li> a down to earth price like this</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my scalp at the beach down south this summer.</li>
            <li> It was hard to get enough powder on the puff through the little holes in the sifter, but the sifter can be removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I recommend leaving half of the tape on,</li>
            <li> face did not slide off in a greasy mess after sports all day</li>
            <li> Never really worked for me, not sure why.</li>
            <li> The lid is screwed on so tight and you have to twist it off with all your strength.</li>
            <li> Not sure what other reviewers were talking about with color -</li>
            <li> You do get a lot for the little it costs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Morning, I layer moisturizer, Olay with SPF 30, summer add Neutrogena Liquid SPF 70, a little of Revlon</li>
            <li> I needed something to put on his little bald head.</li>
            <li> I dust a little on his head, face and arms</li>
            <li> The powder was a little lighter than my skin and could be seen a little.</li>
            <li> No normal skin toned person can use this as is necessary for protection and not look as though they fake and baked their face.</li>
            <li> a little bit heavy for my oily skin.  </li>
            <li> Doctors recommend wearing sunscreen everyday.</li>
            <li> I also recommend discarding the puff and use a fluffy brush instead.  </li>
            <li> you are looking for something to even out imperfections and give you sun protection, this will probably fail -- because by the time you get a layer that&#x27;s opaque enough to cover blemishes or discolorations, the peachy tint of this powder will look to stark against the skin.&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li> While it may work alright for some people, it&#x27;s definitely not suitable for anyone with pale skin.</li>
            <li> Almost a peachy-pink color which keeps that horrible white-cast look away that many zinc based sunblocks give you.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that it is difficult to dispense.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This says sheer, but has a slight tint, nothing orangey, or ugly.  </li>
            <li> hard to control.  </li>
            <li> so you can see it on your skin and it feels thick.  </li>
            <li> you normally wouldn&#x27;t wear base</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would get all over the place as has been my experience with loose powders, but not with this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> but I hate how greasy lining my hairline with regular sunscreen makes my hair.</li>
            <li> I tried to make this work by blending it with other powders, but it&#x27;s just bad.</li>
            <li> For me, it is too expensive to use like that every day, since that takes a lot, but I might do that every day if price was not an issue for me.  </li>
            <li> sad.</li>
            <li> packing was a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> the product itself is not too bad otherwise.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t expect that it would be so bad.  </li>
            <li> For people that hate the feel of layers and layers of makeup products, because despite of its color, this powder *feels&amp;#34; weightless on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li> , the packaging is horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I would prefer if this product was translucent as I am very fair and do not love the hue of this product.  With that said, I would probably purchase this again to keep in my desk at work for a midday powder.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin, and this is making me break out less than other products so that&#x27;s a good thing.  Not sure what other reviewers were talking about with color - I have fair skin and this powder looks fine on me.</li>
            <li> totally sheer.  lasted all day  face did not slide off in a greasy mess after sports all day</li>
            <li> First, this works well as an everyday sunscreen. Most of the sun damage we experience is not just from the beach but from daily sun and light exposure. Doctors recommend wearing sunscreen everyday. This is a fine powder with a little bit of color but not enough to color your face or use as a foundation unless you are quite fair. However, neither does it leave you pasty. You do get a lot for the little it costs. It really comes in elegant box that reminds me of something that Marilyn Monroe or Jackie Kennedy would have on their dressing table to powder their nose. There is enough in the box to keep some on your bathroom counter and put some in a powder brush applicator to take with you.</li>
            <li> Never really worked for me, not sure why.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect sunscreen! I have very fair skin and this sheer formula works great!  The container is large so it is not as portable but great price and product.</li>
            <li> Love it. It does have color and I am pretty fair skinned, but it goes on very translucent. I use it to see my primer before my foundation.</li>
            <li> Got this product to use as face sunscreen for my daughter...she LOVES it..</li>
            <li> Color is good year round for my warm skin (fair in winter, tanned in summers) and so cheap! Take off 1 star for not having other color options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My work is outdoors and I&#x27;m hardcore about sunscreen; particularly now after all these years in the sun, I have freckles and brown spots all over my once gorgeous skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was looking for a powder sunscreen that I can reapply outdoors over makeup and dirt. I&#x27;m lucky this is the right color for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morning, I layer moisturizer, Olay with SPF 30, summer add Neutrogena Liquid SPF 70, a little of Revlon Nearly Naked, finally top off with this power with Elf kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> This works really well and for the price its a definite buy im fair skinned and it worked out great not too heavy</li>
            <li> I really prefer this powder to any other sunscreen. We tend to have a lot of blowing dust, so lotions tend to get muddy and gross. Seems to keep the sun off, just remember your ears and places you normally wouldn&#x27;t wear base</li>
            <li> The powder has a peachy kind of tint which looks terrible on my fair skin. Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Very pale color so must use prior to bronzer. Great coverage and easy application!</li>
            <li> This powder is NOT &amp;#34;nude&amp;#34; &amp;#34;sheer&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;translucent.&amp;#34; I got it at a reduced price so I&#x27;m keeping it although I won&#x27;t be using it much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a pink shade. (I&#x27;ll post photos) I happen to have pink-toned skin and rosy cheeks, so the color actually works for me. However, I do not wear makeup and that&#x27;s what this seems like to me. It gives me a flat powdered look and rubs off on anything that touches my face. It leaves color on the washcloth when I wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it to use as a dusting to get rid of the shininess after applying a sunscreen lotion to my face. It did that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot vouch for its sun protection abilities as I used it over another sunscreen. It felt all right (not suffocating). It was hard to get enough powder on the puff through the little holes in the sifter, but the sifter can be removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To reiterate, my box looks exactly as pictured and has the same labeling, but the color of the powder does not match the illustration on the box.</li>
            <li> It was great.  Especially for the part in my hair.  It&#x27;s obviously non greasy, so I could protect my face and scalp from all day in the sun.</li>
            <li> The color is a bit dark. It would have been nice if it was a translucent powder but I do like that it has sunscreen in it.</li>
            <li> Loose powder, UHHHMAAAZZZIN. I use this as a setting powder, the puff is so soft and the powder goes on so easily and stays in place all day. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Natural finish, great product and the prince is just amazing, i Will definitely buy again.  Has also sunscreen which is superb.</li>
            <li> A nude hue to it offers great coverage for lighter complexions. The SPF has kept me protected through long days. The powder itself does kind of melt a bit so maybe not the best choice for very oily face or humid areas. A bit of melt is not that bad, though, I kind of like the slightly dewy look it gives me. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen powder, love it!</li>
            <li> BLENDS NICE AND GOOD PROTECTION I WAS SURPRISED AT THE COST PRETTY DARN CHEAP&lt;br /&gt;FOR A VERY GOOD PRODUCT  WILL BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> Makes African American skin ashy</li>
            <li> I have light olive skin and it blends wonderfully. It has higher SPF protection than most mineral powders and it rivals the very expensive powders that I normally use.</li>
            <li> I just received this today, and it looks really orange in the tub, but when applied it looks quite neutral on my pale complexion. Unlike many mineral MUs, this is completely matte--not a bit of shimmer or luminosity. The only negative this early is how little is contained in the tub (a bit more than 1 TBS), but it&#x27;s only $6, so I can&#x27;t complain. I haven&#x27;t tested its UVB yet, and I&#x27;ll report back if I burn.</li>
            <li> This is a great handy little product to have around! I have a 1yr old boy with no hair and we are constantly heading out doors. I needed something to put on his little bald head. This is the perfect solution. I would like to try with a makeup brush to apply it but so far I&#x27;ve only used the provided application pad and it works great. I dust a little on his head, face and arms and he head out for an hour. I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting him down for a nap with the sunblock on b/c its just a powder unlike the other sunscreens I have that never fully rub in. It has a nice light weight feel that I forget that I&#x27;ve put it on as soon as Im done applying it. I use it on my face, neck and arms as well. Neither of us have any issues with irritation and we both have Very sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already purchased a back up!</li>
            <li> I *love* that the powder is SPF 45!  I haven&#x27;t found another loose powder with such a high SPF. It is translucent so it works worth any skin color. And the price is excellent! The only complaint is that it is difficult to dispense. It comes with a massive powder puff but very little powder comes out of the holes.  I would prefer to tap some out and use a brush like Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I bought this just to fulfill an order for free shipping however it is one of the best cosmetic, if not the best cosmetic purchases I&#x27;ve ever made. I liked that this was a powder sunscreen and thought it would be good to just to reapply on top of makeup each day, what I didn&#x27;t expect was the best setting powder ever, even better than my MAC. Even after wearing glasses and sunglasses there are no marks left when I take them off. Also, I should mention that I am dark-skinned and this product works well over my foundation. Can&#x27;t be the price!</li>
            <li> The reason I am giving this product 5 stars is affordability.  This powder goes on sheer, I apply with a big fluffy brush, not the sponge that comes with it.  I love that it has the spf built in already and I use it on top of my cc cream as added insurance that I am protecting my skin.  So far, I have found that it does not cake. I would definitely purchase again.  Even the container it comes in is pleasing to the eye.</li>
            <li> I wear sunscreen every day under my make-up on all exposed areas, even in the winter.  However, since I always do a full face make-up (you’re welcome, world) I wouldn’t re-apply the sunscreen later in the day.  To make it easier for me to reapply, I use this in conjunction with additional powdered zinc, bronzer, and setting powder to make my own &amp;#34;correctly colored&amp;#34; sunscreen powder.  Since this contains zinc as one of the ingredients, it’s too light by itself for my skin-tone.  While I’m pretty pale, especially during the MN winters, I tan easily (yes, even with the preventative sunscreen use) and this can look chalky on me for most of the year if I don’t mix it.  Hence the 1 star deduction.  On the plus side though, it is super cheap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels heavier than just a setting or foundation powder would, but I can live with that for the protection.  Since I layer my sunscreen anyway I don’t cake it on so I haven’t experienced any separation or oxidation color changes, at least until after about 12 hours of wear.  Of course, if I work all day and if I plan on going out that night, I’m reapplying my make-up anyway so I don’t feel gross.  I have extremely oily skin and the zinc in this does NOT break me out, it also helps to keep my face matte.  Which is nice because I go through an average of 5 blotting papers a day to cut the shine in my t-zone as it is.</li>
            <li> It is agreeable except for the screen inside the box.  It can get cluggy easily, and then has to be washed, dried, etc.  the product itself is not too bad otherwise.</li>
            <li> I love this product....I&#x27;ve been using this instead of my normal cream sunscreen topped with my mineral foundation.....just using this one product is such a nice change....love love love it!!  Some people mentioned that it had a dark pigment, the one I received says &amp;#34;sheer&amp;#34; and it really is sheer.  Leaves no color, but just enough coverage for our hot summers in California.</li>
            <li> hi try look nice on put the one i got was half empty .even thou said new on it i think been use very diapointed.maybe buy from some one else .to see if  is like that</li>
            <li> I use this on top of a base.  I like the SPF rating since I have had to have pre cancers removed from my face.  The matt look on top of my base works well.</li>
            <li> I really like this powder.  I wear sunscreen 50 normally and reapply every hour, but still get color of freckly...(which will turn to age spots).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This says sheer, but has a slight tint, nothing orangey, or ugly.  I actually prefer this than sheer as I feel it smooths my skin ever so slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did put it over my lotion sunscreen for extra protection a couple of times at the beach.  I was afraid it would get all over the place as has been my experience with loose powders, but not with this.&lt;br /&gt;Great price too!</li>
            <li> I know there is some debate over whether or not you can get additional sunscreen protection from a powder make up - so I give it 5 stars on the assumption that it has the added benefit of sunscreen, but even without it, I love this powder. Nice lightweight finish that removes shine. Great value!</li>
            <li> Great product but the description says translucent, but the product says sheer...other than that it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> I keep this in my car and apply when I leave the car to go out into the sun.  I love the fact that it is a high level of SPF in a powder form and can be reapplied easily.</li>
            <li> I wear sunscreen on my face and exposed skin every day. For my face, I like to set it with a powder so that it isn&#x27;t shiny. Most SPF powders are very expensive, so I wanted to try this inexpensive one from e.l.f., but couldn&#x27;t find it in stores (I believe it&#x27;s only sold on their website, besides being available here and from some other resellers.) I didn&#x27;t mind paying a little more than the MSRP since other options are either difficult to find or much more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;The powder is chalky and makes my skin look somewhat dry. I wouldn&#x27;t mind so much (it does help control oil/shininess) but the tint is very pink, like a pink stucco house in the Southwest. I can&#x27;t imagine it looking good on any skintone unless you apply very little, which would make it pretty much useless as a sunscreen. And if it&#x27;s useless as a sunscreen, well, there are plenty of better (and often cheaper) loose and pressed powders you could use, some of which are from the same company. I&#x27;ll try to find a way to use what I have, but will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always worn foundation, but now I just wear tinted moisturizer and this powder, and I love the look. This is very sheer and doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothing.</li>
            <li> I wanted powder sunscreen for the part in my children&#x27;s hair since they don&#x27;t always keep their hats on their heads.  The product is tinted so it shows up on my brunette, but not my blonde.  I just use my hand to wipe it off the brunette&#x27;s hair.  It seems to work as neither child ended up with a burnt head.</li>
            <li> Great product in theory, but the powder&#x27;s tint was quite dark, almost like a loose powder foundation. It was too dark for my pasty-pale skin so I couldn&#x27;t use it without looking Oompa-loompa-ish. If it matches your skin tone, I imagine this would be a great product, especially for the wonderfully low price. I wish it came in multiple colors for easier matching, but it doesn&#x27;t, and it&#x27;s difficult to tell if it will be a match from the pictures, so I recommend that if you want this product, it might be best to buy it in a store.</li>
            <li> I really needed a powder sunscreen to apply over makeup. Even though this powder says &amp;#34;translucent,&amp;#34; it&#x27;s not. I use my lotion sunscreen all over and apply this as blush on the areas most prone to sunburn. On the tops of cheekbones and my nose. I add a little highlighter to make it look more natural. This suncreen is very matte and the highlighter adds a bit of dimension. I&#x27;m NC10 for reference.</li>
            <li> Nice packaging and smooth as silk. This is the best powder coverage with sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t burned while wearing this.  Love that is a dry application rather than the usual greasy thick options.</li>
            <li> This powder SPF is light and translucent, and perfect over makeup. I hate liquid sunscreen on my face, so I use as many products with SPF on it as possible, but sometimes you need more protection. I usually use this product to set my makeup, and it works as well for that purpose as any other more expensive powder. I used to use BareMinerals mineral SPF that came in a brush (and was much more expensive), and while the brush was a nice feature, I prefer this product to that one by far. Since it is colorless, there is no need to match your skin tone and you can reapply as needed without building color.&lt;br /&gt;E.L.F. has become a favorite brand of mine. It is quality makeup at down right cheap prices.</li>
            <li> I was on very strong medication that required me to wear sunscreen. However my skin was so sensitive I could not wear normal sunscreen. This worked amazing. Light and easy. I still use it now. It never bothered my sensitive skin or ruined my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Genius product at an awesome price.</li>
            <li> Superb product!!  So glad to find sunscreen that is in powder form instead of goopy liquids or gels, which I despise.  I have very fair, very sensitive skin and am allergic to about 90% of all cosmetics - they cause inflammation and redness for me --  this product does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the easiest product to use, just brush it on, I use my own brush and put in on over my make-up or when I&#x27;m going out to walk my dogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absolutely protects my skin from getting burned, which in Southern California happens in about 5 minutes without sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this product and recommend it highly to anyone with sensitive, red, thin, easily burnt skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this powder. Titanium and Zinc are the most effective natural SPF you can put on your face. However, the powder is tinted. Almost a peachy-pink color which keeps that horrible white-cast look away that many zinc based sunblocks give you. This works well for my skin since I am Irish and have pink undertones. However, I can see this color obviously not working for everyone&#x27;s skin toned - so those of you with warm undertones or darker skin might want to try a different powder. But heck - for $6 it&#x27;s worth a try if you&#x27;re on the fence! Another plus - The powder does not look cakes nor does it settle in my pores and it&#x27;s extremely easy for me to re-apply it throughout the day. Will continue to use this powder with my daily skin care routine!</li>
            <li> Seems to be exactly what was described. Wish the container was a bit smaller not very travel friendly.</li>
            <li> Says it&#x27;s translucent but it&#x27;s far from it. It is a bright enough red that I have to use it as a blush.</li>
            <li> very effective and safe to leave in the car.  use this at Disney when we go.  just pat it on the face and arms and works great.  a little bit heavy for my oily skin.  I use this on the whole family.  no complaints, but probably would not use at the beach or anything like that.  you do need to reapply when sweating.</li>
            <li> Inlove with this product. I use it under my foundation and it&#x27;s not noticeable.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t keep face matte for long. Color is off too. Does not clog my pores though. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I am SO,SO PLEASED!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using mineral makeup, the top original companies for 15+ years and it completely healed my adult acne and  is the cure for everything I hated about other foundation&#x27;s...and I tried them all.&lt;br /&gt;With a down to earth price like this I am sold. I tried the primer and it is the best of any I have tried. I can&#x27;t wait to get a big order together.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in the hopes of using it this summer, but even though it claims to be translucent, it still shows up and will not blend in, possibly due to my darker skin tone.  If you are purchasing it and are of the fairer side, I would recommend it for sure.  Maybe in the winter months I will have lightened up enough to use it and not see it on my skin.  Still a great product outside of color issues.</li>
            <li> Works well. Prevents burning. Great alternative to lotion. Is a little darker than expected</li>
            <li> This powder is a great value. Most popular sunscreen powders cost more than 10 times the price of this little gem.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to apply, it doesn&#x27;t look cakey and it adds an extra layer of protection to your face that is weightless and effective.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback that I see is that this is a tinted powder, not clear.&lt;br /&gt;So inevitably, it will be too dark for some people.&lt;br /&gt;I think if you are lighter than NC30, you will probably see the powder on your skin. But if you apply it lightly, with a big fluffy brush, it should still be wearable.&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that you shouldn&#x27;t be applying this powder looking for significant coverage. That&#x27;s not the purpose of this product.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something to even out imperfections and give you sun protection, this will probably fail -- because by the time you get a layer that&#x27;s opaque enough to cover blemishes or discolorations, the peachy tint of this powder will look to stark against the skin.&lt;br /&gt;So what is this powder good for, then?&lt;br /&gt;• This is great for people that are normally unable to wear sunscreens because they are sensitive to the ingredients in conventional sunscreen bases.&lt;br /&gt;• For people that hate the feel of layers and layers of makeup products, because despite of its color, this powder *feels&amp;#34; weightless on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;• For people that are on medication that makes their skin super sensitive to the sun. ONLY if you are layering the powder over another form of stable sunscreen-- because I don&#x27;t believe that this powder alone can give enough sun protection as a main sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;• As a light weight finishing powder, for people NC30+ that don&#x27;t want to look to matte or cakey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is, I love it. I need a ton of sun protection, but I don&#x27;t want to look like Casper or feel like I have a layer of Crisco on my face; so I use this powder over my regular sunscreen and make up for additional piece of mind.</li>
            <li> I ordered this by accident. I meant to get the HD loose powder one. I don&#x27;t know, I guess it works? I don&#x27;t really have an issue with tanning but it&#x27;s nice to be protected by the UVA/UVB rays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the packaging is horrible. It&#x27;s super messy so I recommend leaving half of the tape on, that way you won&#x27;t make a huge mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought e.l.f. products in the past and they are good for the price that you pay.  This is no different--it&#x27;s a decent powder and a decent quantity.  The compact is a twist-off and is a little cumbersome to open.  It&#x27;s from China whatdoyouexpect.  Overall, a decent face powder.</li>
            <li> As I live an extremely active lifestyle in Hawaii, I am a MAJOR sunscreen junkie...the more SPF the better!  This product is a perfect setting powder to add protection over my makeup or my lotion sunscreens.  It has a higher SPF than most powder products and since my sunscreens and make up have a chemical sunscreen (octinoxate) in them, this powder gives me the additional benefit of a barrier sunscreen (titanium dioxide).  The powder disappeared when applied on my skin (I have warm-toned Asian skin) and I didn&#x27;t have the problems with the powder turning orange during the day.  In Hawaii&#x27;s humid climate, it does a nice job keeping my skin nice and matte.  A pretty AMAZING product for only $6!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something folks should probably consider is that this product probably shouldn&#x27;t be used alone for protection in full sun exposure.  It works great as a SPF supplement and probably for light intermittent sun exposure, but usually sunscreens need a certain amount to be effective.  Therefore, if you apply this lightly, it&#x27;s hard to know if you&#x27;re getting enough protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only criticism is the packaging is a pain--it&#x27;s pretty messy and you end up wasting a fair amount of powder.  I also recommend discarding the puff and use a fluffy brush instead.  All in all, not worth deducting a star, but I will probably transfer the product into a better container.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews, I was reluctant to buy this.  I wish I had bought it right away!  I expected it to be orange, but it was much lighter, and a warmer shade (pink).  I am fair and this works nicely for me.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, this powder is very tinted. I am the palest person I&#x27;ve ever met, but I have very pink undertones. So even though this powder is way too dark for me, it doesn&#x27;t look particularly unnatural. I usually only use this alone long after my skincare products have had a chance to dry and sink in, or over dry bb cream. It&#x27;s waaay too pigmented to use over slicker (silicone based) bb cream or liquid foundation. Doesn&#x27;t break out my sensitive skin, which I assume is because ZnO is actually pretty helpful (calamine!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a pretty good value, and there&#x27;s a lot there. But I use it everyday, and reapply multiple times per day, so I&#x27;m going through it pretty fast. Also can&#x27;t just slap it on without a mirror since it is so dark.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a solution to sunscreen lotions always burning my eyes, and it solved that problem perfectly.  I think both sides of the previous reviews are true - it is a little pink/orange, but that may not be a problem for you.  For my medium skin, it blends in beautifully.  For my daughter&#x27;s more porcelain complexion, it can ONLY be used more like a blush/bronzer, but she is doesn&#x27;t want more coverage than that, anyway.  I use it in place of foundation, over moisturizer, for days when I will be outside more, and I love it.  For me, it is too expensive to use like that every day, since that takes a lot, but I might do that every day if price was not an issue for me.  I like the not-too-matte finish.  Three tips:  #1 If you are putting it all over your face, make sure you blend the neck.  #2 Check yourself in direct sun and fluorescent lighting, to make sure the tint looks natural.  #3 This is a powder, so if you have fine hairs anywhere on your face, they will pick up the powder, too.</li>
            <li> Product was much too orange for me- I certainly wouldn&#x27;t call it translucent. While it may work alright for some people, it&#x27;s definitely not suitable for anyone with pale skin. Not sure how it would work with dark skin either, as there was a pretty noticeable color it left behind which I imagine would show up against any skin tones and be pretty stark against very dark or very light skin. Pretty disappointed and will probably have to throw it out as I can&#x27;t imagine when I&#x27;d ever be able to use it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because i was going to the beach and needed the SPF. I am a brown skin african american and at first this seem too light for my but i applied jt over my foundation then applied my powder make up to cover the ashiness.</li>
            <li> Cheap, effective and easy to use.  Used it as a finishing powder.  SPF powder shouldn&#x27;t cost much.  You will like this product, I imagine.  Wish my kid hadn&#x27;t poured it out all over the backseat of my car.</li>
            <li> I usually buy a much more expensive powder (Urban decay Razor Sharp), but, after seeing the other reviews, decided to see how well this compared. It is an excellent powder! It does not break out my sensitive skin, and it lasts much longer than I anticipated. I am so thankful I tried this product!</li>
            <li> I thought it would be great with all of the sun protection, but this powder has aged my face by a least 10 yrs.&lt;br /&gt;My parents were in shock!&lt;br /&gt;I explained it was my new powder , washed my face to prove it .&lt;br /&gt;They said to throw it out.&lt;br /&gt;Very sad.</li>
            <li> this is a great product,very affordable hard to find,powder with sunscreen so im very happy with this powder,it sheer so most people can wear it.will order again for sure.good seller.thank you.</li>
            <li> It is rare for me to spend a day at beach and not come home with the bright red nose, no matter how often I reapply sunscreen. This product changed that! There was no redness at the end of the day and my skin was not oily or greasy like regular sun block. The applicator is soft and makes the product easy to apply. The powder was a little lighter than my skin and could be seen a little. I did reapply frequently as I would with any sun protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anyone spending time in the sun.</li>
            <li> A lot of color in this product.  I did see that in some of the reviews but I didn&#x27;t expect that it would be so bad.  I love elf products and wanted to really like this sunscreen as an item I could use after makeup application thru-out the day.  I can&#x27;t because the color is too dark on me.</li>
            <li> I love e.l.f. products, and was extremely excited to discover this powder SPF on Amazon. The feel of the product is great; however, I have very fair skin, and this &amp;#34;sheer&amp;#34; powder had too dark of a pigment for me. I&#x27;m looking around and might order the Jane Iredale translucent SPF powder... Although it only has an SPF of 30.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much coverage, if you want something full coverage this isn&#x27;t for you. It also works just fine for my medium color skin.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for the price!  It works well with any foundation or on its own. The price is outstanding for the value!</li>
            <li> Here are the ingredients listed on the ELF site:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Titanium Dioxide 23.3% Zinc Oxide 18.7% Ingredients: Mica, Silica, Talc, Bismuth Oxychloride, Boron Nitride, Aluminum Hydroxide, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Extract, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Retinyl Palmitate (Va), Tocopheryl Acetate (Ve), Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (Vc), Sodium Dehydroacetate May Contain: Iron Oxides (CI 77891 77892 77899), Manganese Violet (CI 77742)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good: in a sifter instead of a bristle-shedding brush tube like so many powder sunscreens, cheap (cheap enough that I see it&#x27;s been added to add-ons in the week since I bought it), and easy to see if you&#x27;ve applied it, due to it being more tinted than advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad: not even close to translucent, orange-ish and too dark for my NW15 skin, and the inactive ingredients include Vitamin A, which some recent studies indicate may be counterproductive in sunscreen. Goes on shiny (bismuth and boron, I believe, are to blame for that).</li>
            <li> than i expected, which is normally good, but this one is kind of bulky for my travel bag.  it is about four times the size that it looks on screen.  the powder might go on better with a brush, but with the spongy felt type applicator it is a very very pale color.  hard to control.  so you can see it on your skin and it feels thick.  close inspection ... i found the box also says Made in China.  won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. All I know is I live in TX. and the sun is literally on us 360 out of 365 days of the yr!! If you are fair, you wear sunblock OVER sunblock! I use powder sunblock over the sticky gooey sunblock to keep it from melting back into gooey sunblock in the heat and sweat! What I found w/this one is to mix it w/the sheer powder and that diffuses some of the orangey color. My sister (also in TX) was diagnosed w/skin cancer so we are terrified of this sun here. I can barely afford the doctor myself, so it is so nice to have an affordable powder sunblock to combat it! I am so grateful to e.l.f. products-they are decent well made products, yet very affordable! Every woman deserves to feel and look her best w/out breaking her bank account-this one also helps us stay healthy! I have used far more expensive products, but this one works absolutely as well w/out the cost!</li>
            <li> Love this product. If I need to put on sunscreen quickly or reapply it makes it&lt;br /&gt;so easy. Don&#x27;t have to wash hands. Great for active kids too.</li>
            <li> It actually appears very pink when you receive it. I tried it anyway. I wanted something my toddler would not balk at when I put it on her face and this worked great. I can also put it on the part in her hair. It surprisingly didn&#x27;t make either of us look pink. Works great for sun protection.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my scalp at the beach down south this summer. I have thin hair so my scalp always burns but I hate how greasy lining my hairline with regular sunscreen makes my hair. This product worked like a charm. I spent two weeks in the strong southern sun and my scalp didn&#x27;t get burned at all. And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Oompa Loompa. You better be fake tanning to make this product match you. No normal skin toned person can use this as is necessary for protection and not look as though they fake and baked their face.</li>
            <li> It is not shear but I really like it.  And it seems to last longer than any of my other makeup.  And can be worn alone without any other make up.</li>
            <li> Very nice powder, especially for the price.  I ordered it for the sunscreen value and I am pleasantly surprised by how invisible it is.  It doesn&#x27;t cake or collect in creases over make up or just moisturizer.  I even put it on the backs of my hands and it doesn&#x27;t  show or change color.  I apply it with the puff it comes with, even on brow bones and eyelids and it is a perfect invisible application.  I had expected to use a brush to blend it in, but a brush is not needed.</li>
            <li> This powder is not fine enough, so &amp;#34;sheer&amp;#34; is a stretch - especially if you use enough for the 45 SPF rating to be accurate. Additionally, the color was very warm and turned orange on my slightly oily skin within an hour. I tried to make this work by blending it with other powders, but it&#x27;s just bad. Colorless powdered zinc is much smoother, softer and would be a better color for fair to light or possibly medium skin.</li>
            <li> The product itself deserves 5 stars. It works very well. It feels like there is nothing on and you&#x27;re protected from the sun, bonus! Very natural looking and feeling.&lt;br /&gt;The packing was a bit disappointing. It arrived before estimated arrival time 👍 however the podwer was all over the item when I removed it from the box. When I unscrewed the lid it was all over the pouf even though the sticker was closing the holes for application... It arrived with the other powder I ordered from e.l.f. which arrived in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an affordable sunscreen zinc powder and bought this off their website.I got it in the mail and screwed off the top of the lid which is very hard to do.The lid is screwed on so tight and you have to twist it off with all your strength.I took out the puff went to apply the powder and it&#x27;s a bright orange,YUCK!! Unless you want to look like a pumpkin on Halloween... I threw it out. Do not recommend!!</li>
