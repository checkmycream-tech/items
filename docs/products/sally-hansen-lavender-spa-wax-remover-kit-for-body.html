            <li>wax itself is great!</li>
            <li>It worked perfectly!</li>
            <li>Very impressed with the prompt delivery and service.    </li>
            <li>This stuff is the best stuff I&#x27;ve found for home waxing.</li>
            <li>It has a great smell, BUT it is not water soluble!</li>
            <li>When applying the strip, it&#x27;s best to cut them to size</li>
            <li>Works great!!</li>
            <li>This does a great job and leaves me silky-smooth!</li>
            <li>I use this wax for my underarms and legs, and it is the best around.</li>
            <li>It does the job perfectly!</li>
            <li>I have been using this wax for 3 years and love it!!!</li>
            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>The lavender smell is great</li>
            <li>I use mine for brazilians and it works great.</li>
            <li>The azulene oil is great for getting it off your skin, too.</li>
            <li>this is a great product.</li>
            <li>it are not all that great.</li>
            <li>you know the technique of waxing this product is great.</li>
            <li>But baby oil on paper towels or cotton balls works great.</li>
            <li>Great service but package was damaged and the bottle was stuck</li>
            <li>It worked great though, removed the hair very effectively.</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li>but it also gives you a bunch of spatulas and some very effective strips.</li>
            <li>It does a very nice job for a store bought kit.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also so much cheaper if you purchase this delightful item via amazon, which is the best price i&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>The was has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>AND THAT IT SMELLS GOOD AND BLAH BLAH BLAH</li>
            <li>- smells good    </li>
            <li>It took off the hair fairly well</li>
            <li>It is good if used by heating in microwave instead of gas.</li>
            <li>the oil has always done a good job taking the wax off.</li>
            <li>but i used baby oil to clean up the excess wax off my skin and it worked great!</li>
            <li>great for the skin and very easy to use</li>
            <li>It smells great and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t come out easily!!</li>
            <li>but a great tip I learned : USE COFFEE FILTERS from the dollar store  :)</li>
            <li>For this kind of waxing seek a pro (or a talented friend).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The things I love are the smell, the color and that it is very effective when used correctly!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great product, my skin is very sensitive and this wax works just great on my skin, plus I love the lavander scent!!</li>
            <li>For the love of all that is holy, DON&#x27;T buy this product!</li>
            <li>Boy, am I glad I picked this one!</li>
            <li>I would recommend investing in a wax warmer and better wax!</li>
            <li>This stuff smells awesome and it doesn&#x27;t hurt that it looked pretty, too.</li>
            <li>It effectively removes hair and has never irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li>yes, it&#x27;s a bit gooey, but honestly, what microwavable wax won&#x27;t be gooey?    </li>
            <li>I use it before washing my face and before bathing so my face isn&#x27;t too warm.</li>
            <li>so this really is just about you finding that perfect</li>
            <li>If the wax is too warm, it becomes sticky (think bubble gum) and stretches between the cloth strip and your skin when you pull.</li>
            <li>If it looks like frosting, it&#x27;s too warm.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, always works really well.</li>
            <li>The wax heats up nicely in the microwave, so I&#x27;d give it an A+ for convenience.</li>
            <li>you can why the wax is still warm on your skin, with the strips supplied.</li>
            <li>In fact it just stays put even after warm shower and scrub.</li>
            <li>The strips lift the wax off the skin nicely.</li>
            <li>Many times hair length and technique inhibit a good result.</li>
            <li>If you wax figure out what kind works for you and the parts you&#x27;re waxing and avoid the others.</li>
            <li>I always do my own waxing and have never had any issues until I tried this product.</li>
            <li>and it does feel kind of calming and spa-like.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a very strong wax.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>but it comes off very easily with the oil.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most effective hair removal</li>
            <li>I have found.4 stars to 5 because it seems to be the most effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most effective hair removal I have found.</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the best and easiest waxing kits I&#x27;ve ever purchased and used.</li>
            <li>This is by far a great wax!  </li>
            <li>Very quick delivery!</li>
            <li>and I had to figure out the right temperature, but if you have the right temperature this wax will work perfectly every time without irritation and without removing living skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this waxing system because I liked that it used cloth strips, and came with a pretty good sized jar of wax.</li>
            <li>In Europe I used a cheap $6 waxing kit that did a WAY better job at removing my hair (and keeping it away!)</li>
            <li>What I find perfect about this wax though is that 1.)it lasts because it does not degrade very quickly (in fact I didn&#x27;t find that it degraded at all until I nearly reached the bottom and</li>
            <li>Tossed it out and won&#x27;t buy more.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product and im pleased.</li>
            <li>I been buying this product over and over again, works much better than sugar wax,</li>
            <li>I use it on my face an neck mostly.</li>
            <li>this better go away or i&#x27;ll sue.</li>
            <li>On top of all that it couldn&#x27;t even remove all the hair.</li>
            <li>Some people redden more than others</li>
            <li>but Commet seemed to be able to remove it.</li>
            <li>I used to use a different Sally Hansen wax for my armpits that I thought was the best until I tried this on my armpits.  </li>
            <li>This, folks, is way better.</li>
            <li>They discontinued their two best wax hair removal kits: sugar wax and express wax hair removal (white chocolate scented).  </li>
            <li>I just ran out of the wax I bought over 5 years ago (I use it mostly for my eyebrows, but have done my legs a couple of times).</li>
            <li>so had to microwave it more often.    </li>
            <li>It took some practice be able to do it correctly.</li>
            <li>:))</li>
            <li>and I still haven&#x27;t been able to get it off the area I attempted to wax.</li>
            <li>If you like to wax regularly or are just looking for that flawless hairlessness for an event  </li>
            <li>this was one of the most traumatic experiences that either of us have had.</li>
            <li>always make sure you wash waxing area with soap with non moisturizing soap,&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I mostly wax my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice and smooth, and will most often get all the hairs in one swipe.</li>
            <li>This is a feature that I miss from Nair wax in a tub (no longer available on the market), which would just dissolve with warm water, no soap necessary.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li>This wax is great to use for your whole body.</li>
            <li>Make sure you go in the direction of hair growth.</li>
            <li>It sticks more to your skin than your hair.</li>
            <li>I should have been more patient instead of buying the Sally Hansen.</li>
            <li>There are MUCH better waxes out there.  </li>
            <li>My favorite is Nads</li>
            <li>That one works better.</li>
            <li>This is SO MUCH BETTER than those all-in-one wax strips.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and worked ok</li>
            <li>Yes, I know the Azure finishing oil helps to remove the wax, but if you drop any, you&#x27;ll end up using more of the oil to scrape it off your furniture than you would on yourself.</li>
            <li>The wax was very very sticky sort of and it was good that i had placed a newspaper on the slab otherwise</li>
            <li>The wax grips all the hair and my legs just look very clean and shiny after I finish waxing and put the relief oil that comes with it.</li>
            <li>Not to mention the wax has a very pleasant scent, which (in my opinion) is enough of a reason in itself to try it!</li>
            <li>If your skin is too warm then the wax will stick like a paste to your skin and if the wax is too cool it will start to get thicker and sticky and that will remove living skin.   </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s effective and really easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great deal because it goes so far.</li>
            <li>I have found that most of the hot waxes are made to rinse off with soap and warm water.</li>
            <li>Just read the directions and enjoy smooth legs!</li>
            <li>This is one of the most important tips IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re experienced with wax, this is not messy at all.</li>
            <li>Wax works well, smells good, and the oil meant to remove wax, really works.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use, got the hair off perfectly fine, and came off in the shower super easy, with just warm water.</li>
            <li>I dont know if it would work miracles on clothes or other fabrics as well, but its best you dont try to tempt fate!!  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with the results, though, and here are a couple tricks that made it a little more manageable:    </li>
            <li>Well, I finally got a good wax!</li>
            <li>First time I tried and love it!  </li>
            <li>The residue removes easily, and the product is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s honestly really easy.</li>
            <li>Those wax kits were efficient and easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>This one is easy to use and does not harm my skin.</li>
            <li>you need to make sure your skin is taut during application and once the wax is stuck there clean up is not as easy as soap and water.</li>
            <li>This lavender wax does not wash off easily, even after applying the oil provided in the kit.</li>
            <li>I found that applying mineral oil once I&#x27;m done easily cleans up the sticky stuff.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that easy.</li>
            <li>I would reccomend the Nair brazilian formula wax over this that comes in the roll on, that rinses off easily.</li>
            <li>It easily and efficiently got wax off my skin and my glass table.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to used.</li>
            <li>Fairly easy to use, but my skin reacted to this product.  </li>
            <li>I put it in a pot of water on the stove and keep the heat on low/medium to keep it at a nice consistent temperature.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, not bad and it would be a 5 if the wax didn&#x27;t tear a top layer of my skin off.</li>
            <li>good thing about this wax is that, contrary to what a lot of people are saying in their reviews here, it&#x27;s not hard to remove from your skin with the wax strips provided.</li>
            <li>I found this product equally good at removing hair and much easier to clean up afterward.</li>
            <li>is a fine line, but I have found this to be the case with any wax</li>
            <li>just fine</li>
            <li>It degraded quickly too so I had to replace it before I was even able to use the tub up.   </li>
            <li>Very easy and very painless to do!</li>
            <li>First of, I don&#x27;t know what kind of cream this is because in order to get it off of my fingers when I accidentally touched it, I had to use the special oil they included.</li>
            <li>THE BOX MAKES IT SOUND SO FANCY</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t rip off smoothly WHATSOEVER.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.  </li>
            <li>but I still have fantastic results from just the one application per side.  </li>
            <li>What i did not research was this cheap product.</li>
            <li>Have oil and cotton balls to remove the wax available (I use vitamin E oil) and a trash bag to dispose of them and the wax</li>
            <li>My arms are baby smooth.</li>
            <li>If the wax is just pliable enough to spread, it holds itself together much better and gets a good grip on the hair.</li>
            <li>Good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t, this kit is a good investment for at-home waxing or those times when you just can&#x27;t go get a professional one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought 2 right away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to use just a thin layer of the wax, and the best way to do that is to make sure the wax is pretty warm.</li>
            <li>I would have liked more cloth strips, but they&#x27;re easy enough to come by.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy.</li>
            <li>: quick and easy</li>
            <li>The wax was pretty decent - heated up and applied well, had good consistency and a pleasant smell, and was strong enough to remove stubborn and dense hair growth.  </li>
            <li>I normally use oil to take it off (any kind, baby oil, olive oil, shea oil...)</li>
            <li>Anything more than 10, and the wax gets too hot.</li>
            <li>When I did more of my leg, the wax was not as consistent</li>
            <li>Pulls most to all of my hair the first time.</li>
            <li>Ok first of all, it&#x27;s WAX, people.</li>
            <li>(even their own brand new wax that has pain reliever)</li>
            <li>I ended up getting in the shower to shave, clean and soothe my skin.    </li>
            <li>You can use it to clean up your stove, kitchen, skin, whatever.</li>
            <li>So this is the second time I&#x27;ve ever waxed myself and I liked this product a lot more than the ouch-relief wax kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nearly a year later now.... I&#x27;m Increasing the rating for this product from 4 stars to 5 because it seems to be the most effective.</li>
            <li>I literally had to use a bottle of baby oil to clean up.     </li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t wash it off with anything except their \\&quot;special</li>
            <li>The special oil was about the size of a chapstick.</li>
            <li>and it comes right off!  </li>
            <li>This stuff does a good job of removing hair, but as others have noted previously, it is an utter pain to clean up.  </li>
            <li>My legs are bright red and screaming in pain.</li>
            <li>great product, came in the mail a bit crushed though.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Sally Hansen sugar hair removal product for years with good results (almost as good as the much more expensive NADS).</li>
            <li>the person who invented this thing should be full body waxed with this product.</li>
            <li>It took a full 3 minutes for the wax to heat up to a usable consistency, instead of the recommended 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Good thing it was only my legs; supposedly this thing works for bikini, too - that would hurt.</li>
            <li>It worked the way it was, so keep it simple, and don&#x27;t change a good thing.</li>
            <li>Keep the wax relatively COOL.</li>
            <li>Many thanks</li>
            <li>Clean up was a bit of a pain, and the wax seemed to lose temperature and solidify rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>You may have to give it one more go, but it works very well.</li>
            <li>So this kit will last you probably around 6, which I think is good value for cost.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>complete hair removal (I always miss spots), and a nice lady with whom I didn&#x27;t feel embarrassed at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, this is quite good.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and the included oil easily cleans up any extra wax.</li>
            <li>Super Glue was easier to remove from my skin and counter then this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Other then that, pretty good!</li>
            <li>The texture is super sticky.</li>
            <li>Although Sally Hansen has many good products in the market this one is a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li>In local store they do not carry this anymore though I love this kit as it did very clean hair removal.</li>
            <li>This formula is so much better than the new one.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good product for an over the counter wax product for ten dollars.</li>
            <li>Make sure it is clean, neat and that you don&#x27;t have carpeting or clothing in the area where this is going to be used... smooth surfaces only!</li>
            <li>If you want a hot wax don&#x27;t buy this one!</li>
            <li>(Read the directions first of course!)...</li>
            <li>The formula has a pleasant smell and is gentle enough so as not to cause prolonged irritation (you will get redness after the wax, but the oil helps soothe your skin faster).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The first time using it is the easiest as the jar that the wax comes in is clean.  </li>
            <li>Though it can be messy, if you don&#x27;t pay attention to what you are doing, it works great for me.</li>
            <li>The pain was tolerable, but the hassle just wasn&#x27;t worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Liked the product but smaller than I thought</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a buy, and I&#x27;d recommend it to everyone I know.</li>
            <li>This is by far among my favorite wax.</li>
            <li>I had to get this from Amazon because it&#x27;s the only one that takes off the hair effectively.</li>
            <li>The expense of having a professional give you one is sometimes even more painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can just cut tons of strips just the right size for each area.</li>
            <li>so I jumped right in and spread it on the bikini area...</li>
            <li>intervals until it is the right consistency/temperature.</li>
            <li>The right temp.</li>
            <li>(once you have mastered the right temp.).</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>Heat up the wax once, then place it on the warmer and it will keep the right</li>
            <li>Must be scraped off of counters right away to avoid staining cultured marble.  </li>
            <li>It only needs to be moderately hot to be effective.</li>
            <li>This wax is an absolute disaster to clean up.</li>
            <li>the oil included in the kit made for easy cleanup with no residual wax, but didn&#x27;t really matter since the wax didn&#x27;t get much hair off.</li>
            <li>the only wax i would ever recommend to anyone i know, especially women :) effective lasts longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been waxing my legs and bikini area at home for the past couple of months using a cheap grocery store wax ($6) and had a pretty good experience, but I decided to change it and use the Sally Hansen one just to try it out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just read the directions first and you&#x27;re golden.</li>
            <li>The HONEY BARE wax product was much better.  </li>
            <li>take your time and get it right the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The problem is it is VERY VERY VERY STICKY.</li>
            <li>I always sit on the same towel when I wax my legs, and no matter how many times i wash it, the purple stains remain.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time waxing my arms</li>
            <li>I applied the wax exactly how the directions stated, and it still didn&#x27;t even remove all the hair.</li>
            <li>and it saves us so much money instead of going to a salon!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I tried it and it really did work!</li>
            <li>I first used this on my bikini area</li>
            <li>just make sure you use the blue oil to remove the wax, nothing else will remove it.</li>
            <li>The thicker the layer the more likely you are to burn yourself if it is too hot</li>
            <li>To get wax off your skin, first try using an already-used strip.</li>
            <li>Hot water and a kitchen scrubby work</li>
            <li>So, if you get any on your counter top or floor its no big deal.  </li>
            <li>No, spend the extra money and get a better kit.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish there were more cloth strips included with the package.</li>
            <li>(this is what had happened after the first use).  </li>
            <li>compliments of my dad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for the last 5 years and love it, if i dont go to a salon for waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s all I really need to review anyway!  </li>
            <li>so have flip flops or old socks available to slip on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.)</li>
            <li>Painless, all the hair was gone including the roots, and all of the wax pulled off on the first try.</li>
            <li>kit was my first venture into brazilian waxing</li>
            <li>if I&#x27;m going pretty</li>
            <li>first time I tried it out</li>
            <li>If you use this for your eyebrows it work fairly well misses maybe a few hairs every once in a while, but nothing a tweezers cant fix.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think if you&#x27;re dead set on doing this yourself, this kit is a good option.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, except for the little pull-tab on the top of the canister.  </li>
            <li>Apply pressure with clean fingers to area immediately after and press clean part of strip on any excess wax left to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product is a complete NO-NO!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting waxed at salons for years so am very familiar with proper waxing technique.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product, such a high quality wax and works so well!</li>
            <li>Note though that they don&#x27;t send enough muslin strips with the package, it&#x27;s a good idea to grab some extra.</li>
            <li>Shaving irritated my skin too much and hair removal creams didn&#x27;t have the long lasting effect that results from waxing (plus it&#x27;s very messy!).&lt;br /&gt;After trying several brands of home waxing kits, Sally Hansen&#x27;s Lavender kit has become my preferred choice because it has the best value when it comes to price and effectiveness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and this product did not hurt.  </li>
            <li>(I tried rubbing an ice cube on spilled wax à la Real Simple, but it didn&#x27;t peel away easily).     </li>
            <li>Easy solution, purchase craft Popsicle sticks for low cost.</li>
            <li>I thought they were kind of odd to begin with.</li>
            <li>B000BJBGLM GIGI Large Muslin Strips 100-ct.</li>
            <li>If you are doing a large area like your legs you are going to have to reheat the wax</li>
            <li>All things considered, I&#x27;d say that it is certainly a high-quality product.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;ve had experience waxing before, the oil provided does clean up the wax on any non-fabric surfaces easily, 1 jar allows me to wax at least 3-4 times full legs, underarms, and upper lip, because the wax is strong it does grab my hair from the roots and regrowth slower</li>
            <li>It will cool fast so you want it hot, but it is tricky because you obviously don&#x27;t want to use it too hot.</li>
            <li>The oil will get off LITTLE bits and pieces and moisturize your legs really nicely, but it will not take off like 3 inches by 2 inches of wax.</li>
            <li>It ripped a layer of my skin off and now i a huge brown mark on my thigh and welts all over the back of my legs.</li>
            <li>wax does not adhere very well to the strips.&lt;br</li>
            <li>its very gooey and drippy, and applied it.  </li>
            <li>i scrubbed soo much</li>
            <li>The oil that comes with it didn&#x27;t do much really</li>
            <li>i threw it straight into the garbage which is where it belongs.</li>
            <li>Also, because there is so much product I run out of the cloth, which you cut to size.</li>
            <li>I really like this kit.  </li>
            <li>Smells very nice--like Lavender--</li>
            <li>And don&#x27;t use so much wax at once.</li>
            <li>I just apply some to the whole area, press on a waxing strip and rip it all off at once.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Sally Hansen&#x27;s wax products have really declined.  </li>
            <li>, it is very sticky</li>
            <li>Have extra strips available (Nair has them).</li>
            <li>The light purple opaque shade helps with visibility, as one would know if the entire area intended to be waxed</li>
            <li>) Remember to take off as much wax residue</li>
            <li>More than I expected.</li>
            <li>It hurt so much, ripping the skin.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;ve waxed as much</li>
            <li>I think because the wax really does grip the hair and not the skin.</li>
            <li>Heats up in 45 seconds, soft, smooth just a bit messy as most waxes are.  </li>
            <li>This product worked nicely, but was extremely messy and my hand were so sticky when dealing with the product.</li>
            <li>personally think its a good kit, even if other people don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I love the smell compared to some of the other waxes I have tried and I really like the post-waxing oil.</li>
            <li>It hurts more than any other waxing treatment I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Agree with other reviewers who said 30-60 seconds heating time wasn&#x27;t sufficient; I heated for three minutes and probably could&#x27;ve heated a bit more.</li>
            <li>Yes, it works for waxing-- but getting it off skin requires scrubbing with the included oil (had to also use several ounces of grapeseed oil to clean skin).  </li>
            <li>One tub of wax easily lasts through two full waxings (arms AND legs) plus several minor waxes (underarm and face).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Well, his skin was BRIGHT red for FOUR days, then his hair follicles became red and bumpy and his hair started to grow back, FOUR DAYS AFTER WAXING!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think that this was a big issue because my mail box was full</li>
            <li>It is so far from water soluble it is not even funny.</li>
            <li>only area I received a bruise was on the back of my left knee where I had difficulty finding a good position to pull the strip</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, overall, not bad.</li>
            <li>Adequately removes have when done properly.</li>
            <li>Always a classic wax.</li>
            <li>I would highly discourage anyone who wants to buy this product, it&#x27;s such a hassle and the results aren&#x27;t worth the effort.</li>
            <li>Most times you need to wait about 30 seconds, rub again, pull skin tight and remove strip in a quick, parallel motion.</li>
            <li>I highly, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Cleanup is a bit more challenging than other products I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>You must clean the area and dry it well then use baby powder or even a face powder works when applied with a makeup brush.</li>
            <li>in my opinion it does a better job, might be a bit messy but the oil softens the wax and problem</li>
            <li>This is coming from someone who has waxed for years and never complained about pain.</li>
            <li>The wax is heated up the microwave, but it remains pretty much the same consistency.  </li>
            <li>The only good thing was it did remove hair but left me with a bigger mess to clean.</li>
            <li>It gets every hair, and has a pleasant smell to it and it hurts less than any other wax.</li>
            <li>If you wax your legs right you won&#x27;t have any left over wax, also the oil provided in the package soothes the skin and takes away the redness and gets any remaining wax off.</li>
            <li>Learn how to apply the wax in the right direction, and the proper way to pull it off.</li>
            <li>If you like having to scrape wax off your entire bathroom with a metal spatula and have oil poured all over it, go right ahead and buy this product.</li>
            <li>If you apply it properly, and rub the strip a few times before pulling, it comes off clean and almost pain free (for me, at least!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, this is a fabulous product, that as one other reviewer notes, beats spas and salons by 10 country miles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little messy but the results are great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to waxing and bought this for my legs and bikini area.  </li>
            <li>I typically have to reheat the wax 2 or 3 times during the waxing process because I find it most effective when the wax is  somewhat thin.   </li>
            <li>Other than the mess, the wax itself is really good.</li>
            <li>This is honestly my absolute least favorite Sally Hansen product I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li>First apply a layer of powder to the area to keep the wax from sticking to (and possibly pulling off or bruising)</li>
            <li>Work on a small area at a time and cut the strips to an appropriate size.     </li>
            <li>I originally tried other brands.</li>
            <li>I will say, you must be VERY careful when using this product because it is a hassle to clean up.  </li>
            <li>This kit is definitely easiest to use if you get a professional wax first and then just use this every couple of weeks for grooming.</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s very sticky, i prefer it over bare natural.</li>
            <li>The bottle of \\&quot;remover\\&quot; is an unknown substance that was not much bigger than a perfume sample and nowhere near enough to clean up my own legs, much less the rest.    </li>
            <li>What a huge sticky mess this caused in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the oil that comes with it actually does something, or if the wax itself is just more gentle.        </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good wax, but just wear gloves &amp; be careful with it or it will be a complete messy disaster!</li>
            <li>Using a thin layer will not only cut down on this possibility, but will also work more effectively without taking off your skin.</li>
            <li>Now, if you ever plan on using this product more than once (which I&#x27;m assuming most people would,) you&#x27;re going to have a bad time.</li>
            <li>The whole area i waxed ,even after 2 days is still all red and rashy.</li>
            <li>and I had sticky patches left all over my legs that I really had to rub at to get off.</li>
            <li>This one, just like their Brazilian kit were complete disasters.</li>
            <li>It also works well on any area of the body that has hair and works on all of my hair types (both soft and course).</li>
            <li>bought this for my 12yr old daughter.</li>
            <li>she has been waxing (by professional) since she was 10.</li>
            <li>if waxing sensitive areas be cautious as the wax is sticky and if you dont correctly make your skin taught it will hurt and leave bruise</li>
            <li>The label should specify that it&#x27;s a SOFT wax, I was expecting a wax that needed to be melted, would harden, and then rip off.</li>
            <li>So far its either Sally Hansen Spa Body Wax Lavender for me or Shaving</li>
            <li>So far its either Sally Hansen Spa Body Wax Lavender for me or Shaving</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have never had any problems with &amp;#34;breakouts&amp;#34; after using this wax.</li>
            <li>It also works well with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I can say without a doubt that the problem with this product is the strips and not the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this during a move because my professional pot was in storage</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame really; I recommend the regular Sally Hansen wax instead.</li>
            <li>and I consider myself to have a sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>comes with a reasonable number of strips, and several sticks</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m smooth for 2 weeks and definitely need another wax after 4.&lt;br /&gt;-After 3 waxes, I only have 1 strip left.</li>
            <li>if you can afford a professional wax, get one.</li>
            <li>The wax is very glue-like, and does not harden to a solid when it has cooled down.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>The bottom line is, this product is way more trouble than its worth, especially since its about the same price as the other hot waxes out there, and it seems to have the same results.</li>
            <li>Pat the used wax down on the sticky spot, then pull up quickly.</li>
            <li>All waxes, if dripped all over the place, can be messy to clean up after.    </li>
            <li>I would have given it 5 stars if it were easier to clean up abd not so messy.</li>
            <li>(To be extra safe, I usually put the wax jar on a paper plate when I&#x27;m using it, and then any drips do not end up on my counter.)</li>
            <li>I have very course dark hair that grows way to fast.</li>
            <li>Sometimes its not following the directions exactly on the box, sometimes its just waxing properly!</li>
            <li>As for the strips, they&#x27;re a little stiff and they don&#x27;t give you very many.</li>
            <li>Product has really lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li>But sorry, I am not a monkey in a lab and do not need super glue strong wax to take my leg hair off.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other Sally Hansen kits that had different kind of wax that came in a little block that you melt in the microwave.  </li>
            <li>I would say that each jar gives me about 3 waxes-provided that I have enough strips left-although it gets a bit less effective as I get down towards the bottom of the jar &amp; I have to keep reheating to keep it from getting to glue-y.  </li>
            <li>After your skin is clean apply some powder, this will keep your skin from bonding with the wax and you will be less likely to rip your skin off.</li>
            <li>So much that I think I actually ripped some skin off my inner thigh.</li>
            <li>It got all my hair off except the super tiny super thin hairs that no one notices anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little tip is, if you wax and find you have leftovers, next time just spread the wax a little more thinner or don&#x27;t use so much</li>
            <li>Usually home waxes aren&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
            <li>And the way to clean off the excess is to take a q-tip and dip it in the little blue oil.</li>
            <li>I thought I would try the wax and found it to be VERY effective for removing hair but almost impossible to cleanup.</li>
            <li>SO much work, a nightmare to clean up, and frustrating to use.</li>
            <li>I can see how reviewers might complain that it gets messy, but I&#x27;ve never really seen a clean wax!</li>
            <li>But after using it, it&#x27;s clear why the product only costs $9.</li>
            <li>First of all, everyone who is unhappy, there&#x27;s a technique to waxing and that&#x27;s why most people shouldn&#x27;t try it at home.</li>
            <li>It took an hour of scrubbing and massaging with oils and wax remover to get most of it off, at least enough to get dressed, and I was still finding blobs of sticky gummy wax 24 hours later.  </li>
            <li>wax cools too quickly, needing constant reheating in the microwave.&lt;br /&gt;-The wax is extremely difficult to clean up and doesn&#x27;t come off with soap and water as advertised.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not messy, it pulls the hairs out of the root instead of breaking them, and it doesn&#x27;t leave any rash or red spots.</li>
            <li>Naturally Bare Honey Wax Hair Remover for Body Wax Women by Sally Hansen, 1 Count]].  </li>
            <li>wax is not going to last you nearly 8 weeks as advertised</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d go over an area multiple times as professional estheticians do</li>
            <li>Admittedly, waxing your own legs is a messy process, but even with usual precautions, this wax GETS EVERYWHERE AND DOES NOT COME UP.     </li>
            <li>While it is effective at removing unwanted hair from your skin, its diffiiculty in removal otherwise make it a scary product to use.</li>
            <li>First time using it, it got in my hair, on my hands, and it was just a complete mess!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many of the other Sally Hansen products in the past, but this destroyed my skin.</li>
            <li>I find a lot of the other ones are no better but cost more.  </li>
            <li>2.)it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin so I can literally wax right before I walk out the door for a major event without worrying about my eyebrow area from looking raw</li>
            <li>It is SO much less expensive than going to the spa for a leg wax, and it is very effective at removing hair.  </li>
            <li>Wax works well and removes hair cleanly AS LONG AS the wax is warm enough (thin)</li>
            <li>Like it has been stated before, it is a mission to clean up the wax once it&#x27;s spilled on clothing, countertops, or other surfaces; just try to be extra careful when applying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(What a drag getting older.)</li>
            <li>I have been waxing for more than ten years now and have never experienced what I did with this wax.</li>
            <li>The sticks are too thick for getting detailed spots such as eye brows.</li>
            <li>I was left with a lot of extras and broken off hairs that I would have to pluck, also leaving me waxing more frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Thank God tried on small area first!</li>
            <li>so be careful when applying, cools down quickly</li>
            <li>But there is at least one other I like better.  </li>
            <li>You may have a couple of messy waxes at first, but once you get used to it</li>
            <li>I tried this product for the first time a few days ago.</li>
            <li>It is very difficult to manage and good luck getting off of ANYTHING it touches, including your skin.</li>
            <li>Like if the strip left over little pieces of wax I would just go over it with the same strip and it would come right</li>
            <li>I agree that it is a serious pain to clean up--if you get it on any clothes/furniture, etc, forget about it.  </li>
            <li>No only did this product not work in successfully removing hair (about 1 hair in every 50 actually stuck to the wax) but it also left my skin irritated and badly bruised....</li>
            <li>this one is strong enough to remove short or thin hairs without repeat applications.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>it came with in hopes it would help to remove the wax, but thee amount was too little to do much.</li>
            <li>The little traces of the wax on the skin didn&#x27;t go away with soap and water and it was very sticky.</li>

            <li> Very good product.</li>
            <li> The lavender smell is great</li>
            <li> I use mine for brazilians and it works great.</li>
            <li> The azulene oil is great for getting it off your skin, too.</li>
            <li> this is a great product.</li>
            <li> it are not all that great.</li>
            <li> you know the technique of waxing this product is great.</li>
            <li> But baby oil on paper towels or cotton balls works great.</li>
            <li> Great service but package was damaged and the bottle was stuck</li>
            <li> It worked great though, removed the hair very effectively.</li>
            <li> I love it!!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> but it also gives you a bunch of spatulas and some very effective strips.</li>
            <li> It does a very nice job for a store bought kit.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s also so much cheaper if you purchase this delightful item via amazon, which is the best price i&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> The was has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> AND THAT IT SMELLS GOOD AND BLAH BLAH BLAH</li>
            <li> - smells good    </li>
            <li> It took off the hair fairly well</li>
            <li> It is good if used by heating in microwave instead of gas.</li>
            <li> the oil has always done a good job taking the wax off.</li>
            <li> but i used baby oil to clean up the excess wax off my skin and it worked great!</li>
            <li> great for the skin and very easy to use</li>
            <li> It smells great and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t come out easily!!</li>
            <li> but a great tip I learned : USE COFFEE FILTERS from the dollar store  :)</li>
            <li> For this kind of waxing seek a pro (or a talented friend).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The things I love are the smell, the color and that it is very effective when used correctly!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great product, my skin is very sensitive and this wax works just great on my skin, plus I love the lavander scent!!</li>
            <li> For the love of all that is holy, DON&#x27;T buy this product!</li>
            <li> Boy, am I glad I picked this one!</li>
            <li> I would recommend investing in a wax warmer and better wax!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells awesome and it doesn&#x27;t hurt that it looked pretty, too.</li>
            <li> It effectively removes hair and has never irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li> yes, it&#x27;s a bit gooey, but honestly, what microwavable wax won&#x27;t be gooey?    </li>
            <li> I use it before washing my face and before bathing so my face isn&#x27;t too warm.</li>
            <li> so this really is just about you finding that perfect</li>
            <li> If the wax is too warm, it becomes sticky (think bubble gum) and stretches between the cloth strip and your skin when you pull.</li>
            <li> If it looks like frosting, it&#x27;s too warm.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, always works really well.</li>
            <li> The wax heats up nicely in the microwave, so I&#x27;d give it an A+ for convenience.</li>
            <li> you can why the wax is still warm on your skin, with the strips supplied.</li>
            <li> In fact it just stays put even after warm shower and scrub.</li>
            <li> The strips lift the wax off the skin nicely.</li>
            <li> Many times hair length and technique inhibit a good result.</li>
            <li> If you wax figure out what kind works for you and the parts you&#x27;re waxing and avoid the others.</li>
            <li> I always do my own waxing and have never had any issues until I tried this product.</li>
            <li> and it does feel kind of calming and spa-like.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a very strong wax.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very easy to remove.  </li>
            <li> but it comes off very easily with the oil.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most effective hair removal</li>
            <li> I have found.4 stars to 5 because it seems to be the most effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most effective hair removal I have found.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best and easiest waxing kits I&#x27;ve ever purchased and used.</li>
            <li> This is by far a great wax!  </li>
            <li> Very quick delivery!</li>
            <li> and I had to figure out the right temperature, but if you have the right temperature this wax will work perfectly every time without irritation and without removing living skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this waxing system because I liked that it used cloth strips, and came with a pretty good sized jar of wax.</li>
            <li> In Europe I used a cheap $6 waxing kit that did a WAY better job at removing my hair (and keeping it away!)</li>
            <li> What I find perfect about this wax though is that 1.)it lasts because it does not degrade very quickly (in fact I didn&#x27;t find that it degraded at all until I nearly reached the bottom and</li>
            <li> Tossed it out and won&#x27;t buy more.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and im pleased.</li>
            <li> I been buying this product over and over again, works much better than sugar wax,</li>
            <li> I use it on my face an neck mostly.</li>
            <li> this better go away or i&#x27;ll sue.</li>
            <li> On top of all that it couldn&#x27;t even remove all the hair.</li>
            <li> Some people redden more than others</li>
            <li> but Commet seemed to be able to remove it.</li>
            <li> I used to use a different Sally Hansen wax for my armpits that I thought was the best until I tried this on my armpits.  </li>
            <li> This, folks, is way better.</li>
            <li> They discontinued their two best wax hair removal kits: sugar wax and express wax hair removal (white chocolate scented).  </li>
            <li> I just ran out of the wax I bought over 5 years ago (I use it mostly for my eyebrows, but have done my legs a couple of times).</li>
            <li> so had to microwave it more often.    </li>
            <li> It took some practice be able to do it correctly.</li>
            <li> :))</li>
            <li> and I still haven&#x27;t been able to get it off the area I attempted to wax.</li>
            <li> If you like to wax regularly or are just looking for that flawless hairlessness for an event  </li>
            <li> this was one of the most traumatic experiences that either of us have had.</li>
            <li> always make sure you wash waxing area with soap with non moisturizing soap,&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I mostly wax my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It goes on nice and smooth, and will most often get all the hairs in one swipe.</li>
            <li> This is a feature that I miss from Nair wax in a tub (no longer available on the market), which would just dissolve with warm water, no soap necessary.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> This wax is great to use for your whole body.</li>
            <li> Make sure you go in the direction of hair growth.</li>
            <li> It sticks more to your skin than your hair.</li>
            <li> I should have been more patient instead of buying the Sally Hansen.</li>
            <li> There are MUCH better waxes out there.  </li>
            <li> My favorite is Nads</li>
            <li> That one works better.</li>
            <li> This is SO MUCH BETTER than those all-in-one wax strips.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and worked ok</li>
            <li> Yes, I know the Azure finishing oil helps to remove the wax, but if you drop any, you&#x27;ll end up using more of the oil to scrape it off your furniture than you would on yourself.</li>
            <li> The wax was very very sticky sort of and it was good that i had placed a newspaper on the slab otherwise</li>
            <li> The wax grips all the hair and my legs just look very clean and shiny after I finish waxing and put the relief oil that comes with it.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the wax has a very pleasant scent, which (in my opinion) is enough of a reason in itself to try it!</li>
            <li> If your skin is too warm then the wax will stick like a paste to your skin and if the wax is too cool it will start to get thicker and sticky and that will remove living skin.   </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s effective and really easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great deal because it goes so far.</li>
            <li> I have found that most of the hot waxes are made to rinse off with soap and warm water.</li>
            <li> Just read the directions and enjoy smooth legs!</li>
            <li> This is one of the most important tips IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re experienced with wax, this is not messy at all.</li>
            <li> Wax works well, smells good, and the oil meant to remove wax, really works.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use, got the hair off perfectly fine, and came off in the shower super easy, with just warm water.</li>
            <li> I dont know if it would work miracles on clothes or other fabrics as well, but its best you dont try to tempt fate!!  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with the results, though, and here are a couple tricks that made it a little more manageable:    </li>
            <li> Well, I finally got a good wax!</li>
            <li> First time I tried and love it!  </li>
            <li> The residue removes easily, and the product is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s honestly really easy.</li>
            <li> Those wax kits were efficient and easy to remove.  </li>
            <li> This one is easy to use and does not harm my skin.</li>
            <li> you need to make sure your skin is taut during application and once the wax is stuck there clean up is not as easy as soap and water.</li>
            <li> This lavender wax does not wash off easily, even after applying the oil provided in the kit.</li>
            <li> I found that applying mineral oil once I&#x27;m done easily cleans up the sticky stuff.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that easy.</li>
            <li> I would reccomend the Nair brazilian formula wax over this that comes in the roll on, that rinses off easily.</li>
            <li> It easily and efficiently got wax off my skin and my glass table.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to used.</li>
            <li> Fairly easy to use, but my skin reacted to this product.  </li>
            <li> I put it in a pot of water on the stove and keep the heat on low/medium to keep it at a nice consistent temperature.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, not bad and it would be a 5 if the wax didn&#x27;t tear a top layer of my skin off.</li>
            <li> good thing about this wax is that, contrary to what a lot of people are saying in their reviews here, it&#x27;s not hard to remove from your skin with the wax strips provided.</li>
            <li> I found this product equally good at removing hair and much easier to clean up afterward.</li>
            <li> is a fine line, but I have found this to be the case with any wax</li>
            <li> just fine</li>
            <li> It degraded quickly too so I had to replace it before I was even able to use the tub up.   </li>
            <li> Very easy and very painless to do!</li>
            <li> First of, I don&#x27;t know what kind of cream this is because in order to get it off of my fingers when I accidentally touched it, I had to use the special oil they included.</li>
            <li> THE BOX MAKES IT SOUND SO FANCY</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t rip off smoothly WHATSOEVER.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.  </li>
            <li> but I still have fantastic results from just the one application per side.  </li>
            <li> What i did not research was this cheap product.</li>
            <li> Have oil and cotton balls to remove the wax available (I use vitamin E oil) and a trash bag to dispose of them and the wax</li>
            <li> My arms are baby smooth.</li>
            <li> If the wax is just pliable enough to spread, it holds itself together much better and gets a good grip on the hair.</li>
            <li> Good for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t, this kit is a good investment for at-home waxing or those times when you just can&#x27;t go get a professional one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought 2 right away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to use just a thin layer of the wax, and the best way to do that is to make sure the wax is pretty warm.</li>
            <li> I would have liked more cloth strips, but they&#x27;re easy enough to come by.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy.</li>
            <li> : quick and easy</li>
            <li> The wax was pretty decent - heated up and applied well, had good consistency and a pleasant smell, and was strong enough to remove stubborn and dense hair growth.  </li>
            <li> I normally use oil to take it off (any kind, baby oil, olive oil, shea oil...)</li>
            <li> Anything more than 10, and the wax gets too hot.</li>
            <li> When I did more of my leg, the wax was not as consistent</li>
            <li> Pulls most to all of my hair the first time.</li>
            <li> Ok first of all, it&#x27;s WAX, people.</li>
            <li> (even their own brand new wax that has pain reliever)</li>
            <li> I ended up getting in the shower to shave, clean and soothe my skin.    </li>
            <li> You can use it to clean up your stove, kitchen, skin, whatever.</li>
            <li> So this is the second time I&#x27;ve ever waxed myself and I liked this product a lot more than the ouch-relief wax kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nearly a year later now.... I&#x27;m Increasing the rating for this product from 4 stars to 5 because it seems to be the most effective.</li>
            <li> I literally had to use a bottle of baby oil to clean up.     </li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t wash it off with anything except their \\&quot;special</li>
            <li> The special oil was about the size of a chapstick.</li>
            <li> and it comes right off!  </li>
            <li> This stuff does a good job of removing hair, but as others have noted previously, it is an utter pain to clean up.  </li>
            <li> My legs are bright red and screaming in pain.</li>
            <li> great product, came in the mail a bit crushed though.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Sally Hansen sugar hair removal product for years with good results (almost as good as the much more expensive NADS).</li>
            <li> the person who invented this thing should be full body waxed with this product.</li>
            <li> It took a full 3 minutes for the wax to heat up to a usable consistency, instead of the recommended 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Good thing it was only my legs; supposedly this thing works for bikini, too - that would hurt.</li>
            <li> It worked the way it was, so keep it simple, and don&#x27;t change a good thing.</li>
            <li> Keep the wax relatively COOL.</li>
            <li> Many thanks</li>
            <li> Clean up was a bit of a pain, and the wax seemed to lose temperature and solidify rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> You may have to give it one more go, but it works very well.</li>
            <li> So this kit will last you probably around 6, which I think is good value for cost.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> complete hair removal (I always miss spots), and a nice lady with whom I didn&#x27;t feel embarrassed at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, this is quite good.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice and the included oil easily cleans up any extra wax.</li>
            <li> Super Glue was easier to remove from my skin and counter then this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Other then that, pretty good!</li>
            <li> The texture is super sticky.</li>
            <li> Although Sally Hansen has many good products in the market this one is a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> In local store they do not carry this anymore though I love this kit as it did very clean hair removal.</li>
            <li> This formula is so much better than the new one.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product for an over the counter wax product for ten dollars.</li>
            <li> Make sure it is clean, neat and that you don&#x27;t have carpeting or clothing in the area where this is going to be used... smooth surfaces only!</li>
            <li> If you want a hot wax don&#x27;t buy this one!</li>
            <li> (Read the directions first of course!)...</li>
            <li> The formula has a pleasant smell and is gentle enough so as not to cause prolonged irritation (you will get redness after the wax, but the oil helps soothe your skin faster).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The first time using it is the easiest as the jar that the wax comes in is clean.  </li>
            <li> Though it can be messy, if you don&#x27;t pay attention to what you are doing, it works great for me.</li>
            <li> The pain was tolerable, but the hassle just wasn&#x27;t worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Liked the product but smaller than I thought</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a buy, and I&#x27;d recommend it to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> This is by far among my favorite wax.</li>
            <li> I had to get this from Amazon because it&#x27;s the only one that takes off the hair effectively.</li>
            <li> The expense of having a professional give you one is sometimes even more painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can just cut tons of strips just the right size for each area.</li>
            <li> so I jumped right in and spread it on the bikini area...</li>
            <li> intervals until it is the right consistency/temperature.</li>
            <li> The right temp.</li>
            <li> (once you have mastered the right temp.).</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> Heat up the wax once, then place it on the warmer and it will keep the right</li>
            <li> Must be scraped off of counters right away to avoid staining cultured marble.  </li>
            <li> It only needs to be moderately hot to be effective.</li>
            <li> This wax is an absolute disaster to clean up.</li>
            <li> the oil included in the kit made for easy cleanup with no residual wax, but didn&#x27;t really matter since the wax didn&#x27;t get much hair off.</li>
            <li> the only wax i would ever recommend to anyone i know, especially women :) effective lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing my legs and bikini area at home for the past couple of months using a cheap grocery store wax ($6) and had a pretty good experience, but I decided to change it and use the Sally Hansen one just to try it out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just read the directions first and you&#x27;re golden.</li>
            <li> The HONEY BARE wax product was much better.  </li>
            <li> take your time and get it right the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The problem is it is VERY VERY VERY STICKY.</li>
            <li> I always sit on the same towel when I wax my legs, and no matter how many times i wash it, the purple stains remain.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time waxing my arms</li>
            <li> I applied the wax exactly how the directions stated, and it still didn&#x27;t even remove all the hair.</li>
            <li> and it saves us so much money instead of going to a salon!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I tried it and it really did work!</li>
            <li> I first used this on my bikini area</li>
            <li> just make sure you use the blue oil to remove the wax, nothing else will remove it.</li>
            <li> The thicker the layer the more likely you are to burn yourself if it is too hot</li>
            <li> To get wax off your skin, first try using an already-used strip.</li>
            <li> Hot water and a kitchen scrubby work</li>
            <li> So, if you get any on your counter top or floor its no big deal.  </li>
            <li> No, spend the extra money and get a better kit.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish there were more cloth strips included with the package.</li>
            <li> (this is what had happened after the first use).  </li>
            <li> compliments of my dad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for the last 5 years and love it, if i dont go to a salon for waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s all I really need to review anyway!  </li>
            <li> so have flip flops or old socks available to slip on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.)</li>
            <li> Painless, all the hair was gone including the roots, and all of the wax pulled off on the first try.</li>
            <li> kit was my first venture into brazilian waxing</li>
            <li> if I&#x27;m going pretty</li>
            <li> first time I tried it out</li>
            <li> If you use this for your eyebrows it work fairly well misses maybe a few hairs every once in a while, but nothing a tweezers cant fix.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think if you&#x27;re dead set on doing this yourself, this kit is a good option.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, except for the little pull-tab on the top of the canister.  </li>
            <li> Apply pressure with clean fingers to area immediately after and press clean part of strip on any excess wax left to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product is a complete NO-NO!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting waxed at salons for years so am very familiar with proper waxing technique.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product, such a high quality wax and works so well!</li>
            <li> Note though that they don&#x27;t send enough muslin strips with the package, it&#x27;s a good idea to grab some extra.</li>
            <li> Shaving irritated my skin too much and hair removal creams didn&#x27;t have the long lasting effect that results from waxing (plus it&#x27;s very messy!).&lt;br /&gt;After trying several brands of home waxing kits, Sally Hansen&#x27;s Lavender kit has become my preferred choice because it has the best value when it comes to price and effectiveness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and this product did not hurt.  </li>
            <li> (I tried rubbing an ice cube on spilled wax à la Real Simple, but it didn&#x27;t peel away easily).     </li>
            <li> Easy solution, purchase craft Popsicle sticks for low cost.</li>
            <li> I thought they were kind of odd to begin with.</li>
            <li> B000BJBGLM GIGI Large Muslin Strips 100-ct.</li>
            <li> If you are doing a large area like your legs you are going to have to reheat the wax</li>
            <li> All things considered, I&#x27;d say that it is certainly a high-quality product.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;ve had experience waxing before, the oil provided does clean up the wax on any non-fabric surfaces easily, 1 jar allows me to wax at least 3-4 times full legs, underarms, and upper lip, because the wax is strong it does grab my hair from the roots and regrowth slower</li>
            <li> It will cool fast so you want it hot, but it is tricky because you obviously don&#x27;t want to use it too hot.</li>
            <li> The oil will get off LITTLE bits and pieces and moisturize your legs really nicely, but it will not take off like 3 inches by 2 inches of wax.</li>
            <li> It ripped a layer of my skin off and now i a huge brown mark on my thigh and welts all over the back of my legs.</li>
            <li> wax does not adhere very well to the strips.&lt;br</li>
            <li> its very gooey and drippy, and applied it.  </li>
            <li> i scrubbed soo much</li>
            <li> The oil that comes with it didn&#x27;t do much really</li>
            <li> i threw it straight into the garbage which is where it belongs.</li>
            <li> Also, because there is so much product I run out of the cloth, which you cut to size.</li>
            <li> I really like this kit.  </li>
            <li> Smells very nice--like Lavender--</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t use so much wax at once.</li>
            <li> I just apply some to the whole area, press on a waxing strip and rip it all off at once.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Sally Hansen&#x27;s wax products have really declined.  </li>
            <li> , it is very sticky</li>
            <li> Have extra strips available (Nair has them).</li>
            <li> The light purple opaque shade helps with visibility, as one would know if the entire area intended to be waxed</li>
            <li> ) Remember to take off as much wax residue</li>
            <li> More than I expected.</li>
            <li> It hurt so much, ripping the skin.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;ve waxed as much</li>
            <li> I think because the wax really does grip the hair and not the skin.</li>
            <li> Heats up in 45 seconds, soft, smooth just a bit messy as most waxes are.  </li>
            <li> This product worked nicely, but was extremely messy and my hand were so sticky when dealing with the product.</li>
            <li> personally think its a good kit, even if other people don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I love the smell compared to some of the other waxes I have tried and I really like the post-waxing oil.</li>
            <li> It hurts more than any other waxing treatment I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Agree with other reviewers who said 30-60 seconds heating time wasn&#x27;t sufficient; I heated for three minutes and probably could&#x27;ve heated a bit more.</li>
            <li> Yes, it works for waxing-- but getting it off skin requires scrubbing with the included oil (had to also use several ounces of grapeseed oil to clean skin).  </li>
            <li> One tub of wax easily lasts through two full waxings (arms AND legs) plus several minor waxes (underarm and face).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Well, his skin was BRIGHT red for FOUR days, then his hair follicles became red and bumpy and his hair started to grow back, FOUR DAYS AFTER WAXING!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that this was a big issue because my mail box was full</li>
            <li> It is so far from water soluble it is not even funny.</li>
            <li> only area I received a bruise was on the back of my left knee where I had difficulty finding a good position to pull the strip</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, overall, not bad.</li>
            <li> Adequately removes have when done properly.</li>
            <li> Always a classic wax.</li>
            <li> I would highly discourage anyone who wants to buy this product, it&#x27;s such a hassle and the results aren&#x27;t worth the effort.</li>
            <li> Most times you need to wait about 30 seconds, rub again, pull skin tight and remove strip in a quick, parallel motion.</li>
            <li> I highly, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Cleanup is a bit more challenging than other products I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> You must clean the area and dry it well then use baby powder or even a face powder works when applied with a makeup brush.</li>
            <li> in my opinion it does a better job, might be a bit messy but the oil softens the wax and problem</li>
            <li> This is coming from someone who has waxed for years and never complained about pain.</li>
            <li> The wax is heated up the microwave, but it remains pretty much the same consistency.  </li>
            <li> The only good thing was it did remove hair but left me with a bigger mess to clean.</li>
            <li> It gets every hair, and has a pleasant smell to it and it hurts less than any other wax.</li>
            <li> If you wax your legs right you won&#x27;t have any left over wax, also the oil provided in the package soothes the skin and takes away the redness and gets any remaining wax off.</li>
            <li> Learn how to apply the wax in the right direction, and the proper way to pull it off.</li>
            <li> If you like having to scrape wax off your entire bathroom with a metal spatula and have oil poured all over it, go right ahead and buy this product.</li>
            <li> If you apply it properly, and rub the strip a few times before pulling, it comes off clean and almost pain free (for me, at least!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, this is a fabulous product, that as one other reviewer notes, beats spas and salons by 10 country miles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little messy but the results are great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to waxing and bought this for my legs and bikini area.  </li>
            <li> I typically have to reheat the wax 2 or 3 times during the waxing process because I find it most effective when the wax is  somewhat thin.   </li>
            <li> Other than the mess, the wax itself is really good.</li>
            <li> This is honestly my absolute least favorite Sally Hansen product I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> First apply a layer of powder to the area to keep the wax from sticking to (and possibly pulling off or bruising)</li>
            <li> Work on a small area at a time and cut the strips to an appropriate size.     </li>
            <li> I originally tried other brands.</li>
            <li> I will say, you must be VERY careful when using this product because it is a hassle to clean up.  </li>
            <li> This kit is definitely easiest to use if you get a professional wax first and then just use this every couple of weeks for grooming.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s very sticky, i prefer it over bare natural.</li>
            <li> The bottle of \\&quot;remover\\&quot; is an unknown substance that was not much bigger than a perfume sample and nowhere near enough to clean up my own legs, much less the rest.    </li>
            <li> What a huge sticky mess this caused in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the oil that comes with it actually does something, or if the wax itself is just more gentle.        </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good wax, but just wear gloves &amp; be careful with it or it will be a complete messy disaster!</li>
            <li> Using a thin layer will not only cut down on this possibility, but will also work more effectively without taking off your skin.</li>
            <li> Now, if you ever plan on using this product more than once (which I&#x27;m assuming most people would,) you&#x27;re going to have a bad time.</li>
            <li> The whole area i waxed ,even after 2 days is still all red and rashy.</li>
            <li> and I had sticky patches left all over my legs that I really had to rub at to get off.</li>
            <li> This one, just like their Brazilian kit were complete disasters.</li>
            <li> It also works well on any area of the body that has hair and works on all of my hair types (both soft and course).</li>
            <li> bought this for my 12yr old daughter.</li>
            <li> she has been waxing (by professional) since she was 10.</li>
            <li> if waxing sensitive areas be cautious as the wax is sticky and if you dont correctly make your skin taught it will hurt and leave bruise</li>
            <li> The label should specify that it&#x27;s a SOFT wax, I was expecting a wax that needed to be melted, would harden, and then rip off.</li>
            <li> So far its either Sally Hansen Spa Body Wax Lavender for me or Shaving</li>
            <li> So far its either Sally Hansen Spa Body Wax Lavender for me or Shaving</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have never had any problems with &amp;#34;breakouts&amp;#34; after using this wax.</li>
            <li> It also works well with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I can say without a doubt that the problem with this product is the strips and not the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this during a move because my professional pot was in storage</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame really; I recommend the regular Sally Hansen wax instead.</li>
            <li> and I consider myself to have a sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> comes with a reasonable number of strips, and several sticks</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m smooth for 2 weeks and definitely need another wax after 4.&lt;br /&gt;-After 3 waxes, I only have 1 strip left.</li>
            <li> if you can afford a professional wax, get one.</li>
            <li> The wax is very glue-like, and does not harden to a solid when it has cooled down.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> The bottom line is, this product is way more trouble than its worth, especially since its about the same price as the other hot waxes out there, and it seems to have the same results.</li>
            <li> Pat the used wax down on the sticky spot, then pull up quickly.</li>
            <li> All waxes, if dripped all over the place, can be messy to clean up after.    </li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars if it were easier to clean up abd not so messy.</li>
            <li> (To be extra safe, I usually put the wax jar on a paper plate when I&#x27;m using it, and then any drips do not end up on my counter.)</li>
            <li> I have very course dark hair that grows way to fast.</li>
            <li> Sometimes its not following the directions exactly on the box, sometimes its just waxing properly!</li>
            <li> As for the strips, they&#x27;re a little stiff and they don&#x27;t give you very many.</li>
            <li> Product has really lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li> But sorry, I am not a monkey in a lab and do not need super glue strong wax to take my leg hair off.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Sally Hansen kits that had different kind of wax that came in a little block that you melt in the microwave.  </li>
            <li> I would say that each jar gives me about 3 waxes-provided that I have enough strips left-although it gets a bit less effective as I get down towards the bottom of the jar &amp; I have to keep reheating to keep it from getting to glue-y.  </li>
            <li> After your skin is clean apply some powder, this will keep your skin from bonding with the wax and you will be less likely to rip your skin off.</li>
            <li> So much that I think I actually ripped some skin off my inner thigh.</li>
            <li> It got all my hair off except the super tiny super thin hairs that no one notices anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little tip is, if you wax and find you have leftovers, next time just spread the wax a little more thinner or don&#x27;t use so much</li>
            <li> Usually home waxes aren&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
            <li> And the way to clean off the excess is to take a q-tip and dip it in the little blue oil.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try the wax and found it to be VERY effective for removing hair but almost impossible to cleanup.</li>
            <li> SO much work, a nightmare to clean up, and frustrating to use.</li>
            <li> I can see how reviewers might complain that it gets messy, but I&#x27;ve never really seen a clean wax!</li>
            <li> But after using it, it&#x27;s clear why the product only costs $9.</li>
            <li> First of all, everyone who is unhappy, there&#x27;s a technique to waxing and that&#x27;s why most people shouldn&#x27;t try it at home.</li>
            <li> It took an hour of scrubbing and massaging with oils and wax remover to get most of it off, at least enough to get dressed, and I was still finding blobs of sticky gummy wax 24 hours later.  </li>
            <li> wax cools too quickly, needing constant reheating in the microwave.&lt;br /&gt;-The wax is extremely difficult to clean up and doesn&#x27;t come off with soap and water as advertised.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not messy, it pulls the hairs out of the root instead of breaking them, and it doesn&#x27;t leave any rash or red spots.</li>
            <li> Naturally Bare Honey Wax Hair Remover for Body Wax Women by Sally Hansen, 1 Count]].  </li>
            <li> wax is not going to last you nearly 8 weeks as advertised</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d go over an area multiple times as professional estheticians do</li>
            <li> Admittedly, waxing your own legs is a messy process, but even with usual precautions, this wax GETS EVERYWHERE AND DOES NOT COME UP.     </li>
            <li> While it is effective at removing unwanted hair from your skin, its diffiiculty in removal otherwise make it a scary product to use.</li>
            <li> First time using it, it got in my hair, on my hands, and it was just a complete mess!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many of the other Sally Hansen products in the past, but this destroyed my skin.</li>
            <li> I find a lot of the other ones are no better but cost more.  </li>
            <li> 2.)it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin so I can literally wax right before I walk out the door for a major event without worrying about my eyebrow area from looking raw</li>
            <li> It is SO much less expensive than going to the spa for a leg wax, and it is very effective at removing hair.  </li>
            <li> Wax works well and removes hair cleanly AS LONG AS the wax is warm enough (thin)</li>
            <li> Like it has been stated before, it is a mission to clean up the wax once it&#x27;s spilled on clothing, countertops, or other surfaces; just try to be extra careful when applying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (What a drag getting older.)</li>
            <li> I have been waxing for more than ten years now and have never experienced what I did with this wax.</li>
            <li> The sticks are too thick for getting detailed spots such as eye brows.</li>
            <li> I was left with a lot of extras and broken off hairs that I would have to pluck, also leaving me waxing more frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Thank God tried on small area first!</li>
            <li> so be careful when applying, cools down quickly</li>
            <li> But there is at least one other I like better.  </li>
            <li> You may have a couple of messy waxes at first, but once you get used to it</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time a few days ago.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to manage and good luck getting off of ANYTHING it touches, including your skin.</li>
            <li> Like if the strip left over little pieces of wax I would just go over it with the same strip and it would come right</li>
            <li> I agree that it is a serious pain to clean up--if you get it on any clothes/furniture, etc, forget about it.  </li>
            <li> No only did this product not work in successfully removing hair (about 1 hair in every 50 actually stuck to the wax) but it also left my skin irritated and badly bruised....</li>
            <li> this one is strong enough to remove short or thin hairs without repeat applications.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> it came with in hopes it would help to remove the wax, but thee amount was too little to do much.</li>
            <li> The little traces of the wax on the skin didn&#x27;t go away with soap and water and it was very sticky.</li>
            <li> While you can clean some of it off of hard surfaces, be extremely careful not to get the wax on any cloth objects.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had such a poor experience trying to clean up after waxing.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions carefully and was left with a huge mess and little hair removal.</li>
            <li> My skin was raw from scrubbing it off and that barely accomplished anything.</li>
            <li> and they do last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will keep purchasing  so long as someone is still selling my next time around.</li>
            <li> I used about half of the jar of wax and half of the azulene oil for my first attempt.</li>
            <li> Not only was it EXTREMELY EXTREMELY STICKY, (good for legs, bad for hands) but the wax starts hardening in about 2 minutes....</li>
            <li> few tips for anyone new to using this product,</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I&#x27;ve used almost half my wax for 3 brazilians so far.</li>
            <li> I went to European Wax Center and got waxed by a professional for about half what local waxers cost</li>
            <li> Even after heating the wax in the microwave to become completely liquid(which helps with application and reduces waste), the wax does not become dangerously hot, as is common with transparent wax</li>
            <li> There are much better wax kits (like Nair) that are so much easier and less painful to remove with just some water.</li>
            <li> I bought this product only because it was the last one, out of other brands I prefer, that was on the shelf.  </li>
            <li> and I constantly had to re-heat it only to make a bigger mess.</li>
            <li> I will buy this again and again as long as they continue to sell it.</li>
            <li> WEEKS LATER I&#x27;ve carried specks of it to the couch {from unknown bits on the floor?}</li>
            <li> I am no professional with waxing</li>
            <li> Then hold down your skin and pull in the opposite direction of the hair growth (as close to your skin as possible).</li>
            <li> Not only was it the worst pain ever, it also left most of the wax on my skin and didn&#x27;t remove much of my hair.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, i was left with hair in tact, a red rash and a sticky mess to clean up.  </li>
            <li> If the wax gets too sticky or starts to thicken reheat it before proceeding because I have found that when the wax takes your skin off it is because it is not hot enough.</li>
            <li> They provide an oil to take it off the skin but the quantity is not enough and it doesnt work on other surfaces like countertops.</li>
            <li> Too Long Of A Wait!</li>
            <li> Too Long Of A Wait!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other waxes and they&#x27;re never quite substantial enough to get my armpit hair.</li>
            <li> The strips are very wide so for smaller areas</li>
            <li> For some reason this one wouldn&#x27;t harden or dry.</li>
            <li> Well the wax won&#x27;t dry (it&#x27;s suppose to harden</li>
            <li> I got purple wax all over the place, and it&#x27;s really difficult to clean up.</li>
            <li> The wax takes much longer than 30 seconds to even move it around the jar, in addition to how ridiculously sticky it is.</li>
            <li> my sister &amp; I use it all the time (we have pretty dark &amp; thick hair)</li>
            <li> The wax is extremely sticky, yet seems to only remove a very limited amount of hair.</li>
            <li> I had to microwave it for a total of 60 sec at 30 sec then at interval of 10 sec</li>
            <li> First of all, when I opened the package, the box that you see in the picture was all mangled up like someone had broken into it.</li>
            <li> oil is the only thing that will break down wax.</li>
            <li> bought this kit at my local CVS because my skin literally cannot handle shaving down there.</li>
            <li> i heated it, applied it to my legs and it wouldnt come off, the strip would only pick up half the wax and the rest remained stuck to my skin.</li>
            <li> half a bottle of pharmacy alcohol and an hour of rubbing left a residue which took a week to disappear.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I had the same outcome as the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> It ended up being a big gummy mess.  </li>
            <li> Super inconvenient to use because there&#x27;s wax coating the outside of the jar.</li>
            <li> finishing oil doesn&#x27;t really help much; I mean, it makes the wax on my legs less sticky, but the wax is still on them even after scrubbing at it with a cotton ball and the oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know you&#x27;re supposed to do a little at a time with the armpits because the hairs all grow in different directions.  </li>
            <li> Most of the bad reviews will be from people who have misused the product.</li>
            <li> have everything ready (jar, strips, scissors for cutting strips as needed, foil, application stick, and oil prior to starting</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried sugar waxes and pre-waxed strips, this is the only wax that really removes the hair without fail.</li>
            <li> It works as expected.</li>
            <li> So be careful.</li>
            <li> I spent another 30 getting it out of my sink.  </li>
            <li> My microwave is weaker than some, so instead of heating it for 30 sec.</li>
            <li> I did it for 40 sec and waited a minute before using it, just like the directions said.   </li>
            <li> to start and then at 30 sec.</li>
            <li> so be careful.</li>
            <li> The Gigi one got harder faster</li>
            <li> Wax should be heated for a few seconds only.</li>
            <li> so u know it&#x27;s closed and store the container in an upright position.e Muslin Strips 100-ct.</li>
            <li> so u know it&#x27;s closed and store the container in an upright position.</li>
            <li> and Expected for the price.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to get ANY of the wax on your fingers and use gloves.</li>
            <li> I heated up the wax for about 30 sec and it kept hardening up.</li>
            <li> You want a harder wax for that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for roughly 10 years on my brows and bikini line.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many of Sally Hansen&#x27;s home waxing kits and they seem to get worse and worse.</li>
            <li> The only thing that will take off excess wax is the azulene oil that is included in the kit, and they only provide you with a very small bottle of it.</li>
            <li> It was so messy, so sticky and so ineffective that I actually came online specifically to warn other people off this product.</li>
            <li> My complaints about this product are that it is pretty hard to find, there aren&#x27;t enough strips and the removal oil is not great.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I am inept in the waxing process, but for the second time I&#x27;ve been left with some pretty ugly bruising.</li>
            <li> and the cherry on top of the cake was the massive ugly unsightly bruise it left behind....</li>
            <li> When I put the cloth strips I used and the wash cloths in the washer, the wax got all over the washer and on every other piece of clothing in there.</li>
            <li> I generally like Sally Hansen products but have to concur with the other negative reviews here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other waxing products and never anything so nightmarish as this.</li>
            <li> In a moment of extreme confidence, I picked up this kit with plans for a DIY Brazilian while my husband is away at a conference.</li>
            <li> I have never had this problem with any other wax products.</li>
            <li> I have to say about the other review</li>
            <li> After using this product, I cannot use any other product.</li>
            <li> do to EXTREME ingrown hairs and irritation.</li>
            <li> This product was a big waste of money!</li>
            <li> Compared to other brands (like Nair&#x27;s microwavable wax)</li>
            <li> The product is EXTREMELY sticky and you cannot wash it off with soap or water.</li>
            <li> Yes it is sticky, but it works extremely well.</li>
            <li> I usually buy extra cloth strips as well.</li>
            <li> No need to repeat waxing on any area, this seems to be an issue with other products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> The other products I&#x27;ve tried leave hairs.</li>
            <li> Get strips other then from the kit.</li>
            <li> Ruined the other parts of the kit.</li>
            <li> I often see red bumps, but they go away after 1 day usually.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have mentioned that it&#x27;s not water soluble.</li>
            <li> I recommend to other to try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very messy even for me that I wax myself regularly.</li>
            <li> The only drawbacks that I noticed were that the wax can be a bit on the messy side, and it goes cold a little quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyone who buys this kit should make sure to do a few things, because a lot of these bad reviews are also from user error.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> I also used to be annoyed about having to run back to the microwave during waxing, but that was finally solved by placing the wax tub on a candle jar warmer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit surprised by all the negative reviews!</li>
            <li> The mess this product creates is definitely NOT worth the money I spent or the aggravation.</li>
            <li> i would have been very difficult for me to clean.</li>
            <li> It never even got hard enough to pick, pull, or scrape it off.</li>
            <li> Instead, they have to try to keep improving it, and to them that means making it as sticky and hard to remove as possible.</li>
            <li> I personally recommend SurgiWax hard wax.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also getting very difficult to find in stores as most brands are now creating just hard wax, which I&#x27;m not used to using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One jar of the product lasts me over a year, and I have to do my lip and middle brow at least every month.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was tired of shaving not having long enough effects.  </li>
            <li> since the formula is so thick, of course you would have to scrape the excess wax off of the wooden sticks provided to apply the wax, meaning excess wax accumulates on the rim of the jar.</li>
            <li> It does remove most of the hair, but it is impossible to get off of your skin!  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even remove half of it.</li>
            <li> Because you are ripping the hair follicle out and drawing the blood up to the surface--in other words--the waxed area turning red is common!  </li>
            <li> There will be less hair to pull up, making it a lot easier for you.</li>
            <li> I bought this product without reading its review, previously i had used sally hansen</li>
            <li> So when I remove my pants for bed, I&#x27;ll find black fuzzy splotches all over my leg where the pants material has stuck to the remaining wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cut them in half.    </li>
            <li> I have already gone through half the bottle of finishing oil just cleaning up my skin from ONE application.</li>
            <li> Half of the tub used and the strips are all gone.</li>
            <li> Received half the wax I paid for.</li>
            <li> I consider my hair growth to be normal-maybe slightly accelerated</li>
            <li> It ends up staying on your skin as as a sticky purple mess.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t do it all the time because it is a mess and a lot of work</li>
            <li> Also it is a mess</li>
            <li> It missed a lot of hair, and made the biggest mess.</li>
            <li> as I have you get pretty numb</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be a mess afterward</li>
            <li> Results in a mess, with no hair removal.</li>
            <li> even when I pulled the skin tight and removed as instructed.</li>
            <li> The wax residue was so difficult to get off; they provide an extra bottle of some strange smelling liquid to help remove the wax afterwards, but it doesn&#x27;t work well at all</li>
            <li> The ones included are large, wide, and almost impossible to use to spread wax on your eyebrow area.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Regarding pain, it can hurt quite a bit, but no more than other waxing systems I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten it off of glass, my skin/ nails, and a ceramic counter by pouring on a little wax and then rubbing it off with my hands/ scratching it off with my nail.  </li>
            <li> Just pour a little bit into the palm of your hand, rub your hands together and rub your hands where it&#x27;s still sticky.</li>
            <li> I have used Nads which worked, but the problem with it was that if you compromised the gel in any way--meaning you got a little oil from your skin or maybe a little water in it</li>
            <li> , I couldnt even get it out of the sink when I dripped a little.</li>
            <li> It is a pain to get off counter tops, but a little oil and a razor blade</li>
            <li> I dabbed a little between two fingers and rubbed it in the area I waxed and that does the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyway, I used a little baby powder and that made the bikini line easier to deal with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little messy, but you get the hang of it after a while.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t overheat the wax and don&#x27;t continue to use it when it cools down and gets thicker.. reheat!</li>
            <li> I have very dark course hair</li>
            <li> It is a bit messy though</li>
            <li> DONT WASTE UR MONEY.</li>
            <li> this is why I do it when I have no where to go afterwards for a few hours), ask any beautician...</li>
            <li> each before it was thin enough to be applicable.</li>
            <li> but it got too messy for me</li>
            <li> Well I must just be impatient</li>
            <li> I have been using home-waxing kits for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few products and settled with Nair sugar-based wax -</li>
            <li> I have been waxing my underarms and bikini area for years now and never have I had this much trouble with any wax I used.</li>
            <li> It was soo messy and sticky.</li>
            <li> Really messy</li>
            <li> Really messy</li>
            <li> bcuz I always seemed to miss a few hair when shaving.</li>
            <li> But after a few coats it did remove the hair.    </li>
            <li> MESSY.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find the wax to be messy because you have to swirl the stick to break off the stringy wax coming out of the container and also after placing it on the skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this wax product for a few years now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any trouble with it</li>
            <li> but it is messy.  </li>
            <li> Of course wax is going to be messy.</li>
            <li> When getting wax out of the jar, pull the stick out and twirl it around a few times before applying.</li>
            <li> nail polish remover and a little elbow grease will remove spills from counters and other hard surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing that it&#x27;s going to be pretty much impossible to get the wax off.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few hot wax products as well, and I have to say that this one is by far the worst one ever!    </li>
            <li> I used a plain non fusible interfacing tonight.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> But after the first use, the wax gets all over the outside of the container, the lid becomes impossible to screw back on because wax gets onto the rim of the container, and it is nearly impossible NOT to get bits of the wax all over everything.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this one in the past and it didn&#x27;t give me hard time, I was trying to save $2 because the other version &amp;#34;Brazilian strength&amp;#34; was $10</li>
            <li> I thought that maybe it was particularly bad for him because it was his first time waxing.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because this was my first time waxing, but it was rather painful, not to mention clumps of wax would not come off with the strip.</li>
            <li> If you find you are getting wax all over, SLOW DOWN.</li>
            <li> And now I&#x27;m left with skin so irritated I can&#x27;t even shave (in the middle of summer) because half of the skin on my legs is gone :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nads and other cold wax products similar to that.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, trust me!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past 2 years, I like it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste it on your countertop!</li>
            <li> I have to say, after having used Gigi for the past 4 or so years, I have now switched to this product.</li>
            <li> For some small spots, even soap and water can be used to take it off.</li>
            <li> its wax and wax is messy!</li>
            <li> Not sure what made me choose it,</li>
            <li> Tip: If you buy Sally Hansen wax in the store, there is usually a coupon included inside the box.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I had a lot of problems with it, and I was only using it on my armpits and still couldn&#x27;t get it to work.</li>
            <li> Not 5 stars because it&#x27;s not removeable without the oil as some water soluble waxes I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> oil that comes with the kit works miracles and don&#x27;t be fooled by the small vial of it.</li>
            <li> If you are new to waxing you&#x27;re likely to have a horrific mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to put the towel I used in the wash for fear of finding those little bits on future loads of laundry.</li>
            <li> Other waxes seem to just tear at my skin and leave hair behind.</li>
            <li> The directions say to use a thin layer of wax; obviously I don&#x27;t know what thin is because when I use the strips, I end up pulling off SOME of the wax and no hair and the strip</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find my usual SurgiWax Brazilian hard wax  </li>
            <li> my skin was raw!  </li>
            <li> Plus, it was really hard to spread on my skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since using this product I&#x27;ve tried honey waxing and hard waxes</li>
            <li> It was hard to remove even with the oil provided.</li>
            <li> shut had hard time opening.</li>
            <li> It was not as painful as I expected for a wax product, but left behind a sticky purple residue that would not come off with the oil included in the kit or soap and water.  </li>
            <li> Pay to get waxed at a salon at least once and watch the technique.</li>
            <li> at least once</li>
            <li> (at least that&#x27;s what worked for me), and get to waxin&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I use this product for my lip, between brows, and on the sides of my face where the hair is a bit too thick.</li>
            <li> Also don&#x27;t apply too thick of wax or the strip</li>
            <li> unless you have really really slow hair growth.</li>
            <li> This product is thick and does NOT DISSOLVE with soap and water.  </li>
            <li> No more going to the spa!</li>
            <li> This is usually the state when it is soupy/watery looking like a thin gravy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also had laser hair removal done, so have a very small amount of hair to wax at this point.</li>
            <li> I also feel it&#x27;s less painful that other thinner wax.</li>
            <li> This item is less painful than other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Then I was left with sticky bits of wax stuck to my skin that are nearly impossible to remove.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve got some serious hair.</li>
            <li> It reminded me of when a glob of super sticky bubble gum gets ground into hair and requires a buzz cut with one nasty twist, it won&#x27;t come off the skin either.  </li>
            <li> Accidentally dripped some on my arm, and we had to SHAVE it out because it is like some horrible super sticky cement.</li>
            <li> SO overall it PAINFUL.</li>
            <li> The single WORST product i have ever used in my entire life.  </li>
            <li> Regardless of how thick or thin I spread on the wax, it did a poor job and the paper strips did not remove all the wax from my skin.  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this product, and I think I would rather save my money to spend on a professional waxing than this useless product.</li>
            <li> For those concerned, my daughter has a condition that caused her to grow very thick pubic hair when she was 3.</li>
            <li> I also find it to not be irritating at all--</li>
            <li> The worst part is that it is so sticky and tacky that it didn&#x27;t really remove the hair.  </li>
            <li> I use craft sticks to apply a thin layer of wax onto the area to be treated.</li>
            <li> Now don&#x27;t be confused</li>
            <li> I like all the other bad reviews</li>
            <li> It did remove all the hair but it was little painful</li>
            <li> so finding a wax that will do the job without irritating my skin is difficult.</li>
            <li> Beware, this wax is extremely painful, useless and messy.</li>
            <li> Very dumb i know.</li>
            <li> Wax is too sticky, does not apply evenly, extremely painful to use, and hard to remove once you&#x27;re finished.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while--and it is getting increasingly difficult to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> that might teach him/her not to foist disgusting stuff on the unsuspecting public.</li>
            <li> Yes the residue (I&#x27;m talking about the left over after you pull the strip off) is the worst part...</li>
            <li> is then useless.  </li>
            <li> had splotches everywhere on my legs and was unable to scrape it off.</li>
            <li> Now I believed it was something I did wrong and not the product</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re weird and don&#x27;t seem to grip the wax.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In and outin 15 minutes (waxing myself takes a labored 30-45 if I&#x27;m being picky about getting it all), little to no pain (waxing myself hurts really bad!),</li>
            <li> Also, the mess is insane.  </li>
            <li> and I found some cold wax strips that were a lot easier to apply.  </li>
            <li> Crazy?</li>
            <li> I tried all kinds of soap and wash clothes, a horrible mess!</li>
            <li> The wax is way to sticky, the strip removed two strands of hair and the wax was very difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s impossible to use without getting it all over everything.</li>
            <li> The wax was impossible to remove from my skin.</li>
            <li> It has become impossible to find it in the stores, so I tried the Sally Hansen version instead.</li>
            <li> This product is impossible to wash off once applied.  </li>
            <li> This is a really  BAD wax.</li>
            <li> Painful?</li>
            <li> in a painful, painful way.</li>
            <li> Brazilian waxes are painful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still painful</li>
            <li> so I knew it was gonna be painful for him</li>
            <li> This crap will not come off of my skin.</li>
            <li> this was a scene from a bloody horror movie.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> i had to keep microwaving it that i got soo sick of it and just threw it away!!  </li>
            <li> Its horrible!!!!</li>
            <li> its awful.</li>
            <li> It is the WORST thing I have ever used!!</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE product!!!</li>
            <li> This wax was awful.</li>
            <li> I understand peoples&#x27; complaints, but you&#x27;re getting an awful lot of bang for your buck, people.</li>
            <li> so I decided to use the one strip I had with the cream--and it was terrible.</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrible!</li>
            <li> This product is the WORST!</li>
            <li> When I was cleaning up, I grabbed the jar of wax by the lid (very stupid in retrospect) because I thought the lid would be stuck shut on the container</li>
            <li> Worst wax i have ever used.</li>
            <li> but they stopped selling it and replaced it with some terrible Sally Hansen microwaveable sugar wax.</li>
            <li> This wax was awful.</li>
            <li> This is probably the worst wax I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I get insane razor bumps and in grown hairs.</li>
            <li> This is the worst wax I have ever used.  </li>

            <li> For some reason this one wouldn&#x27;t harden or dry. I&#x27;ve tried this one in the past and it didn&#x27;t give me hard time, I was trying to save $2 because the other version &amp;#34;Brazilian strength&amp;#34; was $10 and since I used this one before and it never gave me problems, I thought I should save $2. Well the wax won&#x27;t dry (it&#x27;s suppose to harden so it pulls away the skin along with the cloth). It was just gooey. So this company either sent me a defective one or a used one that someone over heated because that&#x27;s what happens when you boil or overheat the wax.</li>
            <li> It works as expected. Adequately removes have when done properly.</li>
            <li> This stuff was a nightmare. It ended up being a big gummy mess.  It reminded me of when a glob of super sticky bubble gum gets ground into hair and requires a buzz cut with one nasty twist, it won&#x27;t come off the skin either.  It took an hour of scrubbing and massaging with oils and wax remover to get most of it off, at least enough to get dressed, and I was still finding blobs of sticky gummy wax 24 hours later.  It never even got hard enough to pick, pull, or scrape it off.</li>
            <li> I tried this wax kit today with a friend of mine, and neither of us could even finish the job. The pain was tolerable, but the hassle just wasn&#x27;t worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Lavender scent is pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;-Cheap (also a con)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The wax does not adhere very well to the strips.&lt;br /&gt;-There aren&#x27;t enough strips in the kit to finish even a leg, let alone two or an entire hairy body.&lt;br /&gt;-The wax cools too quickly, needing constant reheating in the microwave.&lt;br /&gt;-The wax is extremely difficult to clean up and doesn&#x27;t come off with soap and water as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;-Not every hair comes off with the strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy this product again. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this at CVS to use as a bikini wax. I read the instructions, applied as they said, and removed as they said. No only did this product not work in successfully removing hair (about 1 hair in every 50 actually stuck to the wax) but it also left my skin irritated and badly bruised....even when I pulled the skin tight and removed as instructed. Very disappointed. Tossed it out and won&#x27;t buy more.</li>
            <li> I bought this product only because it was the last one, out of other brands I prefer, that was on the shelf.  Went home, heated it up.... its very gooey and drippy, and applied it.  Not only was it EXTREMELY EXTREMELY STICKY, (good for legs, bad for hands) but the wax starts hardening in about 2 minutes.... i had to keep microwaving it that i got soo sick of it and just threw it away!!  it gets everywhere!!!  i scrubbed and scrubbed in the shower to get parts off and even shaved the parts i didnt get and the wax was still there!!! i scrubbed soo much my skin was raw!  even the parts that i did wax had some hair here and there that the wax missed.  THE BOX MAKES IT SOUND SO FANCY AND THAT IT SMELLS GOOD AND BLAH BLAH BLAH...... BUT DONT BE FOOLED!!!!  NEVER WILL I BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN NOR WILL I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE!!!  save your money and buy something else.... its $9.00 for a reason!  Its horrible!!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried several different at-home waxing kits, and this is one of my favorites!  It effectively removes hair and has never irritated my skin.  Regarding pain, it can hurt quite a bit, but no more than other waxing systems I&#x27;ve tried.  I will say, you must be VERY careful when using this product because it is a hassle to clean up.  The wax does not wash away with soap and water, so if you are prone to spills, you may want to purchase something else.  (To be extra safe, I usually put the wax jar on a paper plate when I&#x27;m using it, and then any drips do not end up on my counter.)</li>
            <li> I have been using the Sally Hansen sugar hair removal product for years with good results (almost as good as the much more expensive NADS). I thought I would try the wax and found it to be VERY effective for removing hair but almost impossible to cleanup. It stuck to everything it touched (sink, counter) and I couldn&#x27;t find anything to remove it. When I put the cloth strips I used and the wash cloths in the washer, the wax got all over the washer and on every other piece of clothing in there. I called the company to try to find some help and they had no clue and did not seem to care. I don&#x27;t remember any warning that this was a problem on the instructions. I felt it was my civic duty to warn others. Hope this helps</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while--and it is getting increasingly difficult to find in stores.  It is SO much less expensive than going to the spa for a leg wax, and it is very effective at removing hair.  I would say that each jar gives me about 3 waxes-provided that I have enough strips left-although it gets a bit less effective as I get down towards the bottom of the jar &amp; I have to keep reheating to keep it from getting to glue-y.  I also find it to not be irritating at all--I&#x27;m not sure if the oil that comes with it actually does something, or if the wax itself is just more gentle.        Forgot to Mention: The purple oil that comes with the wax is also about the only thing that will help REMOVE the wax once it&#x27;s on something.  I&#x27;ve gotten it off of glass, my skin/ nails, and a ceramic counter by pouring on a little wax and then rubbing it off with my hands/ scratching it off with my nail.  I dont know if it would work miracles on clothes or other fabrics as well, but its best you dont try to tempt fate!!  I typically have to reheat the wax 2 or 3 times during the waxing process because I find it most effective when the wax is  somewhat thin.   I agree that it is a serious pain to clean up--if you get it on any clothes/furniture, etc, forget about it.  I always sit on the same towel when I wax my legs, and no matter how many times i wash it, the purple stains remain.  So be careful.</li>
            <li> This is my first time waxing my arms i thought why not go for it! I purchased this product and im pleased. I already knew waxing would hurt which mind you it does...However once your all done and you see the results its so awesome. It is a bit messy though and i ran out of strips. The oil that comes with it didn&#x27;t do much really but i used baby oil to clean up the excess wax off my skin and it worked great!</li>
            <li> The single WORST product i have ever used in my entire life.  i heated it, applied it to my legs and it wouldnt come off, the strip would only pick up half the wax and the rest remained stuck to my skin. and nothing would make it budge, not the purple oil, not baby oil, not body lotion, nothing. half a bottle of pharmacy alcohol and an hour of rubbing left a residue which took a week to disappear. and the cherry on top of the cake was the massive ugly unsightly bruise it left behind....not to mention the fact that it picked up 3 strands of hair and left the rest.  i threw it straight into the garbage which is where it belongs.DONT WASTE UR MONEY. its awful. the person who invented this thing should be full body waxed with this product. that might teach him/her not to foist disgusting stuff on the unsuspecting public.</li>
            <li> I been buying this product over and over again, works much better than sugar wax, in my opinion it does a better job, might be a bit messy but the oil softens the wax and problem is over.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair removal kit to use on my bikini area. Not only was it the worst pain ever, it also left most of the wax on my skin and didn&#x27;t remove much of my hair. A couple of weeks later I figured I would give it another try and use it on my legs. Needless to say I had the same outcome as the first time I used it. Don&#x27;t buy this product!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, but not for necessarily body hair. I use it on my face an neck mostly. It&#x27;s a great deal because it goes so far. With a popsicyle stick size wand I use this product for my lip, between brows, and on the sides of my face where the hair is a bit too thick. The residue removes easily, and the product is easy to apply. Also, because there is so much product I run out of the cloth, which you cut to size. So, I have found that by using facing (a cloth bought in sewing materials, the stuff that is used in collars) I can just cut tons of strips just the right size for each area. One jar of the product lasts me over a year, and I have to do my lip and middle brow at least every month. I do the sides of my face by my side burn area every couple of months, and my chin and under chin every 3 months. (What a drag getting older.)</li>
            <li> I bought this waxing system because I liked that it used cloth strips, and came with a pretty good sized jar of wax. But after using it, it&#x27;s clear why the product only costs $9. It is the WORST thing I have ever used!! It took a full 3 minutes for the wax to heat up to a usable consistency, instead of the recommended 30 seconds. Even after it&#x27;s heated up, the wax is so STICKY it&#x27;s impossible to use without getting it all over everything. The only thing that will take off excess wax is the azulene oil that is included in the kit, and they only provide you with a very small bottle of it. I applied the wax exactly how the directions stated, and it still didn&#x27;t even remove all the hair. It didn&#x27;t even remove half of it. Then I was left with sticky bits of wax stuck to my skin that are nearly impossible to remove. I would highly discourage anyone who wants to buy this product, it&#x27;s such a hassle and the results aren&#x27;t worth the effort.</li>
            <li> This stuff SEVERELY irritated my skin. The whole area i waxed ,even after 2 days is still all red and rashy. this better go away or i&#x27;ll sue. TERRIBLE product!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing for over 10 years now with Sally Hansen products.  Tried this one because I couldn&#x27;t find my regular go-to the Brazilian box.   The wax was impossible to remove from my skin. Needless to say, i was left with hair in tact, a red rash and a sticky mess to clean up.  I ended up getting in the shower to shave, clean and soothe my skin.    Waste of money, trust me!</li>
            <li> This crap will not come off of my skin. It&#x27;s sticking everywhere and I&#x27;ve tried to remove it with soap, baby wipes, and a wash cloth with no luck. It hurts more than any other waxing treatment I&#x27;ve tried. It rips off my skin. It doesn&#x27;t rip off smoothly WHATSOEVER. It leaves my skin irritated. On top of all that it couldn&#x27;t even remove all the hair. I followed the instructions and yet it&#x27;s still a crappy product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waxed at home before so I jumped right in and spread it on the bikini area...IT TOOK ME AN HOUR to get it off my skin.  The worst part is that it is so sticky and tacky that it didn&#x27;t really remove the hair.  Not a part of the body that tolerates the struggle to remove the wax.  Spare yourself.</li>
            <li> This is the messiest home waxing kit I have ever bought!  Just pulling the lid off started the disaster of purple wax all over everything.  After spending 20 minutes trying to get it off my skin I spent another 30 getting it out of my sink.  Super Glue was easier to remove from my skin and counter then this stuff.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I really like this kit.  I only use for eyebrow waxing.&lt;br /&gt;PROS: 1. Product has really lasted a long time.  I wax every 2 weeks, and have only used about 1/3 of the jar over a 6 month period.&lt;br /&gt;2. The lavender smell is great also!&lt;br /&gt;****&lt;br /&gt;CONS:  I wish there were different sized sticks to apply the product.  The ones included are large, wide, and almost impossible to use to spread wax on your eyebrow area.&lt;br /&gt;2. not enough paper strips.  but a great tip I learned : USE COFFEE FILTERS from the dollar store  :)</li>
            <li> LOVE this product, such a high quality wax and works so well! my sister &amp; I use it all the time (we have pretty dark &amp; thick hair) and it saves us so much money instead of going to a salon! it&#x27;s also so much cheaper if you purchase this delightful item via amazon, which is the best price i&#x27;ve found. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and this product did not hurt.  I do not understand what everyone is complaining about.  It is a great product!  Smells very nice--like Lavender--yes, it&#x27;s a bit gooey, but honestly, what microwavable wax won&#x27;t be gooey?    Yes the residue (I&#x27;m talking about the left over after you pull the strip off) is the worst part...getting it off took some elbow work and lots of that after lotion stuff.  To those complaining it left your legs or whatever red...any wax is going to do that.  Why?  Because you are ripping the hair follicle out and drawing the blood up to the surface--in other words--the waxed area turning red is common!  Some people redden more than others (I know my skin is always red afterwards...this is why I do it when I have no where to go afterwards for a few hours), ask any beautician...they will tell you the same thing.  Ripping your skin off while pulling the strip?  Obviously you are not pulling your skin taught enough, or at all. I have never had this product pull any skin off.     I will buy this again and again as long as they continue to sell it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, my skin is very sensitive and this wax works just great on my skin, plus I love the lavander scent!!</li>
            <li> This wax was awful. The wax residue was so difficult to get off; they provide an extra bottle of some strange smelling liquid to help remove the wax afterwards, but it doesn&#x27;t work well at all and I had sticky patches left all over my legs that I really had to rub at to get off. Good thing it was only my legs; supposedly this thing works for bikini, too - that would hurt. Don&#x27;t buy this. There are much better wax kits (like Nair) that are so much easier and less painful to remove with just some water.</li>
            <li> is the best wax for all your body!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product for an over the counter wax product for ten dollars. I understand peoples&#x27; complaints, but you&#x27;re getting an awful lot of bang for your buck, people. I use mine for brazilians and it works great. It&#x27;s important to use just a thin layer of the wax, and the best way to do that is to make sure the wax is pretty warm. I don&#x27;t actually put mine in the microwave- I put it in a pot of water on the stove and keep the heat on low/medium to keep it at a nice consistent temperature. If you find you are getting wax all over, SLOW DOWN. And don&#x27;t use so much wax at once. You just need to dip the tip of the stick into the wax pot. And you can wait a minute or two to get the strip onto the wax- don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;ll still work. As for the oil- use it generously. You can use it to clean up your stove, kitchen, skin, whatever. And don&#x27;t put it on a cotton ball and then put it on your skin. You&#x27;ll get cotton stuck everywhere and no oil on you. Just pour a little bit into the palm of your hand, rub your hands together and rub your hands where it&#x27;s still sticky. When you run out, you can just use baby oil. Remember- oil is the only thing that will break down wax. This kit is definitely easiest to use if you get a professional wax first and then just use this every couple of weeks for grooming. There will be less hair to pull up, making it a lot easier for you. You may have a couple of messy waxes at first, but once you get used to it it&#x27;s honestly really easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many of the other Sally Hansen products in the past, but this destroyed my skin. Any drips stick to the skin, and take forever to remove, and it only does so so at removing hair.  I would never use it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many of Sally Hansen&#x27;s home waxing kits and they seem to get worse and worse. This one, just like their Brazilian kit were complete disasters. I would have rather gone to a salon and paid to have it done. I just want to warn others to think twice before using it. I think the company must be trying to make the wax stronger and stronger. If that is their goal, they have achieved it. But sorry, I am not a monkey in a lab and do not need super glue strong wax to take my leg hair off.   It got all over my fingers, sink, shower floor and nothing but Commet seemed to be able to remove it. I tried all kinds of soap and wash clothes, a horrible mess! My skin was raw from scrubbing it off and that barely accomplished anything. I used up the bottle of finishing oil it came with in hopes it would help to remove the wax, but thee amount was too little to do much. Finally, my fiance looked up on the Internet how to get wax off and he read baby oil works. I tried it and it really did work! Thank goodness something worked. And of course, the directions in the box don&#x27;t even tell you that. BTW, I DID follow the directions. My microwave is weaker than some, so instead of heating it for 30 sec. I did it for 40 sec and waited a minute before using it, just like the directions said.   If you want to use a at home waxing kit that works, if you can find it anywhere anymore, which I am trying to do online to no avail. Use Sally Hansen&#x27;s honey wax with cloth strips. Not those plastic strips that don&#x27;t work, and especially not the strips with the wax already on it. It was easy to use, got the hair off perfectly fine, and came off in the shower super easy, with just warm water. I don&#x27;t know why Sally Hansen can&#x27;t stick with a product that works. Instead, they have to try to keep improving it, and to them that means making it as sticky and hard to remove as possible. It&#x27;s just a waxing kit. It worked the way it was, so keep it simple, and don&#x27;t change a good thing.</li>
            <li> I generally like Sally Hansen products but have to concur with the other negative reviews here. It was so messy, so sticky and so ineffective that I actually came online specifically to warn other people off this product. I&#x27;ve tried other waxing products and never anything so nightmarish as this.</li>
            <li> I bought this product without reading its review, previously i had used sally hansen no heat gel so i thought to try this one. I had purchased it at Walgreen. I had to microwave it for a total of 60 sec at 30 sec then at interval of 10 sec each before it was thin enough to be applicable. The wax was very very sticky sort of and it was good that i had placed a newspaper on the slab otherwise i would have been very difficult for me to clean. It did remove all the hair but it was little painful so i didn&#x27;t try it on my underarms. The little traces of the wax on the skin didn&#x27;t go away with soap and water and it was very sticky. Its water insoluble so doesn&#x27;t dissolve in water. I tried nailpolish remover to remove it but didnt work, then finally i applied almond oil n rubbed it. That helped only to some extent. In total i was dissappointed with this product. I would instead prefer to use no heat gel by same company rather than this one.   The only good thing was it did remove hair but left me with a bigger mess to clean.</li>
            <li> I first used this on my bikini area but it got too messy for me and I found some cold wax strips that were a lot easier to apply.  BUT I use this for my armpits.  Fantastic.  I just apply some to the whole area, press on a waxing strip and rip it all off at once.  I know you&#x27;re supposed to do a little at a time with the armpits because the hairs all grow in different directions.  Well I must just be impatient but I still have fantastic results from just the one application per side.  A little tip is, if you wax and find you have leftovers, next time just spread the wax a little more thinner or don&#x27;t use so much so you have leftovers.  I used to use a different Sally Hansen wax for my armpits that I thought was the best until I tried this on my armpits.  This, folks, is way better.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past 2 years, I like it</li>
            <li> I love it!! Even though it&#x27;s very sticky, i prefer it over bare natural. just make sure you use the blue oil to remove the wax, nothing else will remove it.</li>
            <li> Product will remove hair but only comes with a tiny bottle to remove the wax from anywhere it remains.  Even then, I always find I miss a place.  So when I remove my pants for bed, I&#x27;ll find black fuzzy splotches all over my leg where the pants material has stuck to the remaining wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sally Hansen&#x27;s wax products have really declined.  They discontinued their two best wax hair removal kits: sugar wax and express wax hair removal (white chocolate scented).  Those wax kits were efficient and easy to remove.  Now you can only seem to buy the \\&quot;eco friendly\\&quot; one where the wax does not stick to the plastic and this lavender one where the wax does not wash off.</li>
            <li> I have very dark course hair so finding a wax that will do the job without irritating my skin is difficult. I have used Nads which worked, but the problem with it was that if you compromised the gel in any way--meaning you got a little oil from your skin or maybe a little water in it then it would ruin the entire tub of product and it would no longer work. It degraded quickly too so I had to replace it before I was even able to use the tub up.   I did not have this problem with Sally Hansen&#x27;s Lavender Wax. I just ran out of the wax I bought over 5 years ago (I use it mostly for my eyebrows, but have done my legs a couple of times). It works perfectly! It did take me some practice and I had to figure out the right temperature, but if you have the right temperature this wax will work perfectly every time without irritation and without removing living skin. I use it before washing my face and before bathing so my face isn&#x27;t too warm. Then I heat the wax in the microwave for 1min. to start and then at 30 sec. intervals until it is the right consistency/temperature. This is usually the state when it is soupy/watery looking like a thin gravy. It will cool fast so you want it hot, but it is tricky because you obviously don&#x27;t want to use it too hot. If your skin is too warm then the wax will stick like a paste to your skin and if the wax is too cool it will start to get thicker and sticky and that will remove living skin.   I use craft sticks to apply a thin layer of wax onto the area to be treated. The thicker the layer the more likely you are to burn yourself if it is too hot so be careful. Using a thin layer will not only cut down on this possibility, but will also work more effectively without taking off your skin. If the wax gets too sticky or starts to thicken reheat it before proceeding because I have found that when the wax takes your skin off it is because it is not hot enough. The right temp. is a fine line, but I have found this to be the case with any wax so this really is just about you finding that perfect temp./consistency that works well for you.   What I find perfect about this wax though is that 1.)it lasts because it does not degrade very quickly (in fact I didn&#x27;t find that it degraded at all until I nearly reached the bottom and 2.)it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin so I can literally wax right before I walk out the door for a major event without worrying about my eyebrow area from looking raw (once you have mastered the right temp.). It also works well on any area of the body that has hair and works on all of my hair types (both soft and course).</li>
            <li> In a moment of extreme confidence, I picked up this kit with plans for a DIY Brazilian while my husband is away at a conference. Crazy? Probably. Painful? Yes. I am very happy with the results, though, and here are a couple tricks that made it a little more manageable:    1. First apply a layer of powder to the area to keep the wax from sticking to (and possibly pulling off or bruising) your skin. I used cornstarch and a cotton ball.    2. Keep the wax relatively COOL. If the wax is too warm, it becomes sticky (think bubble gum) and stretches between the cloth strip and your skin when you pull. If the wax is just pliable enough to spread, it holds itself together much better and gets a good grip on the hair. If it looks like frosting, it&#x27;s too warm. It should be more like silly putty.    3. Work on a small area at a time and cut the strips to an appropriate size.     4. To get wax off your skin, first try using an already-used strip. Pat the used wax down on the sticky spot, then pull up quickly. The azulene oil is great for getting it off your skin, too. Don&#x27;t waste it on your countertop! Hot water and a kitchen scrubby work just fine (I tried rubbing an ice cube on spilled wax à la Real Simple, but it didn&#x27;t peel away easily).     I would have liked more cloth strips, but they&#x27;re easy enough to come by. I used about half of the jar of wax and half of the azulene oil for my first attempt.</li>
            <li> I started buying this about a month ago when my store ran out of the Gigi Microwavable Wax. I have to say, after having used Gigi for the past 4 or so years, I have now switched to this product. Here is why:    - for some reason, the wax is not as sticky as the Gigi one. It comes off your skin a lot easier, especially in terms of spillages and clean-ups. I normally use oil to take it off (any kind, baby oil, olive oil, shea oil...) For some small spots, even soap and water can be used to take it off. This was NOT the case for the Gigi wax.    - also for some reason this wax stays viscous a lot longer. The Gigi one got harder faster so had to microwave it more often.    - smells good    - I&#x27;ve found in my store that this is actually cheaper than the Gigi wax but it also gives you a bunch of spatulas and some very effective strips. The strips are very wide so for smaller areas I cut them in half.    I have officially switched to this brand!! I highly, highly recommend it. I&#x27;ve been waxing myself (bikini, underarm) for 6 years now. It took some practice be able to do it correctly. Most of the bad reviews will be from people who have misused the product. ALL waxes, if not used properly can pull at your skin (that&#x27;s the point, right? :)) and cause bleeding or bruising. All waxes, if dripped all over the place, can be messy to clean up after.    I&#x27;ve been using this one for a while now and I cannot find any fault with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using wax hair removal products for years. I&#x27;ve used Nads and other cold wax products similar to that. I&#x27;ve used a few hot wax products as well, and I have to say that this one is by far the worst one ever!    I have found that most of the hot waxes are made to rinse off with soap and warm water. So, if you get any on your counter top or floor its no big deal.  But, this product only comes off with the oil that comes in the box. Even then, you still have to scrape and scrub to get all the wax off. And, depending on where its spilled you may be left with a stain.     The bottom line is, this product is way more trouble than its worth, especially since its about the same price as the other hot waxes out there, and it seems to have the same results. If you want a hot wax don&#x27;t buy this one!</li>
            <li> For the love of all that is holy, DON&#x27;T buy this product! My legs are bright red and screaming in pain. The wax got EVERYWHERE and you can&#x27;t wash it off with anything except their \\&quot;special oil\\&quot;. It didn&#x27;t even take the hair off my legs! And now I&#x27;m left with skin so irritated I can&#x27;t even shave (in the middle of summer) because half of the skin on my legs is gone :(</li>
            <li> To those who trashed this item I can only say, read the directions. Wax should be heated for a few seconds only. Anything more than 10, and the wax gets too hot. You must always test the temperature before attempting to use the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this is a fabulous product, that as one other reviewer notes, beats spas and salons by 10 country miles. I wish it were easier to find on store shelves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to waxing and bought this for my legs and bikini area.  Regardless of how thick or thin I spread on the wax, it did a poor job and the paper strips did not remove all the wax from my skin.  It was not as painful as I expected for a wax product, but left behind a sticky purple residue that would not come off with the oil included in the kit or soap and water.  I followed the directions carefully and was left with a huge mess and little hair removal.</li>
            <li> I have been using home-waxing kits for a few years now. I&#x27;ve tried a few products and settled with Nair sugar-based wax - it&#x27;s effective and really easy to clean. It has become impossible to find it in the stores, so I tried the Sally Hansen version instead. Never again. I got purple wax all over the place, and it&#x27;s really difficult to clean up. Plus, my hair grew back in oh say a week or so. I have never had this problem with any other wax products. Plus, it was really hard to spread on my skin and I ran out of strips. I will never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was tired of shaving not having long enough effects.  This product doesn&#x27;t even remove hair.  I attempted to use it on my legs and after following every instruction to the letter all it did was make my skin red and stinging.  Also, the mess is insane.  It took several minutes of scrubbing to even get wax off my hands and I still haven&#x27;t been able to get it off the area I attempted to wax.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars if it were easier to clean up abd not so messy. It worked great though, removed the hair very effectively.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, waxing your own legs is a messy process, but even with usual precautions, this wax GETS EVERYWHERE AND DOES NOT COME UP.     WEEKS LATER I&#x27;ve carried specks of it to the couch {from unknown bits on the floor?} and I&#x27;ve NO idea how to get it up. The bottle of \\&quot;remover\\&quot; is an unknown substance that was not much bigger than a perfume sample and nowhere near enough to clean up my own legs, much less the rest.    Stay away, whatever the chemistry of these Sally Hansen waxes is/are, THEY DON&#x27;T GO AWAY.     I&#x27;m afraid to put the towel I used in the wash for fear of finding those little bits on future loads of laundry.</li>
            <li> First of all, when I opened the package, the box that you see in the picture was all mangled up like someone had broken into it. I didn&#x27;t think that this was a big issue because my mail box was full and I thought it had gotten squished that way. But then I opened the box and the twenty strips that were supposed be included were all gone except for one. What the heck? I decided I wasn&#x27;t going to return it but that I would just go buy strips so I decided to use the one strip I had with the cream--and it was terrible. First of, I don&#x27;t know what kind of cream this is because in order to get it off of my fingers when I accidentally touched it, I had to use the special oil they included. The special oil was about the size of a chapstick. I couldn&#x27;t get this cream off even if I tried scrubbing it with a sponge. It took off the hair fairly well but it&#x27;s like the cream was trying to become one with my skin (literally). I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s supposed to be that way or what but all I know is that I&#x27;m never using this product ever again.</li>
            <li> Wax is too sticky, does not apply evenly, extremely painful to use, and hard to remove once you&#x27;re finished. No, spend the extra money and get a better kit.  NO NO NO. I give it two stars because it was convenient and it did get the job done...in a painful, painful way.</li>
            <li> This leg wax is one of the best. It&#x27;s not messy, it pulls the hairs out of the root instead of breaking them, and it doesn&#x27;t leave any rash or red spots. It&#x27;s quick and easy. If you like to wax regularly or are just looking for that flawless hairlessness for an event  this is a great product. Note though that they don&#x27;t send enough muslin strips with the package, it&#x27;s a good idea to grab some extra.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best waxes I have tried. Usually home waxes aren&#x27;t strong enough. I have to say about the other review, why on earth would you wash the DISPOSABLE cloth strips? What a weirdo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish there were more cloth strips included with the package.</li>
            <li> After using this product, I cannot use any other product. (even their own brand new wax that has pain reliever) This one is easy to use and does not harm my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a really  BAD wax. I have been waxing for more than ten years now and have never experienced what I did with this wax. My underarms were sore for almost three days.Dont believe the review of the 4/5 stars.JUST STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> bought this for my 12yr old daughter. this was one of the most traumatic experiences that either of us have had. followed directions. trying to apply it was a joke! sticky gunk every where! when removing from area intended to wax, removed chunks of skin! Thank God tried on small area first! you may think result occured because she is 12. she has been waxing (by professional) since she was 10. this was a scene from a bloody horror movie. would not recomend this for anyone!!! For those concerned, my daughter has a condition that caused her to grow very thick pubic hair when she was 3. She cannot shave this area do to EXTREME ingrown hairs and irritation. Her medical specialist suggested we try waxing. I did alot of research and asked alot of questions. What i did not research was this cheap product. Very dumb i know.</li>
            <li> This product was a big waste of money! I did not know that \\&quot;spa\\&quot; wax would be so sticky! The directions say to use a thin layer of wax; obviously I don&#x27;t know what thin is because when I use the strips, I end up pulling off SOME of the wax and no hair and the strip is then useless.  I have already gone through half the bottle of finishing oil just cleaning up my skin from ONE application. The mess this product creates is definitely NOT worth the money I spent or the aggravation.</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrible! So sticky. After the experience with this stuff, I truly believe waxing should be left to the professionals at a salon.</li>
            <li> Liked the product but smaller than I thought</li>
            <li> I used to go to a spa every month to get my legs waxed. Shaving irritated my skin too much and hair removal creams didn&#x27;t have the long lasting effect that results from waxing (plus it&#x27;s very messy!).&lt;br /&gt;After trying several brands of home waxing kits, Sally Hansen&#x27;s Lavender kit has become my preferred choice because it has the best value when it comes to price and effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I like this product:&lt;br /&gt;- One tub of wax easily lasts through two full waxings (arms AND legs) plus several minor waxes (underarm and face).&lt;br /&gt;- Compared to other brands (like Nair&#x27;s microwavable wax) this one is strong enough to remove short or thin hairs without repeat applications.&lt;br /&gt;- The formula has a pleasant smell and is gentle enough so as not to cause prolonged irritation (you will get redness after the wax, but the oil helps soothe your skin faster).&lt;br /&gt;- After prolonged use, the hair will grow thinner or even stop growing in some areas!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complains about this product:&lt;br /&gt;- Like it has been stated before, it is a mission to clean up the wax once it&#x27;s spilled on clothing, countertops, or other surfaces; just try to be extra careful when applying.&lt;br /&gt;- I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this wax if you&#x27;re planning to wax deep in the bikini area... you need to make sure your skin is taut during application and once the wax is stuck there clean up is not as easy as soap and water. For this kind of waxing seek a pro (or a talented friend).&lt;br /&gt;- The wax needs constant reheating. I also used to be annoyed about having to run back to the microwave during waxing, but that was finally solved by placing the wax tub on a candle jar warmer [[ASIN:B000RN18QA Ganz Inc EJ6826 Jar Candle Warmer]]. Heat up the wax once, then place it on the warmer and it will keep the right consistency.&lt;br /&gt;- Not enough strips. Even if you are reusing the strips as much as possible, you will probably fall short on sheets. Just buy an extra pack of strips at your local beauty supply, like SALLY&#x27;S. I use these [[ASIN:B000BJBGLM GIGI Large Muslin Strips 100-ct. 9\\&quot; x 3\\&quot;]].&lt;br /&gt;- The jar lid gets stuck. Just don&#x27;t try to screw it back on... once you&#x27;ve used the product, tap it on so u know it&#x27;s closed and store the container in an upright position.e Muslin Strips 100-ct. 9\\&quot; x 3\\&quot;]].  - The jar lid gets stuck. Just don&#x27;t try to screw it back on... once you&#x27;ve used the product, tap it on so u know it&#x27;s closed and store the container in an upright position.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!! This product is the WORST! It is very difficult to manage and good luck getting off of ANYTHING it touches, including your skin. It is so far from water soluble it is not even funny. Doesnt wash off of skin, remains sticky, I couldnt even get it out of the sink when I dripped a little. SO much work, a nightmare to clean up, and frustrating to use. Accidentally dripped some on my arm, and we had to SHAVE it out because it is like some horrible super sticky cement. DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been waxing my underarms and bikini area for years now and never have I had this much trouble with any wax I used. The product is EXTREMELY sticky and you cannot wash it off with soap or water. They provide an oil to take it off the skin but the quantity is not enough and it doesnt work on other surfaces like countertops. Not to mention it doesnt pull all the hair off and it tore my skin instead. Beware, this wax is extremely painful, useless and messy. This is coming from someone who has waxed for years and never complained about pain.</li>
            <li> This stuff does a good job of removing hair, but as others have noted previously, it is an utter pain to clean up.  The first time using it is the easiest as the jar that the wax comes in is clean.  But after the first use, the wax gets all over the outside of the container, the lid becomes impossible to screw back on because wax gets onto the rim of the container, and it is nearly impossible NOT to get bits of the wax all over everything.  While you can clean some of it off of hard surfaces, be extremely careful not to get the wax on any cloth objects.    When I was cleaning up, I grabbed the jar of wax by the lid (very stupid in retrospect) because I thought the lid would be stuck shut on the container (this is what had happened after the first use).  Instead, the container fell and spilled all over some clothing.  I&#x27;m guessing that it&#x27;s going to be pretty much impossible to get the wax off.    I&#x27;ve used other Sally Hansen kits that had different kind of wax that came in a little block that you melt in the microwave.  I found this product equally good at removing hair and much easier to clean up afterward.</li>
            <li> This product was such a hassle to use. It was soo messy and sticky. It gets everywhere, not to mention it does not even remove all the hair. Don&#x27;t buy this product!!!</li>
            <li> I used this product twice (foolishly), and each time it ripped the skin off of my body! The first time was just a small bit so I thought I&#x27;d try it again a month later. My skin is now open to infection and I could have permanent scarring. I have received no reply from customer service either. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> This is my third time buying this specific type of wax. I only use it on my face so the container lasts me about a year or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips and sticks that come with it are not all that great. The sticks are too thick for getting detailed spots such as eye brows. Easy solution, purchase craft Popsicle sticks for low cost. As for the strips, they&#x27;re a little stiff and they don&#x27;t give you very many. Solution.... Purchase a pack of strips. You can get them in quantities of like 50 or 100 and they do last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax itself is great! I will keep purchasing  so long as someone is still selling my next time around.</li>
            <li> I have very course dark hair that grows way to fast. compliments of my dad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for the last 5 years and love it, if i dont go to a salon for waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: quick and easy if you&#x27;ve had experience waxing before, the oil provided does clean up the wax on any non-fabric surfaces easily, 1 jar allows me to wax at least 3-4 times full legs, underarms, and upper lip, because the wax is strong it does grab my hair from the roots and regrowth slower (once i wax it lasts 2-3 wks before i have to wax again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: doesnt come with enough strips (i buy the muslin strips from Sally), it is very sticky so be careful when applying, cools down quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;1. always make sure you wash waxing area with soap with non moisturizing soap,&lt;br /&gt;2. use a strip of foil on the lip of the jar to prevent sticky lid&lt;br /&gt;3. have everything ready (jar, strips, scissors for cutting strips as needed, foil, application stick, and oil prior to starting&lt;br /&gt;4. if waxing sensitive areas be cautious as the wax is sticky and if you dont correctly make your skin taught it will hurt and leave bruise</li>
            <li> When I first tried this product I completely failed, though it was my first time waxing. I like all the other bad reviews had splotches everywhere on my legs and was unable to scrape it off. I tried washing with soap and water, and soaking with oil. I ended up getting it off with my finger nails and lots of oil. Now I believed it was something I did wrong and not the product so I watched some videos and How-To&#x27;s and then tried again. It worked perfectly! It got all my hair off except the super tiny super thin hairs that no one notices anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using this product I&#x27;ve tried honey waxing and hard waxes and I would say I DO recommend this product if you can do it properly. Sometimes its not following the directions exactly on the box, sometimes its just waxing properly! Like if the strip left over little pieces of wax I would just go over it with the same strip and it would come right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally think its a good kit, even if other people don&#x27;t. I would use it again. I love the smell compared to some of the other waxes I have tried and I really like the post-waxing oil. Don&#x27;t use the oil to remove a GLOB of wax, just use it to moisturize legs when done waxing. The oil will get off LITTLE bits and pieces and moisturize your legs really nicely, but it will not take off like 3 inches by 2 inches of wax.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t buy this product locally, so sourced it online.  Very impressed with the prompt delivery and service.    Many thanks</li>
            <li> Always a classic wax.</li>
            <li> Bought it for the wife but I use it! I started waxing my eyebrows a lil and it works like a charm in 5 minutes your done!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, always works really well. This formula is so much better than the new one. Very easy and very painless to do!</li>
            <li> I buy this wax all the time! Yes it is sticky, but it works extremely well. And isn&#x27;t that the point? If you wax your legs right you won&#x27;t have any left over wax, also the oil provided in the package soothes the skin and takes away the redness and gets any remaining wax off. I usually buy extra cloth strips as well. Just read the directions and enjoy smooth legs!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, except for the little pull-tab on the top of the canister.  Wax works well, smells good, and the oil meant to remove wax, really works.</li>
            <li> great for the skin and very easy to use</li>
            <li> There was an error with my order so all I received was the actual wax from this kit - but that&#x27;s all I really need to review anyway!  The wax was pretty decent - heated up and applied well, had good consistency and a pleasant smell, and was strong enough to remove stubborn and dense hair growth.  Clean up was a bit of a pain, and the wax seemed to lose temperature and solidify rather quickly.  Other then that, pretty good!</li>
            <li> The wax is heated up the microwave, but it remains pretty much the same consistency.  It ends up staying on your skin as as a sticky purple mess.  I&#x27;m still trying to get it off.  The label should specify that it&#x27;s a SOFT wax, I was expecting a wax that needed to be melted, would harden, and then rip off.</li>
            <li> In local store they do not carry this anymore though I love this kit as it did very clean hair removal.</li>
            <li> So this is the second time I&#x27;ve ever waxed myself and I liked this product a lot more than the ouch-relief wax kit.&lt;br /&gt;The only area I received a bruise was on the back of my left knee where I had difficulty finding a good position to pull the strip from.&lt;br /&gt;The finishing oil doesn&#x27;t really help much; I mean, it makes the wax on my legs less sticky, but the wax is still on them even after scrubbing at it with a cotton ball and the oil.&lt;br /&gt;So, overall, not bad.</li>
            <li> I am no professional with waxing and I don&#x27;t do it all the time because it is a mess and a lot of work but when I do, this is the only product I will use. My complaints about this product are that it is pretty hard to find, there aren&#x27;t enough strips and the removal oil is not great. Also it is a mess but I haven&#x27;t come across any similar product that isn&#x27;t... its wax and wax is messy! The things I love are the smell, the color and that it is very effective when used correctly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips for anyone new to using this product, (Read the directions first of course!)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) Have extra strips available (Nair has them). Pre-cut the strips if you are doing smaller areas... you don&#x27;t want to have to struggle with this while playing in wax!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) Have oil and cotton balls to remove the wax available (I use vitamin E oil) and a trash bag to dispose of them and the wax strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.)  Setup an area where you are going to use this in advance. Make sure it is clean, neat and that you don&#x27;t have carpeting or clothing in the area where this is going to be used... smooth surfaces only! If you are doing a large area like your legs you are going to have to reheat the wax and you don&#x27;t want to track wax across your house to the microwave so have flip flops or old socks available to slip on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.) After your skin is clean apply some powder, this will keep your skin from bonding with the wax and you will be less likely to rip your skin off. This is one of the most important tips IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Don&#x27;t overheat the wax and don&#x27;t continue to use it when it cools down and gets thicker.. reheat! Also don&#x27;t apply too thick of wax or the strip won&#x27;t bond with all of the wax and when you pull, it will HURT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.) Don&#x27;t go over the same area you have already waxed or you are going to have severe redness and maybe even bleeding... take your time and get it right the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE** --July,16,2010--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearly a year later now.... I&#x27;m Increasing the rating for this product from 4 stars to 5 because it seems to be the most effective. Really messy but it works well if used Correctly! So far its either Sally Hansen Spa Body Wax Lavender for me or Shaving, nothing else seems to make the cut (although I&#x27;m always looking for an easier solution). Recently I bought the \\&quot;Braun 5270 Silk-&amp;eacute;pil X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator\\&quot; and \\&quot;Moom Organic Hair Removal Kit, Tea Tree, 6-Ounce Package\\&quot; and although both are very different products, they both had the same end result.. Too Long Of A Wait! With Sally Hansen Spa Body Wax Lavender, I can almost wax as soon as I see the hair and the hairs gone for a while .. with no repeating. It&#x27;s the most effective hair removal I have found.4 stars to 5 because it seems to be the most effective. Really messy but it works well if used Correctly!

            <li> Worst wax i have ever used. It ripped a layer of my skin off and now i a huge brown mark on my thigh and welts all over the back of my legs. This should be taken off the market!!!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this wax several times. I mostly wax my eyebrows. It smells great and is very easy to use. It only needs to be moderately hot to be effective. I have sensitive skin and have never had any problems with &amp;#34;breakouts&amp;#34; after using this wax.</li>
            <li> This product is impossible to wash off once applied.  I accidentally got a bit stuck in my hair and it would not wash out even after 10 minutes in the shower. I had to cut out a chunk of hair instead.  An extra bit left on my face also could not be washed off, despite repeated scrubblings. While it is effective at removing unwanted hair from your skin, its diffiiculty in removal otherwise make it a scary product to use.</li>
            <li> It is good if used by heating in microwave instead of gas.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time a few days ago. Not sure what made me choose it, but I did. Boy, am I glad I picked this one! This is by far one of the best and easiest waxing kits I&#x27;ve ever purchased and used. The wax heats up nicely in the microwave, so I&#x27;d give it an A+ for convenience. It goes on nice and smooth, and will most often get all the hairs in one swipe. You may have to give it one more go, but it works very well. Not to mention the wax has a very pleasant scent, which (in my opinion) is enough of a reason in itself to try it! It also works well with sensitive skin. The only drawbacks that I noticed were that the wax can be a bit on the messy side, and it goes cold a little quickly. But just pop it in the microwave for a bit, and the problem takes care of itself. All things considered, I&#x27;d say that it is certainly a high-quality product. Definitely worth a buy, and I&#x27;d recommend it to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> the only wax i would ever recommend to anyone i know, especially women :) effective lasts longer. compare to the blue wax that sally hansen has. this one lasts longer!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) The was has a pleasant smell. The light purple opaque shade helps with visibility, as one would know if the entire area intended to be waxed is covered.&lt;br /&gt;2) It is a very strong wax. No need to repeat waxing on any area, this seems to be an issue with other products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;3) Even after heating the wax in the microwave to become completely liquid(which helps with application and reduces waste), the wax does not become dangerously hot, as is common with transparent wax formulas.&lt;br /&gt; Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Remember to take off as much wax residue you can why the wax is still warm on your skin, with the strips supplied. This lavender wax does not wash off easily, even after applying the oil provided in the kit. In fact it just stays put even after warm shower and scrub. This is a feature that I miss from Nair wax in a tub (no longer available on the market), which would just dissolve with warm water, no soap necessary.&lt;br /&gt;2) Not enough wax strips supplied. Half of the tub used and the strips are all gone.</li>
            <li> I have tried this kit twice now. Hoping that over time that pain from this wax would lessen.    Now don&#x27;t be confused my 2 star come solely from dissatisfaction. Not how well it works. If you use this for your eyebrows it work fairly well misses maybe a few hairs every once in a while, but nothing a tweezers cant fix. How ever use it anywhere else [for example legs or bikini area] its a disaster.     I tried using the product on the lower part of my legs around my ankles bcuz I always seemed to miss a few hair when shaving. This product worked nicely, but was extremely messy and my hand were so sticky when dealing with the product. When I did more of my leg, the wax was not as consistent and I constantly had to re-heat it only to make a bigger mess. It hurt alot. More than I expected. It felt as if it was ripping my skin with it. But after a few coats it did remove the hair.    When I tried using the product on my bikini area. Biggest Mistake. It hurt so much, ripping the skin. It missed a lot of hair, and made the biggest mess. I literally had to use a bottle of baby oil to clean up.     SO overall it PAINFUL. MESSY. and Expected for the price.</li>
            <li> only wax that works for me and I&#x27;ve tried several!</li>
            <li> great product, came in the mail a bit crushed though.</li>
            <li> Tip: nail polish remover and a little elbow grease will remove spills from counters and other hard surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you know the technique of waxing this product is great. If you are new to waxing you&#x27;re likely to have a horrific mess. I always spread some newspaper out below me to catch drips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried sugar waxes and pre-waxed strips, this is the only wax that really removes the hair without fail.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best stuff I&#x27;ve found for home waxing. The other products I&#x27;ve tried leave hairs. I found that applying mineral oil once I&#x27;m done easily cleans up the sticky stuff. They do that in the salon with baby oil, so I figured it was the same idea. My arms are baby smooth.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Good for my sensitive skin. Very quick delivery! I&#x27;m glad I bought 2 right away.</li>
            <li> Very good product. You just have to apply once. Very easy to apply. I don&#x27;t recommend it for bikini area. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my eyebrows for years. A container of it lasts forever. It&#x27;s a little messy, but you get the hang of it after a while. I put it in the microwave for 1 minute to get it gooey enough. And the way to clean off the excess is to take a q-tip and dip it in the little blue oil. Rub it around on the excess wax and wipe it off with a paper towel. It&#x27;s that easy. I never used it anywhere but my eyebrows though. It never tore my skin.</li>
            <li> This wax is great to use for your whole body. It has a great smell, BUT it is not water soluble! Be careful not to get ANY of the wax on your fingers and use gloves. First time using it, it got in my hair, on my hands, and it was just a complete mess! Other than the mess, the wax itself is really good. It gets every hair, and has a pleasant smell to it and it hurts less than any other wax. It&#x27;s a good wax, but just wear gloves &amp; be careful with it or it will be a complete messy disaster!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit surprised by all the negative reviews! I&#x27;ve been waxing my legs and bikini area for 15 years now. I have South Asian roots so I&#x27;ve got some serious hair. This is by far among my favorite wax. I had been buying this at Target but they stopped selling it and replaced it with some terrible Sally Hansen microwaveable sugar wax. I had to get this from Amazon because it&#x27;s the only one that takes off the hair effectively. I like the smell and I like that it&#x27;s creamy.. The strips lift the wax off the skin nicely. I can see how reviewers might complain that it gets messy, but I&#x27;ve never really seen a clean wax! If you&#x27;re experienced with wax, this is not messy at all. I definitely recommend this to others. I also feel it&#x27;s less painful that other thinner wax.</li>
            <li> First of all, everyone who is unhappy, there&#x27;s a technique to waxing and that&#x27;s why most people shouldn&#x27;t try it at home. You must clean the area and dry it well then use baby powder or even a face powder works when applied with a makeup brush. I didn&#x27;t find the wax to be messy because you have to swirl the stick to break off the stringy wax coming out of the container and also after placing it on the skin. Make sure you go in the direction of hair growth. When applying the strip, it&#x27;s best to cut them to size so you don&#x27;t overlap areas where hair grows different directions. Rub the strip over the wax in the direction of hair growth. Most times you need to wait about 30 seconds, rub again, pull skin tight and remove strip in a quick, parallel motion. Apply pressure with clean fingers to area immediately after and press clean part of strip on any excess wax left to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this worked well with the steps above and the oil has always done a good job taking the wax off. Many times hair length and technique inhibit a good result. It also says areas to avoid using this on.</li>
            <li> This wax was awful. It was hard to remove even with the oil provided. I heated up the wax for about 30 sec and it kept hardening up. I had to run back and forth to the microwave to keep reheating. I would recommend investing in a wax warmer and better wax!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing since I was 10, and self waxing for about 8 years now. I can say without a doubt that the problem with this product is the strips and not the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this during a move because my professional pot was in storage and I&#x27;ve been trying to use it up. Even with pre-cleansing and cornstarching my skin the wax would not come off. And it hurt! When you&#x27;ve waxed as much as I have you get pretty numb so for this to hurt I knew something was off. It was also not pulling hair from the roots. I was left with a lot of extras and broken off hairs that I would have to pluck, also leaving me waxing more frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I ran out of strips in the kit. I thought they were kind of odd to begin with. They looked like interfacing, not muslin. I decided to go with that and grabbed a strip of interfacing from my sewing studio to cut up (hey, fabric is fabric, is interfacing). Well, I finally got a good wax! Painless, all the hair was gone including the roots, and all of the wax pulled off on the first try. THE PROBLEM WAS THE STRIPS IN THE KIT!! They&#x27;re weird and don&#x27;t seem to grip the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who buys this kit should make sure to do a few things, because a lot of these bad reviews are also from user error.&lt;br /&gt;1. Prep your skin with rubbing alcohol and then a cornstarch dusting.&lt;br /&gt;2. ***Get strips other then from the kit.*** Local beauty supply, fabric store, whatever. I used a plain non fusible interfacing tonight.&lt;br /&gt;3. Learn how to apply the wax in the right direction, and the proper way to pull it off. Pay to get waxed at a salon at least once and watch the technique. Pay attention!&lt;br /&gt;4. Don&#x27;t use this for your bikini line. You want a harder wax for that. If you wax figure out what kind works for you and the parts you&#x27;re waxing and avoid the others.</li>
            <li> This item is less painful than other products I&#x27;ve used. I think because the wax really does grip the hair and not the skin. The problem is it is VERY VERY VERY STICKY. Wow. What a huge sticky mess this caused in my bathroom. I&#x27;ve never had such a poor experience trying to clean up after waxing. I would reccomend the Nair brazilian formula wax over this that comes in the roll on, that rinses off easily.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find my usual SurgiWax Brazilian hard wax  so I settled for this Sally Hansen product. I always do my own waxing and have never had any issues until I tried this product. It sticks more to your skin than your hair. So much that I think I actually ripped some skin off my inner thigh. It&#x27;s very messy even for me that I wax myself regularly. I do not recommend this product at all. The texture is super sticky. TOO sticky if you ask me. Do not buy unless you want unsightly bikini scarring. I hope they fade. I personally recommend SurgiWax hard wax. I should have been more patient instead of buying the Sally Hansen.</li>
            <li> This is probably the worst wax I have tried.  It does remove most of the hair, but it is impossible to get off of your skin!  The supplied oil helps some, but it&#x27;s still a pain.  Don&#x27;t try with cloth strips as it won&#x27;t rinse off the strips and will clog your drain!  There are MUCH better waxes out there.  My favorite is Nads [[ASIN:B000JUWHYI Nad&#x27;s No-Heat Hair Removal Gel, 6 oz (170 g)]] or Sally Hansen honey wax using CLOTH STRIPS (not supplied in the kit) [[ASIN:B001510LDY Naturally Bare Honey Wax Hair Remover for Body Wax Women by Sally Hansen, 1 Count]].  Tip: If you buy Sally Hansen wax in the store, there is usually a coupon included inside the box.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this variety of the sally Hansen wax this time. Sadly, I had a lot of problems with it, and I was only using it on my armpits and still couldn&#x27;t get it to work. It&#x27;s a shame really; I recommend the regular Sally Hansen wax instead. That one works better.</li>
            <li> Arrived spilled out into the box. Received half the wax I paid for. Ruined the other parts of the kit. Super inconvenient to use because there&#x27;s wax coating the outside of the jar.</li>
            <li> This is by far a great wax!  It is a pain to get off counter tops, but a little oil and a razor blade and it comes right off!  I have been using this wax for 3 years and love it!!!</li>
            <li> Works great!! I have been using this wax product for a few years now and I have not experience any allergic reaction to it (and I consider myself to have a sensitive skin). The wax grips all the hair and my legs just look very clean and shiny after I finish waxing and put the relief oil that comes with it. I often see red bumps, but they go away after 1 day usually.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this kit before and started looking online because it may be discontinued. It does a very nice job for a store bought kit. The wax melts well in the microwave and comes off with the included oil if you get it anywhere you don&#x27;t want it. comes with a reasonable number of strips, and several sticks so you don&#x27;t can toss the stick after each use. Not 5 stars because it&#x27;s not removeable without the oil as some water soluble waxes I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> Though it can be messy, if you don&#x27;t pay attention to what you are doing, it works great for me. Heat it for 1 minute (unlike the instructions for .5 minutes). Apply in the direction of the hair growth. Put on the wax strips and rub on. Then hold down your skin and pull in the opposite direction of the hair growth (as close to your skin as possible). Pulls most to all of my hair the first time. This is SO MUCH BETTER than those all-in-one wax strips. The smell is nice and the included oil easily cleans up any extra wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other waxes and they&#x27;re never quite substantial enough to get my armpit hair. This does the trick. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Other reviewers have mentioned that it&#x27;s not water soluble. No. It&#x27;s not. (I think it improves the pulling power of the wax!) But baby oil on paper towels or cotton balls works great. If it spills on your counter, baby oil or GooGone works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for roughly 10 years on my brows and bikini line.  I&#x27;ve never had any trouble with it and it&#x27;s very easy to remove.  One jar lasts forever.  It&#x27;s also getting very difficult to find in stores as most brands are now creating just hard wax, which I&#x27;m not used to using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that it WILL leak if it is not stored properly.  My last jar tipped over and has destroyed the inside of the bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li> Brazilian waxes are painful. The expense of having a professional give you one is sometimes even more painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this kit at my local CVS because my skin literally cannot handle shaving down there. I get insane razor bumps and in grown hairs. So if I want it gone, I have to wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit was my first venture into brazilian waxing and I must say, it&#x27;s been an alright time. I&#x27;ve used the kit a total of 3 times, all three to accomplish a brazilian. It&#x27;s still painful but I think my technique is getting better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Lavender smell is definitely there and it does feel kind of calming and spa-like.&lt;br /&gt;-The oil that comes with the kit works miracles and don&#x27;t be fooled by the small vial of it. I&#x27;ve only used 1/3 of it after 3 waxes and used/spilled plenty. It easily and efficiently got wax off my skin and my glass table.&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;ve used almost half my wax for 3 brazilians so far. So this kit will last you probably around 6, which I think is good value for cost.&lt;br /&gt;- Wax works well and removes hair cleanly AS LONG AS the wax is warm enough (thin), hair is short enough, and applied correctly (applied with growth, ripped against growth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Stringy &amp; Sticky. You&#x27;ll be a mess afterward but that&#x27;s what the oil is for.&lt;br /&gt;-I don&#x27;t have a wax/candle warmer so I have to run to microwave to reheat at least once if I&#x27;m going pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;-One wax is not going to last you nearly 8 weeks as advertised unless you have really really slow hair growth. I consider my hair growth to be normal-maybe slightly accelerated and I&#x27;m smooth for 2 weeks and definitely need another wax after 4.&lt;br /&gt;-After 3 waxes, I only have 1 strip left. So buy extra strips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think if you&#x27;re dead set on doing this yourself, this kit is a good option. Though I have to admit. I went to European Wax Center and got waxed by a professional for about half what local waxers cost and it was a heavenly experience. In and outin 15 minutes (waxing myself takes a labored 30-45 if I&#x27;m being picky about getting it all), little to no pain (waxing myself hurts really bad!), complete hair removal (I always miss spots), and a nice lady with whom I didn&#x27;t feel embarrassed at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you can afford a professional wax, get one. If you can&#x27;t, this kit is a good investment for at-home waxing or those times when you just can&#x27;t go get a professional one.</li>
            <li> First time I tried and love it!  Heats up in 45 seconds, soft, smooth just a bit messy as most waxes are.  No irration and doesn&#x27;t hurt when you pull off with strips included!  You can feel the Lavender smoothness on your skin!  LOVE IT!! No more going to the spa!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little messy but the results are great. I recommend to other to try. Easy to used. just tried</li>
            <li> Always works as advertised.  Been using the product for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing my legs and bikini area at home for the past couple of months using a cheap grocery store wax ($6) and had a pretty good experience, but I decided to change it and use the Sally Hansen one just to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried it out it was on my boyfriend, to wax his stomach. He had never waxed before so I knew it was gonna be painful for him and his skin will be irritated for the next couple of days. Well, his skin was BRIGHT red for FOUR days, then his hair follicles became red and bumpy and his hair started to grow back, FOUR DAYS AFTER WAXING! I thought that maybe it was particularly bad for him because it was his first time waxing. But then when I tried it on my bikini area I had the same problem - a lot of irritation and the hair started growing back WAY TOO SOON. Same on the legs. I think this wax doesn&#x27;t properly remove hair from the root and that&#x27;s why it grows back so fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good thing about this wax is that, contrary to what a lot of people are saying in their reviews here, it&#x27;s not hard to remove from your skin with the wax strips provided. If you apply it properly, and rub the strip a few times before pulling, it comes off clean and almost pain free (for me, at least!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend paying $12 for this wax. In Europe I used a cheap $6 waxing kit that did a WAY better job at removing my hair (and keeping it away!) than this one.</li>
            <li> Other waxes seem to just tear at my skin and leave hair behind. This does a great job and leaves me silky-smooth!</li>
            <li> I bought this yesterday after realizing Nads had changed their formulation from the gel to strips with gel already in place.  I can&#x27;t seem to find the former anywhere in Chicago so I bought this product instead as the strips werent working for me.  This product does the job but it is messy.  The wax seems to grab all of the hair compared to Nads, but I did notice it tore off my skin. I&#x27;ll try baby powder, as one review suggested, and see if that helps.  The wax will not come off with soap and water (unlike Nads) but it comes off very easily with the oil.  I dabbed a little between two fingers and rubbed it in the area I waxed and that does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not bad and it would be a 5 if the wax didn&#x27;t tear a top layer of my skin off. Also, at $11 a box, it seemed like a steal.</li>
            <li> This is the worst wax I have ever used.  Not only does it not come off, but it tore my legs apart.  It left my legs bruised from scrubbing the wax off with both the oil provided and soap and water.</li>
            <li> I use this wax for my underarms and legs, and it is the best around. I originally tried other brands. Once I started using this, I would never switch. It does the job perfectly! Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This kit does not work. After I put the wax and pull the strip only part of the wax adhered. This product only leaves the bruises and the hair you wanted gone. The amount of oil it brings for you to remove the excess wax is not enough.</li>
            <li> Ok first of all, it&#x27;s WAX, people. Of course wax is going to be messy. When getting wax out of the jar, pull the stick out and twirl it around a few times before applying. Problem solved. Anyway, I used a little baby powder and that made the bikini line easier to deal with. I also cut the strips into 4&#x27;s. Now throw a towel on the bathroom floor, nuke the stuff for 40 seconds (at least that&#x27;s what worked for me), and get to waxin&#x27;. This stuff smells awesome and it doesn&#x27;t hurt that it looked pretty, too. Just read the directions first and you&#x27;re golden.</li>
            <li> Per Mrs. John Kelly...This product is thick and does NOT DISSOLVE with soap and water.  It will not come off towels and washcloths.  Must be scraped off of counters right away to avoid staining cultured marble.  Yes, it works for waxing-- but getting it off skin requires scrubbing with the included oil (had to also use several ounces of grapeseed oil to clean skin).  The HONEY BARE wax product was much better.  Will be switching back to Nad&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting waxed at salons for years so am very familiar with proper waxing technique. I&#x27;ve also had laser hair removal done, so have a very small amount of hair to wax at this point. I figured an at-home kit would be simple, but if so, this one is definitely not it! The wax is extremely sticky, yet seems to only remove a very limited amount of hair. I&#x27;d go over an area multiple times as professional estheticians do and that didn&#x27;t even cut it. I did find that the oil included in the kit made for easy cleanup with no residual wax, but didn&#x27;t really matter since the wax didn&#x27;t get much hair off. Agree with other reviewers who said 30-60 seconds heating time wasn&#x27;t sufficient; I heated for three minutes and probably could&#x27;ve heated a bit more. Very unhappy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Perhaps I am inept in the waxing process, but for the second time I&#x27;ve been left with some pretty ugly bruising. Not the look I was going for. I&#x27;m tossing it.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this product I read the reviews, although the reviews weren&#x27;t favorable. I decided to give it a chance and it was a big mistake. The wax is way to sticky, the strip removed two strands of hair and the wax was very difficult to remove. Although Sally Hansen has many good products in the market this one is a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Great service but package was damaged and the bottle was stuck shut had hard time opening. Love the smell and worked ok</li>
            <li> The wax takes much longer than 30 seconds to even move it around the jar, in addition to how ridiculously sticky it is. Maybe it&#x27;s because this was my first time waxing, but it was rather painful, not to mention clumps of wax would not come off with the strip. I had to stop because I couldn&#x27;t get some of the wax to come off, and soap and water would not help. I am so disappointed with this product, and I think I would rather save my money to spend on a professional waxing than this useless product.</li>
            <li> Had rashes and bruises wen used. Results in a mess, with no hair removal. Doesn&#x27;t come out easily!! The product is a complete NO-NO!!!!</li>
            <li> This is honestly my absolute least favorite Sally Hansen product I&#x27;ve ever bought. Now keep in mind, the negatives about this product have to do with the packaging, as well as the actual formula of the wax itself. As soon as I opened the jar, I knew that this would be a challenge. The wax is very glue-like, and does not harden to a solid when it has cooled down.&lt;br /&gt;But since the formula is so thick, of course you would have to scrape the excess wax off of the wooden sticks provided to apply the wax, meaning excess wax accumulates on the rim of the jar. Now, if you ever plan on using this product more than once (which I&#x27;m assuming most people would,) you&#x27;re going to have a bad time. The next time I tried to open the jar, the lid felt like it was cemented on. After about 15 minutes of twisting and turning, the lid finally came off. This wax is an absolute disaster to clean up. Yes, I know the Azure finishing oil helps to remove the wax, but if you drop any, you&#x27;ll end up using more of the oil to scrape it off your furniture than you would on yourself. If you like having to scrape wax off your entire bathroom with a metal spatula and have oil poured all over it, go right ahead and buy this product. And god forbid you can&#x27;t fully close the lid because of all the gunk stuck in the way. But I think you&#x27;ll get the gist. I, for one, would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Fairly easy to use, but my skin reacted to this product.  Cleanup is a bit more challenging than other products I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I find a lot of the other ones are no better but cost more.  But there is at least one other I like better.  Overall, this is quite good.</li>
