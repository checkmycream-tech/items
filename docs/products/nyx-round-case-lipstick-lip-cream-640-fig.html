            <li>It&#x27;s not the best lipstick out there, but for the price it does a great job.</li>
            <li>and it looks great with my skin</li>
            <li>Very nice lipstick.</li>
            <li>I did use a brush to apply and I loved the color, it was creamy.  </li>
            <li>and she loved it.</li>
            <li>Maybe a good alternative to this one.</li>
            <li>These series of lipsticks by NYX are incredibly moisturizing, with a lot of pigment in them and they feel comfortable on the lips.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love everything about this lipstick!</li>
            <li>a beautiful color, feels creamy, smooth and hydrating.</li>
            <li>very smooth and good color</li>
            <li>I can say it coated my sink nicely.</li>
            <li>But even after you had a couple hours with this on you will notice a nice stain on your lips.</li>
            <li>Beautiful color kind of matches my lips, creamy, soft and has a nice glossy-like finish</li>
            <li>Long-lasting and very smooth.</li>
            <li>I recommend them, and i would buy more shades of this collection.</li>
            <li>Pigmented but not over the top.</li>
            <li>it was so overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty fair skin</li>
            <li>and I was so excited!</li>
            <li>It was not the most easy lipstick to work with</li>
            <li>But, I mix it with another color and it looks fine.</li>
            <li>Smooth and feels like a gloss but has color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>(It looks cheap:</li>
            <li>Available at amazon.</li>
            <li>Formula is smooth and even coverage</li>
            <li>I said it wasn&#x27;t easy to apply because when I opened it by pulling the top off, a large chunk of the lipstick fell into the bathroom sink.  </li>
            <li>I recently bought the \\&quot;Soft Matte Lip Cream\\&quot; by NYX and it was absolutely wonderful!</li>
            <li>Nice color, I have pale skin and auburn hair and this color looks good on me, don&#x27;t use it all the time though.</li>
            <li>and it was more like a bright bold pink.</li>
            <li>What a waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am super bummed.</li>
            <li>I know some of the reviews said its a bright pink</li>
            <li>I opened it and put it on right</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say if it lasted all day as I wiped it off and began the clean up of the sink.  </li>
            <li>The color was a bright pink color which might look neonish on warm skin tones but you can tone down the color too.  </li>
            <li>This is the first lipstick I have from this brand</li>
            <li>The color of one coat is sheer and as you add more it becomes opaque.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a nice pink.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use any of their other products, soi wouldn&#x27;t kow about them, but a love the smooth moisturizing way their lipsticks feel, stay full of vibrant color, and last a longtime!  </li>
            <li>It looks more orange on my lips than I expected.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a bit more pink/orange than just pink.</li>
            <li>and I will most likely purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li>I love this color, I usually mix this color with mac&#x27;s pink plaid and i get so many compliment.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a light mauvey pink</li>
            <li>My only complain is that it doent last that long (2 or 3 hours without retouching, maybe more if you dont eat, drink or kiss anyone).</li>
            <li>The color was more pink than I expected, which doesn&#x27;t always go well with my skin tone</li>
            <li>First of all, this fig shade is like a soft barbie pink, anything like the picture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more pink than I thought it would be though.</li>

            <li> so I typically blend it with another color.</li>

            <li> So sad that this color was discontinued! NYX is a soft consistency lipstick, but their new colors hold up against Mac, Sephora, Nars and other expensive brands!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the color. It looks more orange on my lips than I expected. But, I mix it with another color and it looks fine.</li>
            <li> Like this lipstick a lot, not very chalky and definitely lasts for a long time. The color was more pink than I expected, which doesn&#x27;t always go well with my skin tone so I typically blend it with another color. This is the first lipstick I have from this brand and I will most likely purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love everything about this lipstick! Long-lasting and very smooth. It&#x27;s a little more pink than I thought it would be though.</li>
            <li> I like the quality but not the color. It&#x27;s not like I was expecting, it&#x27;s a bit more pink/orange than just pink.</li>
            <li> Very nice lipstick. Smooth and feels like a gloss but has color.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy brand again. Color lasts during day.</li>
            <li> The color was just as shown and described.  I said it wasn&#x27;t easy to apply because when I opened it by pulling the top off, a large chunk of the lipstick fell into the bathroom sink.  When I turned the tube only a small portion was left.  I did use a brush to apply and I loved the color, it was creamy.  I can&#x27;t really say if it lasted all day as I wiped it off and began the clean up of the sink.  I can say it coated my sink nicely.</li>
            <li> I got two lipsticks and got earing with each. The color of one coat is sheer and as you add more it becomes opaque.</li>
            <li> The color was a bright pink color which might look neonish on warm skin tones but you can tone down the color too.  The major drawback was that when applied on lips it felt heavy, unpatchy during application and settled into lip lines.  It was not the most easy lipstick to work with and I did not like the way it applied on the lips</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any of their other products, soi wouldn&#x27;t kow about them, but a love the smooth moisturizing way their lipsticks feel, stay full of vibrant color, and last a longtime!  Not a splurge, either, at these prices.</li>
            <li> Everything I want. Cruety-free. Cheap. (It looks cheap: that is for the case of the product which I don&#x27;t care anyway. Not the way it shows on lips or anything about quality.) Available at amazon. Color I like. Worry-free shopping experience!</li>
            <li> First of all, this fig shade is like a soft barbie pink, anything like the picture. These series of lipsticks by NYX are incredibly moisturizing, with a lot of pigment in them and they feel comfortable on the lips. My only complain is that it doent last that long (2 or 3 hours without retouching, maybe more if you dont eat, drink or kiss anyone). But even after you had a couple hours with this on you will notice a nice stain on your lips. I recommend them, and i would buy more shades of this collection.</li>
            <li> Nice color, I have pale skin and auburn hair and this color looks good on me, don&#x27;t use it all the time though. Formula is smooth and even coverage</li>
            <li> very smooth and good color</li>
            <li> Beautiful color kind of matches my lips, creamy, soft and has a nice glossy-like finish</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a light mauvey pink and it was more like a bright bold pink. I would not buy these lipsticks ever again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best lipstick out there, but for the price it does a great job. Bought it for a friend and she loved it.</li>
            <li> I got my lipstick in mail today and I was so excited! I opened it and put it on right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a beautiful color, feels creamy, smooth and hydrating. I know some of the reviews said its a bright pink but I find it to be a softer pink. Pigmented but not over the top. I have pretty fair skin and it looks great with my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT TASTES LIKE PERFUME! I accidentally licked my lips and it tasted like sprayed perfume in my mouth... after about 10 minutes the taste still hadn&#x27;t gone away and I had to brush my teeth it was so overwhelming.  I have tried to wear it multiple times, and every time I take it off almost immediately. I finally just threw it away. What a waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am super bummed. I use a lot of NYX products and this is the first time I have EVER had anything negative to say. I recently bought the \\&quot;Soft Matte Lip Cream\\&quot; by NYX and it was absolutely wonderful! Maybe a good alternative to this one.</li>
            <li> I love this color, I usually mix this color with mac&#x27;s pink plaid and i get so many compliment. This is my go to lip color</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not true to color but it&#x27;s a nice pink.</li>
