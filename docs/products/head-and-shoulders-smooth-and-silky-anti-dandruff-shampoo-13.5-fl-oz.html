            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>Great shampoo that works for dandruff.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>Awesome price and even better results.</li>
            <li>It has a really pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-smells pleasant</li>
            <li>It smelled good and worked as a dandruff control.  </li>
            <li>It smells so good too.</li>
            <li>This is really good shampoo.  </li>
            <li>However it isn&#x27;t as good at preventing dandruff as Pert Plus.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I am very pleased with this product, and I will be continuing to use it, even if I don&#x27;t have a dandruff issue, because I like the smoothness it gives to my hair.</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely and feels good on the scalp.</li>
            <li>Best review was from my hair dresser that first said &amp;</li>
            <li>It makes my hair sooo silky and shiny, I love it!</li>
            <li>Great smell my hair is silky and smooth</li>
            <li>the wife said she liked this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>in all this is a nice formula.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a light, pleasant fragrance that was not overpowering and did not aggravate my fragrance-sensitive family</li>
            <li>The differentiating feature with this version is the addition of moisturizers that softens and eliminates frizz giving your hair a nice healthy glow</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll fall in love with it.</li>
            <li>This shampoo seems to give me a bit more control over that aspect</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used my regular conditioner and not the companion Head &amp; Shoulders product; the results were excellent.  </li>
            <li>It smells pretty good, compared to most dandruff shampoos.  </li>
            <li>she has no dandruff but did say that her scalp did feel very clean</li>
            <li>pretty good product for your money.</li>
            <li>The Smooth Silky formula has a nice scent and did leave my hair frizz free.</li>
            <li>I might actually be able to get away without the gel by using the Smooth and Silky.</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t think it was too &amp;#34;perfume-y&amp;#34; or too strong.  </li>
            <li>Some might find it too strong</li>
            <li>fragrance is nice ... not masculine and not feminine, just pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is fine, I&#x27;ve never used a dandruff shampoo before.</li>
            <li>Otherwise this is a perfectly fine dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I am fine, so I do associate that effect with this product.</li>
            <li>The Hydration formula has a coconut scent where this Silky Smooth has almost no scent at all (which is fine with me).</li>
            <li>And the lather is super rich!</li>
            <li>but I do like a smooth look for my chin length hair, which I have trimmed every 4 to 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And, did the Silky and Smooth element perform as promised?</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s free shipping over $35 makes this a valuable online purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, if you like the smooth look then then this product delivers.  </li>
            <li>Berry smelling dandruff shampoo works well at both getting rid of flakes and giving hair a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>Has a lovely, light smell and makes my hair feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>The scent is fine, nothing particularly special.</li>
            <li>I also like the way it leaves my scalp shiny clean and itch free.</li>
            <li>these new, niche products make them more relevant now than ever!</li>
            <li>and my hair feels clean and refreshed after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This shampoo seems to get my hair clean.</li>
            <li>Excellent shampo for my old, long hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that will fluctuate but it would still be financially responsible for us to check it out.</li>
            <li>her hair looked full and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>This is another good variety of Head &amp; Shoulders Shampoo that I have had the chance to try recently.  </li>
            <li>This is seriously the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Hair and head feel clean, itch-free and fresh after using this product.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is mild and nice.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>/&gt;About a  teaspoon-worth of shampoo produced a nice lather and provided the cleansing power necessary to produce a glossy, smooth surface.  </li>
            <li>This version has a really nice scent that I like better than some other Head and Shoulders shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>after drying i ran my hands over her hair and it felt very smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo has a pleasant smell that I would describe a mixture of vanilla and cotton candy, not too overwhelming but very different from the standard H&amp;S shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is a great everyday shampoo that will help control dandruff flakes</li>
            <li>In its original incarnation it didn&#x27;t have a pleasant scent and it tended to be very drying, although it did control dandruff and flaking from other causes.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I was pretty excited to give this new Head and Shoulders Smooth and Silky</li>
            <li>milky out of the bottle, but lathers up really well and rich.  </li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t notice the difference but after a few days I began to have fly away hair</li>
            <li>It does leave your hair very soft and easy to brush.  </li>
            <li>The smell did last for awhile after showering, maybe because its new to me, but it feels good.</li>
            <li>This H&amp;S &#x27;Smooth Silky&#x27; shampoo provides all the goodness you&#x27;d expect from your standard Head &amp; Shoulders with a lively and vigorous lather that easily rinses out with a clean and refreshed feel.</li>
            <li>The varieties do not seem to matter as much, though it is nice to know I need not always need a 2-in-1 to achieve the same results.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cost that much, just give it a try!</li>
            <li>I have tried out a number of varieties, though this was my first  experience with &amp;#34;smooth and silky&amp;#34; with 24-hour frizz</li>
            <li>I see no reason to use a topical medication more then need be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my hair is smooth and soft after using it.  </li>
            <li>My first issue with this product was the shipping and delivery.  </li>
            <li>Beyond that, I honestly can&#x27;t tell the difference between how this shampoo cleans my hair and any other shampoo.</li>
            <li>Head &amp; Shoulders  Instant Hydration Dandruff Shampoo, 22.5 Fluid Ounce]] and loved it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Head &amp; Shoulders does indeed control dandruff and for me it does such a good job that I only have to use it once a week.</li>
            <li>The results were fine, and likely better than a traditional shampoo without the added benefit of a conditioner.  </li>
            <li>This variety does a good job of cleaning my hair, and does not any real scent at all, unlike some older H&amp;S products I&#x27;ve tried that had a slightly off-putting scent to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did notice that even without added conditioners, this shampoo made my hair feel much more silky and smooth after drying than usual.  </li>
            <li>To be honest this Silky Smooth version seems to be exactly the same as the one listed above except they smell different.</li>
            <li>and she said that it lathers up really well.  </li>
            <li>Personally I got the smooth shiny</li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves his hair much smoother and shinier.  </li>
            <li>Head &amp; Shoulders Silky Smooth has definite silky feeling to it, I used this a couple of times now and my hair does feel softer.</li>
            <li>My husband and I have always used Head and Shoulders shampoo (he all the time, me only occasionally) for dandruff, and recently I needed a bottle of H&amp;S, so I was happy to have the chance to try this new type out.  </li>
            <li>The longer you leave it on, the more chance the active ingredient has to work.</li>
            <li>When I went to get my hair cut from my usual hairdresser she remarked on my hair and tried guessing what kind of shampoo I was using.</li>
            <li>and this fine hair, when I do let it grow out a bit, tends to be difficult to stay looking nice as I have never in my life used hair spray, oils, etc.  </li>
            <li>Because I have fine textured hair frizz is not normally a problem</li>
            <li>The additive moisturizers do indeed accentuate your hair with a nice sheen and you get the benefits of flake elimination thanks to the incorporation of H&amp;S&#x27; standard active ingredient - 1% pyrithione zinc.</li>
            <li>This variety is similar in many ways to the &amp;#34;moisture care&amp;#34; variety which I also tried recently.</li>
            <li>Finally, it rinses super clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t try the conditioner, because right now I have fairly short hair, and don&#x27;t really need one.  </li>
            <li>I have found it pretty simple to return things to Amazon for this type of issue, but it is always a little bit of a pain.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself started out as just ok.  </li>
            <li>think this is my new Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li>only comment on this particular item is that you will likely get a better value going with a larger sized bottle such as [[ASIN:B0015KS48O Head and Shoulders Smooth and Silky Dandruff Conditioner 23 Fluid Ounce]].  </li>
            <li>My son has hair that does a fair imitation of Bozo the Clown for frizziness &amp; sticking out at odd angles.  </li>
            <li>One other point to consider is that this particular formula utilizes a sweet, fruity scent.</li>
            <li>Like the other version of H&amp;S I reviewed, I found it interesting that this shampoo didn&#x27;t have that characteristic tingling effect at first, and that you can only really feel it after you put in the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty short hair</li>
            <li>the 22.5oz Hydration formula costs about a dollar less then this 13.5oz Silky Smooth version.</li>
            <li>and since I wash my hair on a daily basis can pretty well attest to the fact that no harm has come to my head, scalp or hair so far.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair at all, but does the job right.  </li>
            <li>it rinses out completely.  </li>
            <li>It makes the hair soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair (actually, at this point in my life, I have very little hair and</li>
            <li>have given this stuff, the Smooth Silky version a try and find it to be equal to any of the other formulas they have offered over the years.  </li>
            <li>I started using this because I had trouble finding my original dandruff shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and feel of this shampoo in my hair but after several weeks of daily use, my hair started feeling dried out.  </li>
            <li>First, unlike some other reviewers, I like the smell</li>
            <li>It has a runny consistency similar to the regular Head and Shoulders (which is not a negative).  </li>
            <li>I also have naturally wavy hair, which I try to blow-dry or flat iron into straightness daily.  </li>
            <li>It took 3 days of washing with other shampoos to get it looking normal again.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> My husband and I have always used Head and Shoulders shampoo (he all the time, me only occasionally) for dandruff, and recently I needed a bottle of H&amp;S, so I was happy to have the chance to try this new type out.  </li>

            <li> Finally, it rinses super clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t try the conditioner, because right now I have fairly short hair, and don&#x27;t really need one.  </li>

            <li> Like the other version of H&amp;S I reviewed, I found it interesting that this shampoo didn&#x27;t have that characteristic tingling effect at first, and that you can only really feel it after you put in the conditioner.  </li>

            <li> you are troubled by unsightly dandruff flakes, but prefer using a shampoo that does not dry your hair and leaves it looking like silk, I recommend &amp;#34;Head &amp; Shoulders Smooth Silky Dandruff Shampoo.&amp;#34;</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I love the smell and feel of this shampoo in my hair but after several weeks of daily use, my hair started feeling dried out.  If you need this for dandruff plan on using a conditioner with it.  Otherwise you need to use in moderation.  It smelled good and worked as a dandruff control.  Just plan on using conditioner.  I would recommend</li>
            <li> My husband and I have always used Head and Shoulders shampoo (he all the time, me only occasionally) for dandruff, and recently I needed a bottle of H&amp;S, so I was happy to have the chance to try this new type out.  First, unlike some other reviewers, I like the smell, I didn&#x27;t think it was too &amp;#34;perfume-y&amp;#34; or too strong.  I didn&#x27;t try the conditioner, because right now I have fairly short hair, and don&#x27;t really need one.  I also have naturally wavy hair, which I try to blow-dry or flat iron into straightness daily.  I did notice that even without added conditioners, this shampoo made my hair feel much more silky and smooth after drying than usual.  I have had a bit of &amp;#34;winter dandruff&amp;#34; as I call it, but after using this for a few days, that has disappeared as well.  All in all, I am very pleased with this product, and I will be continuing to use it, even if I don&#x27;t have a dandruff issue, because I like the smoothness it gives to my hair.</li>
            <li> Best review was from my hair dresser that first said &amp;#34;Your hair smells great&amp;#34;, then &amp;#34;Feels great too, what did you use on it?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Very milky out of the bottle, but lathers up really well and rich.  A quality product and fair price!</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve tried a TON of salon brands and expensive store brands - but I always go back to this. It makes my hair sooo silky and shiny, I love it! It smells so good too. When I went to get my hair cut from my usual hairdresser she remarked on my hair and tried guessing what kind of shampoo I was using. She was shocked when I told her it was this! Awesome price and even better results. Would definitely recommend to anyone. I used it with the matching conditioner as well. Don&#x27;t know if that makes a difference to some people or not. It doesn&#x27;t cost that much, just give it a try! You&#x27;ll fall in love with it.</li>
            <li> I have been a regular user of Head &amp; Shoulders products for about two decades. I have tried out a number of varieties, though this was my first  experience with &amp;#34;smooth and silky&amp;#34; with 24-hour frizz control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Head &amp; Shoulders to avoid dandruff issues, and like all of the other varieties, here you get the Pyrithione zinc you need in a dandruff shampoo. Beyond that, I noticed no particular benefit from the &amp;#34;smooth and silky&amp;#34; variety. I usually prefer a 2-in-1 with a conditioner, but in this case it really was not necessary. The results were fine, and likely better than a traditional shampoo without the added benefit of a conditioner.  This variety is similar in many ways to the &amp;#34;moisture care&amp;#34; variety which I also tried recently. In fact, side by side, I could not tell any difference at all between the two apart from their scents - neither of which are unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use Head &amp; Shoulders for the trusted anti-dandruff benefit. The varieties do not seem to matter as much, though it is nice to know I need not always need a 2-in-1 to achieve the same results. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I tried the shampoo and conditioner and my hair looked like it was so oily that it hadn&#x27;t been washed in a week.  It took 3 days of washing with other shampoos to get it looking normal again.  I would only recommend this shampoo for people who have really dry hair.</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders is a product that has been around for over 40 years, maybe longer. In its original incarnation it didn&#x27;t have a pleasant scent and it tended to be very drying, although it did control dandruff and flaking from other causes. My dermatologist originally recommended an imported dandruff shampoo that actually had side effects that included dizziness, plus it was expensive. After reading the instructions for it, I asked her for a different and less expensive product, and she recommended Head and Shoulders, formula of my choice. The Smooth Silky formula has a nice scent and did leave my hair frizz free. Because I have fine textured hair frizz is not normally a problem but I do like a smooth look for my chin length hair, which I have trimmed every 4 to 6 weeks. At this point, I am not sure if I will use it with every shampoo, but definitely once a week.</li>
            <li> I have very thick somewhat wavy hair that can become slightly frizzy when the weather is humid. Therefore, I was pretty excited to give this new Head and Shoulders Smooth and Silky a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foremost, know that if you struggle with flakes (a few or a lot), the physicians on the television show The Doctors suggest using Head and Shoulders ... but, whenever possible, apply a generous amount to your hair and let it sit while you bathe, shave, etc. The longer you leave it on, the more chance the active ingredient has to work. (But don&#x27;t leave it on for hours. LOL!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is nice ... not masculine and not feminine, just pleasant scent. And the lather is super rich! Finally, it rinses super clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many will need a conditioner with this. Head and Shoulders sells a number of separate conditioners (all are excellent). So, grab any of those if you have long hair that requires this extra step (like me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, did the Silky and Smooth element perform as promised? You bet! I was frizz-free all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Head and Shoulders has always been an excellent product ... these new, niche products make them more relevant now than ever!</li>
            <li> The cold dry weather here makes our scalps itchy and dry. I have never used a dandruff shampoo but I was hoping this would help. Neither my husband or I noticed a difference. I also need to follow up with a conditioner as my hair is way to long to not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is fine, I&#x27;ve never used a dandruff shampoo before. My husband says he&#x27;ll use it until it&#x27;s gone but not to buy it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Head &amp; Shoulders Shampoos and all of the different variants of the product for about 40 years now.  It is actually the only shampoo I ever use and since I wash my hair on a daily basis can pretty well attest to the fact that no harm has come to my head, scalp or hair so far.  It does control dandruff quiet well and my hair feels clean and refreshed after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have given this stuff, the Smooth Silky version a try and find it to be equal to any of the other formulas they have offered over the years.  I do not that with this stuff my scalp tends to not feel as dry; a feeling I rather like.  I have very fine hair (actually, at this point in my life, I have very little hair and what little I do have I keep very short) and this fine hair, when I do let it grow out a bit, tends to be difficult to stay looking nice as I have never in my life used hair spray, oils, etc.  This shampoo seems to give me a bit more control over that aspect&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An excellent product in my opinion and I am pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don Blankenship&lt;br /&gt;The Ozarks</li>
            <li> This shampoo seems to get my hair clean. The fragrance is a bit different than other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried. I would describe it as a combination of watermelon and bubble gum. Beyond that, I honestly can&#x27;t tell the difference between how this shampoo cleans my hair and any other shampoo. It does seem to work, and work well, for cleaning my hair.</li>
            <li> This is nothing like the regular version of Head and Shoulders.  It has a really pleasant scent.  It has a runny consistency similar to the regular Head and Shoulders (which is not a negative).  This version does an excellent job of cleansing your hair without stripping it.  My hair is dry so I need a shampoo that will not strip it but I also need one that doesn&#x27;t leave it totally greasy and this one does neither.  This is a great everyday shampoo that will help control dandruff flakes</li>
            <li> great product.  Smells great and lathers up quite well</li>
            <li> Excellent shampo for my old, long hair. It cleans thoroughly without making my hair feel stripped. I also like the way it leaves my scalp shiny clean and itch free.</li>
            <li> Totally not worth it. Way overpriced! You can get the same at your local walmart/target for less than 5 dollars!</li>
            <li> I recently reviewed [[ASIN:B00OP26H0Q Head &amp; Shoulders  Instant Hydration Dandruff Shampoo, 22.5 Fluid Ounce]] and loved it. I&#x27;m no stranger to Head &amp; Shoulders and have been using it for decades. To be honest this Silky Smooth version seems to be exactly the same as the one listed above except they smell different. The Hydration formula has a coconut scent where this Silky Smooth has almost no scent at all (which is fine with me). Americans tend to over-scent themselves anyway). The active ingredients are the same; pyrithione zinc 1%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Head &amp; Shoulders does indeed control dandruff and for me it does such a good job that I only have to use it once a week. I see no reason to use a topical medication more then need be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of the writing of this review the 22.5oz Hydration formula costs about a dollar less then this 13.5oz Silky Smooth version. I&#x27;m sure that will fluctuate but it would still be financially responsible for us to check it out. Amazon&#x27;s free shipping over $35 makes this a valuable online purchase. I&#x27;d like to see them add this to their subscription list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
            <li> gave this to the wife to use.  she used it and she said that it lathers up really well.  it rinses out completely.  after drying i ran my hands over her hair and it felt very smooth and soft.  running my fingers through her hair it felt like i was running my fingers over a silk shirt or pillow.  her hair looked full and bouncy.  the wife said she liked this shampoo.  she has no dandruff but did say that her scalp did feel very clean</li>
            <li> This is really good shampoo.  Like the other version of H&amp;S I reviewed, I found it interesting that this shampoo didn&#x27;t have that characteristic tingling effect at first, and that you can only really feel it after you put in the conditioner.  I&#x27;ll get this again.</li>
            <li> This is another good variety of Head &amp; Shoulders Shampoo that I have had the chance to try recently.  It&#x27;s active ingredient Pyrithione Zinc (1%) has always worked for me in controlling my minor dandruff.  This variety does a good job of cleaning my hair, and does not any real scent at all, unlike some older H&amp;S products I&#x27;ve tried that had a slightly off-putting scent to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only comment on this particular item is that you will likely get a better value going with a larger sized bottle such as [[ASIN:B0015KS48O Head and Shoulders Smooth and Silky Dandruff Conditioner 23 Fluid Ounce]].  Otherwise this is a perfectly fine dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for volume then you will need to look at another product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you like the smooth look then then this product delivers.  Personally I got the smooth shiny look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s Head &amp; Shoulders so it will take care of the dandruff.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great! Has a lovely, light smell and makes my hair feel fresh and clean. It works great and I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li> My son has hair that does a fair imitation of Bozo the Clown for frizziness &amp; sticking out at odd angles.  This shampoo leaves his hair much smoother and shinier.  It lathers nicely and feels good on the scalp.</li>
            <li> I started using this because I had trouble finding my original dandruff shampoo.  It smells pretty good, compared to most dandruff shampoos.  It does leave your hair very soft and easy to brush.  However it isn&#x27;t as good at preventing dandruff as Pert Plus.  Overall though pretty good product for your money.</li>
            <li> This H&amp;S &#x27;Smooth Silky&#x27; shampoo provides all the goodness you&#x27;d expect from your standard Head &amp; Shoulders with a lively and vigorous lather that easily rinses out with a clean and refreshed feel. The differentiating feature with this version is the addition of moisturizers that softens and eliminates frizz giving your hair a nice healthy glow afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a nice formula. The additive moisturizers do indeed accentuate your hair with a nice sheen and you get the benefits of flake elimination thanks to the incorporation of H&amp;S&#x27; standard active ingredient - 1% pyrithione zinc. One other point to consider is that this particular formula utilizes a sweet, fruity scent. Some might find it too strong but I found it acceptable enough.</li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders Silky Smooth has definite silky feeling to it, I used this a couple of times now and my hair does feel softer. The shampoo has a pleasant smell that I would describe a mixture of vanilla and cotton candy, not too overwhelming but very different from the standard H&amp;S shampoo. The smell did last for awhile after showering, maybe because its new to me, but it feels good.</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo. Some of the features are as follows:-&lt;br /&gt;1) The fragrance is mild and nice.&lt;br /&gt;2) It rinses off 99% of dandruff flakes from the scalp and hair.&lt;br /&gt;3) It makes the hair soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;4) My hair feels healthier after each and every use.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-24 hour frizz control&lt;br /&gt;-always eliminates flakes for me&lt;br /&gt;-smells pleasant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-none</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Head &amp; Shoulders Smooth Silky Dandruff Shampoo&amp;#34; leaves your hair silky smooth and helps get rid of those annoying &amp;#34;snowflakes&amp;#34;.  This shampoo has a light, pleasant fragrance that was not overpowering and did not aggravate my fragrance-sensitive family members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a  teaspoon-worth of shampoo produced a nice lather and provided the cleansing power necessary to produce a glossy, smooth surface.  I used my regular conditioner and not the companion Head &amp; Shoulders product; the results were excellent.  I dried my hair as I usually do and finished it using a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are troubled by unsightly dandruff flakes, but prefer using a shampoo that does not dry your hair and leaves it looking like silk, I recommend &amp;#34;Head &amp; Shoulders Smooth Silky Dandruff Shampoo.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> this does not contain conditioner</li>
            <li> This is the same as all the other Head &amp; Shoulders products I have tried. It just works. The scent is fine, nothing particularly special.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo that works for dandruff.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair at all, but does the job right.  There is no medicine smell and my hair is smooth and soft after using it.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Berry smelling dandruff shampoo works well at both getting rid of flakes and giving hair a smooth finish. Does not smell medicinal at all, which is a big plus. White, creamy shampoo suds up well. Hair and head feel clean, itch-free and fresh after using this product. Contains the active ingredient Pyrithione zinc to combat dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My first issue with this product was the shipping and delivery.  I opened to liquid on the bottle and surrounding packaging.  I have found it pretty simple to return things to Amazon for this type of issue, but it is always a little bit of a pain.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself started out as just ok.  I used it for a week and found that it left my hair feeling a little bit dryer than it was.  At first I didn&#x27;t notice the difference but after a few days I began to have fly away hair and it just felt dry.&lt;br /&gt;A week back on my other shampoo and I am fine, so I do associate that effect with this product.</li>
            <li> Great smell my hair is silky and smooth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time user of Head and Shoulders so it&#x27;s my go-to shampoo. This version has a really nice scent that I like better than some other Head and Shoulders shampoos I&#x27;ve tried. It also left my hair less frizzy than it usually would be. I have pretty short hair so I tend to let it air dry and then use a bit of gel. I might actually be able to get away without the gel by using the Smooth and Silky. One other thing I like about this version is that it doesn&#x27;t have whatever some of the other Head and Shoulders have in it that makes your head feeling tingly/cool. I don&#x27;t like that at all, especially if it gets on your forehead. No burning or weird sensations here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is my new Head and Shoulders.</li>
