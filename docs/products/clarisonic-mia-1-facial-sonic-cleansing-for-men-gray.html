            <li>I contacted Perfect Skin MD</li>

            <li>It is a very good product.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for a friend because I have been using a Mia 2 myself for about a year now with great results.</li>
            <li>I am happy to have it.  </li>
            <li>Great product I had to get used to it</li>
            <li>Great product!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Otherwise, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>Anyways, this was a great investment for $85 sale price.</li>
            <li>It cleans great.</li>
            <li>I was blown away at how good a job it does.</li>
            <li>his own separate brush) and loved the way it made his skin feel.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Love my clarisonic!</li>
            <li>My favorite nighttime ritual!</li>
            <li>LOVE this!</li>
            <li>I love my Clari!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know that until after I received mine, which is nice because I don&#x27;t like standing at a sink to wash my face and getting water everywhere.</li>
            <li>ive never been more satisfied and happy with a product in my life.</li>
            <li>very impressive, my face is much cleaner than before</li>
            <li>And yes, this is a verified AUTHENTIC Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>Did most of what it was suppose to.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Everyone loves it because their skin feels cleaner and looks better within just a couple days.</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>I continue to use the Mia 2-3 times a week, but I have no idea if my skin looks any better.</li>
            <li>Hmm, I&#x27;m sure Sephora will tell me.</li>
            <li>I love the Mia, I have had one for a year</li>
            <li>I have been using this for more than a month now</li>
            <li>skin is clearer and feels better than it ever has before.  </li>
            <li>and I am really pleased with how well it works.  </li>
            <li>Need I say more.</li>
            <li>this is the best way to ensure clean and clear face...</li>
            <li>It is very light and its easy to charge it.</li>
            <li>soon, after the first week, and still, i am getting better and better results.</li>
            <li>Which is a huge pain because it takes about 12 hours to charge according to the instructions.</li>
            <li>but with the color i bought the led light to indicate if its fully charge is not visible</li>
            <li>Anyhow, rest assured that is not an issue and although I can&#x27;t speak to the manufacturers warranty being honored, the product I received was a genuine Clairsonic</li>
            <li>so far its a good buy</li>
            <li>I was really excited to purchase this.</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also true that Clarisonic will not honor the warranty on devices purchased through Amazon, but Amazon accepted the return without a problem.</li>
            <li>I love clarasonic products, I just have a question about this particular model.</li>
            <li>I held off from purchasing one for years because (a) I am not one to throw money at junk and expect a life transformation in return, and (b) I have dry, as opposed to acne-prone, skin, so I was unsure whether I was a good</li>
            <li>I own one myself and use it daily.</li>
            <li>I definitely would&#x27;ve liked to know before I bought it.</li>
            <li>This is the third one I&#x27;ve bought as a gift since everyone comments on how nice my skin has been looking.</li>
            <li>and it looked like it came right off the shelf at a store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great little machine, I got hooked while using my girlfriends, my face is soft and clean, I also use the Cetaphil Gentle skin cleanser.</li>
            <li>Shortly after my friend opened their gift I realized that there was no LED light to indicate when it was charging or full.</li>
            <li>Contacted Clarisonic directly to find out that the gray color prevents the LED light from showing through.</li>
            <li>The LED  indicator never came on while charging the brush the first time.</li>
            <li>and I could see results the first 2 days.  </li>
            <li>first use</li>
            <li>Perfect Skin MD - Amazon Marketplace &amp;#60;n6yqs7wvryf5v1b@marketplace.amazon.com&amp;#62; is the seller that sold me a fake Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>They look exactly alike.  </li>
            <li>and it looked resolved based on more recent ones.  </li>
            <li>three weeks into the purchase, i would gladly pay double.</li>
            <li>I love this facial brush.</li>
            <li>I have had people say my skin looks soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>She saw and felt immediate positive changes.</li>
            <li>Very good product, small enough for travel.</li>
            <li>Sent the first one back because I thought the LED (charging notification) light didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>There are women of a certain set who worhsip at the altar of the Clairsonic.</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t think the company will bother publicizing that information although the person I talked to agreed that it should be stated.</li>
            <li>a dry-skinned person, I always use 3 levels of moisturizer after cleansing (serum, day/night cream, and eye cream), but after using the Mia, I feel as though I&#x27;m ready for a 4th level.</li>
            <li>This thing looks real.  </li>
            <li>verified that one is real.  </li>
            <li>I love the results from using it, and I really like the whole device in general, but I&#x27;m removing a star for the hassle  of misrepresentation with the grey model.  </li>
            <li>the transformation is more than skin deep, but as lame as it sounds, i feel beautiful in my bare skin.</li>
            <li>Been seeing some mixed reviews on here and would really like to know if it&#x27;s worth  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I would normally recommend Clarisonic to everyone.</li>
            <li>Normally would not go out of my way to say anything about it,</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, fair, dry, slightly acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>biggest gripes are how long it holds a charge (Lasts about a week or two, compared with my electric razor, which lasts nearly a month without a charge) and the fact that it turns itself off after 60 seconds instead of giving out a special pulse to let me know (I like to use it a tad longer than the minute it suggests).</li>
            <li>Then I ordered a replacement directly from Clarisonic, and the LED didn&#x27;t work on that one either!  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a quick modern solution to washclothes but didn&#x27;t want to go overboard with skin care.  </li>
            <li>I finally got tired of my boyfriend borrowing mine, so I surprised him with one of his own.</li>
            <li>When I contacted Clarisonic regarding the LED, they informed me that the light does not shine through the dark color of the grey model.  </li>
            <li>Clearly I wasn&#x27;t the only one who had called on the matter.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s pretty metro and LOVES his new little gadget!!</li>
            <li>i went through a small adjustment phase with the product, but it was only mild breakouts.</li>
            <li>I bought one of these Mia devices for my nephew (bad acne problem) and before I knew it I had ordered 6 more for my whole household!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Using this is a bit arduous because you are supposed to remove your makeup first (in the old days, that&#x27;s why you washed your face).</li>

            <li> /&gt;Using this is a bit arduous because you are supposed to remove your makeup first (in the old days, that&#x27;s why you washed your face).</li>
            <li> first I was apprehensive  about ordering from Amazon because of the &amp;#34;authorized dealer&amp;#34; problem and other reviewers problems with receiving fake versions from a certain vendor.  </li>
            <li> THE GREY COLOR IS MENS - which is NOT stated anywhere on this listing.  </li>
            <li> assist in deep cleaning of pores and delivery of other products used afterwards..</li>
            <li> With the ultra sensitive brush head, and my usual face wash, I can use this every night with no irritation what so ever.</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller, and I&#x27;ve had little to no breakouts in the year since I&#x27;ve been us using it.</li>
            <li> expensive but worth it..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to decide whether to stick with this or just use a traditional exfoliator a few times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really works as well as described and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> However, it slowly holds less of a charge to the point now that I have to recharge it after every single use!</li>
            <li> this morning, i woke up without a single break out, a tone face, and scars slowly disappearing.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, since I bought from Amazon, my gift is not covered by warranty although it&#x27;s clearly a manufacturer&#x27;s defect.</li>
            <li> Now I have to buy those wipe thingies, which are not cheap.</li>
            <li> Clarisonic would stand behind any product that is authentic, but not this broken fake.</li>
            <li> I was always shocked after I washed my face and then used an astringent and saw how much makeup was still on my face.</li>
            <li> and they informed me I had actually paid for a fake without knowing it.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t usually have acne anymore.</li>
            <li> I spoke to Clarisonic on the phone today to try to get my broken (fake) Clarisonic fixed</li>
            <li> I have always had annoying acne popping up now and then and generally sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and they said there is no such thing as a fake -- wrong!  </li>
            <li> Not sure what all the people are writing about saying they received fake products or unlicensed seller products.</li>
            <li> No complaints and FYI when it randomly buzzes that means the battery is dying.</li>
            <li> Sooooo Is this item Real or Fake?</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the quality for the price.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was purchased as a present.  I have heard no complaints from the recipient.  I own one myself and use it daily. LOVE IT! I&#x27;ve recommended this product to others, like my sister, and she loves hers as well. She saw and felt immediate positive changes.</li>
            <li> Ive noticed a change in my son&#x27;s face already. Yeah I bought it for my son&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> it do not work at all：（&lt;br /&gt;I had sent it back March 31, and no money have returnd.</li>
            <li> Love my clarisonic! I can definitely tell the difference between when I wash my face with just my hands versus using the clarisonic. Wish they sold replacement chargers though.</li>
            <li> **UPDATE** Clarisonic didn&#x27;t publish the review I put on their site about this problem, nor have they publicized anything about their defect. I will try posting again and see what happens.   I bought this as a gift for a friend because I have been using a Mia 2 myself for about a year now with great results. I would normally recommend Clarisonic to everyone. Shortly after my friend opened their gift I realized that there was no LED light to indicate when it was charging or full. Tried multiple outlets, but still nothing.  Contacted Clarisonic directly to find out that the gray color prevents the LED light from showing through. Or so they say. I have no idea whether it&#x27;s actually working or not, and I&#x27;m not going to try and scratch off the paint to find out. And yes, this is a verified AUTHENTIC Clarisonic. Unfortunately, since I bought from Amazon, my gift is not covered by warranty although it&#x27;s clearly a manufacturer&#x27;s defect. I definitely would&#x27;ve liked to know before I bought it. Probably would&#x27;ve gone with a different color.  Normally would not go out of my way to say anything about it, but I really don&#x27;t think the company will bother publicizing that information although the person I talked to agreed that it should be stated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s making a difference on my son&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> Did most of what it was suppose to.  Need a tougher bristle option</li>
            <li> Very good product, small enough for travel.</li>
            <li> I love clarasonic products, I just have a question about this particular model. The LED  indicator never came on while charging the brush the first time. Is this the way this brush works? How are you suppose to know when it&#x27;s fully charged.</li>
            <li> Sent the first one back because I thought the LED (charging notification) light didn&#x27;t work.  It&#x27;s also true that Clarisonic will not honor the warranty on devices purchased through Amazon, but Amazon accepted the return without a problem. Then I ordered a replacement directly from Clarisonic, and the LED didn&#x27;t work on that one either!  When I contacted Clarisonic regarding the LED, they informed me that the light does not shine through the dark color of the grey model.  Clearly I wasn&#x27;t the only one who had called on the matter.  I love the results from using it, and I really like the whole device in general, but I&#x27;m removing a star for the hassle  of misrepresentation with the grey model.  The diagram and usage manual describing the LED charging-light is in the packaging even when they know it doesn&#x27;t work on that model.</li>
            <li> have three  of these.. one for myself and two sons... this is the best way to ensure clean and clear face... assist in deep cleaning of pores and delivery of other products used afterwards.. expensive but worth it.. these lasts for years..</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this... so I bought it.  I love it.  Its been about a month now.... and I could see results the first 2 days.  My skin is clearer and softer.  I have had people say my skin looks soft and clean.  I would recommend this to others... I am happy to have it.  PERFECT!</li>
            <li> I bought one of these Mia devices for my nephew (bad acne problem) and before I knew it I had ordered 6 more for my whole household!  Everyone loves it because their skin feels cleaner and looks better within just a couple days.</li>
            <li> Great product I had to get used to it but I love it.</li>
            <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels amazon after use and my face is totally clear!&lt;br /&gt;My biggest gripes are how long it holds a charge (Lasts about a week or two, compared with my electric razor, which lasts nearly a month without a charge) and the fact that it turns itself off after 60 seconds instead of giving out a special pulse to let me know (I like to use it a tad longer than the minute it suggests). Otherwise, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> There are women of a certain set who worhsip at the altar of the Clairsonic. I held off from purchasing one for years because (a) I am not one to throw money at junk and expect a life transformation in return, and (b) I have dry, as opposed to acne-prone, skin, so I was unsure whether I was a good candidate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I caved to boredom and aging when I was furloughed and pulled the trigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this is a bit arduous because you are supposed to remove your makeup first (in the old days, that&#x27;s why you washed your face). Now I have to buy those wipe thingies, which are not cheap. So I take my eye makeup off with eye makeup remover, then use a wipe for the face, then use the Mia. Then moisturize assiduosly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On first use, I thought my skin felt a bit softer afterwards. I continue to use the Mia 2-3 times a week, but I have no idea if my skin looks any better. I&#x27;m trying to decide whether to stick with this or just use a traditional exfoliator a few times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a dry-skinned person, I always use 3 levels of moisturizer after cleansing (serum, day/night cream, and eye cream), but after using the Mia, I feel as though I&#x27;m ready for a 4th level. What is the 4th level of moisturizing? Hmm, I&#x27;m sure Sephora will tell me.</li>
            <li> Perfect Skin MD - Amazon Marketplace &amp;#60;n6yqs7wvryf5v1b@marketplace.amazon.com&amp;#62; is the seller that sold me a fake Clarisonic.  I spoke to Clarisonic on the phone today to try to get my broken (fake) Clarisonic fixed and they informed me I had actually paid for a fake without knowing it.  I contacted Perfect Skin MD and they said there is no such thing as a fake -- wrong!  This thing looks real.  I had no idea.  It has a number on the handle that Clarisonic can validate.  I also have one I purchased from Neiman Marcus and Clarisonic verified that one is real.  They look exactly alike.  Beware...I will never buy another Clarisonic from an unauthorized dealer.  Now, Perfect Skin MD refuses to refund my money.  Clarisonic would stand behind any product that is authentic, but not this broken fake.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to purchase this. I was always shocked after I washed my face and then used an astringent and saw how much makeup was still on my face. I do feel like it is cleaning my face but I also feel that it is causing me to have breakouts. I am in my 50s so I don&#x27;t usually have acne anymore. Debating trying a different brush to see if that would make a difference.</li>
            <li> Sooooo Is this item Real or Fake? Been seeing some mixed reviews on here and would really like to know if it&#x27;s worth  buying</li>
            <li> This is the second cleaner I have bought. I love the Mia, I have had one for a year and I noticed a difference in the wrinkles around my eyes within a week. My husband started using mine(with his own separate brush) and loved the way it made his skin feel. Bought the second because 2 people using it we were having to charge every 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the hype of this product.  I use it daily, but am not noticing any difference.</li>
            <li> so far its a good buy but with the color i bought the led light to indicate if its fully charge is not visible so i would suggest to others to just buy the white one.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for more than a month now and it is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was apprehensive  about ordering from Amazon because of the &amp;#34;authorized dealer&amp;#34; problem and other reviewers problems with receiving fake versions from a certain vendor.  I went ahead and got it because those issues seemed to be months back and it looked resolved based on more recent ones.  Anyhow, rest assured that is not an issue and although I can&#x27;t speak to the manufacturers warranty being honored, the product I received was a genuine Clairsonic and it looked like it came right off the shelf at a store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is clearer and feels better than it ever has before.  I have always had annoying acne popping up now and then and generally sensitive skin. I was looking for a quick modern solution to washclothes but didn&#x27;t want to go overboard with skin care.  Anyhow I gave this a shot and I am really pleased with how well it works.  I use it once a day for two minutes and it has made a noticeable difference.  I would encourage anyone who is on the fence to go ahead and give it a shot.  It really works as well as described and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.  No complaints and FYI when it randomly buzzes that means the battery is dying.</li>
            <li> This is a great little machine, I got hooked while using my girlfriends, my face is soft and clean, I also use the Cetaphil Gentle skin cleanser.</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt so clean. This is a great product. I bought the black/gray Mia 1 and registered it in Clarisonic&#x27;s website with no problem. Not sure what all the people are writing about saying they received fake products or unlicensed seller products. Anyways, this was a great investment for $85 sale price. I was blown away at how good a job it does. AND it&#x27;s waterproof so you can keep it in the shower. I didn&#x27;t know that until after I received mine, which is nice because I don&#x27;t like standing at a sink to wash my face and getting water everywhere. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> THE GREY COLOR IS MENS - which is NOT stated anywhere on this listing.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My favorite nighttime ritual!</li>
            <li> LOVE this! Best thing to happen to my skin ever. I have sensitive, fair, dry, slightly acne prone skin. With the ultra sensitive brush head, and my usual face wash, I can use this every night with no irritation what so ever. My pores are smaller, and I&#x27;ve had little to no breakouts in the year since I&#x27;ve been us using it. This is the third one I&#x27;ve bought as a gift since everyone comments on how nice my skin has been looking.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product. It is very light and its easy to charge it. You can even take it into the shower.</li>
            <li> Delivery was as promised.  This cleansing system is awesome.  Because it vibrates and does not rotate it also stimulates your skin.</li>
            <li> the clarisonic mia has changed my life. after hearing friends and coworkers rant of the benefits, i decided to just finally make the purchase. in comparison to the amount of money i spend on skin clearing products, monthly, i figured i would pay off the clarisonic in three months. three weeks into the purchase, i would gladly pay double. i went through a small adjustment phase with the product, but it was only mild breakouts. soon, after the first week, and still, i am getting better and better results. this morning, i woke up without a single break out, a tone face, and scars slowly disappearing. this hasn&#x27;t happened since before my teenage years. ive never been more satisfied and happy with a product in my life. the transformation is more than skin deep, but as lame as it sounds, i feel beautiful in my bare skin.</li>
            <li> very impressive, my face is much cleaner than before</li>
            <li> What a big difference in my teenage boys face even after trying Proactive, Facial peel, derm appts.  Need I say more.</li>
            <li> I love this facial brush. It cleans great. However, it slowly holds less of a charge to the point now that I have to recharge it after every single use! Which is a huge pain because it takes about 12 hours to charge according to the instructions. Very disappointed in the quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I love my Clari! I&#x27;ve had mine for about 2+ years and it&#x27;s become a necessity in my daily routine. I finally got tired of my boyfriend borrowing mine, so I surprised him with one of his own. He&#x27;s pretty metro and LOVES his new little gadget!!</li>
