            <li> The only problem I have with it is that it takes a long time to finally work.</li>
            <li> I bought 4 and used them for 2 month, no significant result so far.</li>
            <li> I used about half the bottle twice a day only on my chin and upper lip, and I saw absolutely no change.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few weeks but can say that it does work when used regularly.  </li>
            <li> I used this product for 3 full bottles and sadly saw no difference.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my hair is finer and grows back at a slightly slower rate.  </li>
            <li> I will continue using the this product  in the morning and at night until  my bottle is empty.  </li>
            <li> I will continue using it, since I cant return it, but have absolutely no hopes.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> It kept sticking in the down position.</li>
            <li> but it does help minimize the appearance and hopefully it will help me wax less often.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to remove my hair from my belly or lower abs, and readjust my hairline from round to Medium V-Shape.</li>
            <li> I feel like I waste some product when spraying</li>
            <li> The past week and a half I have not used it every day as directed.  </li>
            <li> the area that i wanted to grow no more</li>
            <li> and it does slow the growth process.</li>
            <li> and I still have growing facial hair :(</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised without irritating or damaging my skin.</li>
            <li> i noticed the smell getting worse over time</li>
            <li> I will chalk this up to trial and error, but frankly this was an expensive error.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it has parabens!  </li>
            <li> Too bad.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like it very much, it&#x27;s so comfortable. As I purchased from amazon, it didn&#x27;t take any of my time, and the price is good.&lt;br /&gt;Neuza Golding</li>
            <li> I followed directions exactly with this product but did not see any significant hair reduction.  Since then I&#x27;ve been using it once a day (evenings) for about 2 weeks.  It seems like my regrowth is coming in finer now, so maybe over time it will stop completely, as advertised.  One thing I like is that this product does not irritate my sensitive skin.  I&#x27;m willing to keep using it as long as I&#x27;m seeing progress.</li>
            <li> This product works as advertised without irritating or damaging my skin.</li>
            <li> Item arrived timely. Was purchased as a gift. Person I gave this as a present appears happy and have never complained or said anything good or bad. I can&#x27;t give an opinion of the lasting or quality feature.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this productos is only for certain people because it didn&#x27;t work at all for me. I&#x27;ve been using it for two months and there is not a slight change.</li>
            <li> Did not do what it said it would do. I used this product for 3 full bottles and sadly saw no difference.</li>
            <li> I was surprised but the hair did grow back less and less every time I used it, it is a great product</li>
            <li> this item regular water inside  please do not buy this item</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it works.  the area that i wanted to grow no more but it still grow normally, nothing is changed.</li>
            <li> I believe that the hair may have been reduced but it wasn&#x27;t like the description.  I applied the product immediately after waxing and twice daily throughout the next week.  I continued with one application for the following week.  The effects may have been just because I waxed the area prior to applying.  While it was easy to put on and didn&#x27;t harm the skin, I didn&#x27;t feel like it was worth the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this to remove my hair from my belly or lower abs, and readjust my hairline from round to Medium V-Shape.</li>
            <li> Used this product for months and it smells a lot like urine. i noticed the smell getting worse over time and I still have growing facial hair :(</li>
            <li> I bought 4 and used them for 2 month, no significant result so far. I am still using them and will talk about the result later.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions; however, it did not work.  Hair kept growing at the same ol&#x27; rate.  This product is definately overpriced.  The spray pump nozzle even didn&#x27;t work.  It kept sticking in the down position.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the promise of pure, organic ingredients. Unfortunately, it has parabens!  Too bad.  Will be returning it.</li>
            <li> Is painless and works like a charm</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Easy to use and it does slow the growth process. I highly recommend  this product.</li>
            <li> It was very sticky when applied. Didn&#x27;t see any results after using it daily for almost month. I expected better for the price.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but it actually works really well. The only problem I have with it is that it takes a long time to finally work.</li>
            <li> So far I been using it for three weeks and I have not seen any change yet.  I have puck and shave my hair thinking it would give me a better results but nothing.  I will continue using the this product  in the morning and at night until  my bottle is empty.  It hasn&#x27;t work on my Carmel coffee skin. I will keep you posted if something change for me.</li>
            <li> I used about half the bottle twice a day only on my chin and upper lip, and I saw absolutely no change. I will continue using it, since I cant return it, but have absolutely no hopes. I am still looking for a hair inhibiting solution, which actually works. I will chalk this up to trial and error, but frankly this was an expensive error.</li>
            <li> Hair growth inhibitor works wonderful.</li>
            <li> makes a difference, but not total or permanent.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few weeks but can say that it does work when used regularly.  The first 2 weeks I used as directed and didn&#x27;t really notice anything.  The past week and a half I have not used it every day as directed.  I have noticed that my hair is finer and grows back at a slightly slower rate.  I can&#x27;t see this permanently removing my leg hair but it does help minimize the appearance and hopefully it will help me wax less often.  The product is very runny so you have to be quick at rubbing it in after spraying it.  It would be nice if it were in a lotion form.  I feel like I waste some product when spraying and sometimes it drips off my legs before I can rub it in.  It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor.</li>
