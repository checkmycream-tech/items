    <ol>
            <li>Thank you Palmers for making a great product through the years!</li>
            <li>My lips stay perfectly moisturized with this on.</li>
            <li>is a great product!</li>
            <li>My search for the perfect lip balm is over.</li>
            <li>This is the best.</li>
            <li>Best product for cracked lips.</li>
            <li>This is great for lips, cuticles, and for helping to fade scars.</li>
            <li>It was good, until I lost 2</li>
            <li>If you want a good product for your lips then this is the one to get.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really good price as well; the stick is about the size of an Elmer&#x27;s glue stick (in fact, when my sister saw the order, that&#x27;s what she thought it was).</li>
            <li>Good product; 4 stars (with one deducted for the fragrance).</li>
            <li>I apply this and within 5 minutes I&#x27;m good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is amazing chappstick I ever used.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and does the job.</li>
            <li>:) If you like a good value, protected and soothed lips, the smell of cocoa, and don&#x27;t mind carrying your lip balm anywhere</li>
            <li>The twist up packaging makes this very easy to dispense.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 20 years, and have recommended it to many friends.  </li>
            <li>As a 27-year-old woman, I have tried many lip products including balms, chapsticks, glosses, and lipsticks.</li>
            <li>When you open the cap and apply the product, it smells absolutely wonderful and chocolatey, although the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming like a chocolate bar.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>That sold its usefulness to me. :)&lt;</li>
            <li>, you also have to consider that it&#x27;s not going to fit nicely into a pants pocket or anything.</li>
            <li>It works and is much better.</li>
            <li>I love the stick.</li>
            <li>If Palmer&#x27;s loved me they would send me a replacement just because I love it so much.</li>
            <li>Easy to carry around.</li>
            <li>Soft, smooth, and pleasant smell (a light vanilla).</li>
            <li>Very worth it.</li>
            <li>This cocoa butter stick works great as a lip balm, but you can also use it for dry cuticles.</li>
            <li>she gets dry and chapped and this is great for her because it will not hurt if she licks</li>
            <li>Great chap stick for dry, sore, cracked lips.  </li>
            <li>This is a great chapstick to moisturize lips during the very dry winter months.  </li>
            <li>Coco butter has always had the most pleasant smell, hydrates amazingly without any greasy feel, and doesn&#x27;t taste weird.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me and used a different product to protect your lips and a different one to soothe them if they got chapped, then this Swivel Stick is your perfect 2-in-1 solution, as it does both jobs!</li>
            <li>Lancome&#x27;s Juicy Tubes or Estee Lauder&#x27;s High Gloss for lip gloss, Estee Lauder&#x27;s Pure Color Lipstick for lipstick, and honorable-mention lip balm Smith&#x27;s Mocha Rose Lip Balm with Vanilla (in tube form).protected and soothed lips,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this instead of lip balm as suggested by Dr. Oz on his show and he&#x27;s right.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stick for a week now and it really helps my chapped lips!</li>
            <li>This stuff hydrates my lips pleasantly without the weird waxy aftereffects of most chapsticks.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as handy to carry as a small &amp;#34;chap stick&amp;#34; trype produst but is much better and doesn&#x27;t seem to get so melty and soft as some do</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m actually having a huge hissy fit right now as my two year old has lost this for me</li>
            <li>After the first time applying it to my chinked lips, I felt my lips were much softer and smoother than before.</li>
            <li>like I do, I recommend the following products that have given me no negative reactions: Lancome&#x27;s Juicy Tubes or Estee Lauder&#x27;s High Gloss for lip gloss, Estee Lauder&#x27;s Pure Color Lipstick for lipstick, and honorable-mention lip balm Smith&#x27;s Mocha Rose Lip Balm with Vanilla (in tube form).</li>
            <li>I am verypleases with this, doesn&#x27;t make my lips feel dry like most lip products do.</li>
            <li>A bit large.</li>
            <li>Not only are these great for keeping your lips from chapping, but they&#x27;re great for rubbing on your knuckles when they start drying over a cold Buffalo Winter!  </li>
            <li>And it works great on any little facial blemish.</li>
            <li>and I really need it.</li>
            <li>I have had an allergic reaction to some of the &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; form balms, including Chapstick brand and Carmex (the jar is still okay, though), causing my lips to swell and blister, so I am very careful when purchasing new lip products.</li>
            <li>Seriously never use anything else ever again..</li>
            <li>Left my lips very soft after the very first try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a somewhat unnatural chocolate fragrance, but so far, it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>I have narrowed down the irritant to either lanolin or parrafin wax, and luckily, this product has neither</li>
            <li>like I do, I recommend the following products that have given me no negative reactions:</li>
            <li>Any time my lips are dry, windblown or sunburned (I live in CO)</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Better than Carmex imo, since that stuff smells mega weird to me and tastes nasty if you accidentally get any in your mouth.</li>
            <li> As it is I will be ordering again if I can&#x27;t find it; guess I&#x27;ll have to do a serious cleaning of the house.</li>
            <li> I recommend reapplying several times a day if you have badly chapped lips.</li>
            <li> I even went out in this year&#x27;s negative double-digits weather in Illinois while wearing this on my lips, and they didn&#x27;t get chapped at all!</li>
            <li> No more bloody, dry, cracked, painful lips for me.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it is quite faint, so even if you buy the stuff and dislike the scent, you can still use it on your lips without being bothered.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty aftertaste like some chapsticks.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This cocoa butter stick works great as a lip balm, but you can also use it for dry cuticles. It has a chocolately cocoa smell. The stick is larger than a typical lip balm like Chapstick, so it&#x27;s a decent value.</li>
            <li> It was good, until I lost 2</li>
            <li> I am verypleases with this, doesn&#x27;t make my lips feel dry like most lip products do. It isn&#x27;t as handy to carry as a small &amp;#34;chap stick&amp;#34; trype produst but is much better and doesn&#x27;t seem to get so melty and soft as some do</li>
            <li> Seriously never use anything else ever again.. This stuff hydrates my lips pleasantly without the weird waxy aftereffects of most chapsticks. Better than Carmex imo, since that stuff smells mega weird to me and tastes nasty if you accidentally get any in your mouth. Coco butter has always had the most pleasant smell, hydrates amazingly without any greasy feel, and doesn&#x27;t taste weird. I&#x27;m a life convert.</li>
            <li> Left my lips very soft after the very first try. Very worth it.</li>
            <li> If you want a good product for your lips then this is the one to get.  It smells nice and does the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 20 years, and have recommended it to many friends.  Thank you Palmers for making a great product through the years!</li>
            <li> I buy these by the dozen for my &amp;#34;lip balm addicted&amp;#34; wife.  Not only are these great for keeping your lips from chapping, but they&#x27;re great for rubbing on your knuckles when they start drying over a cold Buffalo Winter!  The twist up packaging makes this very easy to dispense.</li>
            <li> This is a great chapstick to moisturize lips during the very dry winter months.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty aftertaste like some chapsticks.</li>
            <li> As a 27-year-old woman, I have tried many lip products including balms, chapsticks, glosses, and lipsticks. I have had an allergic reaction to some of the &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; form balms, including Chapstick brand and Carmex (the jar is still okay, though), causing my lips to swell and blister, so I am very careful when purchasing new lip products. I have narrowed down the irritant to either lanolin or parrafin wax, and luckily, this product has neither (although it does have mineral oil).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my experience with it...&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Cost-efficient. For the price, you are getting a lot of product!&lt;br /&gt;2. Fragrance. When you open the cap and apply the product, it smells absolutely wonderful and chocolatey, although the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming like a chocolate bar.&lt;br /&gt;3. Moisturizes well. My lips stay perfectly moisturized with this on. It also doesn&#x27;t dry out, clump, or flake some other lip balm formulas.&lt;br /&gt;4. Long-lasting. Once applied, this product stays in place and works for several hours, requiring few re-applications.&lt;br /&gt;5. Soothes chapped lips. If you&#x27;re like me and used a different product to protect your lips and a different one to soothe them if they got chapped, then this Swivel Stick is your perfect 2-in-1 solution, as it does both jobs! I even went out in this year&#x27;s negative double-digits weather in Illinois while wearing this on my lips, and they didn&#x27;t get chapped at all! That sold its usefulness to me. :)&lt;br /&gt;6. No allergic reactions! (This one speaks for itself!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. A bit large. While I like that I get a lot of product here, you also have to consider that it&#x27;s not going to fit nicely into a pants pocket or anything. This isn&#x27;t a big deal for me, as I just leave it in my coat pocket, purse, and/or bedside drawer, but if you like to carry it in your front pockets, this will stand out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short:&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product! My search for the perfect lip balm is over. :) If you like a good value, protected and soothed lips, the smell of cocoa, and don&#x27;t mind carrying your lip balm anywhere but your pants pockets, then this product is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, in case you have allergic reactions to the stick-form Chapstick and Carmex like I do, I recommend the following products that have given me no negative reactions: Lancome&#x27;s Juicy Tubes or Estee Lauder&#x27;s High Gloss for lip gloss, Estee Lauder&#x27;s Pure Color Lipstick for lipstick, and honorable-mention lip balm Smith&#x27;s Mocha Rose Lip Balm with Vanilla (in tube form).protected and soothed lips, the smell of cocoa, and don&#x27;t mind carrying your lip balm anywhere but your pants pockets, then this product is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, in case you have allergic reactions to the stick-form Chapstick and Carmex like I do, I recommend the following products that have given me no negative reactions: Lancome&#x27;s Juicy Tubes or Estee Lauder&#x27;s High Gloss for lip gloss, Estee Lauder&#x27;s Pure Color Lipstick for lipstick, and honorable-mention lip balm Smith&#x27;s Mocha Rose Lip Balm with Vanilla (in tube form).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this instead of lip balm as suggested by Dr. Oz on his show and he&#x27;s right.  It works and is much better.</li>
            <li> After I moved here to Hawaii from Las Vegas I thought I needed this product.  It seems as soon as I started using this in Hawaii my lips started to become drier and chapped.  Tested it again.  Stopped using it no problem with dry lips.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time I have about five sticks and one that I use only on my doggies nose she gets dry and chapped and this is great for her because it will not hurt if she licks is. This is great for lips, cuticles, and for helping to fade scars. I love the stick.</li>
            <li> Great chap stick for dry, sore, cracked lips.  It is probably the cheapest one out there for those on a budget and goes above getting the job done.  No more bloody, dry, cracked, painful lips for me.  This stuff does the trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stick for a week now and it really helps my chapped lips! I also rubbed it on my arms to combat my dried skin. It&#x27;s not greasy or oily and absorbs really well, but I do have one complaint: the formula has fragrance. It&#x27;s a somewhat unnatural chocolate fragrance, but so far, it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin. Plus, it is quite faint, so even if you buy the stuff and dislike the scent, you can still use it on your lips without being bothered. It&#x27;s a really good price as well; the stick is about the size of an Elmer&#x27;s glue stick (in fact, when my sister saw the order, that&#x27;s what she thought it was). I recommend reapplying several times a day if you have badly chapped lips. Good product; 4 stars (with one deducted for the fragrance).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never buy any other lip balm again. This is the best. Soft, smooth, and pleasant smell (a light vanilla). Not the least bit sticky, gummy, or waxy. And it works great on any little facial blemish. I feel like I should start hoarding these, in case Palmer&#x27;s quits making them.</li>
            <li> Best product for cracked lips.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son. He has a scar on his upper lip where he got stitches. I put it on every night and he never fights (for a toddler that is saying something). I have started using it on my lips overnight as well. Great during these terrible allergy seasons.</li>
            <li> I cannot sing the praises of this stuff enough. It beats any other lip balm out there. Any time my lips are dry, windblown or sunburned (I live in CO) I apply this and within 5 minutes I&#x27;m good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m actually having a huge hissy fit right now as my two year old has lost this for me and I really need it. If Palmer&#x27;s loved me they would send me a replacement just because I love it so much. As it is I will be ordering again if I can&#x27;t find it; guess I&#x27;ll have to do a serious cleaning of the house.</li>
            <li> Easy to carry around. Use it for all dry spots. Hands, elbows etc</li>
            <li> I knew this ChapStick from a beauty instructing video on YouTube. Then, I ordered it. It is amazing chappstick I ever used. After the first time applying it to my chinked lips, I felt my lips were much softer and smoother than before. I apply it every hour to keep healing me lips.</li>
