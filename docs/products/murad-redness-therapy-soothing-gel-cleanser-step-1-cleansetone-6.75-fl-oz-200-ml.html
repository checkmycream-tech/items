            <li>awesome!!</li>
            <li>This is a great cleanser.</li>
            <li>but it leaves my skin feeling great and reduces breakouts.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time great product</li>
            <li>Great face wash - refreshing!!</li>
            <li>Amazon seems to have the best deals on them, so I highly recommend getting them on Amazon for the best price.  </li>
            <li>The combination of this wash + a good face cream has helped me so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The redness wash was good</li>
            <li>This cleanser it not as good as the Murad Clarifying Cleanser</li>
            <li>No product besides a laser treatment will remove redness from telangiectasia, but it is good to find a product that doesn&#x27;t exacerbate it.</li>
            <li>Loved the product but not the price.  </li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>I love this gel!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>I do love most Murad products, this one is just as good.  </li>
            <li>It is smooth, easy to apply, has a pleasant scent, and keeps my face noticeably clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a nice, light cleanser.</li>
            <li>I preferred the creamy wash from the resurgence line better.</li>
            <li>but I like the feeling of the cream wash better.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these murad products.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>Aveeno ultra-calming foaming cleanser works better for me and is cheaper</li>
            <li>I was having an issue with facial redness after having my baby and this stuff worked incredibly well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just happy it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin by making more red.</li>
            <li>My skin is almost as nice as it was when I was a teenager, and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I like this cleanser for many reasons: removes all make-up, sunblock, oil, \\&quot;residue\\&quot;, gentle fresh scent, lathers nicely, rinses well.</li>
            <li>This is gentle and feels nice as I wash my face.</li>
            <li>So happy to find the same product for 1/2 the salon price.</li>
            <li>I had to buy my own products, fast.</li>
            <li>I use this as a daily cleanser and its amazing!  </li>
            <li>I find that this cleanser does clean my face as promised.</li>
            <li>Excellent product for my sensitive and red skin !!!  </li>
            <li>I love the whole Murad line.</li>
            <li>so it lasts me a good month or two with daily use.  </li>
            <li>I have mild rosacea and thought this product would help reduce the redness, but it did get rid of the redness at all.</li>
            <li>It truly does help calm redness</li>
            <li>Worth the money, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>While they can be pricy, they are totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>and this does a great job of cleaning my face without making it feel raw.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive light skin that shows every irritation-</li>
            <li>I thought it was pretty drying and stripped my skin of oils.</li>
            <li>I am now using it in combination with Murad&#x27;s Recovery Treatment gel, also with Triclosan, and that seems to be getting the job done, albeit at a much higher cost.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been this smooth, hydrated or clear.</li>
            <li>The first time I purchased this was through a salon.  </li>
            <li>The two products together, after only a week, are giving me very smooth, clear skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this item to try and it works great and only a little needed.</li>
            <li>It is so gentle.  </li>
            <li>My skin thanks me every time I use it.</li>
            <li>I have not seen much of a difference in the redness of my skin, but I like it as a cleanser still.</li>
            <li>After turning 30, my skin went from super oily to super dry</li>
            <li>Anyway, this cleanser is very mild, removes makeup well, and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or irritate/inflame it.</li>
            <li>however I found the redness therapy gel to completely live up to it&#x27;s name!</li>
            <li>was BEFORE they removed the Triclosan, but it is decent.</li>
            <li>Recommend highly.</li>
            <li>recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>It dried out my skin, made it taut, and the redness became even more noticeable.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, yet oily skin.  </li>
            <li>If you have very sensitive skin, try this cleanser, it might be what you are looking for.</li>
            <li>After I tried it, I bought it for my daughter and a teen-age granddaughter who has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This product was first recommended to me once when I had a facial</li>
            <li>I am 38 years old with rosacea and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This works really well with my facial brush.  </li>
            <li>For extra, but still gentle, cleaning I use a cotton pad to rub oily areas.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that is prone to redness.</li>
            <li>right after* cleansing/drying I need to use my other products or</li>
            <li>I have red, sensitive, 40</li>
            <li>I have rosacia and have tried so many products that just made it worse.</li>
            <li>It still has the Triclosan, which is the only ingredient that consistently keeps my rosacea breakouts at bay, but I think it has less in it.</li>
            <li>Within 4 days of once a day use, the redness and dry patches on my face where almost completely gone.</li>

            <li> I do still occasionally get the rosacea breakout bumps using just this cleaner, but FAR less than with any other non-Triclosan cleanser.</li>

            <li> Not sure how this would work on regular acne,</li>

            <li> I use this cleanser everyday and I like the way my face feel not to dry nor oliy.</li>

            <li> A small amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> This product has never dried my skin out nor has it broken my skin out.  </li>
            <li> Not pretty!</li>
            <li> else my face may feel a little taught.</li>
            <li> However, for me, it also dried my face to the point that I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I should have realized by a few of the reviews.</li>
            <li> It actually made my acne worse.</li>
            <li> and (usually) oily skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure help redness</li>
            <li> It felt sticky and slick on my face when I tried to wash with it.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Oh, and rosacea sufferers, change your pillowcase at least twice a week...</li>
            <li> I have cystic acne and will have occasional really bad breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started getting broken capiliaries on my chin.</li>
            <li> This product is expensive and it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> however, my skin always feels still oily and maybe dirty after using moisturizing cleansers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years now. I am 38 years old with rosacea and sensitive skin. This product has never dried my skin out nor has it broken my skin out.  Worth the money, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have bought this face cleanser about three times and I really love it. This product was first recommended to me once when I had a facial and I&#x27;ve been hooked since. It truly does help calm redness and it&#x27;s a nice, light cleanser. I will continue to use this product in the future.</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m not impressed with this products lack in ability to help rid my face of its redness! I have mild rosacea and thought this product would help reduce the redness, but it did get rid of the redness at all. This product is expensive and it didn&#x27;t work for me. I thought it was pretty drying and stripped my skin of oils. I&#x27;m just happy it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin by making more red.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive light skin that shows every irritation- this is the only cleanser I can handle in harsh NE winter weather!</li>
            <li> This is a great cleanser. I love the whole Murad line. I don&#x27;t know how much it actually reduces redness but it leaves my skin feeling great and reduces breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have used another murad product before (orange packaging one) however I found the redness therapy gel to completely live up to it&#x27;s name! Within 4 days of once a day use, the redness and dry patches on my face where almost completely gone. The combination of this wash + a good face cream has helped me so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky to have clear skin growing up and as a teenager, however when I hit my 30&#x27;s , I developed red patches and a flaky complexion which is really awful, the Murad products are a bit pricey, but they are well worth every penny. My skin is almost as nice as it was when I was a teenager, and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I use this cleanser everyday and I like the way my face feel not to dry nor oliy.</li>
            <li> I have rosacia and have tried so many products that just made it worse. This wash along with the lotion cured all the bumps and redness. Love!</li>
            <li> I preferred the creamy wash from the resurgence line better. The redness wash was good but I like the feeling of the cream wash better. Also I&#x27;m not sure it does anything for my type of redness which is I have a red tome to my skin not a true redness issue.</li>
            <li> I find that this cleanser does clean my face as promised. I couldn&#x27;t tell whether it helped with the redness or not even though I have used it for about 4 weeks. However, for me, it also dried my face to the point that I had to stop using it. After refraining from using this product, my face is once again non-flaky.</li>
            <li> I love this gel!  I have very sensitive, yet oily skin.  It is very hard to find a product that works perfectly to clean my skin.  No oily residue, no over drying and helps correct my redness!</li>
            <li> Excellent product for my sensitive and red skin !!!  Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> This works really well with my facial brush.  I have rosa era and this does a great job of cleaning my face without making it feel raw.</li>
            <li> I use a number of Murad products from the Redness Therapy line daily. I have red, sensitive, 40+ and (usually) oily skin. I like this cleanser for many reasons: removes all make-up, sunblock, oil, \\&quot;residue\\&quot;, gentle fresh scent, lathers nicely, rinses well. It is definitely not a moisturizing cleanser - however, my skin always feels still oily and maybe dirty after using moisturizing cleansers. For extra, but still gentle, cleaning I use a cotton pad to rub oily areas. I can see how some might find it drying as *right after* cleansing/drying I need to use my other products or else my face may feel a little taught.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started getting broken capiliaries on my chin. Not pretty! I wanted a product that hasn&#x27;t been tested on animals and would not irritate. This is gentle and feels nice as I wash my face. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> awesome!! I was having an issue with facial redness after having my baby and this stuff worked incredibly well. use with treatment gel and recovery moisturizer</li>
            <li> Arrived on time great product</li>
            <li> This cleanser it not as good as the Murad Clarifying Cleanser was BEFORE they removed the Triclosan, but it is decent. It still has the Triclosan, which is the only ingredient that consistently keeps my rosacea breakouts at bay, but I think it has less in it. So while it helps, it doesn&#x27;t do quite a well as the Clarifying Cleanser used to (Boo, Murad...miss that Triclosan!)  This is one of the few cleansers left on the market with Triclosan, and I really hope Murad keeps it around. Anyway, this cleanser is very mild, removes makeup well, and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or irritate/inflame it. I do still occasionally get the rosacea breakout bumps using just this cleaner, but FAR less than with any other non-Triclosan cleanser. I am now using it in combination with Murad&#x27;s Recovery Treatment gel, also with Triclosan, and that seems to be getting the job done, albeit at a much higher cost. The two products together, after only a week, are giving me very smooth, clear skin. If you have very sensitive skin, try this cleanser, it might be what you are looking for. No product besides a laser treatment will remove redness from telangiectasia, but it is good to find a product that doesn&#x27;t exacerbate it. Oh, and rosacea sufferers, change your pillowcase at least twice a week...I swear that helps too! Not sure how this would work on regular acne, but I doubt it would irritate it further, and it would definitely be something you should try if your skin is dried out and irritated from other acne treatments.</li>
            <li> After turning 30, my skin went from super oily to super dry and I just couldn&#x27;t find a balance with my skincare routine.  Redness Therapy was the answer.  My skin has never been this smooth, hydrated or clear.</li>
            <li> The first time I purchased this was through a salon.  Loved the product but not the price.  So happy to find the same product for 1/2 the salon price.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is everything it is advertised to be. It is smooth, easy to apply, has a pleasant scent, and keeps my face noticeably clean.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these murad products.  My daughter has them and I used them 4 days and could not believe the results.  I had to buy my own products, fast.</li>
            <li> It helps me with my problem with redness. I love it</li>
            <li> I have cystic acne and will have occasional really bad breakouts.  I use this as a daily cleanser and its amazing!  I have been seeing an asthetician for a year now and using murad products.  While they can be pricy, they are totally worth it.  Amazon seems to have the best deals on them, so I highly recommend getting them on Amazon for the best price.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of this cleanser so it lasts me a good month or two with daily use.  And it definatly calms the reddness!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok I&#x27;m not sure help redness</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It is so gentle.  A small amount goes a long way.  After I tried it, I bought it for my daughter and a teen-age granddaughter who has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I should have realized by a few of the reviews. I have adult acne and I do need that soapy feeling in my cleanser. This is literally a non foaming gel cleanser. It felt sticky and slick on my face when I tried to wash with it. It doesn&#x27;t lather at all. It actually made my acne worse. I didn&#x27;t notice if it calmed my redness. I stopped using it after a week. Waste of money! I&#x27;m disappointed because I love all the Murad products.</li>
            <li> bought this product to use for the redness caused by my rosacea, but it hasn&#x27;t helped at all.  Aveeno ultra-calming foaming cleanser works better for me and is cheaper</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that is prone to redness. This product had the opposite effect to what it&#x27;s meant to achieve. It dried out my skin, made it taut, and the redness became even more noticeable. I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great face wash - refreshing!!</li>
            <li> Works just like it says. My skin thanks me every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this item to try and it works great and only a little needed. It does seem to be working well for the redness on face.</li>
            <li> I do love most Murad products, this one is just as good.  I have not seen much of a difference in the redness of my skin, but I like it as a cleanser still.</li>
