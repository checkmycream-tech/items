            <li>the suction cups are  not too good.  </li>
            <li>The suction cup even adheres to wood which is surprising</li>
            <li>so I knew it was a good product already.</li>
            <li>She had never seen one and was very glad she received one.</li>

            <li>but okay ,feels a bit more flimsy than I had thought</li>
            <li>but okay for home use</li>
            <li>and it is really heat resistant!!!!  </li>
            <li>I got it to fill in for free shipping</li>
            <li>Works great with my Chi Deep Brilliance!!</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>It holds my large flat iron perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I bought my daughters great new hot irons for a gift and happened to find this item.</li>
            <li>This hot iron holder has worked out great for my flat iron.</li>
            <li>Often I have to hold the holder down when removing the flat iron which kind of defeats the purpose, but when the suction cups hold it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>It is worth getting.</li>
            <li>Looked like something useful</li>
            <li>the product shipped and arrived quickly and was exactly as stated.</li>
            <li>I dont have the right screw which it says you get with the holder.</li>
            <li>Just the right angle.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because one of the 4 suction cups doesn&#x27;t want to hold (polished stone top surface) and I wish they just put a chunk of steel or similar in the bottom of it (1/2 pound</li>
            <li>It holds the iron without getting hot or melting.</li>
            <li>It sticks to my mirror and has really made a difference in counter space!</li>
            <li>I love having a convienent place to store my flat iron.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it because it keeps me from leaving the flat iron laying across my bed or dresser</li>
            <li>This little contraption is perfect for my new chi flat iron.  </li>
            <li>just the right size for a 1 inch iron, anything bigger it won&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li>Really like the flat iron holder, but would love it if the suction cups held better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great product to keep my flat iron off the counter and from slipping into the sink.  </li>
            <li>First, this arrived from the seller very timely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is much safer</li>
            <li>It holds really well on the surface of my bathroom mirror</li>
            <li>The problem with that was that it took up too much room</li>
            <li>I screwed it into the inside of my sink cabinet door (the hell w/ suction cups), and it is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>This holder really works.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed to keep my curling iron off of the new countertop.</li>
            <li>I kept it because there really isn&#x27;t anything better that doesn&#x27;t require you to bolt it down</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I put it high up in my bathroom so that my toddler cannot reach it.</li>
            <li>It was 200 bucks and didn&#x27;t come with one and pricing wise that seems to be a range where you leave the junk irons behind...     </li>
            <li>Holder.[[ASIN:B001209IOG CHROMATIQUE Professional High Temperature Heat Resistant Hair Iron Holder]]</li>
            <li>but when you have a hot flat iron you can&#x27;t put it away...unless you have the Chromatique Professional High Temperature Heat Resistant Hair Iron</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what they said--for flat irons.  </li>
            <li>It keeps it safe from anyone getting hurt while it is cooling down (or heating up) and it also keeps me from burning my counter (which happened with my old flat iron).</li>
            <li>and then i saw my 12 year old boy trying to wash his hands off with the iron plugged in.  </li>
            <li>We bought one (straight iron) from a kiosk at the mall years ago and she has used it almost daily since so we&#x27;ve gotten our money out of it</li>
            <li>It is on my mirror in the bathroom and haven&#x27;t had any issues as far as falling off or coming off.</li>
            <li>The item came quickly and was much smaller than expected.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I was tired of using the carrying pouch I had to protect my counter top.</li>
            <li>so I bought one for my sink area and for each of my girls who also use their flat iron near the sink.  </li>
            <li>Whether heating it up, or just setting it down for a few seconds, this thing is a blessing! :)</li>
            <li>It fits a samll flat iron that I have, but not the one I use daily which is a normal size Hair Art Flat Iron.</li>

            <li> I think it would work with short flat iron</li>
            <li> I bought this at the same time I bought my flat iron</li>
            <li> My flat iron used to take up space on my counter.</li>
            <li> and now I don&#x27;t have to worry about the flat iron burning my countertops.</li>
            <li> so I ordered one for each daughter to go with the flat irons.</li>
            <li> Does not lay flat and will not invert.  </li>
            <li> I always forget to turn off my flat iron holder - so I got this for my CHI.</li>
            <li> The flat iron holder was a gift for my daughter, she uses it every day and her friends want one as well.  </li>
            <li> Must have for anyone with a flat iron!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really simple device so not much to go over, but I wish they would just include them with the irons!    </li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife to help keep up with the limited countertop and because I always thought it was gonna burn me.</li>
            <li> It was always out because I use my CHI every single day.</li>
            <li> I have a Chi that is flat on one side and rounded on the other but not large.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not gentle when I&#x27;m shoving the iron in and out of it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it will hold long term or not.</li>
            <li> so you have to keep pushing down on it.</li>
            <li> You will need a screw to ancor it down, which they have a slot underneath the holder for availablity to do so.</li>
            <li> The suction cups have firmly stayed in place since I placed the holder up over a month ago, and they don&#x27;t appear to want to move around.</li>
            <li> but it does work if i set it on a flat surface and its a bit annoying because there isn&#x27;t much space.</li>
            <li> The suction cups are not particularly strong.  </li>
            <li> gave it three stars because unfortunately the suctions hold for a little while then come loose.  </li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t bad and it arrived in just a few days.</li>
            <li> (there&#x27;s space in the base) to weigh it down for afore mention reason...    </li>
            <li> (Suction was useless on wood BTW)</li>
            <li> and it was ugly.</li>
            <li> Disappointed!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really like the flat iron holder, but would love it if the suction cups held better.&lt;br /&gt;I will be hanging it on the door of my cabinet soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve positioned this item on my bathroom counter and it works wonderfully for keeping the curling secured when in use or not in use.</li>
            <li> just the right size for a 1 inch iron, anything bigger it won&#x27;t fit.  But works well for its intended purpose.</li>
            <li> I love this product..It keeps me from burning my dresser in my room. The only thing I dont like is that the suction cups dont stick sometimes so you have to keep pushing down on it. Mine didnt come with the screw or anything that way if I decided to screw it into the wall I dont have the right screw which it says you get with the holder. Hope this helps!!!</li>
            <li> Wife loved it. She had never seen one and was very glad she received one.</li>
            <li> My flat iron used to take up space on my counter. Now that I have the holder affixed to my mirror, it saves space... and now I don&#x27;t have to worry about the flat iron burning my countertops. The suction cups have firmly stayed in place since I placed the holder up over a month ago, and they don&#x27;t appear to want to move around. Great fix!</li>
            <li> Great product to keep my flat iron off the counter and from slipping into the sink.  I used to leave it in the sink while I was heating it up and then i saw my 12 year old boy trying to wash his hands off with the iron plugged in.  This is much safer so I bought one for my sink area and for each of my girls who also use their flat iron near the sink.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> Nice product!!! I put it on my tile walls in my bathroom, but the suction cups would&#x27;nt stay, so I superglued it. I only wish the handle part would move from side to side so it doesnt stick strait out!</li>
            <li> This holder is very good, it holds my flatiron in place and it looks pretty good too. I got 2, one for my flatiron and one for my curling iron and I&#x27;m very happy with both.</li>
            <li> It is worth getting. I love having a convienent place to store my flat iron. The price isn&#x27;t bad and it arrived in just a few days.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something else on amazon (don&#x27;t remember now), but this came up as a suggestion and for the price I just had to click on it... It&#x27;s a really simple device so not much to go over, but I wish they would just include them with the irons!    We bought one (straight iron) from a kiosk at the mall years ago and she has used it almost daily since so we&#x27;ve gotten our money out of it and then some... It was 200 bucks and didn&#x27;t come with one and pricing wise that seems to be a range where you leave the junk irons behind...     I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because one of the 4 suction cups doesn&#x27;t want to hold (polished stone top surface) and I wish they just put a chunk of steel or similar in the bottom of it (1/2 pound or so should do it) so it doesn&#x27;t need suction cups... I still consider that a safety issue since the suction cups could give and cause the iron to fall (cord weight pulling it, etc)...     I think I&#x27;m going to epoxy a piece of metal in the bottom (there&#x27;s space in the base) to weigh it down for afore mention reason...    Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Was amazed how fast I got the product, and I love it!!!  It holds really well on the surface of my bathroom mirror and it is really heat resistant!!!!  Should have gotten it sooner!  And you can&#x27;t beat the price, amazing!!!</li>
            <li> The idea of this is great,only wish is was bigger. It fits a samll flat iron that I have, but not the one I use daily which is a normal size Hair Art Flat Iron. Disappointed!!</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what they said--for flat irons.  I bought for a 1 inch curling iron and the iron is too long/heavy.  It tips the holder over.  The suction cups are not particularly strong.  I think it would work with short flat iron but I am not totally convinced.  It does have a hole to hang on screw on the back, but that arrangement wouldn&#x27;t work for me inside a cabinet as I needed it.  I finally put two sided sticky pads on the bottom and am trying that.  So far so good but it&#x27;s only been installed 10 minutes.  Not sure if it will hold long term or not.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife to help keep up with the limited countertop and because I always thought it was gonna burn me. It holds it off the counter and keeps it from falling and takes the chance I will get burned away. I got it to fill in for free shipping and we both like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this at the same time I bought my flat iron and I&#x27;m so happy I did.  It keeps it safe from anyone getting hurt while it is cooling down (or heating up) and it also keeps me from burning my counter (which happened with my old flat iron).</li>
            <li> Use this item in my re-finished bathroom. Exactly what I needed to keep my curling iron off of the new countertop. Will accommodate several different sized curling irons. Works great ..... only suggestion is they should make it in different colors.</li>
            <li> I bought my daughters great new hot irons for a gift and happened to find this item. Looked like something useful so I ordered one for each daughter to go with the flat irons. They use them so they were a good find.</li>
            <li> The item came quickly and was much smaller than expected. (I was happy about that!) the holder is a perfect fit for my chi flat iron, but I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because the suction cups aren&#x27;t the best. Often I have to hold the holder down when removing the flat iron which kind of defeats the purpose, but when the suction cups hold it&#x27;s great. (Suction was useless on wood BTW)</li>
            <li> The suction cups do not work.  I put my $99.00 straightener in the holder and it dropped to the floor breaking a piece off of my appliance.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was tired of using the carrying pouch I had to protect my counter top. The problem with that was that it took up too much room and it was ugly. It was always out because I use my CHI every single day. So, I bought this. It solved all my problems. It suctioned very easily to my marble counter top and it&#x27;s been there ever since. It hasn&#x27;t moved at all and I&#x27;m not gentle when I&#x27;m shoving the iron in and out of it. If you have a CHI that you leave out all the time, this is a must. I wish I would have bought it 3 years ago when I bought my CHI. I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Like to stay organized but when you have a hot flat iron you can&#x27;t put it away...unless you have the Chromatique Professional High Temperature Heat Resistant Hair Iron Holder.[[ASIN:B001209IOG CHROMATIQUE Professional High Temperature Heat Resistant Hair Iron Holder]]</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase. It holds my one inch chi without having the blades touch while it is warming up. It is on my mirror in the bathroom and haven&#x27;t had any issues as far as falling off or coming off. It is a great space saver and great value.</li>
            <li> Does not lay flat and will not invert.  the suction cups are  not too good.  You will need a screw to ancor it down, which they have a slot underneath the holder for availablity to do so.</li>
            <li> Just the right angle.  Hold my chi styler up and off my dresser.  Love the convenience.  Sturdy and stays in place.</li>
            <li> the product shipped and arrived quickly and was exactly as stated. The suction cup even adheres to wood which is surprising</li>
            <li> This is the best invention ever! It holds the iron without getting hot or melting. No burnt countertops or dropped flat-irons! I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without this, I just love it! I screwed it into the inside of my sink cabinet door (the hell w/ suction cups), and it is very sturdy. I definitely recommend this product if you use any type of hair iron. Whether heating it up, or just setting it down for a few seconds, this thing is a blessing! :)</li>
            <li> Iron no longer has to lay on the counter and leave burn marks.  It works great and it does not tip over of fall off of the counter.</li>
            <li> This holder really works.  The suction cups hold the holder in place.  It holds my large flat iron perfectly.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I always forget to turn off my flat iron holder - so I got this for my CHI. It sticks to my mirror and has really made a difference in counter space!</li>
            <li> Not quite what I was expecting but okay ,feels a bit more flimsy than I had thought but okay for home use I would not use these in a salon type setting.</li>
            <li> Nice produst. ship went well and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  My duaghter already owns one so I knew it was a good product already.</li>
            <li> The suction cups at the bottom do not stick to anything but it does work if i set it on a flat surface and its a bit annoying because there isn&#x27;t much space.</li>
            <li> This little contraption is perfect for my new chi flat iron.  I absolutely love it because it keeps me from leaving the flat iron laying across my bed or dresser and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the stuff getting burned</li>
            <li> First, this arrived from the seller very timely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it three stars because unfortunately the suctions hold for a little while then come loose.  I have a Chi that is flat on one side and rounded on the other but not large.  I kept it because there really isn&#x27;t anything better that doesn&#x27;t require you to bolt it down and I didn&#x27;t want to do that to my bathroom.</li>
            <li> This hot iron holder has worked out great for my flat iron. I put it high up in my bathroom so that my toddler cannot reach it. It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product!! Must have for anyone with a flat iron!! Works great with my Chi Deep Brilliance!!</li>
            <li> The flat iron holder was a gift for my daughter, she uses it every day and her friends want one as well.  Great deal! Thank you!</li>
