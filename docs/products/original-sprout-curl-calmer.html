            <li>So great to be able to get it at Amazon, and for a reasonable price too!</li>
            <li>It goes on super easy, smells AMAZING, and WORKS!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a baby, but I love this product for my curly hair.  </li>

            <li>Love all of sprouts products.</li>
            <li>My wife and I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Curls are more defined, too.</li>
            <li>I love this product for my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>love that it is 100 percent Vegan</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>loved this cream for my daughter and son which is very nice on their hair and leave it soft and smooth</li>
            <li>While the first two are made with very good quality products and smell great, they simply did not address the fuzziness issue...</li>
            <li>I especially love the clean, natural scent.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t calm the curls too much but awesome on frizz and smells good, light fresh scent.</li>
            <li>When I bought it at the salon I loved it for my daughter&#x27;s hair (which is very long and curly), it was non-sticky with a great smell, but</li>
            <li>It works great on my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>This product makes his hair so much softer and it smells so good.</li>
            <li>I love the original sprout line.  </li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;Original Sprout is made with organic vegetable extracts, is cheaper than the other two products and gives great results!</li>
            <li>Love the original sprout products.</li>
            <li>I use this on my 10-year-old daughter&#x27;s fine, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>My son&#x27;s hair is easily tangled and matted and this turns it into smooth curls.  </li>
            <li>Has a light sent.</li>
            <li>It also is free of allergens, which is a must for our family.</li>
            <li>It makes it shiny and smooth and does not look or feel like there is product in it at all.</li>
            <li>We love it and will keep using it until she&#x27;s ready to graduate to Aveda. :)</li>
            <li>So many people have positively commented that my granddaughter has such beautiful</li>
            <li>Nothing compares to how well Original Sprout works.</li>
            <li>Non sticky formula, anti frizz, smells good and you need just a drop for short curly</li>
            <li>Received the Sprout Curl Calmer quickly and gave it to my daughter to try on my granddaughter who has kinky curly hair...</li>
            <li>My daughter has super curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to any parent that has a child with super curly hair.</li>
            <li>it makes her curls super right and not crunchy.  </li>
            <li>My bi-racial daughter has very curly fine hair</li>
            <li>Love the smell and that it doesn&#x27;t make my four year old look</li>
            <li>It gives just enough control to take the frizziness out of my sons hair - leaves just great soft curls.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of pricey, but well worth the price since it works well and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It keeps hair from becoming frizzy while helping curls soft and defined.</li>
            <li>I have super straight.  </li>
            <li>With just a very small amount of Sprout curl calmer applied, the curls have a better shape and stay nicely shaped all day.</li>
            <li>This works great with the conditioner if your kid has curly hair that is hard to comb.</li>
            <li>It really does calm my daughter&#x27;s curls and defines them.</li>
            <li>Love this, my son is allergic to 8 different foods and we have not started to test environmental allergies.</li>
            <li>I have even recommended it to a friend with very curly haired babies as well!</li>
            <li>This conditioner really delivers on fuzzy hair!</li>
            <li>Works pretty well, not too chemically seeming  (or smelling).&lt;br /&gt;/Richard</li>
            <li>Her curls are left more defined, but I would not say that they are at all &amp;#34;relaxed.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This is a good moisturizer without being over greasy or heavy.  </li>
            <li>It is great for styling a babies hair since it dries with a natural look with less poofiness and frizz.</li>
            <li>We started using this in combination with the Original Sprouts Miracle Detangler and her curls are more defined and less frizzy.</li>
            <li>Most curly girls do their best to stay away from silicone-based stylers because long-term use leads to severely dry hair and irritated scalps so, needless to say</li>
            <li>This product is the only thing that keeps my daughter&#x27;s super curly blonde hair looking great all day long.  </li>
            <li>It really does help prevent the dreaded frizz.</li>
            <li>They control the frizz but don&#x27;t seem to really relax the curls.</li>
            <li>I have very curly/frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>The curl calmer really helps remove the frizzy look to my daughter&#x27;s curls.</li>
            <li>and so she&#x27;s living with a mom who is used to styling straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I will absolutely be buying this again and again until she tells me not to (she&#x27;s two</li>
            <li>My hair is VERY curly and gets too poofy if just air-dried.  </li>
            <li>Completely changed the texture of my granddaughters hair and no tangles !!!  </li>
            <li>However, this is the first product that we have used that really leaves her hair feeling soft without a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>We typically use Shea Moisture and love it.  </li>
            <li>I use this for my 20 month old with very curly dominican hair that is still in the &amp;#34;fro&amp;#34; stage.</li>
            <li>I use this on my 4 and 1 year old who both were lucky enough to get their father&#x27;s curly hair.  </li>
            <li>The smell is terrific and makes his hair super soft.</li>
            <li>B000VOTE6G California Baby hair Conditioner - Super Sensitive, 8.5 Ounce]], [[ASIN:B002WC8EAW Nature&#x27;s Baby Organics Conditioner &amp; Detangler, Lavender Chamomile, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]] and the [[ASIN:B003XFKACM CHI Silk Infusion, 6 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
            <li>She has fine hair and so pretty much anything will pull the curl out and leave a rather unkempt looking mess in the back of her head.</li>
            <li>Very soft  and flexible.  </li>
            <li>My kids also have very sensitive skin and eczema.  </li>
            <li>She is half black and has really fine, curly hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>My daughter has super curly frizzy hair and while it smoothes it down a bit it really doesn&#x27;t keep it calm all day long</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will help and I&#x27;m anxious to see the results  </li>
            <li>and they all have the exact same ingredients.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>This one though, WOW!  </li>
            <li>Son, 5 years old, loves it!</li>
            <li>Then I comb it or clip it back, and it looks so much less frizzy and more under control than if I don&#x27;t put products in her hair.</li>
            <li>I love how her hair looks although i do need to splash a little water on it throughout the day when she messes with it which is inevitable with a toddler.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it is hard to find elsewhere.</li>
            <li>You can clearly see the difference if there are hairs you miss.</li>
            <li>However, if you have a sensitive, allergic scalp I recommend staying away.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m a bit surprised that a hypoallergenic styler uses it.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy and doesn&#x27;t leave their hair sticky.  </li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, it is just another product that makes a claim and does not deliver.</li>
            <li>Mkes hair soft and takes out tangles when used after the bath.</li>
            <li>I got this for my husband who sometimes has wild curly hair.</li>
            <li>I quit using it for a few days now and the hair is starting to get better.</li>
            <li>It gives her smooth, soft curls that look natural and not at all \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; or stiff.</li>
            <li>The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because I have a sensitive nose and the smell is a little strong for me.</li>
            <li>, none of them have the same exact hair, and I cannot use the same hair products on any of them either.</li>
            <li>My little boy has super curly hair and it defintely calms the frizz.</li>
            <li>I put it in after baths and sometimes in the mornings to calm down the bed head in the morning.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a product to tame fine and curly baby&#x27;s hair, look no further!</li>
            <li>I have ordered this online 4 times and only twice has it been the actual original product - the other two times</li>
            <li>My very short older adult hair is much softer and less frizzy when I use this Curl Calmer.  </li>
            <li>Got this for my mixed 12 month old daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t irritate their skin and it define their curls leaving them bouncy and not wet to the touch.  </li>
            <li>honestly not really a product that makes that much difference overall as far as appearance of her hair.</li>
            <li>Combing some of this into my wet hair helps it dry in a more tame way while still maintaining natural curls.</li>
            <li>Our 3 1/2 year old daughter not only tolerates, but actually likes to put on the product herself.</li>
            <li>Now he has regular short hair and still I put it on after bath time to make his hair really soft an manageable.</li>
            <li>The ethnic products were too heavy and greasy, probably due to her fine hair texture.</li>
            <li>She applies it to damp hair and lets it dry naturally, and then again the next morning after spritzing with water for a touch up.</li>
            <li>My little two year old granddaughter has curly hair and this product does wonders on her curls, her hair is so luscious, the curls are so silky soft.</li>

            <li> So many people have positively commented that my granddaughter has such beautiful</li>
            <li> Nothing compares to how well Original Sprout works.</li>
            <li> Non sticky formula, anti frizz, smells good and you need just a drop for short curly</li>
            <li> Received the Sprout Curl Calmer quickly and gave it to my daughter to try on my granddaughter who has kinky curly hair...</li>
            <li> My daughter has super curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to any parent that has a child with super curly hair.</li>
            <li> it makes her curls super right and not crunchy.  </li>
            <li> My bi-racial daughter has very curly fine hair</li>
            <li> Love the smell and that it doesn&#x27;t make my four year old look</li>
            <li> It gives just enough control to take the frizziness out of my sons hair - leaves just great soft curls.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of pricey, but well worth the price since it works well and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It keeps hair from becoming frizzy while helping curls soft and defined.</li>
            <li> I have super straight.  </li>
            <li> With just a very small amount of Sprout curl calmer applied, the curls have a better shape and stay nicely shaped all day.</li>
            <li> This works great with the conditioner if your kid has curly hair that is hard to comb.</li>
            <li> It really does calm my daughter&#x27;s curls and defines them.</li>
            <li> Love this, my son is allergic to 8 different foods and we have not started to test environmental allergies.</li>
            <li> I have even recommended it to a friend with very curly haired babies as well!</li>
            <li> This conditioner really delivers on fuzzy hair!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, not too chemically seeming  (or smelling).&lt;br /&gt;/Richard</li>
            <li> Her curls are left more defined, but I would not say that they are at all &amp;#34;relaxed.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizer without being over greasy or heavy.  </li>
            <li> It is great for styling a babies hair since it dries with a natural look with less poofiness and frizz.</li>
            <li> We started using this in combination with the Original Sprouts Miracle Detangler and her curls are more defined and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> Most curly girls do their best to stay away from silicone-based stylers because long-term use leads to severely dry hair and irritated scalps so, needless to say</li>
            <li> This product is the only thing that keeps my daughter&#x27;s super curly blonde hair looking great all day long.  </li>
            <li> It really does help prevent the dreaded frizz.</li>
            <li> They control the frizz but don&#x27;t seem to really relax the curls.</li>
            <li> I have very curly/frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> The curl calmer really helps remove the frizzy look to my daughter&#x27;s curls.</li>
            <li> and so she&#x27;s living with a mom who is used to styling straight hair.  </li>
            <li> I will absolutely be buying this again and again until she tells me not to (she&#x27;s two</li>
            <li> My hair is VERY curly and gets too poofy if just air-dried.  </li>
            <li> Completely changed the texture of my granddaughters hair and no tangles !!!  </li>
            <li> However, this is the first product that we have used that really leaves her hair feeling soft without a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> We typically use Shea Moisture and love it.  </li>
            <li> I use this for my 20 month old with very curly dominican hair that is still in the &amp;#34;fro&amp;#34; stage.</li>
            <li> I use this on my 4 and 1 year old who both were lucky enough to get their father&#x27;s curly hair.  </li>
            <li> The smell is terrific and makes his hair super soft.</li>
            <li> B000VOTE6G California Baby hair Conditioner - Super Sensitive, 8.5 Ounce]], [[ASIN:B002WC8EAW Nature&#x27;s Baby Organics Conditioner &amp; Detangler, Lavender Chamomile, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]] and the [[ASIN:B003XFKACM CHI Silk Infusion, 6 Fluid Ounce]]</li>
            <li> She has fine hair and so pretty much anything will pull the curl out and leave a rather unkempt looking mess in the back of her head.</li>
            <li> Very soft  and flexible.  </li>
            <li> My kids also have very sensitive skin and eczema.  </li>
            <li> She is half black and has really fine, curly hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li> My daughter has super curly frizzy hair and while it smoothes it down a bit it really doesn&#x27;t keep it calm all day long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will help and I&#x27;m anxious to see the results  </li>
            <li> and they all have the exact same ingredients.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> This one though, WOW!  </li>
            <li> Son, 5 years old, loves it!</li>
            <li> Then I comb it or clip it back, and it looks so much less frizzy and more under control than if I don&#x27;t put products in her hair.</li>
            <li> I love how her hair looks although i do need to splash a little water on it throughout the day when she messes with it which is inevitable with a toddler.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it is hard to find elsewhere.</li>
            <li> You can clearly see the difference if there are hairs you miss.</li>
            <li> However, if you have a sensitive, allergic scalp I recommend staying away.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m a bit surprised that a hypoallergenic styler uses it.</li>
            <li> It is not heavy and doesn&#x27;t leave their hair sticky.  </li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned, it is just another product that makes a claim and does not deliver.</li>
            <li> Mkes hair soft and takes out tangles when used after the bath.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband who sometimes has wild curly hair.</li>
            <li> I quit using it for a few days now and the hair is starting to get better.</li>
            <li> It gives her smooth, soft curls that look natural and not at all \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; or stiff.</li>
            <li> The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because I have a sensitive nose and the smell is a little strong for me.</li>
            <li> , none of them have the same exact hair, and I cannot use the same hair products on any of them either.</li>
            <li> My little boy has super curly hair and it defintely calms the frizz.</li>
            <li> I put it in after baths and sometimes in the mornings to calm down the bed head in the morning.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a product to tame fine and curly baby&#x27;s hair, look no further!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this online 4 times and only twice has it been the actual original product - the other two times</li>
            <li> My very short older adult hair is much softer and less frizzy when I use this Curl Calmer.  </li>
            <li> Got this for my mixed 12 month old daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t irritate their skin and it define their curls leaving them bouncy and not wet to the touch.  </li>
            <li> honestly not really a product that makes that much difference overall as far as appearance of her hair.</li>
            <li> Combing some of this into my wet hair helps it dry in a more tame way while still maintaining natural curls.</li>
            <li> Our 3 1/2 year old daughter not only tolerates, but actually likes to put on the product herself.</li>
            <li> Now he has regular short hair and still I put it on after bath time to make his hair really soft an manageable.</li>
            <li> The ethnic products were too heavy and greasy, probably due to her fine hair texture.</li>
            <li> She applies it to damp hair and lets it dry naturally, and then again the next morning after spritzing with water for a touch up.</li>
            <li> My little two year old granddaughter has curly hair and this product does wonders on her curls, her hair is so luscious, the curls are so silky soft.</li>
            <li> At first i thought it was smoothing things out, but after a few weeks my baby&#x27;s hair is dry and fuzzy all over and all the time not just after naps etc.</li>
            <li> We use this to calm them down a little bit.</li>
            <li> My 14 month-old&#x27;s fine, curly hair was getting really fuzzy and impossible to manage.</li>
            <li> The only gripe is that the results don&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair curly but extremely dry and coarse.</li>
            <li> I use this product on a 2 year old who has slightly curly hair.  </li>
            <li> My children are mixed and I have searched high and low for the right product to bring out their curls, but not leave their hair wet or looking dirty.  </li>
            <li> Her hair is half curly and half straight</li>
            <li> Their hair is really soft and bouncy after it&#x27;s all dried up.</li>
            <li> We started using it when he had long hair, after washing his hair I would put a nickel sized amount on his damped hair.</li>
            <li> I have spent a fortune on products for my daughter&#x27;s curly hair.</li>
            <li> Our boy gets uncontrollable curls whenever his hair gets wet.</li>
            <li> It takes very, very little of the product so the package will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I can comb through it in a matter of minutes rather than the 20 it was taking with other products.  </li>
            <li> A little bit of product goes a long way!</li>
            <li> The little girl I take care of has thick blonde curly hair.</li>
            <li> We use it as a leave in conditioner--we wash her hair every other day and her hair never looks greasy or heavy.  </li>
            <li> They still have some curl but less snarl.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old boy has a difficult hair, not straight, not wavy, somewhat in between.</li>
            <li> , I just finger comb a little of the calmer through her hair and then scrunch up the curls.</li>
            <li> It worked beautifully in my little ones curls ..</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because we have tried a few natural detanglers</li>
            <li> and this doesn&#x27;t make her hair greasy or heavy.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I borrow it too to tame frizz.</li>
            <li> It did nothing to tame his curls and frizz.</li>
            <li> Our daughter has very tight curls.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s just past her shoulders.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t necessarily straighten his hair, it just tones down the crazy.</li>
            <li> When it dries in her hair it seems to look a tad dull and flaky.</li>
            <li> it smelled weird and had an odd, sticky consistency (unless the way it is made is where the inconsistency lies).</li>
            <li> It takes the hard work out of controlling my goldilocks!</li>
            <li> and it has a very thick consistency.</li>
            <li> Seriously!  </li>
            <li> So needless to say I had no idea how to manage curly hair</li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive but it works well.  </li>
            <li> Also, it is a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with the product.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just awesome. We have used it for the last couple of years. Our 3 1/2 year old daughter not only tolerates, but actually likes to put on the product herself. Her curls look great.</li>
            <li> Excellent, I LOVE IT !!!!</li>
            <li> The little girl I take care of has thick blonde curly hair. We started using this in combination with the Original Sprouts Miracle Detangler and her curls are more defined and less frizzy. Because I have already brushed her hair when I used the detangler, I just finger comb a little of the calmer through her hair and then scrunch up the curls. Everywhere we go people comment on her beautiful hair and curls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a baby, but I love this product for my curly hair.  It really does help prevent the dreaded frizz.</li>
            <li> Received the Sprout Curl Calmer quickly and gave it to my daughter to try on my granddaughter who has kinky curly hair...I am waiting to hear to results.I&#x27;m sure it will help and I&#x27;m anxious to see the results  I will update my post and possibly add a photo. This review is based on the organics of the product and great packaging and delivery.</li>
            <li> My daughter has super curly hair.  I have super straight.  So needless to say I had no idea how to manage curly hair let alone buy product.  My daughter is 18 months and this product works so great.  Has a light sent. Does not leave your hands sticky after use and what I like most is it makes her curls super right and not crunchy.  Very soft  and flexible.  Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair curly but extremely dry and coarse.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and that it doesn&#x27;t make my four year old look like I put a bunch of product in his beautiful curly hair!</li>
            <li> I love the original sprout line.  My kids use the products and the curl tamer is really good for my daughter&#x27;s curly hair.  Works great and smells good.</li>
            <li> If you have a non-reactive scalp, this stuff works great - it calms &amp; defines curls and reduces frizzies. However, if you have a sensitive, allergic scalp I recommend staying away. This styler contains dimethicone which is a non-water soluble silicone that causes build-up, dermatitis (eczema and scalp lesions!), etc. Most curly girls do their best to stay away from silicone-based stylers because long-term use leads to severely dry hair and irritated scalps so, needless to say, I&#x27;m a bit surprised that a hypoallergenic styler uses it. It would be great if the creator of this line could replace the dimethicone with a gentler, water soluble silicone.</li>
            <li> I use this on my 10-year-old daughter&#x27;s fine, wavy hair. It&#x27;s perfect to smooth and shape her waves without adding weight or crunch. She applies it to damp hair and lets it dry naturally, and then again the next morning after spritzing with water for a touch up. Just a dime-sized dollop is all she needs for hair that&#x27;s just past her shoulders. Sometimes I borrow it too to tame frizz. Smells great.</li>
            <li> This is great for toddlers with unmanageable curls. Use more liberally than you would expect. You can clearly see the difference if there are hairs you miss.</li>
            <li> loved this cream for my daughter and son which is very nice on their hair and leave it soft and smooth</li>
            <li> I use this for my 20 month old with very curly dominican hair that is still in the &amp;#34;fro&amp;#34; stage. It is great for styling a babies hair since it dries with a natural look with less poofiness and frizz. I love how her hair looks although i do need to splash a little water on it throughout the day when she messes with it which is inevitable with a toddler.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because like others my baby&#x27;s hair was fuZing up after nap or car rides. At first i thought it was smoothing things out, but after a few weeks my baby&#x27;s hair is dry and fuzzy all over and all the time not just after naps etc. I quit using it for a few days now and the hair is starting to get better. This product smells amazing, and I have put it on my split ends after showering, it seems to smooth them well.  I would say what I started using. But we have 3 children and although they look so similar it&#x27;s uncanny, none of them have the same exact hair, and I cannot use the same hair products on any of them either. I wish it would have worked for my baby !  ;-((</li>
            <li> I love this styling creme. It really does calm my daughter&#x27;s curls and defines them. Plus it smells very nice. The only gripe is that the results don&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> I use this on my 4 and 1 year old who both were lucky enough to get their father&#x27;s curly hair.  It is not heavy and doesn&#x27;t leave their hair sticky.  Their hair is really soft and bouncy after it&#x27;s all dried up.</li>
            <li> I like this company.  But I can&#x27;t tell if their different products are actually different from one another.  I have the leave-in conditioner and the detangler spray and they all have the exact same ingredients. This one and the leave in conditioner seem to have the same effect on my kid&#x27;s hair.  They control the frizz but don&#x27;t seem to really relax the curls.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have biracial boys and it works perfectly on their curly hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling stringy. It hasn&#x27;t prevented any frizz</li>
            <li> I have very curly/frizzy hair. This product truly smooths &amp; detangles it. It takes the hard work out of controlling my goldilocks!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use it on myself and my girls.  It works great on my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive but it works well.  My son&#x27;s hair is easily tangled and matted and this turns it into smooth curls.  It also is free of allergens, which is a must for our family.</li>
            <li> Original Sprout products are all great, and this is no exception. I especially love the clean, natural scent.</li>
            <li> Love to use this on my boys hair, they tend to smell like  like they have been playing outside all day... Very  nice scent.... Used this when they were babies, now 7 &amp; 9</li>
            <li> My &#x27;lil darling has curly hair and this product does wonders for her hair.  I love that is safe for my girl, too.</li>
            <li> This works great with the conditioner if your kid has curly hair that is hard to comb. They still have some curl but less snarl.</li>
            <li> It worked beautifully in my little ones curls .. And the scent is great</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hairstylist recommended the Sprout Curl Calmer. The salon was out so I ordered online. The curl calmer really helps remove the frizzy look to my daughter&#x27;s curls. She has fine hair and so pretty much anything will pull the curl out and leave a rather unkempt looking mess in the back of her head. With just a very small amount of Sprout curl calmer applied, the curls have a better shape and stay nicely shaped all day. I don&#x27;t notice any buildup in her hair but we only wash her hair about twice a week since she is only 3. It takes very, very little of the product so the package will last a very long time. All in all, a great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mixed 12 month old daughter&#x27;s hair. Doesn&#x27;t calm the curls too much but awesome on frizz and smells good, light fresh scent.</li>
            <li> My daughter has super curly frizzy hair and while it smoothes it down a bit it really doesn&#x27;t keep it calm all day long and it has a very thick consistency. When it dries in her hair it seems to look a tad dull and flaky.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my curly hair toddler and it smells great.</li>
            <li> Works wonders for my toddlers curly, sometimes unruly hair. Love the shine!</li>
            <li> Love all of sprouts products. My daughter likes the scent too.</li>
            <li> I have spent a fortune on products for my daughter&#x27;s curly hair. Nothing compares to how well Original Sprout works.</li>
            <li> Love this, my son is allergic to 8 different foods and we have not started to test environmental allergies. NIce scent and it does not break out his scalp.</li>
            <li> I use this product on a 2 year old who has slightly curly hair.  I put it in after baths and sometimes in the mornings to calm down the bed head in the morning.  Great fresh scent!</li>
            <li> It gives just enough control to take the frizziness out of my sons hair - leaves just great soft curls.</li>
            <li> Our daughter inherited her curly hair from her grandmother and so she&#x27;s living with a mom who is used to styling straight hair.  This product is great for her curly locks.  We use it as a leave in conditioner--we wash her hair every other day and her hair never looks greasy or heavy.  It&#x27;s also non reactive if when rinsing her hair before a wash it gets in her eyes.  We love it and will keep using it until she&#x27;s ready to graduate to Aveda. :)</li>
            <li> Great product for my toddler and infant. The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because I have a sensitive nose and the smell is a little strong for me. Also, it is a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> This definitely works to take the curl out of my preschoolers hair. Her hair is half curly and half straight so I like some consistency.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with the product.  I used it on wavy hair and didn&#x27;t see any changes at all.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned, it is just another product that makes a claim and does not deliver.</li>
            <li> Since I discovered this product I haven&#x27;t used anything else. My 2 year old boy has a difficult hair, not straight, not wavy, somewhat in between. This product makes his hair so much softer and it smells so good. We started using it when he had long hair, after washing his hair I would put a nickel sized amount on his damped hair. Now he has regular short hair and still I put it on after bath time to make his hair really soft an manageable.</li>
            <li> My wife and I absolutely love this product. Our boy gets uncontrollable curls whenever his hair gets wet. We use this to calm them down a little bit. It doesn&#x27;t necessarily straighten his hair, it just tones down the crazy. The smell is terrific and makes his hair super soft. I would recommend this to any parent that has a child with super curly hair.</li>
            <li> Really nice product I like sprout care product for my kids hair</li>
            <li> My children are mixed and I have searched high and low for the right product to bring out their curls, but not leave their hair wet or looking dirty.  My kids also have very sensitive skin and eczema.  This product doesn&#x27;t irritate their skin and it define their curls leaving them bouncy and not wet to the touch.  It also smells amazing!!!  People are always telling me my babies smell so good.  Great product for curls of all ethnicities!</li>
            <li> Wow!  Seriously!  I was skeptical because we have tried a few natural detanglers and they were ok, at best.  This one though, WOW!  It works!  It goes on super easy, smells AMAZING, and WORKS!  My bi-racial daughter has very curly fine hair and this doesn&#x27;t make her hair greasy or heavy.  I can comb through it in a matter of minutes rather than the 20 it was taking with other products.  I will absolutely be buying this again and again until she tells me not to (she&#x27;s two so that won&#x27;t happen any time soon).  I have even recommended it to a friend with very curly haired babies as well!</li>
            <li> Love this!  My hair is VERY curly and gets too poofy if just air-dried.  Combing some of this into my wet hair helps it dry in a more tame way while still maintaining natural curls.</li>
            <li> The problem with this product is you never know what you&#x27;re going to get. I have ordered this online 4 times and only twice has it been the actual original product - the other two times it smelled weird and had an odd, sticky consistency (unless the way it is made is where the inconsistency lies). When I bought it at the salon I loved it for my daughter&#x27;s hair (which is very long and curly), it was non-sticky with a great smell, but honestly not really a product that makes that much difference overall as far as appearance of her hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it is hard to find elsewhere. So great to be able to get it at Amazon, and for a reasonable price too!</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizer without being over greasy or heavy.  We like it a lot and have ordered it several times.</li>
            <li> This conditioner really delivers on fuzzy hair! My 14 month-old&#x27;s fine, curly hair was getting really fuzzy and impossible to manage. I had tried several products suggested in mom&#x27;s forums, including [[ASIN:B000VOTE6G California Baby hair Conditioner - Super Sensitive, 8.5 Ounce]], [[ASIN:B002WC8EAW Nature&#x27;s Baby Organics Conditioner &amp; Detangler, Lavender Chamomile, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]] and the [[ASIN:B003XFKACM CHI Silk Infusion, 6 Fluid Ounce]] (some moms in my forums swear by it!). While the first two are made with very good quality products and smell great, they simply did not address the fuzziness issue... CHI Silk Infusion is just an anti-frizz product.&lt;br /&gt;Original Sprout is made with organic vegetable extracts, is cheaper than the other two products and gives great results! My daughter&#x27;s hair is smelling wonderful, does not have a greasy look, feels silky and smooth, and is very manageable now. Curls are more defined, too. While the instructions tell you to use as a leave-in, I have also rinsed sometimes, with great results. If you&#x27;re looking for a product to tame fine and curly baby&#x27;s hair, look no further!</li>
            <li> Great product. My little boy has super curly hair and it defintely calms the frizz.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product; doesn&#x27;t take away the curl but does take away the frizz.  Completely changed the texture of my granddaughters hair and no tangles !!!  She LOVES it.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my daughter&#x27;s hair. It makes it shiny and smooth and does not look or feel like there is product in it at all.</li>
            <li> Love the original sprout products. They smell amazing and I feel saw using it on my kids. This one made my daughter&#x27;s curls so bouncy and not frizzy.</li>
            <li> Love it! Non sticky formula, anti frizz, smells good and you need just a drop for short curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;My Son, 5 years old, loves it! After school his hair still rocks!</li>
            <li> Mkes hair soft and takes out tangles when used after the bath. I have ordered this 3 times and will order it again great product!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, not too chemically seeming  (or smelling).&lt;br /&gt;/Richard</li>
            <li> This was used on my toddler at a kid&#x27;s hair salon. He has curly hair and this works great for him.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband who sometimes has wild curly hair. It did nothing to tame his curls and frizz. I guess we&#x27;ll have to go back to the poisonous Paul Mitchell Hair Wax.</li>
            <li> Original Sprout Curl Calmer is Wonderful!!!!  My little two year old granddaughter has curly hair and this product does wonders on her curls, her hair is so luscious, the curls are so silky soft. So many people have positively commented that my granddaughter has such beautiful hair.&lt;br /&gt;We love that it is 100 percent Vegan</li>
            <li> Been using it on my daughter&#x27;s hair for 3 years, works like a charm! She is half black and has really fine, curly hair that tangles easily. The ethnic products were too heavy and greasy, probably due to her fine hair texture. This stuff is perfect! Works as an awesome detangler, leaves her curls in perfect, shiny little spirals and has a pleasant smell. Love it!</li>
            <li> Our daughter has very tight curls.  We typically use Shea Moisture and love it.  However, this is the first product that we have used that really leaves her hair feeling soft without a greasy feel. And this product definitely leaves her hair feeling softer than any others. Her curls are left more defined, but I would not say that they are at all &amp;#34;relaxed.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for over 3 years now. Great for the look of a perfect curl. Love it.</li>
            <li> We use this product on my four year-old daughter&#x27;s curly hair. It gives her smooth, soft curls that look natural and not at all \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; or stiff. The scent is nice too. A little bit of product goes a long way! I just squirt a dime-sized amount onto damp hands and run it through her hair. Then I comb it or clip it back, and it looks so much less frizzy and more under control than if I don&#x27;t put products in her hair. It&#x27;s kind of pricey, but well worth the price since it works well and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This product is the only thing that keeps my daughter&#x27;s super curly blonde hair looking great all day long.  It keeps hair from becoming frizzy while helping curls soft and defined.</li>
            <li> My very short older adult hair is much softer and less frizzy when I use this Curl Calmer.  Thank you.</li>
