            <li>Wonderful products!!</li>
            <li>This kit is perfect for that.</li>
            <li>seriously, I&#x27;m impressed all the way to the moon!!</li>
            <li>The best skincare system I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with these products esp the rose cleansing milk.</li>
            <li>Great Product .Its</li>
            <li>I bought this sampler and loved it.</li>
            <li>Good effective skin care doesn&#x27;t have to cost a fortune.  </li>
            <li>Glad I came across her products as I was browsing online!</li>
            <li>The spray is so refreshing in the mornings!</li>
            <li>Love the rose smell!</li>
            <li>So it might be nice if they added a toner to the line.</li>
            <li>The smell is incredible and being all natural is the icing on the (cake!)face!!!!  </li>
            <li>I gave this set two stars for two reasons: the rose water refreshing spray is nice, and I don&#x27;t think it caused any issues.</li>
            <li>The bottles and packaging were very nice, and I appreciate the fact that they offer sample sizes to try before investing in full sizes.</li>
            <li>My skin is clear, balanced and perfectly hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Rose line as this is what the person used but thank goodness I was able to get a sampe kit.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not easiy impressed my facial products</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the smell of roses, and this Evan Healy kit was no exception</li>
            <li>I was happy with my skin before, but I really believe i have seen improvement in the three weeks I have been using EH products.  </li>
            <li>Now I am enjoying food and my life again.  </li>
            <li>but I think many can relate.  </li>
            <li>I love this skin care system.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love rose-scented items, but I would have tolerated the smell for the sake of healthier skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this line.</li>
            <li>So when purchasing for travel, you can run out of the moisturizer, if you&#x27;re gone for more than a week.</li>
            <li>There should really be more moisturizer included in the kit.</li>
            <li>Love it love it love it.</li>
            <li>Thank U :)</li>
            <li>I just cannot explain how luxurious they are, the quality, the stunning ingredients,</li>
            <li>Glad I started with trial size</li>
            <li>and it is quite nice, will plan to buy a full sized jar</li>
            <li>My skin is a combination of oily and dry, so this seemed like the perfect product line to balance it all out.</li>
            <li>They smell incredible and instantly made skin feel softer.</li>
            <li>When my face looks good, it&#x27;s so much easier to go out in the world.  </li>
            <li>The scent is strong.</li>
            <li>All the thought that went into creating a fine line of skin care ,begins with the quality of the soil.</li>
            <li>I am thinking of switching over and making Evan Healy products my primary skincare line.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s obviously a quality product from a great company.</li>
            <li>Very affordable and effective.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>It is by far the best facial product and will use it always!  </li>
            <li>The upside is that the powdered clay mask more readily lends itself to travelling that something in a liquid or creme.  </li>
            <li>+ products (promising fantastic results)</li>
            <li>Evan Healy has great natural products - was looking to try the facial moisturizer</li>
            <li>The rose cleanser simply takes my breath away!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to John Master&#x27;s Organics Rose Foaming Face Wash.</li>
            <li>saying that certain products containing these so called special ingredients will change my skin.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not working as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>I have tried various amounts of the oil, toner, and lotion to see if I could find a better balance, but it still seems to be an issue after two weeks.</li>
            <li>--It doesn&#x27;t take much to do its job!</li>
            <li>My skin breathes for real now indeed!</li>
            <li>I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have recently noticed my age is catching up with me.</li>
            <li>how can something sooo absolutely natural have such powerful scent!!!  </li>
            <li>I had gone back to a natural brand and my skin was better, but only ok.  </li>
            <li>If I could hug the creator of this product, I certainly would.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend these products and really like their natural/organic nature.  </li>
            <li>I also like that I can pick it up at Whole Foods when grocery shopping.</li>
            <li>Buy it for a friend, and she likes it so much</li>
            <li>(I bought this sample kit at Whole Foods)  </li>
            <li>I was excited to find a complete kit that was natural and affordable.</li>
            <li>After two full weeks of using twice daily, here are my observations:  1)</li>
            <li>I have had very dry skin - 58 years old and nothing worked magic like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>This stuff does live up to its name!  </li>
            <li>I thought, perhaps, it was just a coincidence, so I tried the regime again, 10 days after the first, and the exact same thing happened.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use a dark washcloth (or even a paper towel!)</li>
            <li>I have used countless serums to calm the redness.  </li>
            <li>and I was actually very self conscious because of this smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this set made me instantly  open the Evan Healy site and buy another 50$ worth of products.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I really enjoy using this line.</li>
            <li>I have also used REN which I love but can only get at Sephora and it tend to be more expensive than Murad.  </li>
            <li>so rarely try new stuff, however, this cleans and softens your face without making it dry or oily...........</li>
            <li>After just a few uses I noticed a HUGE difference and no breakouts or irritation has occured.  </li>
            <li>Hoping for glowing clear skin.  </li>
            <li>I went to a Health Store and the young girl there</li>
            <li>REFRAIN from using if you have sensitive prone skin.</li>
            <li>I like how the products feel on my face and just knowing its all natural.  </li>
            <li>The only complaint that I have is that the red clay mask is a bit messy and, if you have white towels, you best have your stain treatment standing by.</li>
            <li>My skin certainly FELT softer after using this product, but all anyone could see was my pimples and severely pink skin.     </li>
            <li>I Have been using the Evanhealy Blue for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>These all natural simple products work!!!</li>
            <li>I developed red patchy blistering skin.</li>
            <li>Shortly after using the products, in the morning and evening, my skin becomes very oily, and still has some dry patches.</li>
            <li>I will certainly consider their other products in the future.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but a little goes a long way and the Proactiv line of products isn&#x27;t very cheap either.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to finish these products, but I will not be buying this particular kit again due to the burning sensation while washing and the increase in oil production throughout the day/night.</li>
            <li>This really surprised me because my skin is not usually very sensitive.</li>
            <li>less star only because the smell is quite intense which makes me sneeze.</li>
            <li>After applying all the other products as directed, my skin feels very soft.</li>

            <li> Thousands of dollars down the drain on products that didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.  </li>
            <li> I have dry, roseacea, skin with blackheads.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m getting a thousand dollars spas treatments every single time I use one of these products.</li>
            <li> For the last few years I have used Murad products and a Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> No more piling on foundation to cover the redness only to see a cakey dry mask.  </li>
            <li> The mask seems to work well without over-drying, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The other thing I have found is the cleanser doesn&#x27;t seem to remove all makeup.</li>
            <li> Only to discover that my skin hasn&#x27;t changed and has only gotten worse.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the first time I used this regime, my face broke out in vicious pimples (I have never been prone to pimples); my cheeks turned bright pink and it stayed that way for almost 6 days!</li>
            <li> I think I may pick up some dark washcloths to keep on hand for the weekly mask.  </li>
            <li> I think even this sample kit will last me at least one month</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised &amp; disappointed really.</li>
            <li> When you purchase this kit, at least for me, the moisturizer runs out after a week and the cleanser &amp; spray in the kit last over 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have tried exfoliation products to help with the black heads and dryness.</li>
            <li> My face has gone from puzzlingly troubled for over a year now probably due to hormonal shifting, to 95% clear.  </li>
            <li> So I purchased this little kit thinking, this will have to do until I get home.  </li>
            <li> this little box of sample products.  </li>
            <li> This little box of sample products has changed my skin in the 6 days since using it.  </li>
            <li> and I have gotten very dry dull skin.  </li>
            <li> It cleared my face within a few days and it has NOT broke Out since.  </li>
            <li> I wear very little makeup if any.  </li>
            <li> I bought very expensice Lancome and Elizabeth Arden products and broke out so bad for over a month.  </li>
            <li> I just started using the Evan Healy face care kit after using Proactiv for the past 14 years.  </li>
            <li> I have piled on heavy thick moisturizers to remedy the dryness.  </li>
            <li> Countless cleansers, serums, treatments, moisturizers I have used only to be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> No more thick heavy moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> The rash on my face was so bad that I didn&#x27;t think it would ever clear up, yet this did the trick.  </li>
            <li> started to develop dry patches as well as small painful bumps that weren&#x27;t quite</li>
            <li> I would have been very disappointed to spend so much money on something that did not go well with my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know it seems dramatic</li>
            <li> Nothing dramatic.  </li>
            <li> you will not go wrong.  </li>
            <li> My blemishes seem to shy away in a week now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I hated the smell.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff does live up to its name!  I&#x27;m not easiy impressed my facial products so rarely try new stuff, however, this cleans and softens your face without making it dry or oily...........in fact my face actually glows after!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the smell of roses, and this Evan Healy kit was no exception: smells like a dream!  Unfortunately, the first time I used this regime, my face broke out in vicious pimples (I have never been prone to pimples); my cheeks turned bright pink and it stayed that way for almost 6 days! I thought, perhaps, it was just a coincidence, so I tried the regime again, 10 days after the first, and the exact same thing happened. Boo!    I gave this set two stars for two reasons: the rose water refreshing spray is nice, and I don&#x27;t think it caused any issues. My skin certainly FELT softer after using this product, but all anyone could see was my pimples and severely pink skin.     I do not recommend this for someone with borderline-dry, borderline-sensitive skin (my skin type).</li>
            <li> I just started using the Evan Healy face care kit after using Proactiv for the past 14 years.  I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have recently noticed my age is catching up with me. Improper use of sunscreen and pregnancies has left me with hyperpigmentation and I have gotten very dry dull skin.  I am very impressed with these products esp the rose cleansing milk. They smell incredible and instantly made skin feel softer. After just a few uses I noticed a HUGE difference and no breakouts or irritation has occured.  A little pricey but a little goes a long way and the Proactiv line of products isn&#x27;t very cheap either.  I am thinking of switching over and making Evan Healy products my primary skincare line.  Glad I came across her products as I was browsing online!</li>
            <li> I Have been using the Evanhealy Blue for sensitive skin.  It is by far the best facial product and will use it always!  I bought very expensice Lancome and Elizabeth Arden products and broke out so bad for over a month.  I went to a Health Store and the young girl there suggested that I try this kit.  It cleared my face within a few days and it has NOT broke Out since.  The rash on my face was so bad that I didn&#x27;t think it would ever clear up, yet this did the trick.  The smell is incredible and being all natural is the icing on the (cake!)face!!!!  I have had very dry skin - 58 years old and nothing worked magic like this stuff.  Please try it - you will not go wrong.  And there are NO chemicals!!!!  LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> For the last few years I have used Murad products and a Clarisonic.  I have also used REN which I love but can only get at Sephora and it tend to be more expensive than Murad.  I was happy with my skin before, but I really believe i have seen improvement in the three weeks I have been using EH products.  I think it may be the toner making the biggest difference.  The only complaint that I have is that the red clay mask is a bit messy and, if you have white towels, you best have your stain treatment standing by. I cannot get the red out with soap and rinsing.  I think I may pick up some dark washcloths to keep on hand for the weekly mask.  The upside is that the powdered clay mask more readily lends itself to travelling that something in a liquid or creme.  I would recommend these products and really like their natural/organic nature.  I also like that I can pick it up at Whole Foods when grocery shopping.</li>
            <li> Wonderful products!! I bought this sampler and loved it. I now buy larger sizes of the individual products in the sampler.</li>
            <li> I would give this 10 stars.  My face has gone from puzzlingly troubled for over a year now probably due to hormonal shifting, to 95% clear.  I&#x27;ve only been using the products for 3 weeks.  If I could hug the creator of this product, I certainly would.  I had been at wits end, not wanting to try drugs and having had eliminated everything from my diet that I thought could be the cause of the blemishes.  Now I am enjoying food and my life again.  I know it seems dramatic but I think many can relate.  When my face looks good, it&#x27;s so much easier to go out in the world.  I love this skin care system.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit so I could take my facial products with me while traveling and not worry about them leaking or breaking.  This kit is perfect for that.</li>
            <li> I was on vacation and I ran out of a couple of my skin care products that I had put into travel sized jars.  So I purchased this little kit thinking, this will have to do until I get home.  I can&#x27;t begin to list off all the skin care products I have tried over the years.  I have been brainwashed by all the marketing and advertising out there saying that certain products containing these so called special ingredients will change my skin.  Only to discover that my skin hasn&#x27;t changed and has only gotten worse.  Thousands of dollars down the drain on products that didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.  I had gone back to a natural brand and my skin was better, but only ok.  Nothing dramatic.  Until... this little box of sample products.  Never has any of the $100+ products (promising fantastic results) I have purchased done what these products have done in the 6 days of using them.  I have dry, roseacea, skin with blackheads.  I have piled on heavy thick moisturizers to remedy the dryness.  I have used countless serums to calm the redness.  I have tried exfoliation products to help with the black heads and dryness. Hoping for glowing clear skin.  Countless cleansers, serums, treatments, moisturizers I have used only to be disappointed.  This little box of sample products has changed my skin in the 6 days since using it.  Gone is the redness and dryness that I have fought tirelessly for years.  No more thick heavy moisturizers.  No more piling on foundation to cover the redness only to see a cakey dry mask.  My skin is clear, balanced and perfectly hydrated.  Even my pores are much smaller and cleaner.  I wear very little makeup if any.  My skin glows.  And to think I only spent $25 to completely change my skin.  Her products have truly changed my skin and my life.  Good effective skin care doesn&#x27;t have to cost a fortune.  Don&#x27;t get caught up in the hype like I did.  These all natural simple products work!!!</li>
            <li> Buy it for a friend, and she likes it so much</li>
            <li> (I bought this sample kit at Whole Foods)  I was excited to find a complete kit that was natural and affordable. I wish every company offered sample sizes! My skin is a combination of oily and dry, so this seemed like the perfect product line to balance it all out. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not working as well as I had hoped. After two full weeks of using twice daily, here are my observations:  1) The cleanser burns while I&#x27;m washing my face. This really surprised me because my skin is not usually very sensitive. 2) After applying all the other products as directed, my skin feels very soft. 3) The mask seems to work well without over-drying, and a little goes a long way. Be sure to use a dark washcloth (or even a paper towel!) to remove it because it will stain! 4) Shortly after using the products, in the morning and evening, my skin becomes very oily, and still has some dry patches. I have tried various amounts of the oil, toner, and lotion to see if I could find a better balance, but it still seems to be an issue after two weeks. 5) The scent is strong. I don&#x27;t love rose-scented items, but I would have tolerated the smell for the sake of healthier skin.  I&#x27;m going to finish these products, but I will not be buying this particular kit again due to the burning sensation while washing and the increase in oil production throughout the day/night. I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s obviously a quality product from a great company. The bottles and packaging were very nice, and I appreciate the fact that they offer sample sizes to try before investing in full sizes. I think even this sample kit will last me at least one month--It doesn&#x27;t take much to do its job! I will certainly consider their other products in the future.</li>
            <li> The jars were open &amp; everything seems chalky &amp; expired. I&#x27;m really surprised &amp; disappointed really.</li>
            <li> I love this line. I&#x27;ve just started using it. The spray is so refreshing in the mornings! Neat concept. Two complaints, though. When you purchase this kit, at least for me, the moisturizer runs out after a week and the cleanser &amp; spray in the kit last over 3 weeks. So when purchasing for travel, you can run out of the moisturizer, if you&#x27;re gone for more than a week. There should really be more moisturizer included in the kit. The other thing I have found is the cleanser doesn&#x27;t seem to remove all makeup. If I use a toner, there seems to be a lot of makeup residue on the cotton pad...So it might be nice if they added a toner to the line. Other than that, I really enjoy using this line. Love the rose smell!</li>
            <li> Evan Healy has great natural products - was looking to try the facial moisturizer and it is quite nice, will plan to buy a full sized jar</li>
            <li> Love it love it love it. I didn&#x27;t even know about this product until I stumbled into it at PCC,, Seattle. Very affordable and effective. My blemishes seem to shy away in a week now. Thank U :)[[ASIN:B006KC7L6I Blue Face Care Kit by Evan Healy]]</li>
            <li> this set made me instantly  open the Evan Healy site and buy another 50$ worth of products. I just cannot explain how luxurious they are, the quality, the stunning ingredients, oh my god. My skin breathes for real now indeed! I feel like I&#x27;m getting a thousand dollars spas treatments every single time I use one of these products. The rose cleanser simply takes my breath away!!!!!!!! how can something sooo absolutely natural have such powerful scent!!!  seriously, I&#x27;m impressed all the way to the moon!!</li>
            <li> I developed red patchy blistering skin. REFRAIN from using if you have sensitive prone skin. I&#x27;m going back to John Master&#x27;s Organics Rose Foaming Face Wash.</li>
            <li> The best skincare system I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I like how the products feel on my face and just knowing its all natural.  It&#x27;s only been 5 days that I&#x27;ve been using it can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s doing anything to my skin yet.  Glad I started with trial size it will probably last ne a month.  One less star only because the smell is quite intense which makes me sneeze.</li>
            <li> Someone told me about this as someone she knew used it and her skin was glowing.  I bought the Rose line as this is what the person used but thank goodness I was able to get a sampe kit.  I would have been very disappointed to spend so much money on something that did not go well with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;First, I hated the smell.  I felt like I smelled like a medicine shop and I was actually very self conscious because of this smell.&lt;br /&gt;I started to develop dry patches as well as small painful bumps that weren&#x27;t quite pimples.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it for two weeks and as I did not see any improvement nor did I ever start to like the smell, I discontinued my use.</li>
            <li> Great Product .Its all in the soil.All the thought that went into creating a fine line of skin care ,begins with the quality of the soil.Thank You!</li>
