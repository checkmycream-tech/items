            <li>Easy to use, and the color matches my hair perfectly.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and does a perfect job.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Godefroy medium is perfect and so easy, but you should have someone do it for you IMO.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product and I enjoy using it.  </li>
            <li>My brows look as good as when my esthetician does them, and it took 5 minutes at home</li>
            <li>They looked good.  </li>
            <li>The results are just as good as the Salon and cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I found it darkened them but not some of the stubborn grays so good.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>I used the medium brown and it looks good.</li>
            <li>I also think it would be a good idea to include some sort of color/stain remover for skin in the kit.</li>
            <li>Mail service was good.  </li>
            <li>Product good,</li>
            <li>Tried the medium brown (I&#x27;m fair skinned with graying, med brown hair).</li>
            <li>I have a fair to med complexion and brown/frosted hair</li>
            <li>Their product is good but their quality over sight is abysmal.</li>
            <li>and they still look good.  </li>
            <li>Provides good coverage.</li>
            <li>This seemed like a good solution.  </li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product.  </li>
            <li>and they still look good -</li>
            <li>I have 3 daughters who have fair eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Looks good for about 24 hours</li>
            <li>I have gray hair and fair skin and the medium brown was good for me.</li>
            <li>This is really good eyebrow dye.  </li>
            <li>It looks really good.</li>
            <li>Works good, I will buy it again.</li>
            <li>Loved this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This will not look good on you.  </li>
            <li>Good product, saves money.</li>
            <li>Still, a good value.</li>
            <li>My brows look so clean and perfect</li>
            <li>Its very easy to use and worked great.</li>
            <li>but otherwise it&#x27;s very easy to use and gives great color.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product, great value and excellent results.</li>

            <li>I am very glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>This product worked great, turned out more charcoal</li>
            <li>Good product if you want to tint your own eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, except I purchased a good artist&#x27;s brush and worked just great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and lasts a good three weeks.</li>
            <li>Why on earth have I waited so many years to do this?!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than having to apply eyeliner to color the gray brows every morning!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Tried this and love the results!  </li>

            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Beats paying $20 or more per visit to have it done in a salon!  </li>

            <li>It still works out cheaper and more convenient for me, so I&#x27;m sticking with it!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>easy to use, its a great product, and you save the trip to the cosmetic.</li>
            <li>This was an easy application with great results.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>The product is easy to use and gives great result.</li>
            <li>Works great and its so easy to use, I put it on 3 weeks ago and its still working well.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and color is great, but all the color went away in 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Easy to use and great results if you follow the directions.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and looks great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used both the Medium and the Light brown and both are great.</li>
            <li>dye worked amazing and lasts me about 1 month before I have to reapply.  </li>
            <li>look amazing..</li>
            <li>My eyebrows are light and sparse and it did a great job tinting them and not staining my skin.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product because it seemed to provide an inexpensive and effective  solution to middle-age &#x27;salt and pepper&#x27; brows that plague dark-haired women.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never dyed my own hair or eyebrows</li>
            <li>I like the kind of brow dye</li>
            <li>I tried this eyebrow tint and was thrilled with the result.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when you have to make your own instructions to tweak it</li>
            <li>I liked the medium brown eyebrow tint.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with the results and for $10</li>
            <li>And the color on my skin came off after washing my face twice, so sacrifice a couple days for nice color</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>His hair is course and kind of wiry</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend using vaseline under and over the brow; it also helps you get the kind of eyebrow shape you want.</li>
            <li>product is effective and very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I am not the most experienced eyebrow dyer, so I am sure the product works better for those who are.</li>
            <li>My brows were washed out from 25 years of the sun and this was a great way to restore the full color.</li>
            <li>I have quite sparse, fair eyebrows and this product will easily tint them so they are visible.  </li>
            <li>Color was good and mixing easy.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with how quick you can do this and how great the price is.</li>
            <li>This product is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I am hooked for good,its very easy to mix and use.</li>
            <li>and I thought this product was very easy to use.</li>
            <li>very easy application-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use, it works as it states it will.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Tweezing is very easy now because what grows in is lighter than the rest of my eyebrow.  </li>
            <li>This product was very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Saves a bundle instead of having salon do this - and very easy</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>This product is very easy to use and it does what it says.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was very easy.</li>
            <li>Would have loved it to be premixed, but fine the way it is...</li>
            <li>Easy instructions, easy to do, great results.  </li>
            <li>Wow, I am really impressed with this item.</li>
            <li>Best eyebrow dye I have used so far.</li>
            <li>Does and excellent job at giving color to the brows and looks natural.</li>
            <li>Perfect natural looking results.  </li>
            <li>but the coverage was excellent and the colour is natural.</li>
            <li>And Light brown for fair skin tones with gray/blonde/red hair.</li>
            <li>I saw the great reviews on this product, and bought it right away.  </li>
            <li>The dye alone doesn&#x27;t look great either, the color is not quite right and there is still spaces showing in my brows.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with how easy this product was to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use though!</li>
            <li>Easy to use!  </li>
            <li>Great dye, easy to use and so worth it!</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;m pretty happy.</li>
            <li>I am an extremely happy customer, this is the first time in about 30 years I can stop filling in my brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very light blond eyebrows and this product darkens them</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;medium-brown&#x27; is (very) light brown.....</li>
            <li>I have very light eyebrows and had been using an eyebrow pencil.  </li>
            <li>If I knew how easy it was to tint my own brows</li>
            <li>The Good thing is that it fades rather quickly, so after about 4-5 face washes you could visibly see it getting lighter.</li>
            <li>I loved how it turned out at the salon, but it seemed to fade awfully quick when the cost is $20 plus tip per trip.</li>
            <li>He has a lot of hair (lucky) and it makes him feel good and makes him look about 15 yrs.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows look much better with it.</li>
            <li>Works much better.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s quite cheap!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>&amp; I have 3 more applications.</li>
            <li>I tried this product and I love it.</li>
            <li>The product content itself is astonishingly skimpy.</li>
            <li>I love this product and recommend it to anyone looking for better brows.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using eyebrow powder and looking for something more permanent for over a year.</li>
            <li>This stuff is so fantastic I would buy it in bulk!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just OK.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It says not to use on eyelashes, but I did try it on my lower lashes and it worked much better than their eyelash tint.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
            <li>I love that its a cream type of dye, because it makes it easier to cover the brow hairs without having it drip off (like a liquid would).</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>When you mix it according to directions, it makes more than you need.  </li>
            <li>It does have to be done more often than I thought it would.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
            <li>I have much more confidence now, and it also helped to see where to tweeze.</li>
            <li>I ended up re-ordering 4 more boxes.</li>
            <li>Much better staying power, and I prefer the blue-based tint.</li>
            <li>but their&#x27;s are like $40 something or more.</li>
            <li>You can top the product on top of itself to create a deeper color which is what I did.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Lasts a couple of weeks, better than salon treatments.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d look like Elvira :-)</li>
            <li>In my case, more like Mommy Dearest than Groucho.</li>
            <li>apply for two minutes better than tatto or going to salon&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>BUT ITS BETTER THAN A SALON</li>
            <li>SO GLAD</li>
            <li>love this product and hope it&#x27;s never ever discontinued.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased.  </li>
            <li>Am planning to buy more.</li>
            <li>I tried this product and LOVE</li>
            <li>Applying the product took getting use to - make sure you use vasoline around ares you don&#x27;t want colored</li>
            <li>Love it - and wish I would have found it sooner.</li>
            <li>My daughter noticed something had changed for the better but couldn&#x27;t figure out what it was.  </li>
            <li>Over time, my body permanently adjusted itself to never sleep with my eyebrows touching my pillows so that if I was at a sleepover I could wake up with eyebrows still on my face.</li>
            <li>later I have great eyebrows again!</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I like it better than Roux, and you also can&#x27;t beat Godefroy&#x27;s price.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a need for it any more.  </li>
            <li>Love product&lt;</li>
            <li>When they went out of business I went online and found to my delight I could continue using this product and cost was better too.</li>
            <li>Okay they are a bit darker than they should be but that darkness soon faded (four days)</li>
            <li>I am pleased.</li>
            <li>I have light brown eyebrows and it turns them darker within 1 minute tops!</li>
            <li>Someone had used most of this already.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad the shade wasn&#x27;t any darker.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>so glad I found this.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>Bought the pencil; wish I&#x27;d kept the money because this is so much better.</li>
            <li>Yes, darkening my eyebrows gives much better definition; no, I&#x27;m not going to do that every day.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I discovered this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this tint.  </li>
            <li>I love this product :)</li>
            <li>Will make sure to get a lighter color</li>
            <li>Excellent coverage for short gray hairs</li>
            <li>The eyebrow brush gave me more control.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy with both the results and the ease of application with the Godefroy Instant Eyebrow tint.  </li>
            <li>Lasts 6 weeks or more.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I wish it had more then one mixing cup, so I could just toss the used one.</li>
            <li>Will reorder, but in light brown!</li>
            <li>My eyebrows have never looked better.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to put tint</li>
            <li>Followed directions precisely but ended up looking like Graucho Marx!</li>
            <li>Since my hair is off-black, I was able to leave the product on for 4 minutes</li>
            <li>but it worked out okay.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars as I found that it didn&#x27;t work any better than the mustache and sideburn color that I can buy in CVS, Wallgreens, etc.</li>
            <li>WONDERFUL, LOCALLY IT COST 3 TIMES</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten the dye everywhere on more than one occasion,</li>
            <li>It makes more tint than needed.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>I plan to purchase again and again :)</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I wanted to darken my brows for more drama and to match my hair.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I love the way I look.  </li>
            <li>It is okay</li>
            <li>OK, I&#x27;ll admit it here.</li>
            <li>I use this every four weeks to make my eyebrows appear on my face :-)</li>
            <li>There are better products than this with more color and more applications per box.  </li>
            <li>Getting it done professionally only lasted 2-3 weeks, I am very impressed!!!</li>
            <li>Just make sure you get it off the surrounding skin with a q tip.</li>
            <li>What more could one want.  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>love this product havent had the color on my brows but a couple days</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to apply and cleans up easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was insanely fast!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the results, though I&#x27;d be interested in experimenting with the light brown in the summer months.</li>
            <li>I think the eyebrows are the most important part of your face, and I feel so much better to be able to get up</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s pretty buildable color wise.</li>
            <li>As long as they continue to make this, I will be a proud user!</li>
            <li>it was kind f cool...</li>
            <li>It works pretty good.</li>
            <li>you first apply it, the color looks good.</li>
            <li>I have medium brown hair and the medium brown was perfect, but I did not leave it on very long.</li>
            <li>it is only good for about 2 weeks, but on the bright side it onlytakes about 3 minutes to apply.</li>
            <li>Great time saver and natural looking!</li>
            <li>I was even able to pick up the really fine blond hairs so that his brows  look fuller.</li>
            <li>I have white eyebrows and eyelashes and am very fair.</li>
            <li>I did like the product and will try the light brown in hopes that will provide a better shade.</li>
            <li>I was also happy that this dye did not irritate my sensitive skin.   </li>
            <li>delivered fast and in good condition.</li>
            <li>The product is good and really tints the eyebrows well.  </li>

            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is fairly easy to use, and comes with everything you need to mix and apply.</li>

            <li>Easy to use and lasts.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Still cheaper than the pros and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This Is a very quick easy method.</li>
            <li>It works and is easy to apply, but it lasts about 2 weeks instead of the 6 advertised.</li>
            <li>Gray Eyebrows take away any youthful looks,and the moment you apply this easy to use tint,you can see the change in your appearance.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say 4 but still for the price, how easy it is and</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Easy to use once you get the hang of the idea</li>
            <li>It was a easy process and it came out</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Followed the easy directions.  </li>
            <li>easy to use &amp; lasts longer.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easily removed with color remover pads), and it lasts a satisfactory length of time - about 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li>but I use a strong, detoxifying face wash that could be why for me.</li>
            <li>This product works awesome, very happy with results!&lt;br /&gt;Eyebrows stayed nice and dark for at least a month!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely</li>
            <li>I love this product as it is simple to use and for me, very effective.  </li>
            <li>It is true  that \\&quot;medium\\&quot; brown is much more like \\&quot;dark\\&quot; brown,  so order the color accordingly.  </li>
            <li>I have dark brown hair and Medium Brown color is perfect.</li>
            <li>The color was too dark and is asked for medium brown; it works great!</li>
            <li>I was so worried about the color, it goes on really dark, but after rinsing, it&#x27;s a perfect match.</li>
            <li>The timing on the charts (easy to read insert provided) was accurate for me.  </li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>No irritation or redness, so darn easy to use and cheap.</li>
            <li>It took about a week for the color to start looking more natural, and after that I was very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>With thicker brows, you might want to rinse off the paste more quickly.  </li>
            <li>those materials seem to fade the color more quickly.</li>
            <li>just so you could even see my eyebrows and that just doesn&#x27;t look very natural on me unless i&#x27;m having a good eyebrow day.</li>
            <li>But once you know your own preference you will love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, very little clean -up, very reasonable price, and it looks great!</li>
            <li>Great color and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Brows came out great.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li>Honestly though it was SO easy even for my first time, it was so quick to process, I have light brows</li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference in how I look without make-up.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows were still too light, and those sparse light hairs were too light.  </li>
            <li>I use to be a huge fan of this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely happy with this product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I ordered light brown.</li>
            <li>light ash blond</li>
            <li>Easy clean up.  </li>
            <li>I have always had \\&quot;light brown\\&quot; tints done before.</li>
            <li>I have light reddish hair</li>
            <li>My hair is light /med</li>
            <li>order again but will try the light brown.</li>
            <li>I have light eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Overall great product.</li>
            <li>Do one brow at a time as it is important not to get this gel in your eyes.</li>
            <li>Its so light</li>
            <li>The results on my clients were great and they left happy.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>But when I do, I will do it a week or so before something important comes up.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the product with varying time and 4 minutes last time makes me happy.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows are light brown</li>
            <li>The color really makes my eyes look nice.  </li>
            <li>I had my brows professionally tinted about a month ago and loved it so much, I wanted to continue tinting them but on my own.</li>
            <li>It works great and last for 4 to 6 weeks before I need to repeat.</li>
            <li>Rarely have I been so satisfied with a purchase.</li>
            <li>Always came out too light and what tint there was overlapped onto surrounding skin.</li>
            <li>So much more economical than getting a brow tint at a salon.</li>
            <li>( I have light brown hair. )  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, Amazon reimbursed me the amount</li>
            <li>hadn&#x27;t even realized eyebrow dye was available for home use until I tried an online search, and this looked like an inexpensive option.</li>
            <li>(I used the timer on my phone to time the process, and touchups, precisely.)</li>
            <li>I never thought I would be free of filling in my sparce eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>I now use the light brown color and it matches well with my brunette hair.</li>
            <li>Medium brown for light to medium skin tones with gray/blonde/red hair.</li>
            <li>I used the wooden applicator that was included and it worked great.</li>
            <li>As a light haired person, I would prefer to see this product in light brown/taupe.  </li>
            <li>The price is great, and you can get several appliations with each capsule of tint powder.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re light</li>
            <li>Awesome, simple and fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very excited that there are three more applications making the whole beauty process one of the cheapest I have done.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you choose the right color - the tint is darker than you can tell from the label.  </li>
            <li>It is super easy to apply and gets great results in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>are much significantly lighter than the light brown that were in the box.  </li>
            <li>You are not going to get a rich color when you get a light brown or medium brown box.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 6 months and can say it continues to work beautifully for me although I am having to use it about every 3 weeks in order to keep a good strong color on my brows because I have some white/ grey hairs to dye.</li>
            <li>This is a quick and easy to use product and saves time  when doing your morning makeup if you have light/gray  hair and need eyebrow color.</li>
            <li>it!&lt;br /&gt;I found it super easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy to apply-</li>
            <li>This product is quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This eyebrow tint worked just as promised and was so quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>super easy to use.</li>
            <li>I had success in ONE MINUTE!</li>
            <li>Works great on grey eyebrow</li>
            <li>I was pretty pleased with the results after that.</li>
            <li>I may not have even tried this product with any success!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and works FAST!!  </li>
            <li>Works great, I never expected such great results so fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fair skinned, light haired, woman of northern European stock.  </li>
            <li>The cuticle was clean within a week, but my nail won&#x27;t be clean until grows out.</li>
            <li>I liked the concept of being able to color/darken my eyebrows (especially as my color is fading!)</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;d purchase the light brown next time, as my skin is fair.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It does dye your skin but one quick scrub and the problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;Great solution for those who have light brow</li>
            <li>Doing this allows me to just clean them up.</li>
            <li>The hairs are very coarse and it takes a lot of eyebrow pencil to make them look filled in - which isn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li>The result is nice but it doesn&#x27;t last more than 3 days...</li>
            <li>The petroleum jelly made clean up a breeze.  </li>
            <li>but I can clean it off with a q-tip.</li>
            <li>I found this tint to be much more effective than regular hair dye.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that my eyebrow tint lasts longer if i clean my eyebrows with a washcloth after applying lotions and sunscreen to my face.  </li>
            <li>A good product that does the job of tinting the eyebrows without too much fuss or muss and is much cheaper than having it done in a salon.</li>
            <li>I felt the final result looked as good or better as any salon job, and the price is certainly right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product is more reasonable then going to the salon and having it done.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use a full capsule.</li>
            <li>The dye itself was easy to use and worked very well, adhering quickly and easily to the hair without leaving any staining on my skin.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give a 5 star is because although the box says it&#x27;s good for 6 weeks, in my case I have to re-do every 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I used that picture on the box, as well as the product&#x27;s recommendation to use this shade for red hair and fair to medium skin tone, when I bought \\&quot;medium brown\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>so cost effective and so natural looking.</li>
            <li>Had good results tinting my &#x27;white&#x27; brows to match my haor color.</li>
            <li>The 1st time I left the dye for 2 minutes as instructed and I LOVED the results.</li>
            <li>I looked like Joan Crawford the first day, but the 2nd day was better and by the third day they looked awesome!!  </li>
            <li>bought this product hoping it would give me a nice natural looking eyebrow color and it delivered.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for a good color to go with my blonde hair.</li>
            <li>I got medium brown and its true to the color.</li>
            <li>Ordering through Amazon was easy, with very reasonable shipping costs.</li>
            <li>This was a good product, it was pretty easy to use and definitely did the job of colouring my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>super easy and very fast too.</li>
            <li>Pretty easy process -</li>
            <li>This product is exactly as described and easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>It was very simple to apply, I used petroleum jelly around the brow area, and I used a clean mascara wand to apply - left it on 3 minutes each side and my brows were perfect.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time coloring my graying eyebrows, and I found it to be extremely easy.</li>
            <li>Luckily after finding this product-not anymore.  </li>
            <li>Hair dye isn&#x27;t made for your face and it fades quickly.</li>
            <li>They are just super</li>
            <li>My brows now look perfect and it only took about five minutes total.</li>
            <li>the gray in my brows is more and more obvious.</li>
            <li>Received it quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is quick:</li>
            <li>This product is great and really does last</li>
            <li>I have learned to mix a smaller amount of the dye  and reseal the casing that the color comes in so that we are able get more applications.</li>
            <li>Also is quick.</li>
            <li>But this was SUPER</li>
            <li>I have golden blonde hair and fair skin and my lashes and brows are nonexistent without some help.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other brands of eye brow tint and this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I have pretty light brows.  </li>
            <li>the Godefroy eyebrow tint works very fast (don&#x27;t over do the timing!)</li>
            <li>After using this product for more than six months, I would say tinting every three weeks is about normal.</li>
            <li>I have used other eyebrow dyes before and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not unpleasant and I think part of the adjustment is going from none to WHOA</li>
            <li>This product is ok, not hard to apply.</li>
            <li>In addition, hot flashes removes what makeup I do use, so I find this product very useful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to eyebrow tinting, so wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect</li>
            <li>I have bought these previously and they were great.</li>
            <li>The color does not last as long as advertised, but even if I had to reapply every week, I would still be very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>this non toxic formula goes on easy and fast- tints the hair and leaves just a bit of skin tint to HELP fill in the look of the brow.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and works fast.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to use and  much cheaper than the  beauty supply store product.</li>
            <li>the product is easy to use and very permanent but watch out for your color choice.</li>
            <li>but its fast to use, easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Whole thing was inexpensive, easy and works.  </li>
            <li>MY NEW FAVORITE BEAUTY TOOL..EASY TO USE AND NOT EXPENSIVE!  </li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>This product saves me so much time in the morning!!  </li>
            <li>I love this product - as I am now almost 50 years old (arrrgh!)</li>
            <li>Since I can actually see them now :)!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll definitely be buying it more!</li>
            <li>but I have to say its so easy and makes such a stunning difference.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions as provided and was happy to see that the applications are in gel caps so that you don&#x27;t have much waste.  </li>
            <li>I think they look better and more natural than when I have them done professionally</li>
            <li>Most likely ProActiv (which contains something that lightens hair so be careful, but great product as well.)</li>
            <li>This product works very well but the materials are extremely cheap.  </li>
            <li>sure to use an old mascara brush to put it on.</li>
            <li>This is a great product especially if you like to tint your eyebrows frequently.  </li>
            <li>With this product, I&#x27;m able to tint my brows and have them look natural.</li>
            <li>BUT It&#x27;s still TOTALLY worth</li>
            <li>I used the dark brown and it worked great the first time.</li>
            <li>It will fade to a more natural color if you do that.</li>
            <li>It is worth it in the end.      </li>
            <li>My recommendation: use the full amount the first  time and after that, adjust the amount of powder you remove from the capsule.</li>
            <li>For me, it works great and saves me from paying big bucks to have my eyebrows dyed by a professional.  </li>
            <li>The 2nd time I left for 4-5 minutes and got a much darker result but still extremely happy with the way it looks!</li>
            <li>It is nice to have your eyebrows back!  </li>
            <li>I liked it but am ordering the lighter shade next time.</li>
            <li>This will save me having to fill in my brows with a pencil every day and looks more natural as well.</li>
            <li>Each capsule makes enough dye that if you take it off and decide that it&#x27;s too light you can still reapply more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For going to a salon and getting my eyebrows tinted for $10 to $15, this kit was absolutely worth it</li>
            <li>I find myself going more natural, well except for the tinting of my lashes and brows.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I am a natural redhead and love the look of darker brows, so I used the &amp;#34;Medium Brown&amp;#34; shade.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s actually fun to do.</li>
            <li>followed a lot of previous viewers&#x27; advice the first time I used it, but after that I was able to just do it my own way.</li>
            <li>very thin ad light eyebrows and this tint works perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is a good product and works as it states, does not seem to last very long - about 4 weeks but in my case that was a good thing since the brown is really almost a black/brown and much darker than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>It does kind of stain the skin under your eyebrow even if you put vaseline around the brow, so when you first tint, it will look darker and more &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; than it will after a few days of face washing.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you mix it really well and don&#x27;t leave on too long &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I have really light thin eyebrows and I&#x27;ve always wanted nice full eyebrows and now I have them!!</li>
            <li>It is really long lasting and very good price.</li>
            <li>so purchased this product and tried it right away.  </li>
            <li>if I´m doing it right.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the right shade for me.</li>
            <li>Every time a salon colors my brows when they do my hair, it seems to wash right off.</li>
            <li>exactly right</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s right for you.</li>
            <li>We woman do what we have to do right.  </li>
            <li>I do it right before a shower.</li>
            <li>and it was just right.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>With my eyebrows the right color, my face has it&#x27;s \\&quot;frame\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I used medium brown and the color is just right.  </li>
            <li>My eyebrows are the source of my embarrassment right now.</li>
            <li>I also, very carefully, use the tint on my eyelashes (which are also fair and sparse!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tried this on Saturday for the first time and am, so far, pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>More activator waters the color powder down more</li>
            <li>If I do it at night before going to bed the extra dye on my skin seems to wear off by the next morning and my brows look great for the first time in my life!</li>
            <li>product itself was easy to apply and use, but if you&#x27;re actually looking for a medium brown, maybe try ordering the light brown.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply looks great, the only thing I have to say that the product claims it will last 6 weeks, and I really am lucky if it lasts two, but other than that I love it.</li>
            <li>I have only use it once so far, and it really works great.</li>
            <li>and I look good with dark brown brows -</li>
            <li>The best part is for the next month I have to use vey little brow makeup.</li>
            <li>Still a great product for us with pale brows!</li>
            <li>The first day I always feel like they are a bit dark (since I am so fair)</li>
            <li>This is a very reddish brown, and lightens up tremendously within a week or two.</li>
            <li>It was super fast.</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews and tips, I went with the medium brown instead of the dark, and I&#x27;m happy that I did because it was darker than I expected.</li>
            <li>I am a true fair skinned, blonde with blue eyes.  </li>
            <li>I actually feared social events that involved swimming, sweating or any kind of make-over because I would have to worry about my eyebrow color coming off!</li>
            <li>The instructions were easy to follow and there was no mess.  </li>
            <li>Having lived with very light eyebrows all of my life, I was looking for a simple inexpensive way to color them.  </li>
            <li>I have very light blonde eyebrows and have always had to use a pencil to fill them in or some sort of brow filler powder.</li>
            <li>So far for 8 months now it works fine</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and the tinted brows and lashes stay tinted for a long time.</li>
            <li>but on me it&#x27;s about 5 good weeks and a week or so of having to add a little filler before i get around to dying them again.</li>
            <li>I think it starts to fade pretty quickly, that is, it is advertised to last for 6 weeks, but if you want well-defined brows, you&#x27;d want to tint them more often, but this is true of the professional tint as well.</li>
            <li>Okay, all the hairs are in, and some are very light (especially the ones that grew back)  </li>
            <li>First time I ever tinted my eyebrows.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, I searched the net for an eyebrow dye, mostly to even out what the hairdresser had missed, and found Godefroy on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The dye will stain your skin just a bit, but it fades after the first washing of your face.  </li>
            <li>I just purchased and used for the first time.</li>
            <li>I naturally have medium brown hair and light brown eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>I will definately be getting this many times in the future.</li>
            <li>The dye works well though, and fast!  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used it and it did work.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you&#x27;re next to your sink, so you can rinse out the color immediately.  </li>
            <li>Pretty pricey.</li>
            <li>and it seems to bleed through on my skin more than stay in my actual brow hair.  </li>
            <li>This is not the first time this company has messed up an order.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>and I had more than enough for both eyebrows.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s not that big of a deal to me since I just mix a bit more dye and mins</li>
            <li>Has enough for more than 4 applications.</li>
            <li>The first thing I would do when I woke up is go to the vanity to use my eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li>It has been about a month since I first applied</li>
            <li>You can find you tube videos to show you exactly how to apply.</li>
            <li>If you go outside the lines, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>The procedure and product are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>and it really does the job!</li>
            <li>It helped me to watch you tube videos on it before I tried it the first time.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m sure they will fade soon enough).</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li>I was worried it would be too light and left it on for the full amount of time recommended.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wayyyyyy cheaper than going to a salon, I will most definitely be ordering it again.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>this was a first for me....</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a whole lot cheaper!  </li>
            <li>This is the first time using this product.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t color as well, so I immediately did it again and left it on for 6 more minutes.  </li>
            <li>I thought they did the trick, but the color is just not really that nice looking.  </li>
            <li>Great coverage and long lasting</li>
            <li>, the 2 mins was more than enough!</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t last more than 3 or 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I know from the first time it was longer then 5 weeks.</li>
            <li>Read directions carefully on first use.</li>
            <li>I did use vaseline around the brows to keep the dye away (as per the instructions) and was glad I did as there was a bit of dye left on the skin under the brows.  </li>
            <li>The first coat I kept on for 90 seconds.</li>
            <li>I had an old capsule from the light brown</li>
            <li>They are naturally a light brown and now with the grey they looked too light for the hair colour.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure which product to use since each color is a different listing on Amazon</li>
            <li>There is enough in each cap for probably two applications or more.</li>
            <li>It did darken my brows though but make sure not to step out for 24 hours in public or it looks like you been sharpeed!</li>
            <li>I was worried the first time</li>
            <li>Follow the instructions exactly.  </li>
            <li>The only down side is that ur new awesome eyebrows start to fade after 3 weeks or so</li>
            <li>Works but color came off in 3 days, don&#x27;t worry about staining ur skin, color comes off super fast, too fast for my taste</li>
            <li>Easy to use, doesn&#x60;t take more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Using warm water and soap to clean the &amp;#34;tools&amp;#34; seems to prevent the staining of the porcelain sink, but the countertop has small brown spots now...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not convinced the color will last six weeks, but I&#x27;m headed into my third week and it looks pretty good still.</li>
            <li>Came with easy to read directions and was easy to use, the color doesnt stay really after 3 weeks, which i expected, so i still give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li>I just ordered the \\&quot;Godefroy Double Lash &amp; Brow Treatment\\&quot; since I love the eyebrow tint so much, so I will be writing a review about it after I give that product a go.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, the instructions are clear and if you have a mirror and a steady hand</li>
            <li>Finally I don&#x27;t have to spend too much time working on my eyebrows in the morning :-).  </li>
            <li>I feel more confident going without make-up, at least I have eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I was hopeful after all of the positive reviews, but this product did not work for me at all.  </li>
            <li>The color lasts a long time and once you get a good method down, it&#x27;s fast and easy.  </li>
            <li>I wish the color description was more accurate, also I don&#x27;t know who would need the color in a whole capsule, it seems like abut of a waste.</li>
            <li>It said it worked on grey but found it did a better job just colouring my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I do one brow at a time, following the directions, until I&#x27;m happy with the color before doing the other brow.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s so much cheaper than having it done professionally, and looks so much cleaner and more natural than makeup!</li>
            <li>I was very nervous to use this product the first time</li>
            <li>I tried the medium brown and ended up letting the tint sit for approx 2 minutes each (i tried 1 minute for the first time and wasn&#x27;t quite dark enough), and am EXTREMELY happy with the turnout.</li>
            <li>next time i&#x27;ll do 40 seconds, other than that great product.</li>
            <li>I have naturally bleach blonde brows that take to dye very easily.</li>
            <li>Due to age related lightening of my eyebrows, I was needing to use more and more eyebrow pencil/powder</li>
            <li>Also, I used half a capsule and the wood applicator and got amazing results.</li>
            <li>And it cleans the color off of your face easy enough</li>
            <li>Otherwise, was easy enough to use.&lt;br /&gt;Any</li>
            <li>This is a simple, easy to use product.  </li>
            <li>So simple so easy</li>
            <li>I wiped with a dry tissue to make sure that my brows were not damp.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is somewhat easy to apply however, 2 days later it looks like you never used it at all!!!</li>
            <li>Very simple instructions, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The wooden tool that came with it was really easy to use too.  </li>
            <li>This is very simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 12 days now, with daily swims in the sea, and showers, and yet the shade is still holding strong.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise the product is easy to apply and looks good, just didn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li>and this certainly makes a world of difference.</li>
            <li>After a certain age, my eyebrows started to lighten up.</li>
            <li>and this certainly makes a world of difference.</li>
            <li>I gave only 4 stars because the product claims to last for 6 weeks, and I havent found this to be true - more like 3 to 4 weeks of color.</li>
            <li>Well, to be safe I did only the 2 mins and decided to add more on if I thought it wasn&#x27;t dark</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t use the petroleum like it recommends, and it still cleans any extra color off my face just fine).  </li>
            <li>I found the medium brown color was perfect for my medium auburn hair color, not any lighter or darker than expected, and looked very natural after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive compared to going to a salon.</li>
            <li>I will try the light brown next time.</li>
            <li>Next time, I will order Light Brown.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>My advice to those who have tried it with unsatisafctory results:  Really glop in on your brows</li>
            <li>The dye stains hair very well</li>
            <li>With this product, I can really see my eyebrows, even from a distance.  </li>
            <li>but it really didn&#x27;t cover like I thought it would.</li>
            <li>this product helps sooo much.</li>
            <li>I had looked into eyebrow dye in the beauty supply store, but it was about $40 which is too much for me.</li>
            <li>With the Roux brand you really need to use the get-the-color-off-your-face gel that comes with the package.  </li>
            <li>Well, based on these reviews of people needing to leave the tint on longer than the 1-2 minutes on the directions, and how light the color was--I followed all the directions, but left the dye on for 10-12 minutes, and WATCH OUT--</li>
            <li>So I just re-ordered the same product in light brown.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>will save me SO MUCH $$$.</li>
            <li>Next time I order I will order the light brown instead.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>you don´t need the whole capsule at once.</li>
            <li>( yeah, just what a woman wants to happen :C ) except for the hair on my head, and my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I really wish I had known about this product years ago.</li>
            <li>Much easier than the supplied toothpick applicators.</li>
            <li>I tried it again and it didn&#x27;t seem to take very well.</li>
            <li>I wish this lasted a whole month - but it of course eventually fades when you wash your face, etc....</li>
            <li>Very annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has made my life so much easier, let me tell you.  </li>
            <li>I found myself reapplying the tint once a week because it faded so fast.</li>
            <li>Also, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and I am just ready to re do them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easier to control how much to &#x27;tap&#x27; into the mixing</li>
            <li>Thanks for listening.&lt;br /&gt;DMW</li>
            <li>I have very bleached out eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Its much cheaper than going to the salon &amp; you have \\&quot;control\\&quot; over the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve discovered you don&#x27;t need the whole capsule</li>
            <li>After much looking found Godefroy and ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess on how much liquid solution to put with it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go out.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much in the way of eyebrows (hypothyroid).</li>
            <li>When I was a girl you could go to the corner drugstore and buy a 3 or 4 ounce bottle of brow and lash dye for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>There wasn&#x27;t much change</li>
            <li>I had to really scrub the color off.</li>
            <li>Much easier to use that Roux tint.</li>
            <li>However, even if you wash the dye off very thoroughly when done, if you&#x27;re fair-skinned with sparse/fine brows like me you&#x27;ll probably still have staining in the brow area itself.</li>
            <li>Watch the video, it was very helpful.</li>
            <li>It saves me so much time vs trying to pencil in sparse areas every morning.</li>
            <li>It worked really well.  </li>
            <li>I have very light/sparse eyebrows and have been going to the salon for tinting to the tune of $20/visit.</li>
            <li>Make sure u put it on the skin as if u were using a pencil to cover empty areas, but it has to go on the skin or it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant to use this product, but decided to give it a whirl.</li>
            <li>I applied the dye (light brown)on one eyebrow only and waited just 1 minute before wiping it off.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I decided to try my brows and the hair began to fill in, but you couldn&#x27;t really see it.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use a whole capsule each time.  </li>
            <li>It dyes very</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>The brows really frame the face and with this inexpensive product</li>
            <li>thanks to all of the reviewers without whose tips and advice</li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>The whole area around my eyebrows is swollen, itchy, irritated.</li>
            <li>Very upset</li>
            <li>It really lasted 6+ weeks as advertised.</li>
            <li>Perfect color for my dirty blonde/light brown hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very concentrated</li>
            <li>I have very blond eyebrows</li>
            <li>I purchased the medium brown and had to reapply a few times to tint the more stubborn grays,  but the effect was entirely worth it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay if you don&#x27;t mind the red and having to re-dye frequently, but I&#x27;m using the Roux tint now.</li>
            <li>makes a difference in my appearance...and am thrilled i don&#x27;t have to use a pencil everyday......</li>
            <li>The product works good as far as darkening, but there are a few downsides.  </li>
            <li>sure in the coming months we&#x27;ll see even less product with a higher purchase price.  </li>
            <li>Make sure there are no phone calls or other interruptions while you are mixing &amp; applying the color, because you&#x27;ll want to focus on timing the length of time that you leave the color on.  </li>
            <li>It works better than any other eyebrow dye I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I have very light eyebrows and this color was quite dark for me.  </li>
            <li>I have dark brown hair with very light brown eyebrows.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows came out much closer to the shade on the \\&quot;dark brown\\&quot; box, to the point where I checked the box 3 times to be sure I bought \\&quot;medium brown\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I found that if I use a part of one of the capsules, mixed with a couple of&lt;br /&gt;drops of the liquid gel, it does a great job for no more eyebrows than I have.  </li>
            <li>I used Swiss O&#x27;Par in the past, and this is much simpler and equally effective.</li>
            <li>However, my hair is dark blond, my complexion is medium fair, my eyes are blue.</li>
            <li>Does looks nice when applied,but does not last as long as advertised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who wants to put more emphasis on their eyebrows and has medium to dark hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who wants to put more emphasis on their eyebrows and has medium to dark hair.</li>
            <li>Excellent coverage, I did leave it on for 2 minutes and it was a little dark at first; next time I will just do 1 minute.</li>
            <li>He did a good job and didn&#x27;t charge me extra when he was also doing my hair, but this product beats his results, hands down.  </li>
            <li>I have used this 6 times now and it spills every single time because the capsule doesn&#x27;t pull apart easily.  </li>
            <li>and then do them for a special occasion if I&#x27;m running low, but</li>
            <li>I use a lot less activator and get a thicker, darker, more intense color mix.  </li>
            <li>I have SUPER light eye brows and until I had someone at a salon tint them a few months ago</li>
            <li>I left the tint on for 60 seconds and my brows looked BLACK on my fair skin.</li>
            <li>Many people said it too dark</li>
            <li>found out the first time I used this that when I am done if I don&#x27;t completely wipe it with soap and water they will continue getting darker after you are done, so I recommend using soap with water on them when you are finished to stop the dying process.</li>
            <li>All hairs were the same color and my eyebrows were full.  </li>
            <li>A true bargain if you are daring enough to try this at home.</li>
            <li>so I reapplied it and left it on for a full two minutes.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I bought Med Brown instead of dark brown.</li>
            <li>I have had no trouble getting exactly the color I want</li>
            <li>I love this product but this is actually dark brown.</li>
            <li>The product was not difficult to mix, applied easily, did not stain my skin (but I was careful not to get the product on my skin) and colored completely in the recommended time.  </li>
            <li>I used to live in a city where I could get this done at a salon for a reasonable price</li>
            <li>Love this product just need to figure out how to use half a capsule</li>
            <li>I am older and have almost invisible brows.  </li>
            <li>I used only about 1/3 of the capsule and it was more than enough for both brows.  </li>
            <li>Put it on thick, left on for 3 minutes, wiped it off and the results were great.  </li>
            <li>now that I am older (and grayer)</li>
            <li>I re-applied the product and left for a further 1-2 minuts until more of my brows were lightned, and that did the trick.</li>
            <li>Yes, I does a decent job coloring/tinting eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>Very natural looking!</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product, though I would use an eyebrow brush for application.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>No more going to salon and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Tapping out the correct amount of liquid developer is easy enough - just be sure you mix in enough to make it spreadable on your brows, but not too much or the dye will run down your face!</li>
            <li>Wow!  Brows!  </li>
            <li>but they are sparse in one area and they could use a little more definition.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, I use this before going to bed, then use a gentile face scrub in the morning in the shower, in order to remove a little more of the excess color.</li>
            <li>let&#x27;s be a little more generous.  </li>
            <li>really* saturate my brows, despite how fine they are, to get the dye to color evenly, and as dark as I would like,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little dark the first couple of days, but a good color for me after that.  </li>
            <li>No staining, used disposable mascara wands to brush through gently, like my professional brow colorist used to do.</li>
            <li>I usually get it on my skin too, but the next day I give them a good scrub with shampoo and washes off.</li>
            <li>(I have light reddish to dark blondish color hair and really light/</li>
            <li>Some people said there is waste with the dye because you mix more than you need.  </li>
            <li>The package was missing 3 of its mixing/applicator sticks, and most of the developer had been used up.</li>
            <li>Now I do it myself every few weeks with outstanding results.</li>
            <li>I was not particularly careful with the application and at first looked like I had Grocho Marx eyebrows ;</li>
            <li>Maybe it will change after I wash my face a few more times.  </li>
            <li>The first time when I used a whole capsule, I pawned the extra off on two friends who were here during my experiment, and even after they were done I could have dyed the brows of all the women on my street.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Absolutely no complaint.</li>
            <li>The first day it was too dark, then it was good for a few days.</li>
            <li>I prepped the area around my brows with a waxy lip balm to prevent any tint from staining my skin and used just a thick cotton ball with warm water to wipe off the tint when done.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color is good not great.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend using the Vaseline around the perimeter to keep the color in the right spot.</li>
            <li>I left it in for 3 minutes to get the right darkness.  </li>
            <li>Also, when I color my hair dark, I can easily make my eyebrows another shade or two darker to match.</li>
            <li>fast shipping and the product works fine except that it doesn&#x27;t last too long.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am THRILLED to not have to mess with eyebrow pencils and assorted make-up every morning.</li>
            <li>Overall, this product is definitely worth it, compared to the cost of getting your eyebrows coloured professionally!</li>
            <li>Color does take quick, so don&#x27;t leave it on too long.</li>
            <li>I have strawberry blonde hair and get my eye brows tinted on a regular basis at salons - always using &amp;#34;Medium Brown.&amp;#34; This brand&#x27;s Medium Brown also says it is suitable for red heads.</li>
            <li>real dark real  quick</li>
            <li>I just wanted to try something new specifically for eyebrows.</li>
            <li>If not, I will have to find a new brow tinting kit.</li>
            <li>but I used a new mascara brush and eyelash comb.</li>
            <li>Its amazing the difference it makes and to think it only takes a few mins.</li>
            <li>Just be sure that during the next step you are careful about cleaning up the edges.  </li>
            <li>I have blonde eyebrows and my hair is light brown and blonde.  </li>
            <li>I naturally have a decent amount of brow hairs</li>
            <li>This is very important, especially for people who have sparse eyebrows due to years of over tweezing.  </li>
            <li>The color is still on and my brows look VERY natural.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply with minimum mess.  </li>
            <li>I just want to give everyone a friendly warning: This product came out MUCH darker than the little picture of the eyebrows on the box indicate it will.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, just mix a pill capsule full of tint with a few drops of the liquid developer (8-10), apply, wait a few minutes (the instructions say to go 1-2 minutes, rinse, and reapply if you want darker result.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use, inexpensive and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>If strong cleansers or exfoliators are used to wash the face, it won&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li>I wish the light brown didn&#x27;t turn so dark, but I did give it a 5-star rating because for the cost, ease of use and results, I feel it does deserve it.</li>
            <li>Today was my second time using it, about 6 weeks into the first time.</li>
            <li>To lighten up any brows that look too dark, I always take an unused toothbrush and lightly scrub my brows with Suave shampoo.</li>
            <li>The first suggestion I have before you use this product is to let your eyebrows grow in, even if you only get sparse hairs here and there.  </li>
            <li>maybe I&#x27;ll have to reapply a week earlier because of that ;-).  </li>
            <li>I left it on for 2 minutes the first time</li>
            <li>I left it on alittle longer the first time and it came out darker than I wanted.  </li>
            <li>so I think reserving half the powdered dye to stetch the product would be fine.</li>
            <li>have dark brown hair with sparse, light colored eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Not too dark not too light.  </li>
            <li>I tried having it done at an Aveda salon and it cost over $35 with tip plus all of the travel time, etc., and the results were exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised how well it worked!</li>
            <li>The color is already there, so there is no guessing where it has been applied, and you can get it as dark or light as you want.</li>
            <li>Although my hair is dark brown, I have had very light colored and sparse eyebrows for the last 20 years or so.</li>
            <li>my eyebrows are very light and thin and using this makes filling them in sooooo much easier!</li>
            <li>I read some reviews about the browns not lasting as long as the black but its still good.  </li>
            <li>Not sure how long effect will last, but even if it just a week or so, it sure beats penciling them in every morning!!</li>
            <li>I bought this product (medium brown) after reading all the reviews about how light it is, and how extra long everyone had to leave it on, etc.</li>
            <li>Also, I think it might continue getting slightly darker after it&#x27;s wiped off, so aim for a light shade.</li>
            <li>Black was 4-5 mins, Medium Brown 3-4, and light brown is 1-2.</li>
            <li>The color looks natural, not too dark or too light.</li>
            <li>I bought the light brown and it turned my eyebrows jet black.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and the results have lasted for quite a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I use an old mascara brush to apply the paste, which I find gives me more control than using the small brush included in the kit.  </li>
            <li>I applied Medium Brown for the recommended time of 1:30-2 mins, stopped short at 1:15 just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t too dark.</li>
            <li>but probably more because I am used to blonde eyebrows then because it is too dark.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how easy it was and how little time it took.  </li>
            <li>Economical, because there are single use applications, and does the job well, even on those pesky gray hairs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit messy - especially if you have very fine eyebrow hair, as I do.  </li>
            <li>I tried Godefroy tint,let me tell you my brows are light brown with alot of grey mixed in, I&#x27;m 71 years old still dye my hair</li>
            <li>I have started using half a capsule of dye each time since it&#x27;s more than enough for me.</li>
            <li>Both very light in colour and in texture, and slow growing.  </li>
            <li>I was able to adjust the color later with another product as I did not want to wait and see how fast this would fade down to something I can go outside in.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get more use out of the capsules by cutting them in half and mixing sparingly, but even so, I think it&#x27;s a good product and</li>
            <li>Each application provides far more than I needed, so I&#x27;ll use a half application next time.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of coloring in those hard to cover coarse white hairs and makes them look very natural.</li>
            <li>It works ok but is extremely hard to apply.</li>
            <li>easy to use and works faster than any other similar products i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Ordered light brown but it turned out very dark.  </li>
            <li>and none are terribly clear.</li>
            <li>I used an old eyebrow tool with a comb/brush combination to apply the dye.  </li>
            <li>It did cover the white hairs and hope is lasts a reasonable length of time.</li>
            <li>I bought this after having my eyebrows professionally tinted a couple times, which cost me over $30 each visit.</li>
            <li>This package will last me much longer than 4 applications.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows have always been nearly invisible.</li>
            <li>If you do, after they dye sits, just get an old tooth brush and with some shampoo, scrub the leftover dye on your skin goodbye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been darkening them with gels and pencils for years, and have always been self conscious at the pool, etc.</li>
            <li>I shaved my eyebrows completely off.</li>
            <li>Godfrey Instant Eyebrow Tint worked very well on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Even with my natural honey brown (as my mom-mom calls it) hair color, my eyebrows looked non-existent which somehow emphasized my chipmunk cheeks.</li>
            <li>But this brand is far easier to use.  </li>
            <li>I leave it on for longer than the directions advise for those white hairs, but it really works.</li>
            <li>Next time I will decrease the amount, so I don&#x27;t have to throw so  much away.  </li>
            <li>The packaging did not look tampered with but the wax strips looked old and I did not dare use them.</li>
            <li>It ended up costing me nearly $18.00 for product and shipping.</li>
            <li>After having my eyebrows professionally dyed, I decided to try it myself.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it does and lasts (almost) as long as it says it does - 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li>and I kept using various eyebrow pencils hoping to find something that didn&#x27;t look too freakish (without much luck I might add).  </li>
            <li>I have used a different product purchased at Sally&#x27;s and this was much easier to use.</li>
            <li>Works instantly without much hassle.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Basically, throw out their directions completely.  </li>
            <li>Also, in order to get those grays to take color, they have to be completely submerged in the color.  </li>
            <li>I buy professional color and leave it on my hair for an hour because I also have resistant gray hair.  </li>
            <li>Take it off a bit early, and if you want to go darker, re-apply.</li>
            <li>so it looks natural.  </li>
            <li>I had been going to have my eyebrows professionally tinted for $20 a pop.</li>
            <li>Now I have natural looking eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>The medium brown looks natural in all lighting.</li>
            <li>WOW..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this before and find that my brows look natural and that the product stays for a month or so and then needs to be retouched for the desired effect</li>
            <li>word of advise, give yourself 1-3 days before they look natural.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this does sting somewhat while it&#x27;s on the skin and leaves a bit of redness, but both the irritation and the redness are gone within five minutes.</li>
            <li>I used to get my brows tinted professionally, but the stylist moved, and I had been getting by with just getting them colored when I got my hair roots done -</li>
            <li>It beats paying $25 to get them done professionally every 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li>AND I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BECAUSE YOU SHOULDN&#x27;T USE NEAR EYES...</li>
            <li>They try marketing this product as different shades of brown, but really it&#x27;s all one color.  </li>
            <li>Especially that I&#x27;m saving so much money.</li>
            <li>This tint works really well, and last weeks.</li>
            <li>I use an old mascara wand as an applicator.</li>
            <li>Lastly, the bottle the activator comes in doesn&#x27;t really produce drops so you have to kindof guess about the 10 drops it calls for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the minimal effort and cost.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Because my brows are a tad sparse, I still did some fill in with my brow pen, but did a lot less than usual because these did a good job of coloring the hair.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t open the box to for more than a month after I ordered it since I hadn&#x27;t used up my original box yet.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and usually stays on about two to three weeks.  </li>
            <li>There was no mess and no dye residue on my skin.  </li>
            <li>There are several (dry) color capsules remaining and enough developer to use the product several more times.  </li>
            <li>For all that is sensible and decent, read the other reviews here and apply with a clean dry mascara wand.</li>
            <li>The box costs only $9 on Amazon and half a capsule of powder is more than enough for both brows, meaning it&#x27;s going to cost me about $1.00 per application.</li>
            <li>At first I would use one whole capsule but ended up with a lot of leftover tint that would go to waste.  </li>
            <li>Probably doesn&#x27;t last six weeks for me, but I&#x27;m older and just use it as needed.</li>
            <li>NOT black.</li>
            <li>I ended up doing two applications, the first one was definitely 2 minutes, the second, I think was a minute thirty.</li>
            <li>totally worth the money, but i would say you need to retouch every 2 weeks, which is no big deal - one box goes a long way!</li>
            <li>The directions are easy to follow and it only takes a few minutes from start to finish tinting your brows.</li>
            <li>It is very simple and easy to use and just takes a few minutes.</li>
            <li>A few years ago, you would receive larger capsules of the powdered tint and could easily use one capsule for 2 applications.  </li>
            <li>I contacted the seller and explained and they sent me another box free of charge even though it was well past the return date.</li>
            <li>It depends on how much of the activator you mix in and how long you leave it on.  </li>
            <li>I had tried a bit of the Touch of Grey on his eyebrows but it didn&#x27;t really work</li>
            <li>My eyebrows look normal now, two weeks later.  </li>
            <li>But after a couple days I was back to my normal color.</li>
            <li>My eyes were literally swollen shut for two days and it has taken 4 weeks to get back to somewhat normal.</li>
            <li>I will allow a week for the color to calm down.  </li>
            <li>I  normally have to pay $25 each time I go to the eyebrow centre so this box of four applications is a true bargin with the same, if not better, professional results.  </li>
            <li>All in all, it takes me about 15 minutes tops every other week or so to dye my brows with this product, which seems a lot better than the ten minutes a day I spent coloring them</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll write a new review on that next month when I have to re-tint.</li>
            <li>I was starting to think I would have to live with invisible eyebrows and all forehead.  </li>
            <li>this medium brown eyebrow tint gives me just  the right contrast, not too dark.</li>
            <li>the color is great for my dirty blonde hair color.</li>
            <li>I happened across this product when I was looking for something else and decided that for less than $5 it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>I had undergone chemotherapy back in 2006 , and it seemed all my BODY hair grew back fast, and darker</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised because a professional should know that everyone is different.  </li>
            <li>The color is moderate, looks very natural and lasts for 10-12 days.</li>
            <li>Overall, it was easy to use, you get 4 applications, the dye obviously works and you cant mess up.</li>
            <li>Next time I´ll order dark brown (I´m blonde and kinda light skin.</li>
            <li>The only one on the market that works well, and looks so natural!</li>
            <li>The product says it&#x27;s for medium brown, but it will be anywhere from light brown to black depending on how long you leave it on.</li>
            <li>The colour is a bit dark, more like black than brown.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tad too dark for my skin, but I&#x27;m sure it will fade slightly.</li>
            <li>Controlling the color is a skill that eludes me so the medium brown is a bit too dark, while the light brown is much too light (blond, actually and so useless).</li>
            <li>Only really have to use half a capsule instead of the whole thing.</li>
            <li>From standard blonde hair, a minute and a half of this color was too light for me.  </li>
            <li>Many other reviews say it fades out after a few washings</li>
            <li>For those saying its black , its not black it is the first day but it fades the day after, or maybe you don&#x27;t know how to apply it.</li>
            <li>The color was a little darker than I thought it would be (I bought medium brown but it seemed more like dark brown) and after about 3 weeks, the color started fading.  </li>
            <li>I could tell right then and there that I did not like the results, but I did the other eye for two minutes just so they would both be on for the same amount of time.  </li>
            <li>Be as clean as you can when putting it on to avoid stains, and if you double up on it to increase pigmentation, just be aware that it comes out very dark, like almost black.  </li>
            <li>Some people are resistant to dyes and exceptions to the general rule should be made.  </li>
            <li>but for me I generally get about 3-4 weeks use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably continue to use clear hair setting gel and a brow brush to shape, but it isn&#x27;t going to make a big difference until the dye wears</li>
            <li>Of course you have to be careful the first time as not to make eyebrows too dark or stain your skin too much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps I spent too much time on the application before I started the timing.</li>
            <li>and it is so simple to use - looks natural not dyed.  </li>
            <li>The Medium brown is darker than I expected but still reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally strawberry blonde hair and white-blond eyelashes and eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I have natural blonde hair and this medium color</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t leave the initial dye on long enough, and ended up doing each brow twice.</li>
            <li>Was so nervous to use this as I am a natural blonde!</li>
            <li>just really comes up darker than expected.</li>
            <li>but now two or three days&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;go back to your old formula, please..........or whatever</li>
            <li>They turned out pretty dark but after two days they fade a bit</li>
            <li>It only lasts about 5 days, perhaps because I have very oily skin, but it only takes 5 minutes to do, so it&#x27;s not a big deal and beats pencil and mascara any day.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t plan on it last anywhere near six weeks.</li>
            <li>The first time the box arrived uncushioned and crushed with several capsules not useable.  </li>
            <li>, wet the Q-tips and go around the outside of the brow edges, removing the excess to get the exact shape you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Instead:&lt;br /&gt;Buy a nice quality small, round tipped paint brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>One thing that was slightly concerning was that in the box there was an insert for beautiful \\&quot;eyelashes\\&quot; which made me think for a split second that I had received the wrong product.  </li>
            <li>Since I had ordered this product before and had some left, it was over a month before I had to open the new product.  </li>
            <li>I am a natural strawberry-blonde, so the hairs on my eyebrows and eyelashes are so light you can hardly see them!</li>
            <li>The wooden applicator was precise enough that I didn&#x27;t mess up, and I have a suspicion that because of the vaseline some of the outside hairs, the roots didn&#x27;t get colored.  </li>
            <li>easy to use product, simple instructions, saving at least $80 in salon fees</li>
            <li>It is an excellent product, easy to use, and lasts for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since relocating back to Canada, I had to order it through Amazon, but unfortunately the mixing lotion bottle was less than half full, which was a disappointment.  </li>
            <li>and so it took me a few touchups on each side to get the right result.</li>
            <li>I think the capsules contain 2-3 times as much dye powder as is necessary for an adequate application (unless your brows are EXTREMELY thick) - the first few times I used the Godefroy Tint, I threw away almost twice the amount than I actually needed.  </li>
            <li>The tint didn&#x27;t last more than a few days to a week, not the time I expected it to last.</li>
            <li>Thanks to other reviews</li>
            <li>Repeat if necessary if you didn&#x27;t get it dark enough or grays didn&#x27;t cover.s worth</li>
            <li>I was shocked as how easy and economical it is!</li>
            <li>though because after first 2min wasn&#x60;t dark enough so I did it again another 2min.</li>
            <li>It made them pretty dark, so I&#x27;m going to try to remove it sooner the next time.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t recommend this product for anyone looking to darken eyebrows if you&#x27;re blonde, strawberry blonde looking for a natural match.</li>
            <li>it has been way too dark at first and only lasts a week (Aveda).</li>
            <li>Put the dye on the light sparse hairs too and slowly draw your eyebrow back.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it burned a little after I wiped it off.</li>
            <li>But when my brows are dyed, just adding a little brow makeup in the morning makes the color pretty.  </li>
            <li>I can usually get away with just using half a capsule at a time...and so stretch out the number of times I can use one package for a bit more savings.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows were very dark for the first couple of days.  </li>
            <li>Using a brow pencil or powder can create a very unnatural look, either too dark or brows appearing to be drawn on.  </li>
            <li>I washed my face very well and they were still dark.  </li>
            <li>though u gotta watch the timing cuz it can go dark fast.</li>
            <li>You have to be careful to not get it all over your forehead, but if you apply it in a few coats in order to really cover the hairs and wait about 10-15 minutes, the product colors very well.  </li>
            <li>Quick easy and a lot less expensive then at the salon.</li>
            <li>complaint was answered promptly and received a full refund.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are a few things you should be aware of when purchasing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That really helps tone it down.</li>
            <li>A few times in the past I&#x27;ve had my brows professionally colored at salons, and while I love the convenience of having dyed brows, but I&#x27;ve found that the dye starts fading fast enough that it is a waste of money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never needed a full one and trying to save the other half was a bit of a pain.  </li>
            <li>This product may work easier for blonde or grey brows that have soft hair.</li>
            <li>Dye is easy to use and color lasts approximately 1 month.</li>
            <li>Not grey but white.</li>
            <li>Last thing - One capsule makes a lot of tint - I break open the capsules and only use half as much.  </li>
            <li>The product is great, but the parcel was totally damaged and one bottle was broken!!!</li>
            <li>but if you spill a little of it, it doesn&#x27;t really matter because there is plenty of it leftover.</li>
            <li>I did not have any problems even though I usually have very sensitive skin and am cautious about using new products.</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous, so I followed the directions carefully, being sure to do only one brow at a time, even though I was feeling impatient to see results on both sides.</li>

            <li> Easy to use, and the color matches my hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does a perfect job.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Godefroy medium is perfect and so easy, but you should have someone do it for you IMO.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and I enjoy using it.  </li>
            <li> My brows look as good as when my esthetician does them, and it took 5 minutes at home</li>
            <li> They looked good.  </li>
            <li> The results are just as good as the Salon and cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I found it darkened them but not some of the stubborn grays so good.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> I used the medium brown and it looks good.</li>
            <li> I also think it would be a good idea to include some sort of color/stain remover for skin in the kit.</li>
            <li> Mail service was good.  </li>
            <li> Product good,</li>
            <li> Tried the medium brown (I&#x27;m fair skinned with graying, med brown hair).</li>
            <li> I have a fair to med complexion and brown/frosted hair</li>
            <li> Their product is good but their quality over sight is abysmal.</li>
            <li> and they still look good.  </li>
            <li> Provides good coverage.</li>
            <li> This seemed like a good solution.  </li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> This is a good product.  </li>

            <li> This will not look good on you.  </li>
            <li> Good product, saves money.</li>

            <li> Beats paying $20 or more per visit to have it done in a salon!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> It still works out cheaper and more convenient for me, so I&#x27;m sticking with it!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>
            <li> easy to use, its a great product, and you save the trip to the cosmetic.</li>
            <li> This was an easy application with great results.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> The product is easy to use and gives great result.</li>
            <li> Works great and its so easy to use, I put it on 3 weeks ago and its still working well.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and color is great, but all the color went away in 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Easy to use and great results if you follow the directions.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and looks great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both the Medium and the Light brown and both are great.</li>
            <li> dye worked amazing and lasts me about 1 month before I have to reapply.  </li>
            <li> look amazing..</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are light and sparse and it did a great job tinting them and not staining my skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because it seemed to provide an inexpensive and effective  solution to middle-age &#x27;salt and pepper&#x27; brows that plague dark-haired women.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never dyed my own hair or eyebrows</li>
            <li> I like the kind of brow dye</li>
            <li> I tried this eyebrow tint and was thrilled with the result.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when you have to make your own instructions to tweak it</li>
            <li> I liked the medium brown eyebrow tint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with the results and for $10</li>
            <li> And the color on my skin came off after washing my face twice, so sacrifice a couple days for nice color</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> His hair is course and kind of wiry</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend using vaseline under and over the brow; it also helps you get the kind of eyebrow shape you want.</li>
            <li> product is effective and very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I am not the most experienced eyebrow dyer, so I am sure the product works better for those who are.</li>
            <li> My brows were washed out from 25 years of the sun and this was a great way to restore the full color.</li>
            <li> I have quite sparse, fair eyebrows and this product will easily tint them so they are visible.  </li>
            <li> Color was good and mixing easy.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with how quick you can do this and how great the price is.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am hooked for good,its very easy to mix and use.</li>
            <li> and I thought this product was very easy to use.</li>
            <li> very easy application-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use, it works as it states it will.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Tweezing is very easy now because what grows in is lighter than the rest of my eyebrow.  </li>
            <li> This product was very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Saves a bundle instead of having salon do this - and very easy</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use and it does what it says.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was very easy.</li>
            <li> Would have loved it to be premixed, but fine the way it is...</li>
            <li> Easy instructions, easy to do, great results.  </li>
            <li> Wow, I am really impressed with this item.</li>
            <li> Best eyebrow dye I have used so far.</li>
            <li> Does and excellent job at giving color to the brows and looks natural.</li>
            <li> Perfect natural looking results.  </li>
            <li> but the coverage was excellent and the colour is natural.</li>
            <li> And Light brown for fair skin tones with gray/blonde/red hair.</li>
            <li> I saw the great reviews on this product, and bought it right away.  </li>
            <li> The dye alone doesn&#x27;t look great either, the color is not quite right and there is still spaces showing in my brows.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased with how easy this product was to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use though!</li>
            <li> Easy to use!  </li>
            <li> Great dye, easy to use and so worth it!</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m pretty happy.</li>
            <li> I am an extremely happy customer, this is the first time in about 30 years I can stop filling in my brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very light blond eyebrows and this product darkens them</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;medium-brown&#x27; is (very) light brown.....</li>
            <li> I have very light eyebrows and had been using an eyebrow pencil.  </li>
            <li> If I knew how easy it was to tint my own brows</li>
            <li> The Good thing is that it fades rather quickly, so after about 4-5 face washes you could visibly see it getting lighter.</li>
            <li> I loved how it turned out at the salon, but it seemed to fade awfully quick when the cost is $20 plus tip per trip.</li>
            <li> He has a lot of hair (lucky) and it makes him feel good and makes him look about 15 yrs.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows look much better with it.</li>
            <li> Works much better.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s quite cheap!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> &amp; I have 3 more applications.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and I love it.</li>
            <li> The product content itself is astonishingly skimpy.</li>
            <li> I love this product and recommend it to anyone looking for better brows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using eyebrow powder and looking for something more permanent for over a year.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so fantastic I would buy it in bulk!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just OK.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It says not to use on eyelashes, but I did try it on my lower lashes and it worked much better than their eyelash tint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
            <li> I love that its a cream type of dye, because it makes it easier to cover the brow hairs without having it drip off (like a liquid would).</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> When you mix it according to directions, it makes more than you need.  </li>
            <li> It does have to be done more often than I thought it would.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
            <li> I have much more confidence now, and it also helped to see where to tweeze.</li>
            <li> I ended up re-ordering 4 more boxes.</li>
            <li> Much better staying power, and I prefer the blue-based tint.</li>
            <li> but their&#x27;s are like $40 something or more.</li>
            <li> You can top the product on top of itself to create a deeper color which is what I did.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a couple of weeks, better than salon treatments.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d look like Elvira :-)</li>
            <li> In my case, more like Mommy Dearest than Groucho.</li>
            <li> apply for two minutes better than tatto or going to salon&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> BUT ITS BETTER THAN A SALON</li>
            <li> SO GLAD</li>
            <li> love this product and hope it&#x27;s never ever discontinued.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased.  </li>
            <li> Am planning to buy more.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and LOVE</li>
            <li> Applying the product took getting use to - make sure you use vasoline around ares you don&#x27;t want colored</li>
            <li> Love it - and wish I would have found it sooner.</li>
            <li> My daughter noticed something had changed for the better but couldn&#x27;t figure out what it was.  </li>
            <li> Over time, my body permanently adjusted itself to never sleep with my eyebrows touching my pillows so that if I was at a sleepover I could wake up with eyebrows still on my face.</li>
            <li> later I have great eyebrows again!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I like it better than Roux, and you also can&#x27;t beat Godefroy&#x27;s price.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a need for it any more.  </li>
            <li> Love product&lt;</li>
            <li> When they went out of business I went online and found to my delight I could continue using this product and cost was better too.</li>
            <li> Okay they are a bit darker than they should be but that darkness soon faded (four days)</li>
            <li> I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I have light brown eyebrows and it turns them darker within 1 minute tops!</li>
            <li> Someone had used most of this already.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad the shade wasn&#x27;t any darker.  </li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> so glad I found this.</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> Bought the pencil; wish I&#x27;d kept the money because this is so much better.</li>
            <li> Yes, darkening my eyebrows gives much better definition; no, I&#x27;m not going to do that every day.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I discovered this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this tint.  </li>
            <li> I love this product :)</li>
            <li> Will make sure to get a lighter color</li>
            <li> Excellent coverage for short gray hairs</li>
            <li> The eyebrow brush gave me more control.  </li>
            <li> I was very happy with both the results and the ease of application with the Godefroy Instant Eyebrow tint.  </li>
            <li> Lasts 6 weeks or more.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I wish it had more then one mixing cup, so I could just toss the used one.</li>
            <li> Will reorder, but in light brown!</li>
            <li> My eyebrows have never looked better.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to put tint</li>
            <li> Followed directions precisely but ended up looking like Graucho Marx!</li>
            <li> Since my hair is off-black, I was able to leave the product on for 4 minutes</li>
            <li> but it worked out okay.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars as I found that it didn&#x27;t work any better than the mustache and sideburn color that I can buy in CVS, Wallgreens, etc.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL, LOCALLY IT COST 3 TIMES</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten the dye everywhere on more than one occasion,</li>
            <li> It makes more tint than needed.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> I plan to purchase again and again :)</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I wanted to darken my brows for more drama and to match my hair.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li> and I love the way I look.  </li>
            <li> It is okay</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;ll admit it here.</li>
            <li> I use this every four weeks to make my eyebrows appear on my face :-)</li>
            <li> There are better products than this with more color and more applications per box.  </li>
            <li> Getting it done professionally only lasted 2-3 weeks, I am very impressed!!!</li>
            <li> Just make sure you get it off the surrounding skin with a q tip.</li>
            <li> What more could one want.  </li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> love this product havent had the color on my brows but a couple days</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to apply and cleans up easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was insanely fast!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the results, though I&#x27;d be interested in experimenting with the light brown in the summer months.</li>
            <li> I think the eyebrows are the most important part of your face, and I feel so much better to be able to get up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s pretty buildable color wise.</li>
            <li> As long as they continue to make this, I will be a proud user!</li>
            <li> it was kind f cool...</li>
            <li> It works pretty good.</li>
            <li> you first apply it, the color looks good.</li>
            <li> I have medium brown hair and the medium brown was perfect, but I did not leave it on very long.</li>
            <li> it is only good for about 2 weeks, but on the bright side it onlytakes about 3 minutes to apply.</li>
            <li> Great time saver and natural looking!</li>
            <li> I was even able to pick up the really fine blond hairs so that his brows  look fuller.</li>
            <li> I have white eyebrows and eyelashes and am very fair.</li>
            <li> I did like the product and will try the light brown in hopes that will provide a better shade.</li>
            <li> I was also happy that this dye did not irritate my sensitive skin.   </li>
            <li> delivered fast and in good condition.</li>
            <li> The product is good and really tints the eyebrows well.  </li>
            <li> Good and fast transaction</li>

            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and did the job.  </li>
            <li> have to repeat the last couple steps 2 or 3 times to get them perfect, but it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is fairly easy to use, and comes with everything you need to mix and apply.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to mix and use although I probably could have gotten a shade lighter but after allowing it to develop I had visible eyebrows again.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and works well.  </li>
            <li> Easy to follow directions.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> It was really easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and lasts.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Still cheaper than the pros and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This Is a very quick easy method.</li>
            <li> It works and is easy to apply, but it lasts about 2 weeks instead of the 6 advertised.</li>
            <li> Gray Eyebrows take away any youthful looks,and the moment you apply this easy to use tint,you can see the change in your appearance.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say 4 but still for the price, how easy it is and</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Easy to use once you get the hang of the idea</li>
            <li> It was a easy process and it came out</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Followed the easy directions.  </li>
            <li> easy to use &amp; lasts longer.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easily removed with color remover pads), and it lasts a satisfactory length of time - about 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li> but I use a strong, detoxifying face wash that could be why for me.</li>
            <li> This product works awesome, very happy with results!&lt;br /&gt;Eyebrows stayed nice and dark for at least a month!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely</li>
            <li> I love this product as it is simple to use and for me, very effective.  </li>
            <li> It is true  that \\&quot;medium\\&quot; brown is much more like \\&quot;dark\\&quot; brown,  so order the color accordingly.  </li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and Medium Brown color is perfect.</li>
            <li> The color was too dark and is asked for medium brown; it works great!</li>
            <li> I was so worried about the color, it goes on really dark, but after rinsing, it&#x27;s a perfect match.</li>
            <li> The timing on the charts (easy to read insert provided) was accurate for me.  </li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> No irritation or redness, so darn easy to use and cheap.</li>
            <li> It took about a week for the color to start looking more natural, and after that I was very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> With thicker brows, you might want to rinse off the paste more quickly.  </li>
            <li> those materials seem to fade the color more quickly.</li>
            <li> just so you could even see my eyebrows and that just doesn&#x27;t look very natural on me unless i&#x27;m having a good eyebrow day.</li>
            <li> But once you know your own preference you will love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, very little clean -up, very reasonable price, and it looks great!</li>
            <li> Great color and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Brows came out great.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Honestly though it was SO easy even for my first time, it was so quick to process, I have light brows</li>
            <li> It makes a huge difference in how I look without make-up.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows were still too light, and those sparse light hairs were too light.  </li>
            <li> I use to be a huge fan of this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely happy with this product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I ordered light brown.</li>
            <li> light ash blond</li>
            <li> Easy clean up.  </li>
            <li> I have always had \\&quot;light brown\\&quot; tints done before.</li>
            <li> I have light reddish hair</li>
            <li> My hair is light /med</li>
            <li> order again but will try the light brown.</li>
            <li> I have light eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Overall great product.</li>
            <li> Do one brow at a time as it is important not to get this gel in your eyes.</li>
            <li> Its so light</li>
            <li> The results on my clients were great and they left happy.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> But when I do, I will do it a week or so before something important comes up.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the product with varying time and 4 minutes last time makes me happy.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are light brown</li>
            <li> The color really makes my eyes look nice.  </li>
            <li> I had my brows professionally tinted about a month ago and loved it so much, I wanted to continue tinting them but on my own.</li>
            <li> It works great and last for 4 to 6 weeks before I need to repeat.</li>
            <li> Rarely have I been so satisfied with a purchase.</li>
            <li> Always came out too light and what tint there was overlapped onto surrounding skin.</li>
            <li> So much more economical than getting a brow tint at a salon.</li>
            <li> ( I have light brown hair. )  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, Amazon reimbursed me the amount</li>
            <li> hadn&#x27;t even realized eyebrow dye was available for home use until I tried an online search, and this looked like an inexpensive option.</li>
            <li> (I used the timer on my phone to time the process, and touchups, precisely.)</li>
            <li> I never thought I would be free of filling in my sparce eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I now use the light brown color and it matches well with my brunette hair.</li>
            <li> Medium brown for light to medium skin tones with gray/blonde/red hair.</li>
            <li> I used the wooden applicator that was included and it worked great.</li>
            <li> As a light haired person, I would prefer to see this product in light brown/taupe.  </li>
            <li> The price is great, and you can get several appliations with each capsule of tint powder.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re light</li>
            <li> Awesome, simple and fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very excited that there are three more applications making the whole beauty process one of the cheapest I have done.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you choose the right color - the tint is darker than you can tell from the label.  </li>
            <li> It is super easy to apply and gets great results in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> are much significantly lighter than the light brown that were in the box.  </li>
            <li> You are not going to get a rich color when you get a light brown or medium brown box.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 6 months and can say it continues to work beautifully for me although I am having to use it about every 3 weeks in order to keep a good strong color on my brows because I have some white/ grey hairs to dye.</li>
            <li> This is a quick and easy to use product and saves time  when doing your morning makeup if you have light/gray  hair and need eyebrow color.</li>
            <li> it!&lt;br /&gt;I found it super easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy to apply-</li>
            <li> This product is quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This eyebrow tint worked just as promised and was so quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> super easy to use.</li>
            <li> I had success in ONE MINUTE!</li>
            <li> Works great on grey eyebrow</li>
            <li> I was pretty pleased with the results after that.</li>
            <li> I may not have even tried this product with any success!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works FAST!!  </li>
            <li> Works great, I never expected such great results so fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fair skinned, light haired, woman of northern European stock.  </li>
            <li> The cuticle was clean within a week, but my nail won&#x27;t be clean until grows out.</li>
            <li> I liked the concept of being able to color/darken my eyebrows (especially as my color is fading!)</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;d purchase the light brown next time, as my skin is fair.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It does dye your skin but one quick scrub and the problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;Great solution for those who have light brow</li>
            <li> Doing this allows me to just clean them up.</li>
            <li> The hairs are very coarse and it takes a lot of eyebrow pencil to make them look filled in - which isn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li> The result is nice but it doesn&#x27;t last more than 3 days...</li>
            <li> The petroleum jelly made clean up a breeze.  </li>
            <li> but I can clean it off with a q-tip.</li>
            <li> I found this tint to be much more effective than regular hair dye.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that my eyebrow tint lasts longer if i clean my eyebrows with a washcloth after applying lotions and sunscreen to my face.  </li>
            <li> A good product that does the job of tinting the eyebrows without too much fuss or muss and is much cheaper than having it done in a salon.</li>
            <li> I felt the final result looked as good or better as any salon job, and the price is certainly right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product is more reasonable then going to the salon and having it done.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a full capsule.</li>
            <li> The dye itself was easy to use and worked very well, adhering quickly and easily to the hair without leaving any staining on my skin.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give a 5 star is because although the box says it&#x27;s good for 6 weeks, in my case I have to re-do every 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I used that picture on the box, as well as the product&#x27;s recommendation to use this shade for red hair and fair to medium skin tone, when I bought \\&quot;medium brown\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> so cost effective and so natural looking.</li>
            <li> Had good results tinting my &#x27;white&#x27; brows to match my haor color.</li>
            <li> The 1st time I left the dye for 2 minutes as instructed and I LOVED the results.</li>
            <li> I looked like Joan Crawford the first day, but the 2nd day was better and by the third day they looked awesome!!  </li>
            <li> bought this product hoping it would give me a nice natural looking eyebrow color and it delivered.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for a good color to go with my blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I got medium brown and its true to the color.</li>
            <li> Ordering through Amazon was easy, with very reasonable shipping costs.</li>
            <li> This was a good product, it was pretty easy to use and definitely did the job of colouring my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> super easy and very fast too.</li>
            <li> Pretty easy process -</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as described and easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> It was very simple to apply, I used petroleum jelly around the brow area, and I used a clean mascara wand to apply - left it on 3 minutes each side and my brows were perfect.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time coloring my graying eyebrows, and I found it to be extremely easy.</li>
            <li> Luckily after finding this product-not anymore.  </li>
            <li> Hair dye isn&#x27;t made for your face and it fades quickly.</li>
            <li> They are just super</li>
            <li> My brows now look perfect and it only took about five minutes total.</li>
            <li> the gray in my brows is more and more obvious.</li>
            <li> Received it quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is quick:</li>
            <li> This product is great and really does last</li>
            <li> I have learned to mix a smaller amount of the dye  and reseal the casing that the color comes in so that we are able get more applications.</li>
            <li> Also is quick.</li>
            <li> But this was SUPER</li>
            <li> I have golden blonde hair and fair skin and my lashes and brows are nonexistent without some help.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of eye brow tint and this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I have pretty light brows.  </li>
            <li> the Godefroy eyebrow tint works very fast (don&#x27;t over do the timing!)</li>
            <li> After using this product for more than six months, I would say tinting every three weeks is about normal.</li>
            <li> I have used other eyebrow dyes before and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not unpleasant and I think part of the adjustment is going from none to WHOA</li>
            <li> This product is ok, not hard to apply.</li>
            <li> In addition, hot flashes removes what makeup I do use, so I find this product very useful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to eyebrow tinting, so wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect</li>
            <li> I have bought these previously and they were great.</li>
            <li> The color does not last as long as advertised, but even if I had to reapply every week, I would still be very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> this non toxic formula goes on easy and fast- tints the hair and leaves just a bit of skin tint to HELP fill in the look of the brow.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works fast.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to use and  much cheaper than the  beauty supply store product.</li>
            <li> the product is easy to use and very permanent but watch out for your color choice.</li>
            <li> but its fast to use, easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Whole thing was inexpensive, easy and works.  </li>
            <li> MY NEW FAVORITE BEAUTY TOOL..EASY TO USE AND NOT EXPENSIVE!  </li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> This product saves me so much time in the morning!!  </li>
            <li> I love this product - as I am now almost 50 years old (arrrgh!)</li>
            <li> Since I can actually see them now :)!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll definitely be buying it more!</li>
            <li> but I have to say its so easy and makes such a stunning difference.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions as provided and was happy to see that the applications are in gel caps so that you don&#x27;t have much waste.  </li>
            <li> I think they look better and more natural than when I have them done professionally</li>
            <li> Most likely ProActiv (which contains something that lightens hair so be careful, but great product as well.)</li>
            <li> This product works very well but the materials are extremely cheap.  </li>
            <li> sure to use an old mascara brush to put it on.</li>
            <li> This is a great product especially if you like to tint your eyebrows frequently.  </li>
            <li> With this product, I&#x27;m able to tint my brows and have them look natural.</li>
            <li> BUT It&#x27;s still TOTALLY worth</li>
            <li> I used the dark brown and it worked great the first time.</li>
            <li> It will fade to a more natural color if you do that.</li>
            <li> It is worth it in the end.      </li>
            <li> My recommendation: use the full amount the first  time and after that, adjust the amount of powder you remove from the capsule.</li>
            <li> For me, it works great and saves me from paying big bucks to have my eyebrows dyed by a professional.  </li>
            <li> The 2nd time I left for 4-5 minutes and got a much darker result but still extremely happy with the way it looks!</li>
            <li> It is nice to have your eyebrows back!  </li>
            <li> I liked it but am ordering the lighter shade next time.</li>
            <li> This will save me having to fill in my brows with a pencil every day and looks more natural as well.</li>
            <li> Each capsule makes enough dye that if you take it off and decide that it&#x27;s too light you can still reapply more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For going to a salon and getting my eyebrows tinted for $10 to $15, this kit was absolutely worth it</li>
            <li> I find myself going more natural, well except for the tinting of my lashes and brows.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I am a natural redhead and love the look of darker brows, so I used the &amp;#34;Medium Brown&amp;#34; shade.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s actually fun to do.</li>
            <li> followed a lot of previous viewers&#x27; advice the first time I used it, but after that I was able to just do it my own way.</li>
            <li> very thin ad light eyebrows and this tint works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and works as it states, does not seem to last very long - about 4 weeks but in my case that was a good thing since the brown is really almost a black/brown and much darker than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> It does kind of stain the skin under your eyebrow even if you put vaseline around the brow, so when you first tint, it will look darker and more &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; than it will after a few days of face washing.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you mix it really well and don&#x27;t leave on too long &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I have really light thin eyebrows and I&#x27;ve always wanted nice full eyebrows and now I have them!!</li>
            <li> It is really long lasting and very good price.</li>
            <li> so purchased this product and tried it right away.  </li>
            <li> if I´m doing it right.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the right shade for me.</li>
            <li> Every time a salon colors my brows when they do my hair, it seems to wash right off.</li>
            <li> exactly right</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s right for you.</li>
            <li> We woman do what we have to do right.  </li>
            <li> I do it right before a shower.</li>
            <li> and it was just right.</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> With my eyebrows the right color, my face has it&#x27;s \\&quot;frame\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I used medium brown and the color is just right.  </li>
            <li> My eyebrows are the source of my embarrassment right now.</li>
            <li> I also, very carefully, use the tint on my eyelashes (which are also fair and sparse!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tried this on Saturday for the first time and am, so far, pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> More activator waters the color powder down more</li>
            <li> If I do it at night before going to bed the extra dye on my skin seems to wear off by the next morning and my brows look great for the first time in my life!</li>
            <li> product itself was easy to apply and use, but if you&#x27;re actually looking for a medium brown, maybe try ordering the light brown.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply looks great, the only thing I have to say that the product claims it will last 6 weeks, and I really am lucky if it lasts two, but other than that I love it.</li>
            <li> I have only use it once so far, and it really works great.</li>
            <li> and I look good with dark brown brows -</li>
            <li> The best part is for the next month I have to use vey little brow makeup.</li>
            <li> Still a great product for us with pale brows!</li>
            <li> The first day I always feel like they are a bit dark (since I am so fair)</li>
            <li> This is a very reddish brown, and lightens up tremendously within a week or two.</li>
            <li> It was super fast.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews and tips, I went with the medium brown instead of the dark, and I&#x27;m happy that I did because it was darker than I expected.</li>
            <li> I am a true fair skinned, blonde with blue eyes.  </li>
            <li> I actually feared social events that involved swimming, sweating or any kind of make-over because I would have to worry about my eyebrow color coming off!</li>
            <li> The instructions were easy to follow and there was no mess.  </li>
            <li> Having lived with very light eyebrows all of my life, I was looking for a simple inexpensive way to color them.  </li>
            <li> I have very light blonde eyebrows and have always had to use a pencil to fill them in or some sort of brow filler powder.</li>
            <li> So far for 8 months now it works fine</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and the tinted brows and lashes stay tinted for a long time.</li>
            <li> but on me it&#x27;s about 5 good weeks and a week or so of having to add a little filler before i get around to dying them again.</li>
            <li> I think it starts to fade pretty quickly, that is, it is advertised to last for 6 weeks, but if you want well-defined brows, you&#x27;d want to tint them more often, but this is true of the professional tint as well.</li>
            <li> Okay, all the hairs are in, and some are very light (especially the ones that grew back)  </li>
            <li> First time I ever tinted my eyebrows.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I searched the net for an eyebrow dye, mostly to even out what the hairdresser had missed, and found Godefroy on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The dye will stain your skin just a bit, but it fades after the first washing of your face.  </li>
            <li> I just purchased and used for the first time.</li>
            <li> I naturally have medium brown hair and light brown eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I will definately be getting this many times in the future.</li>
            <li> The dye works well though, and fast!  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used it and it did work.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you&#x27;re next to your sink, so you can rinse out the color immediately.  </li>
            <li> Pretty pricey.</li>
            <li> and it seems to bleed through on my skin more than stay in my actual brow hair.  </li>
            <li> This is not the first time this company has messed up an order.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> and I had more than enough for both eyebrows.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not that big of a deal to me since I just mix a bit more dye and mins</li>
            <li> Has enough for more than 4 applications.</li>
            <li> The first thing I would do when I woke up is go to the vanity to use my eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> It has been about a month since I first applied</li>
            <li> You can find you tube videos to show you exactly how to apply.</li>
            <li> If you go outside the lines, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> The procedure and product are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> and it really does the job!</li>
            <li> It helped me to watch you tube videos on it before I tried it the first time.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m sure they will fade soon enough).</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li> I was worried it would be too light and left it on for the full amount of time recommended.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wayyyyyy cheaper than going to a salon, I will most definitely be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> this was a first for me....</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a whole lot cheaper!  </li>
            <li> This is the first time using this product.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t color as well, so I immediately did it again and left it on for 6 more minutes.  </li>
            <li> I thought they did the trick, but the color is just not really that nice looking.  </li>
            <li> Great coverage and long lasting</li>
            <li> , the 2 mins was more than enough!</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t last more than 3 or 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I know from the first time it was longer then 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> Read directions carefully on first use.</li>
            <li> I did use vaseline around the brows to keep the dye away (as per the instructions) and was glad I did as there was a bit of dye left on the skin under the brows.  </li>
            <li> The first coat I kept on for 90 seconds.</li>
            <li> I had an old capsule from the light brown</li>
            <li> They are naturally a light brown and now with the grey they looked too light for the hair colour.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure which product to use since each color is a different listing on Amazon</li>
            <li> There is enough in each cap for probably two applications or more.</li>
            <li> It did darken my brows though but make sure not to step out for 24 hours in public or it looks like you been sharpeed!</li>
            <li> I was worried the first time</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions exactly.  </li>
            <li> The only down side is that ur new awesome eyebrows start to fade after 3 weeks or so</li>
            <li> Works but color came off in 3 days, don&#x27;t worry about staining ur skin, color comes off super fast, too fast for my taste</li>
            <li> Easy to use, doesn&#x60;t take more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Using warm water and soap to clean the &amp;#34;tools&amp;#34; seems to prevent the staining of the porcelain sink, but the countertop has small brown spots now...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not convinced the color will last six weeks, but I&#x27;m headed into my third week and it looks pretty good still.</li>
            <li> Came with easy to read directions and was easy to use, the color doesnt stay really after 3 weeks, which i expected, so i still give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I just ordered the \\&quot;Godefroy Double Lash &amp; Brow Treatment\\&quot; since I love the eyebrow tint so much, so I will be writing a review about it after I give that product a go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, the instructions are clear and if you have a mirror and a steady hand</li>
            <li> Finally I don&#x27;t have to spend too much time working on my eyebrows in the morning :-).  </li>
            <li> I feel more confident going without make-up, at least I have eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful after all of the positive reviews, but this product did not work for me at all.  </li>
            <li> The color lasts a long time and once you get a good method down, it&#x27;s fast and easy.  </li>
            <li> I wish the color description was more accurate, also I don&#x27;t know who would need the color in a whole capsule, it seems like abut of a waste.</li>
            <li> It said it worked on grey but found it did a better job just colouring my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I do one brow at a time, following the directions, until I&#x27;m happy with the color before doing the other brow.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s so much cheaper than having it done professionally, and looks so much cleaner and more natural than makeup!</li>
            <li> I was very nervous to use this product the first time</li>
            <li> I tried the medium brown and ended up letting the tint sit for approx 2 minutes each (i tried 1 minute for the first time and wasn&#x27;t quite dark enough), and am EXTREMELY happy with the turnout.</li>
            <li> next time i&#x27;ll do 40 seconds, other than that great product.</li>
            <li> I have naturally bleach blonde brows that take to dye very easily.</li>
            <li> Due to age related lightening of my eyebrows, I was needing to use more and more eyebrow pencil/powder</li>
            <li> Also, I used half a capsule and the wood applicator and got amazing results.</li>
            <li> And it cleans the color off of your face easy enough</li>
            <li> Otherwise, was easy enough to use.&lt;br /&gt;Any</li>
            <li> This is a simple, easy to use product.  </li>
            <li> So simple so easy</li>
            <li> I wiped with a dry tissue to make sure that my brows were not damp.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is somewhat easy to apply however, 2 days later it looks like you never used it at all!!!</li>
            <li> Very simple instructions, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The wooden tool that came with it was really easy to use too.  </li>
            <li> This is very simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 12 days now, with daily swims in the sea, and showers, and yet the shade is still holding strong.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise the product is easy to apply and looks good, just didn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li> and this certainly makes a world of difference.</li>
            <li> After a certain age, my eyebrows started to lighten up.</li>
            <li> and this certainly makes a world of difference.</li>
            <li> I gave only 4 stars because the product claims to last for 6 weeks, and I havent found this to be true - more like 3 to 4 weeks of color.</li>
            <li> Well, to be safe I did only the 2 mins and decided to add more on if I thought it wasn&#x27;t dark</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t use the petroleum like it recommends, and it still cleans any extra color off my face just fine).  </li>
            <li> I found the medium brown color was perfect for my medium auburn hair color, not any lighter or darker than expected, and looked very natural after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive compared to going to a salon.</li>
            <li> I will try the light brown next time.</li>
            <li> Next time, I will order Light Brown.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> My advice to those who have tried it with unsatisafctory results:  Really glop in on your brows</li>
            <li> The dye stains hair very well</li>
            <li> With this product, I can really see my eyebrows, even from a distance.  </li>
            <li> but it really didn&#x27;t cover like I thought it would.</li>
            <li> this product helps sooo much.</li>
            <li> I had looked into eyebrow dye in the beauty supply store, but it was about $40 which is too much for me.</li>
            <li> With the Roux brand you really need to use the get-the-color-off-your-face gel that comes with the package.  </li>
            <li> Well, based on these reviews of people needing to leave the tint on longer than the 1-2 minutes on the directions, and how light the color was--I followed all the directions, but left the dye on for 10-12 minutes, and WATCH OUT--</li>
            <li> So I just re-ordered the same product in light brown.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> will save me SO MUCH $$$.</li>
            <li> Next time I order I will order the light brown instead.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> you don´t need the whole capsule at once.</li>
            <li> ( yeah, just what a woman wants to happen :C ) except for the hair on my head, and my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I really wish I had known about this product years ago.</li>
            <li> Much easier than the supplied toothpick applicators.</li>
            <li> I tried it again and it didn&#x27;t seem to take very well.</li>
            <li> I wish this lasted a whole month - but it of course eventually fades when you wash your face, etc....</li>
            <li> Very annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has made my life so much easier, let me tell you.  </li>
            <li> I found myself reapplying the tint once a week because it faded so fast.</li>
            <li> Also, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> and I am just ready to re do them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier to control how much to &#x27;tap&#x27; into the mixing</li>
            <li> Thanks for listening.&lt;br /&gt;DMW</li>
            <li> I have very bleached out eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Its much cheaper than going to the salon &amp; you have \\&quot;control\\&quot; over the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve discovered you don&#x27;t need the whole capsule</li>
            <li> After much looking found Godefroy and ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess on how much liquid solution to put with it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to go out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much in the way of eyebrows (hypothyroid).</li>
            <li> When I was a girl you could go to the corner drugstore and buy a 3 or 4 ounce bottle of brow and lash dye for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t much change</li>
            <li> I had to really scrub the color off.</li>
            <li> Much easier to use that Roux tint.</li>
            <li> However, even if you wash the dye off very thoroughly when done, if you&#x27;re fair-skinned with sparse/fine brows like me you&#x27;ll probably still have staining in the brow area itself.</li>
            <li> Watch the video, it was very helpful.</li>
            <li> It saves me so much time vs trying to pencil in sparse areas every morning.</li>
            <li> It worked really well.  </li>
            <li> I have very light/sparse eyebrows and have been going to the salon for tinting to the tune of $20/visit.</li>
            <li> Make sure u put it on the skin as if u were using a pencil to cover empty areas, but it has to go on the skin or it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to use this product, but decided to give it a whirl.</li>
            <li> I applied the dye (light brown)on one eyebrow only and waited just 1 minute before wiping it off.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I decided to try my brows and the hair began to fill in, but you couldn&#x27;t really see it.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use a whole capsule each time.  </li>
            <li> It dyes very</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The brows really frame the face and with this inexpensive product</li>
            <li> thanks to all of the reviewers without whose tips and advice</li>
            <li> Really?  </li>
            <li> The whole area around my eyebrows is swollen, itchy, irritated.</li>
            <li> Very upset</li>
            <li> It really lasted 6+ weeks as advertised.</li>
            <li> Perfect color for my dirty blonde/light brown hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very concentrated</li>
            <li> I have very blond eyebrows</li>
            <li> I purchased the medium brown and had to reapply a few times to tint the more stubborn grays,  but the effect was entirely worth it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay if you don&#x27;t mind the red and having to re-dye frequently, but I&#x27;m using the Roux tint now.</li>
            <li> makes a difference in my appearance...and am thrilled i don&#x27;t have to use a pencil everyday......</li>
            <li> The product works good as far as darkening, but there are a few downsides.  </li>
            <li> sure in the coming months we&#x27;ll see even less product with a higher purchase price.  </li>
            <li> Make sure there are no phone calls or other interruptions while you are mixing &amp; applying the color, because you&#x27;ll want to focus on timing the length of time that you leave the color on.  </li>
            <li> It works better than any other eyebrow dye I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have very light eyebrows and this color was quite dark for me.  </li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair with very light brown eyebrows.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows came out much closer to the shade on the \\&quot;dark brown\\&quot; box, to the point where I checked the box 3 times to be sure I bought \\&quot;medium brown\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I found that if I use a part of one of the capsules, mixed with a couple of&lt;br /&gt;drops of the liquid gel, it does a great job for no more eyebrows than I have.  </li>
            <li> I used Swiss O&#x27;Par in the past, and this is much simpler and equally effective.</li>
            <li> However, my hair is dark blond, my complexion is medium fair, my eyes are blue.</li>
            <li> Does looks nice when applied,but does not last as long as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who wants to put more emphasis on their eyebrows and has medium to dark hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who wants to put more emphasis on their eyebrows and has medium to dark hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent coverage, I did leave it on for 2 minutes and it was a little dark at first; next time I will just do 1 minute.</li>
            <li> He did a good job and didn&#x27;t charge me extra when he was also doing my hair, but this product beats his results, hands down.  </li>
            <li> I have used this 6 times now and it spills every single time because the capsule doesn&#x27;t pull apart easily.  </li>
            <li> and then do them for a special occasion if I&#x27;m running low, but</li>
            <li> I use a lot less activator and get a thicker, darker, more intense color mix.  </li>
            <li> I have SUPER light eye brows and until I had someone at a salon tint them a few months ago</li>
            <li> I left the tint on for 60 seconds and my brows looked BLACK on my fair skin.</li>
            <li> Many people said it too dark</li>
            <li> found out the first time I used this that when I am done if I don&#x27;t completely wipe it with soap and water they will continue getting darker after you are done, so I recommend using soap with water on them when you are finished to stop the dying process.</li>
            <li> All hairs were the same color and my eyebrows were full.  </li>
            <li> A true bargain if you are daring enough to try this at home.</li>
            <li> so I reapplied it and left it on for a full two minutes.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I bought Med Brown instead of dark brown.</li>
            <li> I have had no trouble getting exactly the color I want</li>
            <li> I love this product but this is actually dark brown.</li>
            <li> The product was not difficult to mix, applied easily, did not stain my skin (but I was careful not to get the product on my skin) and colored completely in the recommended time.  </li>
            <li> I used to live in a city where I could get this done at a salon for a reasonable price</li>
            <li> Love this product just need to figure out how to use half a capsule</li>
            <li> I am older and have almost invisible brows.  </li>
            <li> I used only about 1/3 of the capsule and it was more than enough for both brows.  </li>
            <li> Put it on thick, left on for 3 minutes, wiped it off and the results were great.  </li>
            <li> now that I am older (and grayer)</li>
            <li> I re-applied the product and left for a further 1-2 minuts until more of my brows were lightned, and that did the trick.</li>
            <li> Yes, I does a decent job coloring/tinting eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> Very natural looking!</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product, though I would use an eyebrow brush for application.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> No more going to salon and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Tapping out the correct amount of liquid developer is easy enough - just be sure you mix in enough to make it spreadable on your brows, but not too much or the dye will run down your face!</li>
            <li> Wow!  Brows!  </li>
            <li> but they are sparse in one area and they could use a little more definition.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I use this before going to bed, then use a gentile face scrub in the morning in the shower, in order to remove a little more of the excess color.</li>
            <li> let&#x27;s be a little more generous.  </li>
            <li> really* saturate my brows, despite how fine they are, to get the dye to color evenly, and as dark as I would like,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little dark the first couple of days, but a good color for me after that.  </li>
            <li> No staining, used disposable mascara wands to brush through gently, like my professional brow colorist used to do.</li>
            <li> I usually get it on my skin too, but the next day I give them a good scrub with shampoo and washes off.</li>
            <li> (I have light reddish to dark blondish color hair and really light/</li>
            <li> Some people said there is waste with the dye because you mix more than you need.  </li>
            <li> The package was missing 3 of its mixing/applicator sticks, and most of the developer had been used up.</li>
            <li> Now I do it myself every few weeks with outstanding results.</li>
            <li> I was not particularly careful with the application and at first looked like I had Grocho Marx eyebrows ;</li>
            <li> Maybe it will change after I wash my face a few more times.  </li>
            <li> The first time when I used a whole capsule, I pawned the extra off on two friends who were here during my experiment, and even after they were done I could have dyed the brows of all the women on my street.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Absolutely no complaint.</li>
            <li> The first day it was too dark, then it was good for a few days.</li>
            <li> I prepped the area around my brows with a waxy lip balm to prevent any tint from staining my skin and used just a thick cotton ball with warm water to wipe off the tint when done.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color is good not great.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend using the Vaseline around the perimeter to keep the color in the right spot.</li>
            <li> I left it in for 3 minutes to get the right darkness.  </li>
            <li> Also, when I color my hair dark, I can easily make my eyebrows another shade or two darker to match.</li>
            <li> fast shipping and the product works fine except that it doesn&#x27;t last too long.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am THRILLED to not have to mess with eyebrow pencils and assorted make-up every morning.</li>
            <li> Overall, this product is definitely worth it, compared to the cost of getting your eyebrows coloured professionally!</li>
            <li> Color does take quick, so don&#x27;t leave it on too long.</li>
            <li> I have strawberry blonde hair and get my eye brows tinted on a regular basis at salons - always using &amp;#34;Medium Brown.&amp;#34; This brand&#x27;s Medium Brown also says it is suitable for red heads.</li>
            <li> real dark real  quick</li>
            <li> I just wanted to try something new specifically for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> If not, I will have to find a new brow tinting kit.</li>
            <li> but I used a new mascara brush and eyelash comb.</li>
            <li> Its amazing the difference it makes and to think it only takes a few mins.</li>
            <li> Just be sure that during the next step you are careful about cleaning up the edges.  </li>
            <li> I have blonde eyebrows and my hair is light brown and blonde.  </li>
            <li> I naturally have a decent amount of brow hairs</li>
            <li> This is very important, especially for people who have sparse eyebrows due to years of over tweezing.  </li>
            <li> The color is still on and my brows look VERY natural.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply with minimum mess.  </li>
            <li> I just want to give everyone a friendly warning: This product came out MUCH darker than the little picture of the eyebrows on the box indicate it will.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, just mix a pill capsule full of tint with a few drops of the liquid developer (8-10), apply, wait a few minutes (the instructions say to go 1-2 minutes, rinse, and reapply if you want darker result.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, inexpensive and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> If strong cleansers or exfoliators are used to wash the face, it won&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> I wish the light brown didn&#x27;t turn so dark, but I did give it a 5-star rating because for the cost, ease of use and results, I feel it does deserve it.</li>
            <li> Today was my second time using it, about 6 weeks into the first time.</li>
            <li> To lighten up any brows that look too dark, I always take an unused toothbrush and lightly scrub my brows with Suave shampoo.</li>
            <li> The first suggestion I have before you use this product is to let your eyebrows grow in, even if you only get sparse hairs here and there.  </li>
            <li> maybe I&#x27;ll have to reapply a week earlier because of that ;-).  </li>
            <li> I left it on for 2 minutes the first time</li>
            <li> I left it on alittle longer the first time and it came out darker than I wanted.  </li>
            <li> so I think reserving half the powdered dye to stetch the product would be fine.</li>
            <li> have dark brown hair with sparse, light colored eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Not too dark not too light.  </li>
            <li> I tried having it done at an Aveda salon and it cost over $35 with tip plus all of the travel time, etc., and the results were exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how well it worked!</li>
            <li> The color is already there, so there is no guessing where it has been applied, and you can get it as dark or light as you want.</li>
            <li> Although my hair is dark brown, I have had very light colored and sparse eyebrows for the last 20 years or so.</li>
            <li> my eyebrows are very light and thin and using this makes filling them in sooooo much easier!</li>
            <li> I read some reviews about the browns not lasting as long as the black but its still good.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how long effect will last, but even if it just a week or so, it sure beats penciling them in every morning!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product (medium brown) after reading all the reviews about how light it is, and how extra long everyone had to leave it on, etc.</li>
            <li> Also, I think it might continue getting slightly darker after it&#x27;s wiped off, so aim for a light shade.</li>
            <li> Black was 4-5 mins, Medium Brown 3-4, and light brown is 1-2.</li>
            <li> The color looks natural, not too dark or too light.</li>
            <li> I bought the light brown and it turned my eyebrows jet black.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and the results have lasted for quite a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I use an old mascara brush to apply the paste, which I find gives me more control than using the small brush included in the kit.  </li>
            <li> I applied Medium Brown for the recommended time of 1:30-2 mins, stopped short at 1:15 just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t too dark.</li>
            <li> but probably more because I am used to blonde eyebrows then because it is too dark.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how easy it was and how little time it took.  </li>
            <li> Economical, because there are single use applications, and does the job well, even on those pesky gray hairs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit messy - especially if you have very fine eyebrow hair, as I do.  </li>
            <li> I tried Godefroy tint,let me tell you my brows are light brown with alot of grey mixed in, I&#x27;m 71 years old still dye my hair</li>
            <li> I have started using half a capsule of dye each time since it&#x27;s more than enough for me.</li>
            <li> Both very light in colour and in texture, and slow growing.  </li>
            <li> I was able to adjust the color later with another product as I did not want to wait and see how fast this would fade down to something I can go outside in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get more use out of the capsules by cutting them in half and mixing sparingly, but even so, I think it&#x27;s a good product and</li>
            <li> Each application provides far more than I needed, so I&#x27;ll use a half application next time.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of coloring in those hard to cover coarse white hairs and makes them look very natural.</li>
            <li> It works ok but is extremely hard to apply.</li>
            <li> easy to use and works faster than any other similar products i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Ordered light brown but it turned out very dark.  </li>
            <li> and none are terribly clear.</li>
            <li> I used an old eyebrow tool with a comb/brush combination to apply the dye.  </li>
            <li> It did cover the white hairs and hope is lasts a reasonable length of time.</li>
            <li> I bought this after having my eyebrows professionally tinted a couple times, which cost me over $30 each visit.</li>
            <li> This package will last me much longer than 4 applications.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows have always been nearly invisible.</li>
            <li> If you do, after they dye sits, just get an old tooth brush and with some shampoo, scrub the leftover dye on your skin goodbye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been darkening them with gels and pencils for years, and have always been self conscious at the pool, etc.</li>
            <li> I shaved my eyebrows completely off.</li>
            <li> Godfrey Instant Eyebrow Tint worked very well on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Even with my natural honey brown (as my mom-mom calls it) hair color, my eyebrows looked non-existent which somehow emphasized my chipmunk cheeks.</li>
            <li> But this brand is far easier to use.  </li>
            <li> I leave it on for longer than the directions advise for those white hairs, but it really works.</li>
            <li> Next time I will decrease the amount, so I don&#x27;t have to throw so  much away.  </li>
            <li> The packaging did not look tampered with but the wax strips looked old and I did not dare use them.</li>
            <li> It ended up costing me nearly $18.00 for product and shipping.</li>
            <li> After having my eyebrows professionally dyed, I decided to try it myself.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it does and lasts (almost) as long as it says it does - 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li> and I kept using various eyebrow pencils hoping to find something that didn&#x27;t look too freakish (without much luck I might add).  </li>
            <li> I have used a different product purchased at Sally&#x27;s and this was much easier to use.</li>
            <li> Works instantly without much hassle.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Basically, throw out their directions completely.  </li>
            <li> Also, in order to get those grays to take color, they have to be completely submerged in the color.  </li>
            <li> I buy professional color and leave it on my hair for an hour because I also have resistant gray hair.  </li>
            <li> Take it off a bit early, and if you want to go darker, re-apply.</li>
            <li> so it looks natural.  </li>
            <li> I had been going to have my eyebrows professionally tinted for $20 a pop.</li>
            <li> Now I have natural looking eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> The medium brown looks natural in all lighting.</li>
            <li> WOW..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this before and find that my brows look natural and that the product stays for a month or so and then needs to be retouched for the desired effect</li>
            <li> word of advise, give yourself 1-3 days before they look natural.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this does sting somewhat while it&#x27;s on the skin and leaves a bit of redness, but both the irritation and the redness are gone within five minutes.</li>
            <li> I used to get my brows tinted professionally, but the stylist moved, and I had been getting by with just getting them colored when I got my hair roots done -</li>
            <li> It beats paying $25 to get them done professionally every 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> AND I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BECAUSE YOU SHOULDN&#x27;T USE NEAR EYES...</li>
            <li> They try marketing this product as different shades of brown, but really it&#x27;s all one color.  </li>
            <li> Especially that I&#x27;m saving so much money.</li>
            <li> This tint works really well, and last weeks.</li>
            <li> I use an old mascara wand as an applicator.</li>
            <li> Lastly, the bottle the activator comes in doesn&#x27;t really produce drops so you have to kindof guess about the 10 drops it calls for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the minimal effort and cost.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Because my brows are a tad sparse, I still did some fill in with my brow pen, but did a lot less than usual because these did a good job of coloring the hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t open the box to for more than a month after I ordered it since I hadn&#x27;t used up my original box yet.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and usually stays on about two to three weeks.  </li>
            <li> There was no mess and no dye residue on my skin.  </li>
            <li> There are several (dry) color capsules remaining and enough developer to use the product several more times.  </li>
            <li> For all that is sensible and decent, read the other reviews here and apply with a clean dry mascara wand.</li>
            <li> The box costs only $9 on Amazon and half a capsule of powder is more than enough for both brows, meaning it&#x27;s going to cost me about $1.00 per application.</li>
            <li> At first I would use one whole capsule but ended up with a lot of leftover tint that would go to waste.  </li>
            <li> Probably doesn&#x27;t last six weeks for me, but I&#x27;m older and just use it as needed.</li>
            <li> NOT black.</li>
            <li> I ended up doing two applications, the first one was definitely 2 minutes, the second, I think was a minute thirty.</li>
            <li> totally worth the money, but i would say you need to retouch every 2 weeks, which is no big deal - one box goes a long way!</li>
            <li> The directions are easy to follow and it only takes a few minutes from start to finish tinting your brows.</li>
            <li> It is very simple and easy to use and just takes a few minutes.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, you would receive larger capsules of the powdered tint and could easily use one capsule for 2 applications.  </li>
            <li> I contacted the seller and explained and they sent me another box free of charge even though it was well past the return date.</li>
            <li> It depends on how much of the activator you mix in and how long you leave it on.  </li>
            <li> I had tried a bit of the Touch of Grey on his eyebrows but it didn&#x27;t really work</li>
            <li> My eyebrows look normal now, two weeks later.  </li>
            <li> But after a couple days I was back to my normal color.</li>
            <li> My eyes were literally swollen shut for two days and it has taken 4 weeks to get back to somewhat normal.</li>
            <li> I will allow a week for the color to calm down.  </li>
            <li> I  normally have to pay $25 each time I go to the eyebrow centre so this box of four applications is a true bargin with the same, if not better, professional results.  </li>
            <li> All in all, it takes me about 15 minutes tops every other week or so to dye my brows with this product, which seems a lot better than the ten minutes a day I spent coloring them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll write a new review on that next month when I have to re-tint.</li>
            <li> I was starting to think I would have to live with invisible eyebrows and all forehead.  </li>
            <li> this medium brown eyebrow tint gives me just  the right contrast, not too dark.</li>
            <li> the color is great for my dirty blonde hair color.</li>
            <li> I happened across this product when I was looking for something else and decided that for less than $5 it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> I had undergone chemotherapy back in 2006 , and it seemed all my BODY hair grew back fast, and darker</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised because a professional should know that everyone is different.  </li>
            <li> The color is moderate, looks very natural and lasts for 10-12 days.</li>
            <li> Overall, it was easy to use, you get 4 applications, the dye obviously works and you cant mess up.</li>
            <li> Next time I´ll order dark brown (I´m blonde and kinda light skin.</li>
            <li> The only one on the market that works well, and looks so natural!</li>
            <li> The product says it&#x27;s for medium brown, but it will be anywhere from light brown to black depending on how long you leave it on.</li>
            <li> The colour is a bit dark, more like black than brown.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad too dark for my skin, but I&#x27;m sure it will fade slightly.</li>
            <li> Controlling the color is a skill that eludes me so the medium brown is a bit too dark, while the light brown is much too light (blond, actually and so useless).</li>
            <li> Only really have to use half a capsule instead of the whole thing.</li>
            <li> From standard blonde hair, a minute and a half of this color was too light for me.  </li>
            <li> Many other reviews say it fades out after a few washings</li>
            <li> For those saying its black , its not black it is the first day but it fades the day after, or maybe you don&#x27;t know how to apply it.</li>
            <li> The color was a little darker than I thought it would be (I bought medium brown but it seemed more like dark brown) and after about 3 weeks, the color started fading.  </li>
            <li> I could tell right then and there that I did not like the results, but I did the other eye for two minutes just so they would both be on for the same amount of time.  </li>
            <li> Be as clean as you can when putting it on to avoid stains, and if you double up on it to increase pigmentation, just be aware that it comes out very dark, like almost black.  </li>
            <li> Some people are resistant to dyes and exceptions to the general rule should be made.  </li>
            <li> but for me I generally get about 3-4 weeks use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably continue to use clear hair setting gel and a brow brush to shape, but it isn&#x27;t going to make a big difference until the dye wears</li>
            <li> Of course you have to be careful the first time as not to make eyebrows too dark or stain your skin too much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps I spent too much time on the application before I started the timing.</li>
            <li> and it is so simple to use - looks natural not dyed.  </li>
            <li> The Medium brown is darker than I expected but still reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally strawberry blonde hair and white-blond eyelashes and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I have natural blonde hair and this medium color</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t leave the initial dye on long enough, and ended up doing each brow twice.</li>
            <li> Was so nervous to use this as I am a natural blonde!</li>
            <li> just really comes up darker than expected.</li>
            <li> but now two or three days&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;go back to your old formula, please..........or whatever</li>
            <li> They turned out pretty dark but after two days they fade a bit</li>
            <li> It only lasts about 5 days, perhaps because I have very oily skin, but it only takes 5 minutes to do, so it&#x27;s not a big deal and beats pencil and mascara any day.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t plan on it last anywhere near six weeks.</li>
            <li> The first time the box arrived uncushioned and crushed with several capsules not useable.  </li>
            <li> , wet the Q-tips and go around the outside of the brow edges, removing the excess to get the exact shape you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Instead:&lt;br /&gt;Buy a nice quality small, round tipped paint brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> One thing that was slightly concerning was that in the box there was an insert for beautiful \\&quot;eyelashes\\&quot; which made me think for a split second that I had received the wrong product.  </li>
            <li> Since I had ordered this product before and had some left, it was over a month before I had to open the new product.  </li>
            <li> I am a natural strawberry-blonde, so the hairs on my eyebrows and eyelashes are so light you can hardly see them!</li>
            <li> The wooden applicator was precise enough that I didn&#x27;t mess up, and I have a suspicion that because of the vaseline some of the outside hairs, the roots didn&#x27;t get colored.  </li>
            <li> easy to use product, simple instructions, saving at least $80 in salon fees</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product, easy to use, and lasts for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since relocating back to Canada, I had to order it through Amazon, but unfortunately the mixing lotion bottle was less than half full, which was a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> and so it took me a few touchups on each side to get the right result.</li>
            <li> I think the capsules contain 2-3 times as much dye powder as is necessary for an adequate application (unless your brows are EXTREMELY thick) - the first few times I used the Godefroy Tint, I threw away almost twice the amount than I actually needed.  </li>
            <li> The tint didn&#x27;t last more than a few days to a week, not the time I expected it to last.</li>
            <li> Thanks to other reviews</li>
            <li> Repeat if necessary if you didn&#x27;t get it dark enough or grays didn&#x27;t cover.s worth</li>
            <li> I was shocked as how easy and economical it is!</li>
            <li> though because after first 2min wasn&#x60;t dark enough so I did it again another 2min.</li>
            <li> It made them pretty dark, so I&#x27;m going to try to remove it sooner the next time.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t recommend this product for anyone looking to darken eyebrows if you&#x27;re blonde, strawberry blonde looking for a natural match.</li>
            <li> it has been way too dark at first and only lasts a week (Aveda).</li>
            <li> Put the dye on the light sparse hairs too and slowly draw your eyebrow back.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it burned a little after I wiped it off.</li>
            <li> But when my brows are dyed, just adding a little brow makeup in the morning makes the color pretty.  </li>
            <li> I can usually get away with just using half a capsule at a time...and so stretch out the number of times I can use one package for a bit more savings.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows were very dark for the first couple of days.  </li>
            <li> Using a brow pencil or powder can create a very unnatural look, either too dark or brows appearing to be drawn on.  </li>
            <li> I washed my face very well and they were still dark.  </li>
            <li> though u gotta watch the timing cuz it can go dark fast.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful to not get it all over your forehead, but if you apply it in a few coats in order to really cover the hairs and wait about 10-15 minutes, the product colors very well.  </li>
            <li> Quick easy and a lot less expensive then at the salon.</li>
            <li> complaint was answered promptly and received a full refund.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are a few things you should be aware of when purchasing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That really helps tone it down.</li>
            <li> A few times in the past I&#x27;ve had my brows professionally colored at salons, and while I love the convenience of having dyed brows, but I&#x27;ve found that the dye starts fading fast enough that it is a waste of money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never needed a full one and trying to save the other half was a bit of a pain.  </li>
            <li> This product may work easier for blonde or grey brows that have soft hair.</li>
            <li> Dye is easy to use and color lasts approximately 1 month.</li>
            <li> Not grey but white.</li>
            <li> Last thing - One capsule makes a lot of tint - I break open the capsules and only use half as much.  </li>
            <li> The product is great, but the parcel was totally damaged and one bottle was broken!!!</li>
            <li> but if you spill a little of it, it doesn&#x27;t really matter because there is plenty of it leftover.</li>
            <li> I did not have any problems even though I usually have very sensitive skin and am cautious about using new products.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous, so I followed the directions carefully, being sure to do only one brow at a time, even though I was feeling impatient to see results on both sides.</li>
            <li> few more tips: Definitely smear Vaeline, Aquaphor, or another thick cream under and just above your brows to prevent your skin staining.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Medium brown\\&quot; is pretty dark - beware if you are a blonde or dark blonde!  </li>
            <li> I have VERY light eyebrows (like clear) and was very skeptical because everytime I&#x27;ve had my eyebrows done</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the light brown is actually dark.</li>
            <li> I have tried using my regular haircolor on them (which the manufacturer does NOT recommend) but it doesn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li> Instructions are simple and it&#x27;s pretty hard to make a mistake if you follow the directions.</li>
            <li> I am african american, with naturally 1b hair color (off black).</li>
            <li> I would recommend getting a shade or two lighter than your natural brow color if you are using it (as I was) to tint those pesky gray/white hairs that crop up in the middle of our dark brows as we age.</li>
            <li> I often alternate between medium brown and dark as I change my hair color quite frequently</li>
            <li> I often alternate between medium brown and dark as I change my hair color quite frequently</li>
            <li> only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the salon&#x27;s did.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But the color is consistent, and even though i am extremely pale it stains my skin minimally (</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are pretty dark afterwards for about a day and a half, but I get longer use out of each application that way.  </li>
            <li> At first the &#x27;pill&#x27; of the dry tint was a bit difficult to open, but with the use of a toothpick it didn&#x27;t take much time.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t yet know how long the dye will last, but if I can get even a few weeks out of the color, I think it&#x27;s worth it if I have to spend less time coloring my brows in each morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As someone who has blonde eyebrows (and dyed red hair) I&#x27;ve had to put brow powder on every single day.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered this color in the past and I have noticed this time the powder in the capsules were much lighter than before.</li>
            <li> You have to break open a capsule filled with powder and add liquid developer in an equal amount, which is difficult to estimate.  </li>
            <li> The color is flat &amp; mousey.</li>
            <li> but it does not last as long as they claim.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> And the color does last equally as long as the Roux brand.  </li>
            <li> My brows are wirey blonde and grey.</li>
            <li> I must have left the product on for too long.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I just wish it would last as long as the product claims.</li>
            <li> , long lasting, did not stain skin.  </li>
            <li> so dont know how long itll last no proublems with packing and sell</li>
            <li> The tint doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like - maybe a week or two rather than the month(s) noted.</li>
            <li> I missed cleaning off a little spot above my eyebrow and the skin was clearly stained for some time.</li>
            <li> I do this in less than five minutes once/month on a Sunday evening before bed and the results are natural and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> but recently I started losing my lashes due to a thyroid condition and starting using a product to help them grow back.  </li>
            <li> she has very grey eyebrows and mine are just starting to change.</li>
            <li> It seems to work...but just does not last very long.  </li>
            <li> One broke open and exploded dry dye all over the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I put Vaseline below my eyebrows when applying it and leave it on much longer than the suggested time, usually at least ten minutes.  </li>
            <li> I recently dyed my blonde hair to a dark brown, but my eyebrows were still blonde!  </li>
            <li> But Beware... it is very dark (The medium brown is almost black).  Definitely test an area before putting the product on your whole eyebrow, and try not to let it touch your skin, because it will stain.  </li>
            <li> but you could double that by only use half the product each time and you would still have some left over.  </li>
            <li> Its a little green at first, but color balances out after a day or two.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great less expensive option!!</li>
            <li> I thought of bleaching, but am afraid of more unwanted results.</li>
            <li> and I generally use dark brown eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice this until I was actually ready to use the product, so it was too late to return it or get a refund.</li>
            <li> Repeat if necessary if you didn&#x27;t get it dark enough or grays didn&#x27;t cover.</li>
            <li> It is pretty dark so start small and add to if you need to.  </li>
            <li> left on for maybe 2 minutes and have had dark brows for 4+ weeks now after a multi step daily face washing and swimming in chlorinated pools a couple times a week.</li>
            <li> The color has also lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li> but my eyebrows have alot of grey.</li>
            <li> I does not lst as long as they say it should.  </li>
            <li> Kit lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> I will update when I get an idea of how long it lasts, but for now, I&#x27;m tickled not to have to get out my magnifying mirror to fill in and shape my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> and I have another tiny jar with a lid that I empty the powder capsules into.  </li>
            <li> Do not touch your eyebrows for a month or two, depending on how long it takes for whatever is going to come in to come in.  </li>
            <li> , I had to pluck 1 or 2 long hairs</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it will last 6 weeks, but that&#x27;s to be expected with eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> In the instructions it tells you how long to leave it on, based on your desired color.</li>
            <li> and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave it on too long.</li>
            <li> I colour my husbands hair with Touch of Grey.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to do this.</li>
            <li> someone on whom makeup just doesn&#x27;t stay, so I&#x27;ll have to wait and see how long it lasts on me.</li>
            <li> Pull the capsule apart, empty it into the mixing bowl,pour in enough developer to make a paste and apply using the provided pointy/slanted applicator.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t think I will wait that long between applications.</li>
            <li> I have resistant grey eyebrow hairs.</li>
            <li> Keep in my mind that my skin is not sensitive at all.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews of others and how they applied and how long they applied it.</li>
            <li> You definitely want to be careful.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think it lasts as long as stated, but works well for me.</li>
            <li> truth about this product is that you can&#x27;t wash it out... for a long time.</li>
            <li> The product coloured my eyebrows well enough, however I found that it did a minimal job on the grey eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m down to my last capsule and I will DEFINITELY be purchasing more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does fade somewhat fast, but so does professional dye--the fact that the box says it lasts 6 weeks is laughable, unless they mean that the whole box will last you six weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain that it last 6 weeks</li>
            <li> Oh, and like a couple of others here I only used 1/2 or less of the capsule and had plenty of mix left over.</li>
            <li> I found that after I left it on for the suggested time which was 3 minutes, there were still bits of my eyebrows that were black, maybe I hadn&#x27;t applied properly.</li>
            <li> As someone who has naturally dark brown hair and very pale blonde eyebrows (so much so that it looks like I don&#x27;t have any at all)</li>
            <li> In other words, especially if you haven&#x27;t had your brows dyed before, you may look like a drag queen initially.</li>
            <li> the capsules were black not brown as many times it still was black not medium brown was not happy with the product</li>
            <li> 2 or 3 minutes is not nearly long enough to get the few grays.&lt;br /&gt;Wipe</li>
            <li> 2 or 3 minutes is not nearly long enough to get the few grays.&lt;br /&gt;Wipe</li>
            <li> This is the only eyebrow tint I have used, so I can&#x27;t compare to other brands.  </li>
            <li> I then did the other eyebrow and did the same.  </li>
            <li> Put left over on other eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> It is a little dark at first but fades slightly.</li>
            <li> The eyebrows are a little darker for the first few days but after that, they look just like my other eyebrows and it lasts for quite a while.  </li>
            <li> I used a clean mascara wand and it still got all over my skin and was difficult to apply to every hair - root to tip.</li>
            <li> After the third use a few days later I gave up.</li>
            <li> As I get older (I&#x27;m 56), I noticed that my eyebrows have slowly become sparse.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last long enough --- maybe a week.</li>
            <li> Before I started using this product 2 years ago, I colored my brows with a pencil every single day for 6 years.</li>
            <li> It turned out quite dark, but I did leave it on for probably a total of 8 minutes after reapplying to cover some gray hairs that didn&#x27;t want to soak it up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dark blonde, so I went with the medium brown.</li>
            <li> I usually have my brows professionally tinted, but thought I would try to do it myself.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair but very blonde eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I use the medium brown (I have dark blonde hair</li>
            <li> Only caution is that I do think that the products run a tad dark.  </li>
            <li> I have dark brown brows and have a white spot on them since my 20&#x27;s and nothing covered the imperfection but this product.  </li>
            <li> I think I might try doing the dark brown color next time to see how that works out.</li>
            <li> and it actually turns that shade of dark.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t last and was never as dark as I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I only used one coat of dark brown (I&#x27;m a medium-dark brunette), and they look perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mine normally lasts at least 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I followed the advice of others and purchased medium brown and it looks dark brown on my eyebrows, which are natively dark brown with some white mixed</li>
            <li> We aged and all kinds strange things happen.  </li>
            <li> but I found it did not really color the grey.</li>
            <li> So I very carefully put a pin size or larger hole in the bottom of the capsule and carefully squeeze/empty the powder into a lidded container.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a month now and the color has toned down a bit, but still no white hairs!  </li>
            <li> I used half of it and a little bit of creme developer (a lot less than the instruction tells you to use) and it was still too much.</li>
            <li> Black eyebrows and white skin.</li>
            <li> I will try less time next time</li>
            <li> Doing it myself, I can learn from previous experiences, and it&#x27;s only $1-2 per application.</li>
            <li> , you can pour in half, close it back up, and you&#x27;ve doubled your number of applications, and halved your price!</li>
            <li> I left on the dye for less than a min</li>
            <li> , I will leave the tint on for only 30 seconds to see if I get brown instead of black.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for someone that would like a natural dark looking eyebrows in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> The application is easier and less likely to get on your skin (because it will stain - another reason to have someone do it for you. )</li>
            <li> After putting on petroleum jelly (not sure it helps) I mix up a third of the capsule and paint it on in the shape I want with a brush, wait 3 minutes and wipe off, some dye is left on the skin in the sparse areas</li>
            <li> And jet black is what you&#x27;ll likely get if you leave on longer than a minute.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely light eyebrows and the color is dark without looking scary.  </li>
            <li> lol I was scared to order this because I was afraid I might accidently dye my skin or it might come out too dark or red hued or something could just potentially go wrong</li>
            <li> I also disliked that you have to use the entire capsule-worth of dye, which makes enough dye for two applications, so you end up throwing away half of the product.</li>
            <li> There are still a few hairs that are black, but only noticeable up close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a lot of mixture left over!</li>
            <li> I ditched the little wooden sticks and use a q-tip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d go a little lighter next time.</li>
            <li> cut open the little capsule</li>
            <li> The next day I washed my face again and the brows lightened up a little.  </li>
            <li> I wish the coloring didn&#x27;t come in those little capsules because they can be tricky to open</li>
            <li> Secondly, the little cup is the cheapest, thinnest plastic i&#x27;ve ever seen and this too contributes to spilling.</li>
            <li> Natural black for olive to dark skin with black hair.</li>
            <li> I went a little overboard the first time and did a few applications -- it gets darker even after you wash it off --</li>
            <li> I have very little grey / white brows.  </li>
            <li> I also leave the paste on for quite a long time, since I&#x27;m only tinting a few hairs!  </li>
            <li> I recently dyed my hair dark, quite dark, and this helped my eyebrows to match.</li>
            <li> , the skin beneath your brows will likely be tinted for a few days,</li>
            <li> Aged 50.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent 38 years drawing eyebrows on my face every morning.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful not to get it on your skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I expected</li>
            <li> Will continue to use this product and save the money I&#x27;d have spent at the salon.</li>
            <li> does seem to alter the color of colored eyebrow hair, but it does not cover white hair, so it&#x27;s a waste of money if that is your goal.</li>
            <li> Do be careful applying on to browline for that reason.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve aged my eyebrows have faded and faded</li>
            <li> I will say that the color is a bit darker than I expected - I have medium brown hair and my eyebrows are a shade darker.  </li>
            <li> It took me a couple tries to figure out the timing, though.</li>
            <li> You have to follow the directions carefully.</li>
            <li> it off with a wet washcloth.  </li>
            <li> it off with a wet washcloth.  </li>
            <li> Wipe everything off with a wet paper towel.  </li>
            <li> Took the dye off with the wet paper towel.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years and buying it at a local beauty shop.  </li>
            <li> There is enough powder in the capsules for three tintings for my thin brows, so I store the extra for use the next couple times.  </li>
            <li> Its a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> You should be careful to use it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come off either so be really careful.</li>
            <li> After chemo, I have few eyebrows and they are very blonde.  </li>
            <li> Be careful not to get it on your skin because it&#x27;ll stain it</li>
            <li> The longer you leave the tint on, the darker they get, so be careful.</li>
            <li> Just apply carefully so there is minimum contact with your skin except within your eyebrow line.  </li>
            <li> I only use half or less of that capsule powder per application because I don&#x27;t need all of what&#x27;s in a single capsule to cover my eyebrows ...</li>
            <li> Blondes or redheads who want a less dramatic look should take note to either buy a light brown shade or leave this tint on for less than the 60 seconds as directed!</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s still on and my last application was a week and a half ago!</li>
            <li> I left the tint on for 2 minutes (the max time directed) and my eyebrows are BLACK!</li>
            <li> My eyebrow is completely white due to vitiligo, so perhaps it works better if you have some base of color to begin with.</li>
            <li> Once the tint has settled, it lasts about half as long as advertised, so you have about 3 weeks before the color is no longer noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I empty a small amount of powder in the cup and add an equal amount of the creme.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and I only have to use very little brow pencil.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it lasted a couple of weeks, other times it seemed to fade within 5-7 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has been extremely helpful.  </li>
            <li> Be careful opening the capsule!  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to worry with eyebrow pencil or other products.  </li>
            <li> For years I have been doing pencil or other color in the morning and takes forever.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Takes only a few minutes and color lasts for weeks!</li>
            <li> Have been using this for tinting eyebrows for months and beats any other products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a year and have not had the problem of it not working anymore, like other reviewers reported.</li>
            <li> This color is not really for blondes, unless your hair is dark blond.  </li>
            <li> Because other reviews recommended going a shade lighter than you think you need, I went for medium brown.</li>
            <li> I agree with an earlier reviewer, use those small brushes in the toothpaste aisle</li>
            <li> wife says that she will not go out for two month due to the color of her brows.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One has to be very careful to not stain the skin around the eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Be very careful opening the capsules.</li>
            <li> When I started to open the capsules the powder was very messy.</li>
            <li> I was very  very careful.  </li>
            <li> IWas very careful.</li>
            <li> I have strawberry blonde hair, and usually like my brows on the darker side, but this was way too dark.</li>
            <li> When I was assembling the dye I discovered that the company had completely neglected to include the capsules  of dye itself, rendering the entire purchase useless.  </li>
            <li> Medium brown can be almost black, depending how you mix it, so be careful.  </li>
            <li> so I waited a few mins for my skin to dry, applied again for another 20 seconds</li>
            <li> Without color I appear very Plain with two blue holes in my face.  </li>
            <li> One complaint - the box says to remember that wet hair looks darker than when it&#x27;s dry - because of that comment I left the dye on a few seconds longer which I regret because my brows ended up a little darker than I wanted.</li>
            <li> I have now a big stain around my eyebrows hard to get rid of.</li>
            <li> The eyebrow color is too dark for me.  </li>
            <li> It is way too dark for me</li>
            <li> and the medium brown is just a smidge too dark.</li>
            <li> I got mine in medium brown even though I have dark hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to go too dark</li>
            <li> Came out a really dark brown.</li>
            <li> Still too dark after 3 days.</li>
            <li> I have fairly dark eyebrows</li>
            <li> If you do end up too dark (as I was after the salon) try tweezing into a thinner shape, and trimming the longer hairs.</li>
            <li> If you dont want really dark brows, I wouldn&#x27;t order this kit and if you do order, I would leave the tint on for a maximum of 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> I have a very small sample jar from some other product in which I store the extra.  </li>
            <li> As I am a man who has turned gray, I noticed that the celebrities on TV are gray with dark eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> seems to be keeping to its promise about lasting for at least 6 weeks...</li>
            <li> The medium brown seems a bit too dark too.</li>
            <li> I went with med brown and it came up a dark \\&quot;shoe polish\\</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as dark as my hair, if not darker.</li>
            <li> I have dark auburn hair and used the medium brown.</li>
            <li> had dark brows for a month now</li>
            <li> so I did 3 minutes for each brow to make them a dark brown.</li>
            <li> My last order arrived late</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as dark as I wanted</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll copy my review from the Dark Brown here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I chose the tint in Dark Brown and processed for three minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it even lasts as long as the dylash......</li>
            <li> I used medium brown and it is dark to me</li>
            <li> Since I dye my hair dark brown</li>
            <li> As soon as I finished the 30 seconds it took to apply and complete my eyebrow enhancement, my grayling thin eyebrows became youthful looking and face framing.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how terrible my eyebrows looked until they looked good again.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long it will last, but I will continue to use this product because as pretty as my hair color is, I hate gray eyebrows.</li>
            <li> mixed the product and applied as suggested and the colour did slowly change.</li>
            <li> So easy to use, almost impossible to mess up, and wayyyy cheaper than getting it done at brow bar or the salon!</li>
            <li> My hair is dark brown (just lighter than black), and after reading the review for the \\&quot;dark brown\\&quot; dye, I ordered the medium brown.</li>
            <li> Dark brown for medium to olive skin tones with dark brown to black hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the dye all the way down to the roots, but</li>
            <li> The jet black color was not too dark for my eybrows.</li>
            <li> I have really dark brown hair (almost black, but still brown)</li>
            <li> I previously ordered this in Dark Brown and had zero issues.</li>
            <li> You mix a very small amount of dye and put it on your eyebrow and only wait</li>
            <li> I was looking for a medium brown color, but this one is dark dark dark!</li>
            <li> The only thing bad I can think of is that each capsule has too much dye for one brow tint (I have been trying to think of a way to use one half capsule at a time).  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions and got no color, except for a slight darkening of the skin.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the color looked almost black even though I only left the dye on for 1 minute.</li>
            <li> Also, the box says it lasts six weeks, but with leaving it on for four minutes, I get about a week and a half, or close to two weeks wear out of an application.  </li>
            <li> so I din´t order black one but medium brown.</li>
            <li> Purchased Jet black eyebrow tint.</li>
            <li> but it was black when I washed it off.</li>
            <li> and it turned my eyebrows BLACK.</li>
            <li> After paying to have this done previously, I was wondering if there was a way I could color my eyebrows at home.  </li>
            <li> I ordered &#x27;Medium Brown&#x27; tint after reading the reviews that the color looked black...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think they would turn jet black since the capsules are brown, but they did</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because of the color turning out black.</li>
            <li> and it turned them BLACK.</li>
            <li> It washes away in about a week and a half to two weeks.  </li>
            <li> If anything it makes filling them in less.</li>
            <li> The color lasted less that the 28 days, but I wash my face and hair quite often.  </li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t even realize I had any on the outer half of my eye brows.</li>
            <li> According to the packaging the color selector goes like this: Get jet black for ebony skin and black hair.</li>
            <li> I might try splitting a capsule in half and tinting every three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looked ridiculous with my red hair and now I might have to bleach my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The color is black- faded to jet.  </li>
            <li> so my brows were a little dark, but I didn&#x27;t mind.  </li>
            <li> I purchased medium brown which was a little too dark for me.</li>
            <li> and doesn&#x27;t cover some of the pesky hard core grey hairs</li>
            <li> so I had quite dark brows for a few days (my fault)</li>
            <li> There is not the mess that you have with the two step dyes.  </li>
            <li> Medium brown is very dark almost black.  </li>
            <li> It is black or very dark blue!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only problem is that its not long lasting That&#x27;s the reason for my 4 stars instead of 5 :( .</li>
            <li> Not worth the price, too messy and missing parts.</li>
            <li> I purchased the medium brown because I was afraid dark brown would be too intense.  </li>
            <li> I put a  little aloe on my brows and that solved that problem.</li>
            <li> little plastic cup that they provide is junky.&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> I guess I was hoping a little bit darker one.</li>
            <li> I would suggest applying it on a day off because of this, as it can look a little extreme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like not having to worry about putting a lot of makeup on so a little mascara, lipstick/gloss</li>
            <li> and it was a little darker than anticipated.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The tint arrives in a powder form which is packaged in little capsules.</li>
            <li> that you &amp;#34;mix&amp;#34; the color in the little cup and apply.</li>
            <li> The little brow comb is helpful.</li>
            <li> my brows a little darker</li>
            <li> just a little</li>
            <li> and since my eyebrows are relatively thin, I might use half the amount next time as it was a waste to throw out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very dark brown</li>
            <li> So my eyebrows were tweezed and shaped but still very dark.  </li>
            <li> My brows came out a very dark brown.</li>
            <li> I recently dyed my hair from dirty blonde to chocolately brown and needed something to tint my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It actually turned out blackish brown, which is my only disappointment with the product.   </li>
            <li> A few recommendations for applying the dye: I use an eyebrow makeup brush to apply the dye.</li>
            <li> I put chapstick around my brow before putting on the dye, rather than dealing with messy Vaseline.</li>
            <li> Follow directions and you will not have much trouble with skin staining.</li>
            <li> Easier to use than Roux brand, though if this brand were not available I would use the Roux brand instead as that does do the job.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x60;t messy at all and didn´t tint me skin either.</li>
            <li> I went into Sally&#x27;s a few weeks ago to get an eyebrow tint</li>
            <li> The developer on this batch/purchase seemed to have dried up.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few years now and can&#x27;t be without it.  </li>
            <li> So a few minutes with this product</li>
            <li> One size does not fit all.  </li>
            <li> It always turned out to be a waste of money to get my hair colored.  </li>
            <li> On to round two.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any trouble with it</li>
            <li> but the color last approximately 1- month.  </li>
            <li> I used it a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> I have several girls at work addicted now too.  </li>
            <li> I swim almost everyday and coming out of the pool with no eyebrows was quite embarrassing.  </li>
            <li> so just leave it on for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> and the results were uneven sometimes in my morning rush.  </li>
            <li> Its messy to mix.  </li>
            <li> I think this helped me from turning my brows dark brown or black like others complained about.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried eyebrow pencils - never the right colour, goopy,some would clump like a bad crayon,  </li>
            <li> I just have a few white hairs but got tired of plucking them, so use a Q-tip with a very little of the dye for precision.  </li>
            <li> I have very black eyebrows</li>
            <li> I usually leave it on a little longer than the package says about two minutes longer.  </li>
            <li> At that moment I have a mess for eyebrows, a terrible shape, and more than one color.  </li>
            <li> and you are basically painting it on thick, down to the skin.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows were also very dark and there was some dye on my skin, but at least I had eyebrows again.  </li>
            <li> But in just a few minutes, I had visible brows!  </li>
            <li> Not sure I will bother with this product again.</li>
            <li> no more gray hairs (I have a lot of them).</li>
            <li> I might try this again and only leave it on for 1-2 minutes, but I\\&quot;m really afraid it will still be too dark.</li>
            <li> No more need.</li>
            <li> I used a small brush and an eyebrow stencil and followed the application instructions.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> When I had dyed my hair, I would also use a small amount on my eyebrows, but the colour would fade within a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> but no more.  </li>
            <li> mine usually lasts 7-10 days..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m of the age when a few gray hairs are creeping into my eyebrows!  </li>
            <li> No more filling in with eyebrow pencils and stuff.</li>
            <li> I use the small brush to mix the paste and apply it to the mascara brush bristles.  </li>
            <li> warning: the powder will permanently stain Corian countertops, as I learned when I spilled a small amount on my bathroom vanity.  </li>
            <li> I w as hoping this product would do the trick for at least a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I just looked like an alien.  </li>
            <li> No more powders.</li>
            <li> and they usually ended up looking &amp;</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will order this again, I will have to keep experimenting with it.</li>
            <li> and it was a tiny bit cheaper than the Dark Brown this time (weird!).</li>
            <li> Thirdly, the wooden sticks are totally worthless.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to go darker, but impossible to go lighter!!</li>
            <li> NOT happy had to purchase another product to strip off the BLACK.</li>
            <li> Alas, I ordered black and got brown.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tried some re-grow products that we worthless and my neighbor suggested getting some type of dye or long lasting eyebrow pencil.  </li>
            <li> This stains your skin and it&#x27;s hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> they were hardly noticeable before.  </li>
            <li> so they are hard to see, now I have eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived without the applicators that were listed on the contents, calling Cosmetic Solutions did not resolve the problem, they told me in broken English that it did not come with applicators, that I was reading the box and instructions wrong.  </li>
            <li> Was looking for something just for eyebrows and purchased the medium brown inspite of some negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Go slowly and let the artist in you come out.  </li>
            <li> Verrrry slowly I might add.  </li>
            <li> Go slow and take your time.  </li>
            <li> I use a thick medicine cup instead.  </li>
            <li> No more salon for me!</li>
            <li> No more disappearing eyebrows!</li>
            <li> &quot; black with that fake undertone.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> , I can come out of the pool without frightening little kids with my non-existent looking lashes and brows.  </li>
            <li> Not a good match.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just messy, and if you do get the product in the wrong spot, just wipe off with a tissue.</li>
            <li> I hated it, I paid too much for this.</li>
            <li> Obviously, go slow, don&#x27;t overdo this or you&#x27;ll look even worse, but it can help.</li>
            <li> I was really sick of using eyebrow pencil on my graying eyebrows and having it not last through the day.  </li>
            <li> The capsule of color is extremely hard to pull apart!  </li>
            <li> Graying brows are tough to treat.</li>
            <li> but I tired of using pencil.</li>
            <li> I was tired of using mascara to darken them.  </li>
            <li> mine are thin.  </li>
            <li> Sooo tired of having to draw them on in the morning</li>
            <li> I look ridiculous now!</li>
            <li> I was also sick to death of coloring them in everyday.</li>
            <li> HOW DUMB!</li>
            <li> &#x60;n look fake.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it faded within two weeks.</li>
            <li> It could be because of my face wash or something, but needless to say, the product didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> A woman at the make-up counter of an expensive shop once whizzed over, said &amp;</li>
            <li> Difficult to apply with precision.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product but am always fighting my eyebrows color fading.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, they are even lighter than my hair, so I look like I&#x27;m half-dead without coloring my brows.</li>
            <li> Just saying - the wrong color was sent -</li>
            <li> then u did something wrong.</li>
            <li> So needless to say I had to use a brow pencil</li>
            <li> I got the wrong color capsules in the medium brown box for the brow tint.</li>
            <li> and I ordered again and now have the wrong color...</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> Luckily I carefully pre-applied vaseline to avoid mistakes -- ha, I would have had a nasty look</li>
            <li> Wearing makeup alone looks bad, looks too draw-on and fake.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid they would rip off my skin.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it might have a funky hue in the sun</li>
            <li> Crazy stuff.</li>
            <li> #34;This will take years off your face&amp;#34; and proceeded to show me a very expensive eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> I have very thin eyebrows that I hate.</li>
            <li> Even if no tweezing for one to two months looks bad, leave it alone.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not that bad</li>
            <li> After a bad experience with the salon owner, I decided to try this home kit myself.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I am now sitting here with body hair bleaching solution on my brows trying to correct this. :(  </li>
            <li> a handful of Q tips and water on hand: (</li>
            <li> :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but this thing is very very tough and insane.</li>
            <li> I will do it again because I hate eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> However, I also hate the hassle of putting on eyebrow pencil or creams and have difficulty finding products I like.</li>
            <li> /&gt;My bad!</li>
            <li> I hated how runny it was</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The medium brown keep my brows looking youthful.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It is easy to use and usually stays on about two to three weeks.  My eyebrows look much better with it.</li>
            <li> Works but color came off in 3 days, don&#x27;t worry about staining ur skin, color comes off super fast, too fast for my taste</li>
            <li> First time I ever tinted my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;My eyebrows are sparse and now gray. I put this on but I guess i am not proficient as i also colored the skin around the brow.&lt;br /&gt;It took a couple days to come off my skin. I couldn&#x27;t leave the house.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to use an old mascara brush to put it on. Works much better.</li>
            <li> I am very happy I bought this item. It did a GREAT job coloring my annoying gray-infused eyebrows. It&#x27;s easy to use and the results have lasted for quite a few weeks. A really excellent product - it does what it says - that is, it tints the eyebrows very successfully. And it&#x27;s quite cheap!</li>
            <li> I paid to have my brows tinted for years. Sometimes it lasted a couple of weeks, other times it seemed to fade within 5-7 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been extremely pleased with this product. I&#x27;ve learned to time it to my satisfaction (i leave it on for 10 minutes), and the results last a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, split a capsule to get two treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the skin beneath your brows will likely be tinted for a few days, so use a Qtip to wipe away any excess outside of your eyebrow contour.</li>
            <li> I have very little grey / white brows.  Use this every 3 months to cover.  Very inexpensive compared to going to a salon.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and I enjoy using it.  However, my hair is dark blond, my complexion is medium fair, my eyes are blue. The eyebrow color is too dark for me.  I will try the light brown next time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely happy with this product, especially for the price. My brows look as good as when my esthetician does them, and it took 5 minutes at home &amp; I have 3 more applications. I was so scared to try this but will definitely be a repeat customer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fair skinned, light haired, woman of northern European stock.  Aged 50.  The last time I had my hair highlighted (which I do every 7 weeks), the hairdresser offered to color my brows.  I&#x27;d never considered doing such a thing, but I let him proceed.  He didn&#x27;t get the color on evenly, and it was quite a shock to see brows on my face when I wasn&#x27;t wearing makeup!  I&#x27;ve spent 38 years drawing eyebrows on my face every morning.  So, I searched the net for an eyebrow dye, mostly to even out what the hairdresser had missed, and found Godefroy on Amazon.  Thanks to other reviews, I ordered the medium brown.  It&#x27;s a bit messy - especially if you have very fine eyebrow hair, as I do.  But in just a few minutes, I had visible brows!  Why on earth have I waited so many years to do this?!  The dye will stain your skin just a bit, but it fades after the first washing of your face.  I used an old eyebrow tool with a comb/brush combination to apply the dye.  Godefroy supplies you with an orange-stick to apply it, but I couldn&#x27;t get that to work for me.  Waited about 4 minutes and wiped it off.  Wow!  Brows!  Like someone else mentioned, I can finally SEE the hairs that need plucking!</li>
            <li> I was hopeful after all of the positive reviews, but this product did not work for me at all.  I followed the directions and got no color, except for a slight darkening of the skin.  I also found it messier than what I have been using (Just for Men!).  My eyebrow is completely white due to vitiligo, so perhaps it works better if you have some base of color to begin with.</li>
            <li> Having lived with very light eyebrows all of my life, I was looking for a simple inexpensive way to color them.  Using a brow pencil or powder can create a very unnatural look, either too dark or brows appearing to be drawn on.  This product is very easy to use. Economical, because there are single use applications, and does the job well, even on those pesky gray hairs. I initially tried it on the suggestion of a friend, and I have since recommended it to others. Ordering through Amazon was easy, with very reasonable shipping costs.</li>
            <li> I just purchased and used for the first time. I ordered light brown. It turned out quite dark, but I did leave it on for probably a total of 8 minutes after reapplying to cover some gray hairs that didn&#x27;t want to soak it up. Many other reviews say it fades out after a few washings so I&#x27;m counting on that. It did cover the white hairs and hope is lasts a reasonable length of time. I didn&#x27;t bother with vaseline and I didn&#x27;t have any problem at all with it coming off the skin.     I wish the light brown didn&#x27;t turn so dark, but I did give it a 5-star rating because for the cost, ease of use and results, I feel it does deserve it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product especially if you like to tint your eyebrows frequently.  Make sure you choose the right color - the tint is darker than you can tell from the label.  Last thing - One capsule makes a lot of tint - I break open the capsules and only use half as much.  Works fine.</li>
            <li> Product is more reasonable then going to the salon and having it done.  I have been purchasing this product for over 3 years and have been very pleased with the outcome.</li>
            <li> Works great. I used to use a Medium Brown eye brow pencil, so I ordered this product in Medium Brown.  Next time, I will order Light Brown.  Came out darker than I wanted.  Had to leave it on longer than said time also.  I will definitely buy this product again though.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and I love it. It has been over 6 weeks since I put it on my eyebrows and they still look great. I have medium brown hair and the medium brown was perfect, but I did not leave it on very long.</li>
            <li> The product arrived without the applicators that were listed on the contents, calling Cosmetic Solutions did not resolve the problem, they told me in broken English that it did not come with applicators, that I was reading the box and instructions wrong.  Contacted Godefroy to report problem and they did not respond.  Product is good, worked very well and was easy to apply.  Based on customer service though I probably will not reorder from this company</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because it seemed to provide an inexpensive and effective  solution to middle-age &#x27;salt and pepper&#x27; brows that plague dark-haired women.  Thankfully this product did the job!  I purchased the medium brown and had to reapply a few times to tint the more stubborn grays,  but the effect was entirely worth it.  It is true  that \\&quot;medium\\&quot; brown is much more like \\&quot;dark\\&quot; brown,  so order the color accordingly.  I will definitely be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> Not sure I will bother with this product again. I&#x27;m a dark blonde, so I went with the medium brown. The color is flat &amp; mousey. The product content itself is astonishingly skimpy. I can&#x27;t believe they expect repeat customers.</li>
            <li> I bought this after having my eyebrows professionally tinted a couple times, which cost me over $30 each visit. Godefroy is a great way to keep up the color and save money. I got the medium brown and I only left it on for one minute each brow, and that was plenty for me. It does fade somewhat fast, but so does professional dye--the fact that the box says it lasts 6 weeks is laughable, unless they mean that the whole box will last you six weeks. I&#x27;ve been re-dyeing once per week and it&#x27;s still saving a lot of money. The box costs only $9 on Amazon and half a capsule of powder is more than enough for both brows, meaning it&#x27;s going to cost me about $1.00 per application. Not bad!     A few recommendations for applying the dye: I use an eyebrow makeup brush to apply the dye. I put chapstick around my brow before putting on the dye, rather than dealing with messy Vaseline. I do one eyebrow at a time as the box recommends. Immediately after I&#x27;m done, I use a toothbrush and some dish soap and scrub each brow, this does not fade the dye but it gets any excess dye off the skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I have bleach blonde eyebrows and need all the help I can get.  My advice to those who have tried it with unsatisafctory results:  Really glop in on your brows so that is fully immerses the hairs with the product.  You have to be careful to not get it all over your forehead, but if you apply it in a few coats in order to really cover the hairs and wait about 10-15 minutes, the product colors very well.  The first day I always feel like they are a bit dark (since I am so fair) but after one day they are PERFECT.  I love this product and recommend it to anyone looking for better brows.</li>
            <li> The dye stains hair very well but I had issues with the dye being splotchy in areas and not working well in the areas where my hair is sparse. I also disliked that you have to use the entire capsule-worth of dye, which makes enough dye for two applications, so you end up throwing away half of the product. I am not the most experienced eyebrow dyer, so I am sure the product works better for those who are. However, I will choose a different tint next time.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Follow directions and you will not have much trouble with skin staining.</li>
            <li> I tried Godefroy tint,let me tell you my brows are light brown with alot of grey mixed in, I&#x27;m 71 years old still dye my hair light ash blond but I tired of using pencil. I am hooked for good,its very easy to mix and use.My brows look like they were done in a beauty salon.I will buy again!.......Cookie Dumas Tx.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! I&#x27;ve been using eyebrow powder and looking for something more permanent for over a year. I decided to give this  a try. It &#x27;s a great product. The first time I used it, it burned a little after I wiped it off. I put a  little aloe on my brows and that solved that problem. For me it lasts about 6 weeks. I don&#x27;t use a full capsule. I empty a small amount of powder in the cup and add an equal amount of the creme. I&#x27;ve used one capsule for 4 applications and I still have some left. This package will last me much longer than 4 applications. I ditched the little wooden sticks and use a q-tip. The key is to get it all over the brow hairs. I usually get it on my skin too, but the next day I give them a good scrub with shampoo and washes off. My brows look great! no more gray hairs (I have a lot of them). I will continue to use this product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wow, I am really impressed with this item. My eyebrows have always been nearly invisible. I was tired of using mascara to darken them.  And this did not work in summer while swimming.  With this product, I can really see my eyebrows, even from a distance.  I did not have any problems even though I usually have very sensitive skin and am cautious about using new products. I would recommend this to anyone who needs to darken their brows easily.  I plan to order my next order soon.</li>
            <li> The eyebrows are a little darker for the first few days but after that, they look just like my other eyebrows and it lasts for quite a while.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is so fantastic I would buy it in bulk! Just be careful not to get it on your skin. If you do, after they dye sits, just get an old tooth brush and with some shampoo, scrub the leftover dye on your skin goodbye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fabulous product!</li>
            <li> The dye itself was easy to use and worked very well, adhering quickly and easily to the hair without leaving any staining on my skin. Unfortunately the color looked almost black even though I only left the dye on for 1 minute. I have strawberry blonde hair, and usually like my brows on the darker side, but this was way too dark. I did like the product and will try the light brown in hopes that will provide a better shade.</li>
            <li> My advise is to read the instructions and follow them.  The product was not difficult to mix, applied easily, did not stain my skin (but I was careful not to get the product on my skin) and colored completely in the recommended time.  The color has also lasted a long time.  I used this product mid-July and its now mid-September and no need to repeat the dye process.</li>
            <li> A good product that does the job of tinting the eyebrows without too much fuss or muss and is much cheaper than having it done in a salon. For under $10, you can tint your brows 4 times. I think it starts to fade pretty quickly, that is, it is advertised to last for 6 weeks, but if you want well-defined brows, you&#x27;d want to tint them more often, but this is true of the professional tint as well. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> This product is great!  I had been having my eyebrows colored by my hair stylist.  He did a good job and didn&#x27;t charge me extra when he was also doing my hair, but this product beats his results, hands down.  When I applied it, I left it on longer than it said to so my brows were a little dark, but I didn&#x27;t mind.  They looked good.  It&#x27;s been a month now and the color has toned down a bit, but still no white hairs!  Yay!  This is easy to use, inexpensive and long lasting.  I&#x27;ll never be without it again.</li>
            <li> This product does the job but it does not last as long as they claim.&lt;br /&gt;The little plastic cup that they provide is junky.&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to apply. One has to be very careful to not stain the skin around the eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;In spite of this I like it and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the do-it-yourself person.  Easy instructions, easy to do, great results.  The results are just as good as the Salon and cheaper.  Highly Recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just OK.  I don&#x27;t know what I expected but it really didn&#x27;t cover like I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I naturally have medium brown hair and light brown eyebrows.  I have been darkening them with gels and pencils for years, and have always been self conscious at the pool, etc. Luckily after finding this product-not anymore.  This has been extremely helpful.  I am no longer worried about going in public without \\&quot;my eyebrows on,\\&quot; and not to mention the time it saves me time every day (sometimes multiple times) dealing with them.  I think the eyebrows are the most important part of your face, and I feel so much better to be able to get up and go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who has to deal with the burden of using gels, pencils, or shadows on a daily basis.  I will say that the directions say to leave it on each eyebrow for two minutes, but I leave it on for four.  My eyebrows are pretty dark afterwards for about a day and a half, but I get longer use out of each application that way.  Also, the box says it lasts six weeks, but with leaving it on for four minutes, I get about a week and a half, or close to two weeks wear out of an application.  I also followed the advice of another reviewer and put chapstick on the skin around my eyebrows to keep from staining my skin.  All in all, it takes me about 15 minutes tops every other week or so to dye my brows with this product, which seems a lot better than the ten minutes a day I spent coloring them in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review is helpful.  I just ordered the \\&quot;Godefroy Double Lash &amp; Brow Treatment\\&quot; since I love the eyebrow tint so much, so I will be writing a review about it after I give that product a go.</li>
            <li> I use this to cover grays in my eyebrows.  I found it darkened them but not some of the stubborn grays so good.</li>
            <li> The second time I ordered this I ended up getting a box that didn&#x27;t have the tint capsules in it. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t open the box to for more than a month after I ordered it since I hadn&#x27;t used up my original box yet. I contacted the seller and explained and they sent me another box free of charge even though it was well past the return date. In addition to that it works. As someone who has naturally dark brown hair and very pale blonde eyebrows (so much so that it looks like I don&#x27;t have any at all) this product helps sooo much. I don&#x27;t always have the time or the desire to do my eyebrows with makeup, with this eyebrow tint I don&#x27;t have to worry about going out and looking like I shaved my eyebrows completely off. Love it. I will definately be getting this many times in the future.</li>
            <li> Godfrey Instant Eyebrow Tint worked very well on my eyebrows. It says not to use on eyelashes, but I did try it on my lower lashes and it worked much better than their eyelash tint. Will continue to use this product and save the money I&#x27;d have spent at the salon.</li>
            <li> The product coloured my eyebrows well enough, however I found that it did a minimal job on the grey eyebrows.  It said it worked on grey but found it did a better job just colouring my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Even with my natural honey brown (as my mom-mom calls it) hair color, my eyebrows looked non-existent which somehow emphasized my chipmunk cheeks. I had looked into eyebrow dye in the beauty supply store, but it was about $40 which is too much for me. I currently dye my hair auburn and (throwing caution to the wind) I would put some on my eyebrows each time I did my roots. Hair dye isn&#x27;t made for your face and it fades quickly. I was also sick to death of coloring them in everyday. I happened across this product when I was looking for something else and decided that for less than $5 it was worth a try. It totally was. It&#x27;s supposed to last up to 6 weeks but on me it&#x27;s about 5 good weeks and a week or so of having to add a little filler before i get around to dying them again. I&#x27;m ok with that. It&#x27;s easy to use, the instructions are clear and if you have a mirror and a steady hand you&#x27;re good to go. I&#x27;m down to my last capsule and I will DEFINITELY be purchasing more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a tip: either wear gloves when removing the dye from your eyebrows and cleaning out the cup or be EXTRA careful to not get any near your nails. It&#x27;s been well over a month since I got some on my ring finger nail (no gel or acrylic) and it still looks like I was digging in the mud under the nail. The cuticle was clean within a week, but my nail won&#x27;t be clean until grows out. My fault though since they do warn of staining multiple times.</li>
            <li> Be careful opening the capsule!  The dye works well though, and fast!  A great deal if you compare what you would pay to have your browns dyed in a salon.</li>
            <li> I liked the concept of being able to color/darken my eyebrows (especially as my color is fading!) so purchased this product and tried it right away.  The color was a little darker than I thought it would be (I bought medium brown but it seemed more like dark brown) and after about 3 weeks, the color started fading.  Don&#x27;t know if it was my face products or the oils on my skin.  The color did work great, it just didn&#x27;t last like I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Easy to use and works FAST!!  It says it is four applications but you could double that by only use half the product each time and you would still have some left over.  I found the medium brown was darker than I thought it would be.  I&#x27;d go a little lighter next time.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Easy clean up.  Easier to use than Roux brand, though if this brand were not available I would use the Roux brand instead as that does do the job.  But this brand is far easier to use.  And it cleans the color off of your face easy enough (I don&#x27;t use the petroleum like it recommends, and it still cleans any extra color off my face just fine).  With the Roux brand you really need to use the get-the-color-off-your-face gel that comes with the package.  But with this brand, it is not necessary.  And the color does last equally as long as the Roux brand.  So I&#x27;m definitely hooked on this brand.  I&#x27;ve used both the Medium and the Light brown and both are great.</li>
            <li> I usually have my brows professionally tinted, but thought I would try to do it myself. I have always had \\&quot;light brown\\&quot; tints done before. I bought this product (medium brown) after reading all the reviews about how light it is, and how extra long everyone had to leave it on, etc. Well, based on these reviews of people needing to leave the tint on longer than the 1-2 minutes on the directions, and how light the color was--I followed all the directions, but left the dye on for 10-12 minutes, and WATCH OUT--those eyebrows of mine STAND OUT. It is way too dark for me (I have light reddish to dark blondish color hair and really light/almost white eyebrows). I might try this again and only leave it on for 1-2 minutes, but I\\&quot;m really afraid it will still be too dark. So I just re-ordered the same product in light brown. I&#x27;ll write a new review on that next month when I have to re-tint.</li>
            <li> This brow color works great for those who wish to color graying brows.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve used it and it did work.  Put up the Do Not Disturb sign!  Make sure there are no phone calls or other interruptions while you are mixing &amp; applying the color, because you&#x27;ll want to focus on timing the length of time that you leave the color on.  Follow the instructions and color one brow at a time.  Your entire brow will become the same color in a matter of 1-2 minutes.  Make sure you&#x27;re next to your sink, so you can rinse out the color immediately.  I used the medium brown and it looks good. There are several (dry) color capsules remaining and enough developer to use the product several more times.  But I&#x27;d purchase the light brown next time, as my skin is fair. and the medium brown is just a smidge too dark. It&#x27;s better than having to apply eyeliner to color the gray brows every morning!  TIP: if some color remains on the skin under your brow after rinsing out the color, dip a cotton swab into some lemon juice and rub it on your brow.  It will remove the color from your skin, without changing the color of your brow.[[ASIN:B001AN0YR0 Godefroy Instant Eyebrow Tint medium brown]]</li>
            <li> Always gives me the color I want. I have blonde eyebrows and I need just a bit of tint. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I just have a few white hairs but got tired of plucking them, so use a Q-tip with a very little of the dye for precision.  I leave it on for longer than the directions advise for those white hairs, but it really works.</li>
            <li> Be very careful opening the capsules. Wear glasses/goggles. One broke open and exploded dry dye all over the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;This does seem to alter the color of colored eyebrow hair, but it does not cover white hair, so it&#x27;s a waste of money if that is your goal.</li>
            <li> I recently dyed my hair from dirty blonde to chocolately brown and needed something to tint my eyebrows. I&#x27;ve never dyed my own hair or eyebrows and I thought this product was very easy to use. I used petroleum jelly as the instructions recommended and it didn&#x27;t leave any stains on my skin. One complaint - the box says to remember that wet hair looks darker than when it&#x27;s dry - because of that comment I left the dye on a few seconds longer which I regret because my brows ended up a little darker than I wanted.</li>
            <li> I am a natural strawberry-blonde, so the hairs on my eyebrows and eyelashes are so light you can hardly see them! With this product, I&#x27;m able to tint my brows and have them look natural. Also, when I color my hair dark, I can easily make my eyebrows another shade or two darker to match. I love that its a cream type of dye, because it makes it easier to cover the brow hairs without having it drip off (like a liquid would). Of course you have to be careful the first time as not to make eyebrows too dark or stain your skin too much. I gave only 4 stars because the product claims to last for 6 weeks, and I havent found this to be true - more like 3 to 4 weeks of color. I also think it would be a good idea to include some sort of color/stain remover for skin in the kit. Nonetheless, I think this is a great product, and I will continue to purchase it!</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of eye brow tint and this one is by far the best! It is super easy to apply and gets great results in a short amount of time. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Black eyebrows and white skin. A medium brown instant tint of this product did not change my eyebrow shade at all even after applying it twice. I have now a big stain around my eyebrows hard to get rid of. Never again! I would go back to Nice-and-Easy root touch up instead. That works great on eyebrows too. I just wanted to try something new specifically for eyebrows. Good job in painting my skin though Godefroy!!! If you want to change your skin tone, not your eyebrows go for Godefroy eyebrow tint!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I used to go to the salon to get my eyebrows dyed. No more need. Does the job and lasts.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  When you mix it according to directions, it makes more than you need.  Next time I will decrease the amount, so I don&#x27;t have to throw so  much away.  Very natural looking!</li>
            <li> This is a quick and easy to use product and saves time  when doing your morning makeup if you have light/gray  hair and need eyebrow color.</li>
            <li> easy to use product, simple instructions, saving at least $80 in salon fees -- arrived timely     thank you!</li>
            <li> I use to get my brows tinted at the salon, but now that I found this product I will NEVER go back!&lt;br /&gt;I use about 1/3 of a capsule for both of my eyebrows and it is plenty. So I get 3 applications per capsule!&lt;br /&gt;For me it only lasts about 4 weeks and then I need to reapply, BUT It&#x27;s still TOTALLY worth it!&lt;br /&gt;I found it super easy to apply. I used a small brush and an eyebrow stencil and followed the application instructions.&lt;br /&gt;This will save me SO MUCH $$$.</li>
            <li> Mail service was good.  Product good, but I think I  need an ash color.  Easy to apply.  It does have to be done more often than I thought it would.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the product. I have light reddish hair but my eyebrows have alot of grey. I purchased medium brown which was a little too dark for me. Next time I order I will order the light brown instead. I left it on for about 2 minutes. It seemed to continue to darken my brows even after I washed off the dye so I will try leaving it on for 1 minute the next time. It lasted for about 4 weeks. All in all, a very good product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I´ve never tinted my eyebrows myself so I had no idea how to do it and if I´m doing it right. But everything is written on the instructions and I read the reviews defore and like somebody mentioned- you don´t need the whole capsule at once. I used half of it and a little bit of creme developer (a lot less than the instruction tells you to use) and it was still too much. Many people said it too dark so I din´t order black one but medium brown. I guess I was hoping a little bit darker one. Next time I´ll order dark brown (I´m blonde and kinda light skin. European). It wasn&#x60;t messy at all and didn´t tint me skin either. Seemed to me like the easiest thing to do! Used it longer thant 2 min though because after first 2min wasn&#x60;t dark enough so I did it again another 2min. Def use timer so both eyebrows will be same color!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Medium brown\\&quot; is pretty dark - beware if you are a blonde or dark blonde!  I will definitely go with a lighter shade next time!  Otherwise, this is a great product that saves a lot of time!</li>
            <li> I had undergone chemotherapy back in 2006 , and it seemed all my BODY hair grew back fast, and darker ( yeah, just what a woman wants to happen :C ) except for the hair on my head, and my eyebrows. Both very light in colour and in texture, and slow growing.  When I had dyed my hair, I would also use a small amount on my eyebrows, but the colour would fade within a couple of days.  I tried eyebrow pencils - never the right colour, goopy,some would clump like a bad crayon,  &#x60;n look fake. I was starting to think I would have to live with invisible eyebrows and all forehead.  I had such luck with this product! So Happy with it ! Easy to use, doesn&#x60;t take more than a few minutes. My hair is light /med blonde, but this medium brown eyebrow tint gives me just  the right contrast, not too dark. Today was my second time using it, about 6 weeks into the first time. It does last. It was not completly faded.. but I started to get a lil &#x27;gold&#x27;.  I have much more confidence now, and it also helped to see where to tweeze.</li>
            <li> Although my hair is dark brown, I have had very light colored and sparse eyebrows for the last 20 years or so. When I heard about this dye, I was eager to try it. After reading many reviews and tips, I went with the medium brown instead of the dark, and I&#x27;m happy that I did because it was darker than I expected. It actually turned out blackish brown, which is my only disappointment with the product.   Overall, I am very pleased with this product. It makes a huge difference in how I look without make-up. The color does not last as long as advertised, but even if I had to reapply every week, I would still be very happy with this product. I ended up re-ordering 4 more boxes. I really wish I had known about this product years ago. It would have saved me a lot of time with the eyebrow pencils.    I was also happy that this dye did not irritate my sensitive skin.   I would highly recommend this product, though I would use an eyebrow brush for application. Much easier than the supplied toothpick applicators.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product. I have very blonde hair and need to dye my eyebrows to even make them visible. This is a very reddish brown, and lightens up tremendously within a week or two. It&#x27;s okay if you don&#x27;t mind the red and having to re-dye frequently, but I&#x27;m using the Roux tint now. It infuses the follicle, so the color stays until the hair actually grows out. Much better staying power, and I prefer the blue-based tint. See my link below...[[ASIN:B0001XKA38 ROUX Lash and Brow Tint BROWN (40 Applications)]]&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I went into Sally&#x27;s a few weeks ago to get an eyebrow tint but their&#x27;s are like $40 something or more. Pretty pricey. I heard about this awhile ago so I thought I&#x27;d give it a go. Love it! I got mine in medium brown even though I have dark hair. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s pretty buildable color wise. You can top the product on top of itself to create a deeper color which is what I did. Plus, it&#x27;s still on and my last application was a week and a half ago!</li>
            <li> This product may work easier for blonde or grey brows that have soft hair. My brows are wirey blonde and grey. It took three times in one day to color my brows but it did work. I will do it again because I hate eyebrow pencil. It was easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I was looking for! Easy to use, and the color matches my hair perfectly. As long as they continue to make this, I will be a proud user! P.s. I find it easier to stock up on this product (even though I use it every 6 weeks) I have 3 boxes, two unopened.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the reviews. I have dark hair but very blonde eyebrows. Not a good match. I used the dark brown and it worked great the first time. Unfortunately it faded within two weeks. I tried it again and it didn&#x27;t seem to take very well. After the third use a few days later I gave up. I think part of the problem is the packaging of the activating lotion. After you use it once it is exposed to air and I think it does something to it. The second and third time I used it the color had a greenish hue. There were no applicators which were supposed to be in the box. The packaging did not look tampered with but the wax strips looked old and I did not dare use them. I was afraid they would rip off my skin. I will not order again. It ended up costing me nearly $18.00 for product and shipping. Not worth the price, too messy and missing parts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Roux for a year now...but no more.  I hated how runny it was and it seems to bleed through on my skin more than stay in my actual brow hair.  With this Godefrey, I&#x27;m telling you - I have brows I never knew were there!!! I love it.  I wished i had gone a shade lighter, but I&#x27;ll take it.  I got the medium brown and have blonde hair. It made them pretty dark, so I&#x27;m going to try to remove it sooner the next time.  Gotta try this stuf.</li>
            <li> Graying brows are tough to treat. this non toxic formula goes on easy and fast- tints the hair and leaves just a bit of skin tint to HELP fill in the look of the brow.Do be careful applying on to browline for that reason. Lasts a couple of weeks, better than salon treatments.</li>
            <li> Finally I don&#x27;t have to spend too much time working on my eyebrows in the morning :-).  Great time saver and natural looking! As I get older (I&#x27;m 56), I noticed that my eyebrows have slowly become sparse. Bought the Medium Brown 2 times now and it&#x27;s the right shade for me. I use only 1/2 of a capsule with each application. At first I would use one whole capsule but ended up with a lot of leftover tint that would go to waste.  This saves some $s too. I do one brow at a time, following the directions, until I&#x27;m happy with the color before doing the other brow. It does stain the skin so be mindful of that. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give a 5 star is because although the box says it&#x27;s good for 6 weeks, in my case I have to re-do every 2-3 weeks. I don&#x27;t want to go too dark and I&#x27;d look like Elvira :-) so I go easy on it. Otherwise, great product and I will continue to buy it until I find something else better.</li>
            <li> The instructions were easy to follow and there was no mess.  It works just as well as going to a salon/spa.  So, I can do it myself and save some money.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Tried the medium brown (I&#x27;m fair skinned with graying, med brown hair). The instructions say to leave on from 1 -2 minutes. After application, left product on 1 minute. Came out a really dark brown. Still too dark after 3 days. In my case, more like Mommy Dearest than Groucho. Even my husband is complaining.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I spent too much time on the application before I started the timing. But then there should be a warning about that.&lt;br /&gt;Will order again but will try the light brown. Otherwise, was easy enough to use.&lt;br /&gt;Any tips for lightening? I thought of bleaching, but am afraid of more unwanted results.</li>
            <li> Pretty easy process - I wish this lasted a whole month - but it of course eventually fades when you wash your face, etc.... the color is great for my dirty blonde hair color.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as described and easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Just apply for two minutes better than tatto or going to salon&lt;br /&gt;Save your money</li>
            <li> After having my eyebrows professionally dyed, I decided to try it myself.  I found a dye at a beauty supply store but the box contained 30 applications - enough to last 10 years.  I found this product online and it is so simple to use - looks natural not dyed.  I use the medium brown (I have dark blonde hair and it&#x27;s perfect).    I would recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> MY NEW FAVORITE BEAUTY TOOL..EASY TO USE AND NOT EXPENSIVE!  I HAVE TO RE-APPLY EVERY 4 WEEKS BUT ITS BETTER THAN A SALON BECAUSE THAT IS $15 EVERY TIME, SO GLAD I TOOK A CHANCE AND DID IT MYSELF</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time, with no damage! Came with easy to read directions and was easy to use, the color doesnt stay really after 3 weeks, which i expected, so i still give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> It darkens my eyebrows well.  I put Vaseline below my eyebrows when applying it and leave it on much longer than the suggested time, usually at least ten minutes.  I does not lst as long as they say it should.  I do like it though.</li>
            <li> As someone who has blonde eyebrows (and dyed red hair) I&#x27;ve had to put brow powder on every single day.  Very annoying.&lt;br /&gt;So thank you Godefroy for this eyebrow tinting kit!!!  It has made my life so much easier, let me tell you.  I used the med brown color, and it was a piece of cake to apply.  You mix the powder and liquid together, spread it on your brows for 2 minutes, wash it off, and voila..6 weeks of tinted brows!  Be as clean as you can when putting it on to avoid stains, and if you double up on it to increase pigmentation, just be aware that it comes out very dark, like almost black.  It will fade to a more natural color if you do that. And any stains will only last for a day.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and hope it&#x27;s never ever discontinued.  (You hear that Godefroy?!)</li>
            <li> This is a simple, easy to use product.  It does exactly what it says it does and lasts (almost) as long as it says it does - 6 weeks.  I am pleased.  Only caution is that I do think that the products run a tad dark.  The Medium brown is darker than I expected but still reasonable.  Am planning to buy more.</li>
            <li> It does what it promises. I have light eyebrows. I changed my hair color darker, so I needed add some color to my brows. It did what I wanted. I used medium brown kit. Kit lasted a long time. (5 applications). You need to reapply every 6 weeks. Not bad!</li>
            <li> Purchased Jet black eyebrow tint. I am african american, with naturally 1b hair color (off black). The jet black color was not too dark for my eybrows. very easy application- my eyebrows came out wonderfully ! The only problem is that its not long lasting That&#x27;s the reason for my 4 stars instead of 5 :( . mine usually lasts 7-10 days..Overall great product.</li>
            <li> I have medium brown hair and have always had sparse brows.  Tried this and love the results!  The medium brown was too dark, so I mix it 50/50 with light brown, apply with a small bristled dental pick, and leave it on for 2 to 2.5 minutes.  Perfect!  the color lasts about 3 weeks.  I like to do this a couple of days before waxing so I can see where each hair is.</li>
            <li> I just want to give everyone a friendly warning: This product came out MUCH darker than the little picture of the eyebrows on the box indicate it will. I used that picture on the box, as well as the product&#x27;s recommendation to use this shade for red hair and fair to medium skin tone, when I bought \\&quot;medium brown\\&quot;. My eyebrows came out much closer to the shade on the \\&quot;dark brown\\&quot; box, to the point where I checked the box 3 times to be sure I bought \\&quot;medium brown\\&quot;. I am now sitting here with body hair bleaching solution on my brows trying to correct this. :(  So please, if you decide to order this product, order a shade lighter than you want your brows to turn out, or don&#x27;t order it. You *cannot* trust the eyebrow shade on the box!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m of the age when a few gray hairs are creeping into my eyebrows!  As I&#x27;ve aged my eyebrows have faded and faded and I kept using various eyebrow pencils hoping to find something that didn&#x27;t look too freakish (without much luck I might add).  So, when I read the reviews here I decided to give it a try.  It&#x27;s very easy to use, it works as it states it will.  It didn&#x27;t cover all the gray hairs but I didn&#x27;t want to keep putting it back on over and over.  I will say that the color is a bit darker than I expected - I have medium brown hair and my eyebrows are a shade darker.  It&#x27;s not unpleasant and I think part of the adjustment is going from none to WHOA there are eyebrows!  So, be prepared if its been awhile since you&#x27;ve seen a lot of eyebrow!  I thought mine were thinning but that wasn&#x27;t the problem... lack of color was... I found my answer - give it a try, I will keep using it to be sure!  Oh, and like a couple of others here I only used 1/2 or less of the capsule and had plenty of mix left over.</li>
            <li> I have fairly dark eyebrows but they are sparse in one area and they could use a little more definition.  I have a fair to med complexion and brown/frosted hair and I generally use dark brown eyeliner.  The med brown was absolutely perfect.  I thought it was very easy to apply.  I followed the directions as provided and was happy to see that the applications are in gel caps so that you don&#x27;t have much waste.  I will update when I get an idea of how long it lasts, but for now, I&#x27;m tickled not to have to get out my magnifying mirror to fill in and shape my eyebrows.  I&#x27;ll probably continue to use clear hair setting gel and a brow brush to shape, but it isn&#x27;t going to make a big difference until the dye wears off.&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m going to look for their eyelash curling product...</li>
            <li> My eyebrows look normal now, two weeks later.  I must have left the product on for too long.  I will try less time next time</li>
            <li> I have bleach blonde eyebrows &amp; lashes, but over the years my hair has darkened to ash brown. Every time a salon colors my brows when they do my hair, it seems to wash right off. I saw this product and figured I had nothing to lose! I applied Aquaphor (like petroleum jelly) above &amp; below my brows just in case it was runny. I had no problems with the directions or product. I had success in ONE MINUTE! For pennies on the dollar of what a salon charges. I am now on week THREE with ZERO fading!!! Can we say, \\&quot;thrilled\\&quot;!!</li>
            <li> Really easy to use and colors lasts.  I had been going every 8-12 weeks to get my eyebrows tinted and waxed at 40 dollars a visit it adds up.  I tried this product and LOVE It - it&#x27;s the same color my lady used before. Applying the product took getting use to - make sure you use vasoline around ares you don&#x27;t want colored and I found it easier to apply w/ a q-tip. My eyesbrows turn blonde so I use the medium brown and get a great color. I only leave it on for 2-3 minutes and it lasts for 3 months between coloring.  Love it - and wish I would have found it sooner.</li>
            <li> easy to use, its a great product, and you save the trip to the cosmetic. Works great on grey eyebrow</li>
            <li> I ordered this on July 13, 2013 but did not open it until today as I had a back up supply.  When I was assembling the dye I discovered that the company had completely neglected to include the capsules  of dye itself, rendering the entire purchase useless.  I can find no contact # or e address so I&#x27;m just out the $$ plus have faded eyebrows and must resort to an eyebrow pencil or brush while on a trip.  This is not the first time this company has messed up an order.  The first time the box arrived uncushioned and crushed with several capsules not useable.  Watch these people.  Their product is good but their quality over sight is abysmal.</li>
            <li> The longest this tint last on the eyebrow is 1 week and about 4 days. Have to reapply. Does looks nice when applied,but does not last as long as advertised.</li>
            <li> I ordered medium brown. It said medium brown on the box but it was black when I washed it off. I look ridiculous now!</li>
            <li> I gave this tint 5 stars.  For me it worked well.  I left it on for 2 minutes.  The time varies for different brow needs.  Some only need it on for a shorter period of time.  Just follow instructions and you should be very happy with results.  Do one brow at a time as it is important not to get this gel in your eyes. I have dark brown brows and have a white spot on them since my 20&#x27;s and nothing covered the imperfection but this product.  It last for me just under 4  weeks.</li>
            <li> I had been getting my eyebrows tinted for years at a hair salon, but now I do it at home with this product and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> As soon as I finished the 30 seconds it took to apply and complete my eyebrow enhancement, my grayling thin eyebrows became youthful looking and face framing.  My daughter noticed something had changed for the better but couldn&#x27;t figure out what it was.  So happy I found this product.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  Easy to use and works fast.  Works perfectly and i would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, except I purchased a good artist&#x27;s brush and worked just great. I like the kind of brow dye that you mix the 2 ingredients together then apply to brow. If you are going to continue to dye your brow, purchase the stain remover offered online. It works beautifully.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews about the browns not lasting as long as the black but its still good.  I found myself reapplying the tint once a week because it faded so fast.</li>
            <li> I love this product as it is simple to use and for me, very effective.  I have very light blond eyebrows and this product darkens them exactly right so I don&#x27;t have to worry with eyebrow pencil or other products.  It doesn&#x27;t last six weeks  but does keep my eyebrows darkened for about three weeks at a time.</li>
            <li> I have used a different product purchased at Sally&#x27;s and this was much easier to use. The directions are easy to follow and it only takes a few minutes from start to finish tinting your brows. This product is NOT for use on eye lashes!</li>
            <li> Before I started using this product 2 years ago, I colored my brows with a pencil every single day for 6 years. I have naturally strawberry blonde hair and white-blond eyelashes and eyebrows. I actually feared social events that involved swimming, sweating or any kind of make-over because I would have to worry about my eyebrow color coming off! Over time, my body permanently adjusted itself to never sleep with my eyebrows touching my pillows so that if I was at a sleepover I could wake up with eyebrows still on my face. HOW DUMB! A couple years into college I did some research about dyeing my brows and I took a leap with Godefroy eyebrow tint. I no longer have to worry about my eyebrows wearing off or looking unnatural. I gained about 10-15 minutes back in my morning routine. I am so happy. It took me a couple tries to figure out the timing, though. To lighten up any brows that look too dark, I always take an unused toothbrush and lightly scrub my brows with Suave shampoo. Works instantly without much hassle. I hope this product never discontinues because I will be using it for life.</li>
            <li> This product works awesome, very happy with results!&lt;br /&gt;Eyebrows stayed nice and dark for at least a month!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will continue to buy!&lt;br /&gt;(make sure to stay in line of eyebrows it will stain your skin!)</li>
            <li> This product saves me so much time in the morning!!  I am blonde and my eyebrows are invisible unless I fill them in with something.  For years I have been doing pencil or other color in the morning and takes forever.&lt;br /&gt;This dye worked amazing and lasts me about 1 month before I have to reapply.  I don&#x27;t use the wooden sticks that come in the box to apply - I use a mascara wand.  I leave on about 2 minutes then wipe off with water and see if I need to go darker.&lt;br /&gt;I found out the first time I used this that when I am done if I don&#x27;t completely wipe it with soap and water they will continue getting darker after you are done, so I recommend using soap with water on them when you are finished to stop the dying process.</li>
            <li> I was really sick of using eyebrow pencil on my graying eyebrows and having it not last through the day.  It has been 3+ weeks since I used this brow tint and they still look good.  The only thing bad I can think of is that each capsule has too much dye for one brow tint (I have been trying to think of a way to use one half capsule at a time).  I would definitely recommend this product especially if you have graying brows.</li>
            <li> This product is ok, not hard to apply. If the dye get on the skin it will stick for about 24 hours and wears off in about a week.</li>
            <li> I have really light thin eyebrows and I&#x27;ve always wanted nice full eyebrows and now I have them!! Its amazing the difference it makes and to think it only takes a few mins. I only used a fourth of the capsule powder and a pea sized drop of the developer cream and I had more than enough for both eyebrows. I would recommend this product to everyone!! The only down side is that ur new awesome eyebrows start to fade after 3 weeks or so but that&#x27;s not that big of a deal to me since I just mix a bit more dye and mins later I have great eyebrows again! I love this product!! I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without it lol :D</li>
            <li> Was looking for something just for eyebrows and purchased the medium brown inspite of some negative reviews. I don&#x27;t know why anyone would rate this product anything but wonderful. It covered my grays with two applications and left my eyebrows medium brown as I wanted. Will continue to buy again. Has enough for more than 4 applications. Only really have to use half a capsule instead of the whole thing. Will definitely buy again and again.</li>
            <li> This eyebrow dye works as described. Takes only a few minutes and color lasts for weeks! Best eyebrow dye I have used so far. Also, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> OMG where has this product been all my life.  So simple so easy so cost effective and so natural looking.</li>
            <li> totally worth the money, but i would say you need to retouch every 2 weeks, which is no big deal - one box goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Great price.  Its a little green at first, but color balances out after a day or two.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have bought these previously and they were great. My daughter and I both use these to tint our eyebrows.  The developer on this batch/purchase seemed to have dried up.</li>
            <li> I have very thin eyebrows that I hate. I grow up in the 70&#x27;s and over tweezed. The first thing I would do when I woke up is go to the vanity to use my eyebrow pencil.I tried this eyebrow tint and was thrilled with the result. You have to follow the directions carefully. I used vaseline to isolate just the brow, I brushed the product on my brow line and removed after the recommended time. It is a little dark at first but fades slightly. I don&#x27;t need to use eyebrow pencil at all. It has been about a month since I first applied and I am just ready to re do them. You get 4 applications with one box. You can find you tube videos to show you exactly how to apply.</li>
            <li> I have strawberry blonde hair and get my eye brows tinted on a regular basis at salons - always using &amp;#34;Medium Brown.&amp;#34; This brand&#x27;s Medium Brown also says it is suitable for red heads. IT IS NOT. I used this product and the color is almost deep olive. I&#x27;ve been using peroxide cream and clarifying shampoo to lighten the color this afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this product for anyone looking to darken eyebrows if you&#x27;re blonde, strawberry blonde looking for a natural match.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Had good results tinting my &#x27;white&#x27; brows to match my haor color. I&#x27;ll use it all the time now.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this as I have never dyed my eyebrows before.  I was surprised how easy it was and how little time it took.  There was no mess and no dye residue on my skin.  I kept it on for the recommended time and found the shade I picked, medium brown, to be perfect for me.  I did it the night before I left for a cruise.  It&#x27;s been 12 days now, with daily swims in the sea, and showers, and yet the shade is still holding strong.  I&#x27;m very excited that there are three more applications making the whole beauty process one of the cheapest I have done.  I  normally have to pay $25 each time I go to the eyebrow centre so this box of four applications is a true bargin with the same, if not better, professional results.  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and did the job.  I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Use an eyebrow brush to distribute the dye so it penetrates the hairs of the eyebrow</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I have been using it for a few years now and can&#x27;t be without it.  The color lasts a long time and once you get a good method down, it&#x27;s fast and easy.  Medium brown can be almost black, depending how you mix it, so be careful.  It depends on how much of the activator you mix in and how long you leave it on.  You can vary the color greatly by just changing these.  More activator waters the color powder down more and you get a lighter brown.  Leave it on shorter time, and it&#x27;s lighter, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;Throw out the wooden applicator&lt;br /&gt;Do not use Vaseline to mask the area around your eyebrows&lt;br /&gt;Basically, throw out their directions completely.  They suck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead:&lt;br /&gt;Buy a nice quality small, round tipped paint brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a handful of Q tips and water on hand: ( Bathroom sink)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut open the little capsule and I have another tiny jar with a lid that I empty the powder capsules into.  It&#x27;s easier to control how much to &#x27;tap&#x27; into the mixing cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When mixing, I like mine very dark brown, so I do not use the 50/50 activator and color powder.  I use a lot less activator and get a thicker, darker, more intense color mix.  Depends on what color you want. Play with the ratios.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paint it on your eyebrows with the paintbrush. If you go outside the lines, it&#x27;s ok. It will make contact with your skin and you are basically painting it on thick, down to the skin. Just be sure that during the next step you are careful about cleaning up the edges.  It will come off your skin within a couple days anyway, and it makes my brows look thicker.  Also, in order to get those grays to take color, they have to be completely submerged in the color.  They are just super stubborn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, wet the Q-tips and go around the outside of the brow edges, removing the excess to get the exact shape you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to repeat the last couple steps 2 or 3 times to get them perfect, but it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I also leave it on for 5-10 minutes.  2 or 3 minutes is not nearly long enough to get the few grays.&lt;br /&gt;Wipe it off with a wet washcloth.  Repeat if necessary if you didn&#x27;t get it dark enough or grays didn&#x27;t cover.s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I also leave it on for 5-10 minutes.  2 or 3 minutes is not nearly long enough to get the few grays.&lt;br /&gt;Wipe it off with a wet washcloth.  Repeat if necessary if you didn&#x27;t get it dark enough or grays didn&#x27;t cover.</li>
            <li> Quick easy and a lot less expensive then at the salon. This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased it. Wonderful.</li>
            <li> This products USED to be A-1....for some reason the quality is gone. The &amp;#34;medium-brown&#x27; is (very) light brown.....there was 1 applicator stick not 4 as the package indicates (another package I received only had one capsule!)....and it doesn&#x27;t even last 3-4 weeks!  Its so light it&#x27;s an every week process- who has the time?  I order 3-4 boxes at a time....what a waste.&lt;br /&gt; Do not know what happened to the quality- maybe Godefroy should look at quality control.&lt;br /&gt; Thanks for listening.&lt;br /&gt;DMW</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have very bleached out eyebrows. So a few minutes with this product and I&#x27;m set for weeks.  No more filling in with eyebrow pencils and stuff. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST do it yourself kit. One kit lasted me 1.5 years. You can use the kit for 8 applications and the color lasts about 2 months...I have dark brown hair and Medium Brown color is perfect. Just make sure you mix it really well and don&#x27;t leave on too long &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This was an easy application with great results.&lt;br /&gt;Once I realized that I could get 2 applications out of each capsule I was a happy customer. The results on my clients were great and they left happy.&lt;br /&gt;The effects lasted about 3-4 weeks which made them and me even happier.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely will recommend and purchase again.</li>
            <li> This tint is great.  Easy to use and does a perfect job.  I have very thin ad light eyebrows and this tint works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great eyebrow tint.  Due to age related lightening of my eyebrows, I was needing to use more and more eyebrow pencil/powder so my brows would be visible.  I heard about Godefroy tint and hesitantly gave it a try.  It works beautifully to restore color to my faded brows.  I leave the tint on for only 1&amp;1/2  minutes per brow and the color last about 4 weeks.  This is the only eyebrow tint I have used, so I can&#x27;t compare to other brands.  Also, I have found that I need only 1/2 capsule for both brows, so a box will last me longer.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Provides good coverage. Probably doesn&#x27;t last six weeks for me, but I&#x27;m older and just use it as needed.</li>
            <li> great product. Its very easy to use and worked great. The procedure and product are exactly what I was looking for. You mix a very small amount of dye and put it on your eyebrow and only wait 2-3 min and wipe off. I&#x27;ll be ordering this again!!</li>
            <li> The first day it was too dark, then it was good for a few days. But after a week or so it started bleaching out and became reddish, until it faded out altogether. It could be because of my face wash or something, but needless to say, the product didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so thankful I found this product. Its much cheaper than going to the salon &amp; you have \\&quot;control\\&quot; over the results.</li>
            <li> I waited two weeks after I dyed my eyebrows to make the review, to see if the dye would fade.  It has not faded at all and my eyebrows look perfect.  I never thought I would say that.  I didn&#x27;t know how terrible my eyebrows looked until they looked good again.  Below are the things I did that weren&#x27;t included in the instructions to get optimal results.      First, this is an excellent eyebrow dye.  I like it better than Roux, and you also can&#x27;t beat Godefroy&#x27;s price.  One reviewer said it didn&#x27;t work on any of her clients.  I&#x27;m surprised because a professional should know that everyone is different.  Some people are resistant to dyes and exceptions to the general rule should be made.  One size does not fit all.  Personally, I am resistant to hair dye.  I buy professional color and leave it on my hair for an hour because I also have resistant gray hair.  This is the reason why I don&#x27;t go to the stylist.  It always turned out to be a waste of money to get my hair colored.  You know your hair best.  What works for one does not work for all.  I took resistance into consideration when I did my eyebrows too.      The first suggestion I have before you use this product is to let your eyebrows grow in, even if you only get sparse hairs here and there.  Do not touch your eyebrows for a month or two, depending on how long it takes for whatever is going to come in to come in.  This is very important, especially for people who have sparse eyebrows due to years of over tweezing.  Even if no tweezing for one to two months looks bad, leave it alone.  It is worth it in the end.      Okay, all the hairs are in, and some are very light (especially the ones that grew back)  At that moment I have a mess for eyebrows, a terrible shape, and more than one color.  On to using the dye.  I would recommend not going out the day you dye your eyebrows, especially if you use my suggestions.  My eyebrows were very dark for the first couple of days.  I didn&#x27;t use the vaseline that was suggested inthe instructions.  I wanted to be in total control of how my eyebrows would be shaped, and felt that the vaseline would get in the way of that.     I took the stick and put the dye on one eyebrow.  Go slowly and let the artist in you come out.  It is like you are drawing a picture.  With the stick, reshape your eyebrow with the dye into the shape that you want.  Put the dye on the light sparse hairs too and slowly draw your eyebrow back.  Go the opposite way too like the directions state.  Leave on two minutes.  Wipe everything off with a wet paper towel.  I could tell right then and there that I did not like the results, but I did the other eye for two minutes just so they would both be on for the same amount of time.  My eyebrows were still too light, and those sparse light hairs were too light.  On to round two.  I wiped with a dry tissue to make sure that my brows were not damp.  This time I left the dye on my eye for three minutes.  Took the dye off with the wet paper towel.  Perfect!  All hairs were the same color and my eyebrows were full.  My eyebrows were also very dark and there was some dye on my skin, but at least I had eyebrows again.  Did the second eye also for three minutes.    A couple of hours later, I tweezed.  Verrrry slowly I might add.  I tweezed into the shape I wanted to have.  Go slow and take your time.  Concentrate on what you want for an eyebrow.  So my eyebrows were tweezed and shaped but still very dark.  I washed my face very well and they were still dark.  The next day I washed my face again and the brows lightened up a little.  The day after, washed face and eyebrows were perfect.  It took about three days to get the dye off the skin and the color to be the color it was supposed to be.  It&#x27;s now two weeks later and I will tweeze again.  Tweezing is very easy now because what grows in is lighter than the rest of my eyebrow.  The color is still on and my brows look VERY natural.  You would never know that I dyed my brows or that I hadsparse hairs at one time.  I look at my eyebrows in the mirror and I can&#x27;t believe that they \\&quot;came back.\\&quot;  To me they are perfect.      I don&#x27;t know when I will have to dye them again.  But when I do, I will do it a week or so before something important comes up.  I will allow a week for the color to calm down.  I will still use the same method.  Two minutes on, wipe off, three minutes on, wipe off.  Eyebrow makeup has gotten thrown out.  I don&#x27;t have a need for it any more.  Some people said there is waste with the dye because you mix more than you need.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s wasteful because I did and will continue to do two applications.  Play around with the dye and experiment.  You don&#x27;t have to follow the instructions verbatim.  You know your hair best and what works and doesn&#x27;t work for you.  You also know if your hair is resistant to perms, dyes, etc.  Chances are if your hair doesn&#x27;t behave, your eyebrows won&#x27;t either.  That&#x27;s when you have to make your own instructions to tweak it so it&#x27;s right for you.</li>
            <li> I paid $30 to have my eyebrows tinted in a salon, and I ended up looking like Groucho Marx! Doing it myself, I can learn from previous experiences, and it&#x27;s only $1-2 per application. The dye comes as a powder in a capsule that you open and mix with a lotion. I&#x27;ve discovered you don&#x27;t need the whole capsule, you can pour in half, close it back up, and you&#x27;ve doubled your number of applications, and halved your price! The directions say to use Vaseline on the areas you don&#x27;t want tinted- skip this. It&#x27;s just messy, and if you do get the product in the wrong spot, just wipe off with a tissue. The product says it&#x27;s for medium brown, but it will be anywhere from light brown to black depending on how long you leave it on. Take it off a bit early, and if you want to go darker, re-apply. It&#x27;s easy to go darker, but impossible to go lighter!! If you do end up too dark (as I was after the salon) try tweezing into a thinner shape, and trimming the longer hairs. Obviously, go slow, don&#x27;t overdo this or you&#x27;ll look even worse, but it can help. Also, I think it might continue getting slightly darker after it&#x27;s wiped off, so aim for a light shade. I may be wrong here, more experience will help. But it&#x27;s so much cheaper than having it done professionally, and looks so much cleaner and more natural than makeup! I love my tinted eyebrows!!</li>
            <li> I remember looking in drugstores for such an item and could not find it.  Since I found this product, I no longer have to spend the money in the salons to darken my eye brows.  It is very simple and easy to use and just takes a few minutes. I will definately buy it again.</li>
            <li> The product is great, but the parcel was totally damaged and one bottle was broken!!!</li>
            <li> We aged and all kinds strange things happen.  I lost my eyebrows one morning - one day they were there and one day they were gone.  Well, not totally, but I definitely needed help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried some re-grow products that we worthless and my neighbor suggested getting some type of dye or long lasting eyebrow pencil.  After much looking found Godefroy and ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the cap was damaged in transit and leaked all over the packaging material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaint was answered promptly and received a full refund.</li>
            <li> Love product&lt;br /&gt;It does dye your skin but one quick scrub and the problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;Great solution for those who have light brow&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the product with varying time and 4 minutes last time makes me happy.</li>
            <li> This is fairly easy to use, and comes with everything you need to mix and apply. I found the medium brown color was perfect for my medium auburn hair color, not any lighter or darker than expected, and looked very natural after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a few things you should be aware of when purchasing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It does kind of stain the skin under your eyebrow even if you put vaseline around the brow, so when you first tint, it will look darker and more &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; than it will after a few days of face washing. I would suggest applying it on a day off because of this, as it can look a little extreme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Once the tint has settled, it lasts about half as long as advertised, so you have about 3 weeks before the color is no longer noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get more use out of the capsules by cutting them in half and mixing sparingly, but even so, I think it&#x27;s a good product and the results are natural-looking and help me feel defined.</li>
            <li> Works great, I never expected such great results so fast. My brows now look perfect and it only took about five minutes total. I will buy again. Also, I used half a capsule and the wood applicator and got amazing results.</li>
            <li> I was disatisfied with this purchase. My eyebrows are light brown and I wanted to darkened them to the medium brown tint that says on the box. When I started to open the capsules the powder was very messy. I left on the dye for less than a min and it turned my eyebrows BLACK. NOT happy had to purchase another product to strip off the BLACK. Waist of time and money. This stains your skin and it&#x27;s hard to wash off. NEVER purchashing this again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years and buying it at a local beauty shop.  When they went out of business I went online and found to my delight I could continue using this product and cost was better too.</li>
            <li> This seems to work well, even though I have to leave on for twice the time that the instruction say to.  The best part is for the next month I have to use vey little brow makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 6-8 years and it really does the job! I would recommend getting a shade or two lighter than your natural brow color if you are using it (as I was) to tint those pesky gray/white hairs that crop up in the middle of our dark brows as we age. They tend to be resistant to the dye, so you&#x27;ll have to leave on the application for the maximum allowable time, and if you do that without using a lighter shade, the colored brow hairs will turn darker than you would probably desire.&lt;br /&gt;The reason for Four Stars instead of Five??  I think the capsules contain 2-3 times as much dye powder as is necessary for an adequate application (unless your brows are EXTREMELY thick) - the first few times I used the Godefroy Tint, I threw away almost twice the amount than I actually needed.  My recommendation: use the full amount the first  time and after that, adjust the amount of powder you remove from the capsule. Tapping out the correct amount of liquid developer is easy enough - just be sure you mix in enough to make it spreadable on your brows, but not too much or the dye will run down your face!</li>
            <li> Works as described. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> The tint is very good color. It is really long lasting and very good price. It did not disappear after my monthly vacation in the sun in Spain.  Great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over 50 and the gray in my brows is more and more obvious. This is the second purchase.  The capsule doesn&#x27;t open for me. So I very carefully put a pin size or larger hole in the bottom of the capsule and carefully squeeze/empty the powder into a lidded container.  I only use half or less of that capsule powder per application because I don&#x27;t need all of what&#x27;s in a single capsule to cover my eyebrows ... mine are thin.  I guess on how much liquid solution to put with it.  I put Vaseline around my brow line ... above and below ... then put the mixed dye on my brows.  After 5 minutes I wipe it all off and then using soap to wipe again.  I always do this the night before and never before going out for the day.  If I missed and some of the dye dyes my skin under my brow hair I can doctor it up so it looks natural.  We woman do what we have to do right.  So far for 8 months now it works fine and I only have to use very little brow pencil.  I like not having to worry about putting a lot of makeup on so a little mascara, lipstick/gloss and I&#x27;m ready to go out.</li>
            <li> After paying to have this done previously, I was wondering if there was a way I could color my eyebrows at home.  This seemed like a good solution.  The product is easy to mix and use although I probably could have gotten a shade lighter but after allowing it to develop I had visible eyebrows again.  Okay they are a bit darker than they should be but that darkness soon faded (four days) and now I have visbile, properly shaded eyebrows.  A true bargain if you are daring enough to try this at home. I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for tinting eyebrows for months and beats any other products. You have to use it every two weeks. This can last upto 3 months.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a medium brown color, but this one is dark dark dark! I hated it, I paid too much for this.</li>
            <li> It covers the gray. I wish I would have done this years ago instead of plucking out the gray hairs ,</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for 2 years. It bets going to a salon. However, only put on for 1 minute at a time and then remove to check darkness. I have light brown eyebrows and it turns them darker within 1 minute tops! It helped me to watch you tube videos on it before I tried it the first time.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and works well.  I wouild recommend for anyone who is losing color to their eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Love this!  I have pretty light brows.  The color really makes my eyes look nice.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I had my brows professionally tinted about a month ago and loved it so much, I wanted to continue tinting them but on my own. I have really dark brown hair (almost black, but still brown) and I look good with dark brown brows - NOT black. I ordered &#x27;Medium Brown&#x27; tint after reading the reviews that the color looked black...they were right!! I left the tint on for 2 minutes (the max time directed) and my eyebrows are BLACK! I didn&#x27;t think they would turn jet black since the capsules are brown, but they did (I&#x27;m sure they will fade soon enough). Next time I tint my brows, I will leave the tint on for only 30 seconds to see if I get brown instead of black. If not, I will have to find a new brow tinting kit. Overall, it was easy to use, you get 4 applications, the dye obviously works and you cant mess up. I gave it 4 stars because of the color turning out black. If you dont want really dark brows, I wouldn&#x27;t order this kit and if you do order, I would leave the tint on for a maximum of 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it claims. It&#x27;s quick and easy to apply-I haven&#x27;t found anything that works this well.</li>
            <li> Long lasting.  Got the medium brown and it was a little darker than anticipated.  I was worried it would be too light and left it on for the full amount of time recommended.  Next time I&#x27;ll back off the time a bit.</li>
            <li> The package was missing 3 of its mixing/applicator sticks, and most of the developer had been used up. Someone had used most of this already. I didn&#x27;t notice this until I was actually ready to use the product, so it was too late to return it or get a refund.</li>
            <li> If I knew how easy it was to tint my own brows I could have been saving a ton of money! Easy to follow directions. Great product. Arrived on time and without issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times now and it&#x27;s excellent. I often alternate between medium brown and dark as I change my hair color quite frequently and this certainly makes a world of difference. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who wants to put more emphasis on their eyebrows and has medium to dark hair.</li>
            <li> Received it quickly.  It worked well.  I was very  very careful.  I&#x27;m glad the shade wasn&#x27;t any darker.  I try to just get the gray ones.  I finally just had to pluck one out.  I didn&#x27;t have any trouble with it getting on my skin, but IWas very careful.</li>
            <li> Love this. I don&#x27;t have much in the way of eyebrows (hypothyroid). What a difference! I feel more confident going without make-up, at least I have eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and  much cheaper than the  beauty supply store product. It lasted about a week before it started to fade and the gray brows started to show.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Good product.  it works.  need to leave it on a bit longer than the directions say.  I have to reuse every 3 weeks but I&amp;#34;m so glad I found this.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  It is pretty dark so start small and add to if you need to.  Recommend</li>
            <li> Did&#x27;nt cover gray well</li>
            <li> works great i love it</li>
            <li> Love this! After a certain age, my eyebrows started to lighten up. A woman at the make-up counter of an expensive shop once whizzed over, said &amp;#34;This will take years off your face&amp;#34; and proceeded to show me a very expensive eyebrow pencil. Bought the pencil; wish I&#x27;d kept the money because this is so much better. Yes, darkening my eyebrows gives much better definition; no, I&#x27;m not going to do that every day. This is quick: mix it up, brush it on, leave for about a minute, wipe it off. I do it right before a shower. I recommend using disposable mascara brushes (you can get them in a pack of 50, also on Amazon) rather than the stick in the package. Lasts for weeks.</li>
            <li> I gave this two stars because the color does balanace out after about a week. However, im irish, i have blonde eye brows and it turned them BLACK. Nowhere near.brown.</li>
            <li> Does and excellent job at giving color to the brows and looks natural. One of my favorites! I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I liked the medium brown eyebrow tint. I used it per direction and then reapplied for a darker effect. It&#x27;s been almost 3 weeks and they still look good - so i&#x27;m pretty happy. It&#x27;s wayyyyyy cheaper than going to a salon, I will most definitely be ordering it again. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I found that if I use a part of one of the capsules, mixed with a couple of&lt;br /&gt;drops of the liquid gel, it does a great job for no more eyebrows than I have.  I can then&lt;br /&gt;make it last longer.  It works great and last for 4 to 6 weeks before I need to repeat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I discovered this product.  For me, it works great and saves me from paying big bucks to have my eyebrows dyed by a professional.  It last about two weeks for me.  I have started using half a capsule of dye each time since it&#x27;s more than enough for me.</li>
            <li> I have quite sparse, fair eyebrows and this product will easily tint them so they are visible.  There is enough powder in the capsules for three tintings for my thin brows, so I store the extra for use the next couple times.  I have a very small sample jar from some other product in which I store the extra.  I also leave the paste on for quite a long time, since I&#x27;m only tinting a few hairs!  With thicker brows, you might want to rinse off the paste more quickly.  I use an old mascara brush to apply the paste, which I find gives me more control than using the small brush included in the kit.  I use the small brush to mix the paste and apply it to the mascara brush bristles.  I also, very carefully, use the tint on my eyelashes (which are also fair and sparse!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A warning: the powder will permanently stain Corian countertops, as I learned when I spilled a small amount on my bathroom vanity.  I now spread newspaper to cover the vanity when I do my eyes.  Using warm water and soap to clean the &amp;#34;tools&amp;#34; seems to prevent the staining of the porcelain sink, but the countertop has small brown spots now... :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is effective and very easy to use.  I used Swiss O&#x27;Par in the past, and this is much simpler and equally effective.</li>
            <li> As I am a man who has turned gray, I noticed that the celebrities on TV are gray with dark eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;This tint on my eyebrows lasts for weeks and looks great.</li>
            <li> Rarely have I been so satisfied with a purchase. My hairdresser used to color my brows when tinting my hair. Always came out too light and what tint there was overlapped onto surrounding skin. Now I do it myself every few weeks with outstanding results.</li>
            <li> this was a first for me....never dyed my eyvrows,before...once i got the hang of it...it was kind f cool...seems to be keeping to its promise about lasting for at least 6 weeks...makes a difference in my appearance...and am thrilled i don&#x27;t have to use a pencil everyday......</li>
            <li> Difficult to apply with precision.  Color was good and mixing easy.</li>
            <li> I am a true fair skinned, blonde with blue eyes.  Hence,  thin and light colored eyebrows.  I do not like to wear makeup but it is the only way to get color for my brows.  Without color I appear very Plain with two blue holes in my face.  I wanted some color to the brows that I would not have to constantly draw on and not appear so blank.  I w as hoping this product would do the trick for at least a few weeks.  It washes away in about a week and a half to two weeks.  I was disappointed.  When I was a girl you could go to the corner drugstore and buy a 3 or 4 ounce bottle of brow and lash dye for a reasonable price.  What ever happened to that?  I would not recommend this product at this price.</li>
            <li> This is great and I will continue to reorder. I have had my eyebrows tattooed and it has worn off my eyebrows are very light and thin and using this makes filling them in sooooo much easier! I watched reviews on youtube and several people would say it lasted 2 weeks or so for me after 1 week I have to reapply but that&#x27;s not a problem for me since I fill my eyebrows in daily doing this once a week is nothing. If anything it makes filling them in less. Doing this allows me to just clean them up.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. So much more economical than getting a brow tint at a salon. I have been using this for over a year and have not had the problem of it not working anymore, like other reviewers reported.</li>
            <li> Love this tint.  I have very light eyebrows and had been using an eyebrow pencil.  This totally eliminated any need for anything to darken the brows.</li>
            <li> I love this product :) This is my second order. I can not be without it. It is easy to apply looks great, the only thing I have to say that the product claims it will last 6 weeks, and I really am lucky if it lasts two, but other than that I love it.</li>
            <li> I was very nervous to use this product the first time but I have to say its so easy and makes such a stunning difference. I definitely recommend using the Vaseline around the perimeter to keep the color in the right spot. I have natural blonde hair and this medium color looks great! I&#x27;ve become a regular tinter with this product!</li>
            <li> Tried this on Saturday for the first time and am, so far, pleased with the results. At first, I didn&#x27;t leave the initial dye on long enough, and ended up doing each brow twice. I think I&#x27;d stick with this color and not go darker. I also think I&#x27;ll leave it on longer in the future. I don&#x27;t yet know how long the dye will last, but if I can get even a few weeks out of the color, I think it&#x27;s worth it if I have to spend less time coloring my brows in each morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because my brows are a tad sparse, I still did some fill in with my brow pen, but did a lot less than usual because these did a good job of coloring the hair.</li>
            <li> The color was too dark and is asked for medium brown; it works great! Will make sure to get a lighter color</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Easy to use</li>
            <li> Excellent coverage for short gray hairs, I had to pluck 1 or 2 long hairs but the color last approximately 1- month.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Was so nervous to use this as I am a natural blonde! My brows were washed out from 25 years of the sun and this was a great way to restore the full color. The 1st time I left the dye for 2 minutes as instructed and I LOVED the results. A perfect medium brown. But they only lasted a week! The 2nd time I left for 4-5 minutes and got a much darker result but still extremely happy with the way it looks! These have lasted 4 weeks and counting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was insanely fast!!!! Came in 2 days!!</li>
            <li> This tint actually does cover the gray eyebrows.  I usually leave it on a little longer than the package says about two minutes longer.  It is nice to have your eyebrows back!  LOL.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I had been going to have my eyebrows professionally tinted for $20 a pop. Now I can do it at home for $2.00. The result is the same. This product is quick and easy to use. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been paying $30 plus tip to have my eyebrows tinted and I wanted to try something at home.  I read the reviews for this product and decided to try it.  I purchased the medium brown because I was afraid dark brown would be too intense.  I followed the directions but used a slanted eyebrow brush to apply the tint rather than the stick that was enclosed in the package.  The eyebrow brush gave me more control.  I did one eyebrow and only left the color on for one minute before wiping off.  There wasn&#x27;t much change so I reapplied it and left it on for a full two minutes.  I then did the other eyebrow and did the same.  I am thrilled with the results! I think they look better and more natural than when I have them done professionally and it&#x27;s a whole lot cheaper!  Even if I have to reapply every two weeks, it&#x27;s still a bargain. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the first time using this product. I would use the eyelash tint on my eyebrows when tinting my lashes but I found it did not really color the grey. This product works and probably too well! I was not particularly careful with the application and at first looked like I had Grocho Marx eyebrows ;0). I had to really scrub the color off. Now they look perfect. The medium brown seems a bit too dark too. I will try a lighter color next time.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product but am always fighting my eyebrows color fading. This product is great and really does last</li>
            <li> I was very happy with both the results and the ease of application with the Godefroy Instant Eyebrow tint.  It&#x27;s a little dark the first couple of days, but a good color for me after that.  ( I have light brown hair. )  The color lasted less that the 28 days, but I wash my face and hair quite often.  I will be using this product again.</li>
            <li> the product is easy to use and very permanent but watch out for your color choice. I went with med brown and it came up a dark \\&quot;shoe polish\\&quot; black with that fake undertone. next time I will try for the lighter shade. I was able to adjust the color later with another product as I did not want to wait and see how fast this would fade down to something I can go outside in. but its fast to use, easy to apply. just really comes up darker than expected.</li>
            <li> This product was very easy to use.  I used the wooden sticks (supplied) to apply the product, no problem.  The timing on the charts (easy to read insert provided) was accurate for me.  My skin was not stained.  I painted the product on the lashes in the arch I wanted, and then tweezed when I was done.  Perhaps by using the orange stick I didn&#x27;t get the dye all the way down to the roots, but so what.  No one can tell...maybe I&#x27;ll have to reapply a week earlier because of that ;-).  I washed my face before using, wiped off with a damp paper towel, took a shower an hour later, and now two weeks later the product still looks good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use without any additional stuff....all you need is provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. Covers the greys that pencils don&#x27;t. Lasts 6 weeks or more. Can use the capsules for multiple uses making it an affordable option for eyebrows. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years now and always bought it from a supplier when I lived in the US.  It is an excellent product, easy to use, and lasts for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since relocating back to Canada, I had to order it through Amazon, but unfortunately the mixing lotion bottle was less than half full, which was a disappointment.  Fortunately, Amazon reimbursed me the amount and I will reorder at a future date.</li>
            <li> Takes some practice to use neatly, but this product does work well. Controlling the color is a skill that eludes me so the medium brown is a bit too dark, while the light brown is much too light (blond, actually and so useless).</li>
            <li> Great! Much easier to use that Roux tint.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years but now the tint does not last like it used to.  It used to stay on for almost two weeks but now two or three days&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;go back to your old formula, please..........or whatever</li>
            <li> I have VERY blonde eyebrows--unfortunately, they are even lighter than my hair, so I look like I&#x27;m half-dead without coloring my brows. However, I also hate the hassle of putting on eyebrow pencil or creams and have difficulty finding products I like. A few times in the past I&#x27;ve had my brows professionally colored at salons, and while I love the convenience of having dyed brows, but I&#x27;ve found that the dye starts fading fast enough that it is a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hadn&#x27;t even realized eyebrow dye was available for home use until I tried an online search, and this looked like an inexpensive option. I was a little nervous, so I followed the directions carefully, being sure to do only one brow at a time, even though I was feeling impatient to see results on both sides. I felt I had to *really* saturate my brows, despite how fine they are, to get the dye to color evenly, and as dark as I would like, and so it took me a few touchups on each side to get the right result. However, the entire process still only took a total of about 10 minutes. (I used the timer on my phone to time the process, and touchups, precisely.) I felt the final result looked as good or better as any salon job, and the price is certainly right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few more tips: Definitely smear Vaeline, Aquaphor, or another thick cream under and just above your brows to prevent your skin staining. However, even if you wash the dye off very thoroughly when done, if you&#x27;re fair-skinned with sparse/fine brows like me you&#x27;ll probably still have staining in the brow area itself. In other words, especially if you haven&#x27;t had your brows dyed before, you may look like a drag queen initially. Therefore, I use this before going to bed, then use a gentile face scrub in the morning in the shower, in order to remove a little more of the excess color. That really helps tone it down. I also use the medium brown color, though, because I want my eyebrows to be darker than my hair rather than the same shade. If you&#x27;re blonde and choose a lighter shade you might not have the same issue.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to use.  I left it on for 2 minutes the first time but it didn&#x27;t color as well, so I immediately did it again and left it on for 6 more minutes.  It worked great.  I only use about an eighth of the capsule each time and it is plenty.  I now just plan on leaving it on for 6 minutes every three or four weeks.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have 3 daughters who have fair eyebrows. Dye is easy to use and color lasts approximately 1 month. I have learned to mix a smaller amount of the dye  and reseal the casing that the color comes in so that we are able get more applications. One package  gives us 12 applications. I would highly recommend this product, great value and excellent results.</li>
            <li> I used it a few weeks ago and I have not had to pencil eyebrows on.  I am older and have almost invisible brows.  Now I have natural looking eyebrows.  Use it sparingly.  Follow the directions.</li>
            <li> This product totally lives up to expectations. I no longer have to pay for eyebrow tinting at the beauty shop.  Instructions are simple and it&#x27;s pretty hard to make a mistake if you follow the directions.</li>
            <li> Good product if you want to tint your own eyebrows. No more going to salon and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It was really easy to apply. The color is great. I wish it had more then one mixing cup, so I could just toss the used one.</li>
            <li> I just tried this dye this morning.  I left it in for 3 minutes to get the right darkness.  I thought they did the trick, but the color is just not really that nice looking.  Maybe it will change after I wash my face a few more times.  I think I might try doing the dark brown color next time to see how that works out.</li>
            <li> This stuff is somewhat easy to apply however, 2 days later it looks like you never used it at all!!! Its a total waste of money. Looks good for about 24 hours and then it&#x27;s gone. Buy something else!</li>
            <li> This is a good product and works as it states, does not seem to last very long - about 4 weeks but in my case that was a good thing since the brown is really almost a black/brown and much darker than I thought it would be.  Will reorder, but in light brown!</li>
            <li> Saves a bundle instead of having salon do this - and very easy</li>
            <li> Great coverage and long lasting</li>
            <li> You should be careful to use it. If it drop on your skin, it takes about one day to disappear!!!</li>
            <li> My eyebrows have never looked better.  Easy to use and lasts.  I have several girls at work addicted now too.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Covers the grays.</li>
            <li> Love this product just need to figure out how to use half a capsule</li>
            <li> I am reasonably happy with this product.  Doesn&#x27;t quite last 6 weeks for me...but does the job.  I can usually get away with just using half a capsule at a time...and so stretch out the number of times I can use one package for a bit more savings.</li>
            <li> This eyebrow tint worked just as promised and was so quick and easy.  I have gray hair and fair skin and the medium brown was good for me.</li>
            <li> I have very light eyebrows and this color was quite dark for me.  Doesn&#x27;t last long so no worries.  Still cheaper than the pros and easy to use.</li>
            <li> fast shipping and the product works fine except that it doesn&#x27;t last too long.  and doesn&#x27;t cover some of the pesky hard core grey hairs</li>
            <li> I thought my eyebrows were skimpier, but realized the dye I had been using just wasn&#x27;t working well.  This is really good eyebrow dye.  I don&#x27;t think it will last 6 weeks, but that&#x27;s to be expected with eyebrows.  You only need to use about 1/4-1/2 of the capsule.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with how easy this product was to use. Watch the video, it was very helpful. I bought the medium brown which I debated about because my hair color now is silver gray. It looks really good. I don&#x27;t know how long it will last, but I will continue to use this product because as pretty as my hair color is, I hate gray eyebrows. I also bought the mascara, haven&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because the \\&quot;leave on timer\\&quot; instructions should be re-done, IMO. I&#x27;m a redhead and I ordered Medium Brown. In the instructions it tells you how long to leave it on, based on your desired color. Black was 4-5 mins, Medium Brown 3-4, and light brown is 1-2. Well, to be safe I did only the 2 mins and decided to add more on if I thought it wasn&#x27;t dark enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the 2 mins was more than enough! My brows came out a very dark brown. The Good thing is that it fades rather quickly, so after about 4-5 face washes you could visibly see it getting lighter. I was pretty pleased with the results after that.</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair and tint my eyebrows regularly or else it looks like I have none. I used to live in a city where I could get this done at a salon for a reasonable price but I moved and places here want $36 for tinting. That&#x27;s ridiculous. Enter this wonderful product -- which is just what I&#x27;ve seen used at the salon. I&#x27;m VERY happy with the results. I went a little overboard the first time and did a few applications -- it gets darker even after you wash it off -- so I had quite dark brows for a few days (my fault) but now it looks great. Next time I&#x27;ll do one application and then judge the color about 30 minutes after I&#x27;ve washed it off. I&#x27;m never forking over big money to a salon again when I can use the same product at home for $2 an application.</li>
            <li> I have blonde eyebrows and my hair is light brown and blonde.  I had to shape my eyebrow daily to look defined.  Now I tint once a month and off I go in the morning.  Be sure to put tint only where you want it as it stains well.</li>
            <li> I love this product - as I am now almost 50 years old (arrrgh!) I find that my eyebrows are starting to turn white. Not grey but white. The hairs are very coarse and it takes a lot of eyebrow pencil to make them look filled in - which isn&#x27;t good. I have tried using my regular haircolor on them (which the manufacturer does NOT recommend) but it doesn&#x27;t last long enough. the Godefroy eyebrow tint works very fast (don&#x27;t over do the timing!) and it lasts a long time. It does a good job of coloring in those hard to cover coarse white hairs and makes them look very natural. I wish the coloring didn&#x27;t come in those little capsules because they can be tricky to open but if you spill a little of it, it doesn&#x27;t really matter because there is plenty of it leftover.</li>
            <li> Works good, I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have only use it once so far, and it really works great. I am glad I bought Med Brown instead of dark brown. I have very black eyebrows and they were even darker after I dye them. But after a couple days I was back to my normal color. I bought this product to dye my grays in my eyebrows. Happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I liked it but am ordering the lighter shade next time. This color is not really for blondes, unless your hair is dark blond.  Easy to use though!</li>
            <li> This Is a very quick easy method. Took me about 2 minutes each eyebrow. I wish it lasted longer but it Is the best I&#x27;ve found. Will continue to buy..</li>
            <li> Easy to use!  I have been paying big bucks to have my brows colored, this kit makes it a breeze!  Coloring them makes them appear thicker also!</li>
            <li> Test the area on your arm as directed in the instructions.  I had a severe reaction on the test after  20 hours.</li>
            <li> The result is nice but it doesn&#x27;t last more than 3 days...The colour is a bit dark, more like black than brown.But it&#x27;s not that bad</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of ordering two types of eyebrow tint,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I meant to order one eyebrow tint and one eyelash tint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bad!</li>
            <li> I use this regularly.  Very simple to use.  Perfect natural looking results.  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last long enough --- maybe a week.</li>
            <li> delivered fast and in good condition. easy to use and works faster than any other similar products i&#x27;ve tried. it did bum me out a bit, that this can&#x27;t be used on eyelashes, but that was just my lack of attention because i didn&#x27;t observe for that text at the bottom of the box in the pictures.</li>
            <li> Ordered light brown but it turned out very dark.  Also stained the skin underneath. Followed directions precisely but ended up looking like Graucho Marx!</li>
            <li> This is a great home eyebrow treatment, and the color works well for me. DO NOT APPLY AS DIRECTED. For all that is sensible and decent, read the other reviews here and apply with a clean dry mascara wand. If I had taken a photo of my brows after following the directions, well...I never would have but trust me it was hilarious/awful. Also, again per the advice on these reviews, don&#x27;t waste a whole capsule just doing two brows. I&#x27;ve used about 1/3 of a capsule this time around and it was just right. The first time when I used a whole capsule, I pawned the extra off on two friends who were here during my experiment, and even after they were done I could have dyed the brows of all the women on my street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this product again and recommend it to others, just do application research before you use it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to eyebrow tinting, so wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but now I&#x27;m hooked! I was so worried about the color, it goes on really dark, but after rinsing, it&#x27;s a perfect match. It saves me so much time vs trying to pencil in sparse areas every morning. I&#x27;m not certain that it last 6 weeks but I use a strong, detoxifying face wash that could be why for me. One time is to purchase an angled eyeliner brush. This makes the application easier and flawless. I experimented on my lashes, that I do not recommend. But on my brows I did not experience any sensitivity. The medium brown looks natural in all lighting. I was afraid it might have a funky hue in the sun but it doesn&#x27;t. Looks great.</li>
            <li> Since I had ordered this product before and had some left, it was over a month before I had to open the new product.  Alas, I ordered black and got brown. Since my hair is off-black, I was able to leave the product on for 4 minutes and it actually turns that shade of dark.  There is no red in the brown, so it work out for me.  Just saying - the wrong color was sent - but it worked out okay.</li>
            <li> My hair is dark brown (just lighter than black), and after reading the review for the \\&quot;dark brown\\&quot; dye, I ordered the medium brown. It&#x27;s just as dark as my hair, if not darker. This is the look I was initially going for but I definitely find it to be too severe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself was easy to apply and use, but if you&#x27;re actually looking for a medium brown, maybe try ordering the light brown.</li>
            <li> It worked really well.  I did learn to use it as directed and not to leave the color on longer than the directions suggested.  However, it doesn&#x27;t last more than 3 or 4 weeks.  I gave it 4 stars as I found that it didn&#x27;t work any better than the mustache and sideburn color that I can buy in CVS, Wallgreens, etc.</li>
            <li> I have very light/sparse eyebrows and have been going to the salon for tinting to the tune of $20/visit. After a bad experience with the salon owner, I decided to try this home kit myself. I was shocked as how easy and economical it is! I have dark auburn hair and used the medium brown. I&#x27;m happy with the results, though I&#x27;d be interested in experimenting with the light brown in the summer months. This will save me having to fill in my brows with a pencil every day and looks more natural as well. Great product!</li>
            <li> WOW.. this stuff works great. I tried it with my Mom. she has very grey eyebrows and mine are just starting to change. I will put up pictures and update the length of time it took to wash out. I know from the first time it was longer then 5 weeks. But I wanted to do before and aftr pictures. So stayed tuned and see how this works out</li>
            <li> Loved this product.&lt;br /&gt;It did everything it said it would do.&lt;br /&gt;Will recomend and buy it again&lt;br /&gt;Have had dark brows for a month now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this before and find that my brows look natural and that the product stays for a month or so and then needs to be retouched for the desired effect</li>
            <li> It works and is easy to apply, but it lasts about 2 weeks instead of the 6 advertised.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL, LOCALLY IT COST 3 TIMES WHAT I PAID</li>
            <li> Beats paying $20 or more per visit to have it done in a salon!  Read directions carefully on first use. But very easy and quick to use.</li>
            <li> It works:&#x27;) though u gotta watch the timing cuz it can go dark fast. If it&#x27;s not working for u then u did something wrong. Make sure u put it on the skin as if u were using a pencil to cover empty areas, but it has to go on the skin or it won&#x27;t work. I love it. I had my sis try it and she was happy smiling by herself while looking at her eyebrows. It doesn&#x27;t come off either so be really careful.</li>
            <li> My son asked me,&amp;#34;What did you do? You look 10 years younger. Gray Eyebrows take away any youthful looks,and the moment you apply this easy to use tint,you can see the change in your appearance. It is so easy to use. A little goes a long way. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have white eyebrows and eyelashes and am very fair. I was very hesitant to use this product, but decided to give it a whirl. I applied the dye (light brown)on one eyebrow only and waited just 1 minute before wiping it off. I then did the second eyebrow and waited 1 minute before wiping it off. It&#x27;s a tad too dark for my skin, but I&#x27;m sure it will fade slightly. Overall I am THRILLED to not have to mess with eyebrow pencils and assorted make-up every morning. Great product! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The tint didn&#x27;t last more than a few days to a week, not the time I expected it to last. I thought it was going to last a bit longer. Otherwise the product is easy to apply and looks good, just didn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would be free of filling in my sparce eyebrows.  Ever....but recently I started losing my lashes due to a thyroid condition and starting using a product to help them grow back.  I decided to try my brows and the hair began to fill in, but you couldn&#x27;t really see it.  I tried this product based on the great reviews and OMG I have very nice visable eyebrows.  I am an extremely happy customer, this is the first time in about 30 years I can stop filling in my brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of advise, give yourself 1-3 days before they look natural.  I looked like Joan Crawford the first day, but the 2nd day was better and by the third day they looked awesome!!  Great dye, easy to use and so worth it!</li>
            <li> The capsules are a bit of a pain to get open and I&#x27;ve gotten the dye everywhere on more than one occasion, but otherwise it&#x27;s very easy to use and gives great color.</li>
            <li> I used only about 1/3 of the capsule and it was more than enough for both brows.  Put it on thick, left on for 3 minutes, wiped it off and the results were great.  I did use vaseline around the brows to keep the dye away (as per the instructions) and was glad I did as there was a bit of dye left on the skin under the brows.  By evening it was gone.  No irritation and the color for medium brown is medium brown.  I&#x27;m thrilled with the results and for $10 I can tint my brows 12 times!!  Love it!!</li>
            <li> This is just what I was needing...now that I am older (and grayer) my eyebrows needed help...they were hardly noticeable before.  Now I have eyebrows again...so happy!</li>
            <li> I just wish it would last as long as the product claims. I get about two weeks before the greys start coming back and I&#x27;m only 54.</li>
            <li> This is the best product out there for those who don&#x27;t dye their eyebrows at the salon. The product is easy to use and gives great result.</li>
            <li> The product is good and really tints the eyebrows well.  Follow the time recommendations as it does tint rapidly.  I left it on alittle longer the first time and it came out darker than I wanted.  You don&#x27;t have to use a whole capsule each time.  It makes more tint than needed.</li>
            <li> Perfection!!! So easy to use, almost impossible to mess up, and wayyyy cheaper than getting it done at brow bar or the salon! There is four applications and all of the tools you need!! It took me 4 minutes tops and my eye brows look amazing.. Since I can actually see them now :)!</li>
            <li> I went to a salon to get my eyebrows tinted till I discovered this product. I love it! No waiting for appointments to get your eyebrows done, plus it&#x27;s cheaper! Very simple instructions, and easy to use. Don&#x27;t leave it on too long. Each capsule makes enough dye that if you take it off and decide that it&#x27;s too light you can still reapply more. Rather safe than sorry...right? It dyes very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the salon&#x27;s did. I don&#x27;t know why that is. It still works out cheaper and more convenient for me, so I&#x27;m sticking with it!</li>
            <li> I recently dyed my blonde hair to a dark brown, but my eyebrows were still blonde!  I was coloring them in every day, but when I didn&#x27;t wear makeup I just looked like an alien.  I saw the great reviews on this product, and bought it right away.  It worked like a charm!  It was easy to use.  At first the &#x27;pill&#x27; of the dry tint was a bit difficult to open, but with the use of a toothpick it didn&#x27;t take much time.  The wooden tool that came with it was really easy to use too.  From standard blonde hair, a minute and a half of this color was too light for me.  It was darker, but not enough to match my hair, so I just did another application for 30 seconds and it came out great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did add vaseline around my brows, but I think next time I&#x27;m going to not do that.  The wooden applicator was precise enough that I didn&#x27;t mess up, and I have a suspicion that because of the vaseline some of the outside hairs, the roots didn&#x27;t get colored.  And the color on my skin came off after washing my face twice, so sacrifice a couple days for nice color, it looked fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For going to a salon and getting my eyebrows tinted for $10 to $15, this kit was absolutely worth it and I&#x27;ll definitely be buying it more!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  After chemo, I have few eyebrows and they are very blonde.  Without dyeing my eyebrows, mine would not show up.  In addition, hot flashes removes what makeup I do use, so I find this product very useful.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this does sting somewhat while it&#x27;s on the skin and leaves a bit of redness, but both the irritation and the redness are gone within five minutes. I have had no trouble getting exactly the color I want and it lasts for weeks.</li>
            <li> Works great and its so easy to use, I put it on 3 weeks ago and its still working well.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. Also is quick. I recommend using vaseline around eyebrow to prevent staining. The product tinted my grows to the perfect shade in about 3 minutes. No more powders. I hope the color lasts. I will recommended this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I have SUPER light eye brows and until I had someone at a salon tint them a few months ago, I didn&#x27;t even realize I had any on the outer half of my eye brows. I loved how it turned out at the salon, but it seemed to fade awfully quick when the cost is $20 plus tip per trip. So I decided to give the at home kit a try and this is what I bought. I LOVE this stuff. Very easy to use, just mix a pill capsule full of tint with a few drops of the liquid developer (8-10), apply, wait a few minutes (the instructions say to go 1-2 minutes, rinse, and reapply if you want darker result. I ended up doing two applications, the first one was definitely 2 minutes, the second, I think was a minute thirty. They turned out pretty dark but after two days they fade a bit and they&#x27;re perfect. I did that two weeks ago and my color is still holding strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great less expensive option!! I plan to purchase again and again :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a strawberry blonde and with that comes the dreaded invisible lashes and brows.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product hoping it would give me a nice natural looking eyebrow color and it delivered.  I swim almost everyday and coming out of the pool with no eyebrows was quite embarrassing.  I tint my lashes and use this for my brows, I can come out of the pool without frightening little kids with my non-existent looking lashes and brows.  :)  I find myself going more natural, well except for the tinting of my lashes and brows.  :)</li>
            <li> I was initially reluctant to use any eyebrow tinting product at home as I was scared they would some how just burn off! After reading the reviews on Amazon about Godefroy I wanted to give it ago because I just couldn&#x27;t spend anymore money at the salon to get it done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mixed the product and applied as suggested and the colour did slowly change. I found that after I left it on for the suggested time which was 3 minutes, there were still bits of my eyebrows that were black, maybe I hadn&#x27;t applied properly. I re-applied the product and left for a further 1-2 minuts until more of my brows were lightned, and that did the trick. There are still a few hairs that are black, but only noticeable up close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a lot of mixture left over! and since my eyebrows are relatively thin, I might use half the amount next time as it was a waste to throw out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An excellent product, wish I had discovered sooner. No irritation or redness, so darn easy to use and cheap. I love this!</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair with very light brown eyebrows. I wanted to darken my brows for more drama and to match my hair. I took the advice of some of the other reviews and the result was perfect!! It was super fast. Not sure how long effect will last, but even if it just a week or so, it sure beats penciling them in every morning!! Will definitely use again and recommend to friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick Tips&lt;br /&gt;1) Use only 1/3 of a dye capsule and mix 1 part dye to 2 parts cream (rather than 1:1 ratio like the instructions said). I think this helped me from turning my brows dark brown or black like others complained about.&lt;br /&gt;2) Use an angled brow brush to apply (so easy!)&lt;br /&gt;3) I applied several coats to get the shade I was looking for. The first coat I kept on for 90 seconds. Next I applied 2 coats for 30 seconds each to even out the shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are thin from overplucking and light from who knows what. Most likely ProActiv (which contains something that lightens hair so be careful, but great product as well.) So needless to say I had to use a brow pencil just so you could even see my eyebrows and that just doesn&#x27;t look very natural on me unless i&#x27;m having a good eyebrow day. lol I was scared to order this because I was afraid I might accidently dye my skin or it might come out too dark or red hued or something could just potentially go wrong and I&#x27;d regret it. Honestly though it was SO easy even for my first time, it was so quick to process, I have light brows so I did 3 minutes for each brow to make them a dark brown. Be careful not to get it on your skin because it&#x27;ll stain it but after 2 times of washing your face that night and the next morning with whatever exfoliator/face wash it&#x27;ll go away on it&#x27;s own. The color doesn&#x27;t last for 6 weeks by any means. I&#x27;d say 4 but still for the price, how easy it is and the fact that you get 4 dyes in 1 box, it&#x27;s worth it. I never buy anything else and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with how quick you can do this and how great the price is. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.  I used to get my brows tinted professionally, but the stylist moved, and I had been getting by with just getting them colored when I got my hair roots done - but it didn&#x27;t last and was never as dark as I wanted.  I found this product, and it works great!  With my eyebrows the right color, my face has it&#x27;s \\&quot;frame\\&quot; back and I love the way I look.  It was very simple to apply, I used petroleum jelly around the brow area, and I used a clean mascara wand to apply - left it on 3 minutes each side and my brows were perfect.  The petroleum jelly made clean up a breeze.  It&#x27;s been 1 week now, and they still look great!  I used medium brown and the color is just right.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Product does as it says it does.  Great color and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Brows came out great.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Wish I had searched and ordered this product sooner.  Easy to apply with minimum mess.  One thing that was slightly concerning was that in the box there was an insert for beautiful \\&quot;eyelashes\\&quot; which made me think for a split second that I had received the wrong product.  Someone might not bother with the instructions and use this on their eyelashes as well which might cause blindness (per the instruction sheet) so beware.</li>
            <li> It is okay but it can get real dark real  quick so just leave it on for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. It does the job and is very simple to use. It beats paying $25 to get them done professionally every 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I got the wrong color capsules in the medium brown box for the brow tint. I have ordered this color in the past and I have noticed this time the powder in the capsules were much lighter than before. I had an old capsule from the light brown and I put in next to the capsule for the medium brown and the medium brown are much significantly lighter than the light brown that were in the box.  I did take picture of the capsules that were included that I can e-mail to you. I think the graphite color capsules were mistakenly put in? My last order arrived late so I was refunded my money and I ordered again and now have the wrong color...</li>
            <li> I love this product but this is actually dark brown. I now use the light brown color and it matches well with my brunette hair. It&#x27;s very easy to use and lasts a good three weeks.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use and it does what it says. The color looks natural, not too dark or too light. Just follow the instructions- super easy and very fast too. The tint stayed on for 6 weeks as promised. I would recommend this product for someone that would like a natural dark looking eyebrows in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;ll admit it here. I colour my husbands hair with Touch of Grey. He has a lot of hair (lucky) and it makes him feel good and makes him look about 15 yrs. younger. Problem was his eyebrows! They are naturally a light brown and now with the grey they looked too light for the hair colour. I had tried a bit of the Touch of Grey on his eyebrows but it didn&#x27;t really work AND I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BECAUSE YOU SHOULDN&#x27;T USE NEAR EYES...OK!!!&lt;br /&gt;Godefroy medium is perfect and so easy, but you should have someone do it for you IMO. It comes with a stick to mix and apply but I used a new mascara brush and eyelash comb. The application is easier and less likely to get on your skin (because it will stain - another reason to have someone do it for you. ) His hair is course and kind of wiry but the coverage was excellent and the colour is natural. Another plus that I recommend is do one eyebrow at a time and leave on just the minimum amount of time then wipe with a damp paper towel. You can always reapply if you need it darker.&lt;br /&gt;Also, by using a mascara brush and eyelash comb I was even able to pick up the really fine blond hairs so that his brows  look fuller. The brows really frame the face and with this inexpensive product both he and I are very pleased.</li>
            <li> This product chemically burned my eyebrows causing me over $3000.00 in medical bill and lost wages, not to mention pain and suffering. My eyes were literally swollen shut for two days and it has taken 4 weeks to get back to somewhat normal. As a RN,I&#x27;m advising you, DO NOT USE this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to do this.After putting on petroleum jelly (not sure it helps) I mix up a third of the capsule and paint it on in the shape I want with a brush, wait 3 minutes and wipe off, some dye is left on the skin in the sparse areas but I can clean it off with a q-tip. If I do it at night before going to bed the extra dye on my skin seems to wear off by the next morning and my brows look great for the first time in my life! It only lasts about 5 days, perhaps because I have very oily skin, but it only takes 5 minutes to do, so it&#x27;s not a big deal and beats pencil and mascara any day.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure which product to use since each color is a different listing on Amazon and none are terribly clear. According to the packaging the color selector goes like this: Get jet black for ebony skin and black hair. Natural black for olive to dark skin with black hair. Dark brown for medium to olive skin tones with dark brown to black hair. Medium brown for light to medium skin tones with gray/blonde/red hair. And Light brown for fair skin tones with gray/blonde/red hair. There are 4 gel capsules with dye inside which you open, dump into a provided cup, add provided developer, stir and apply. There is enough in each cap for probably two applications or more. I applied Medium Brown for the recommended time of 1:30-2 mins, stopped short at 1:15 just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t too dark. It wasn&#x27;t as dark as I wanted so I waited a few mins for my skin to dry, applied again for another 20 seconds and that got me the color I was looking for. There was still plenty of dye left over so I think reserving half the powdered dye to stetch the product would be fine. I had no problem with it staining my skin.</li>
            <li> It did darken my brows though but make sure not to step out for 24 hours in public or it looks like you been sharpeed!</li>
            <li> I just now tinted my brows, using a slanted brush as helpful posters suggested. I only used one coat of dark brown (I&#x27;m a medium-dark brunette), and they look perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was very easy. Luckily I carefully pre-applied vaseline to avoid mistakes -- ha, I would have had a nasty look had I not bothered with the vaseline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m someone on whom makeup just doesn&#x27;t stay, so I&#x27;ll have to wait and see how long it lasts on me. Will update my review if needed when the time comes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks to all of the reviewers without whose tips and advice I may not have even tried this product with any success!</li>
            <li> I previously ordered this in Dark Brown and had zero issues. I&#x27;m going to try the Medium Brown simply because I&#x27;m on a budget and it was a tiny bit cheaper than the Dark Brown this time (weird!). I&#x27;ll copy my review from the Dark Brown here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never tinted my brows before and some of the tinting horror stories had me spooked. But this was SUPER easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tint arrives in a powder form which is packaged in little capsules. Pull the capsule apart, empty it into the mixing bowl,pour in enough developer to make a paste and apply using the provided pointy/slanted applicator. I prepped the area around my brows with a waxy lip balm to prevent any tint from staining my skin and used just a thick cotton ball with warm water to wipe off the tint when done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark brown hair with sparse, light colored eyebrows. I chose the tint in Dark Brown and processed for three minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not convinced the color will last six weeks, but I&#x27;m headed into my third week and it looks pretty good still. I might try splitting a capsule in half and tinting every three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the cost and the ease-factor, I would definitely purchase this item again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***12/10/12 Update: After using this product for more than six months, I would say tinting every three weeks is about normal. I&#x27;ll let it go longer and then do them for a special occasion if I&#x27;m running low, but I wouldn&#x27;t plan on it last anywhere near six weeks. Still a great product for us with pale brows!</li>
            <li> the capsules were black not brown as many times it still was black not medium brown was not happy with the product</li>
            <li> This was a good product, it was pretty easy to use and definitely did the job of colouring my eyebrows. It has been about 4 weeks since I used it, and am starting to notice the colour fading a bit, so although it says it lasts 6 weeks, I don&#x27;t think I will wait that long between applications. Also, if you get any on your skin above/below your brow, wipe it off IMMEDIATELY. I missed cleaning off a little spot above my eyebrow and the skin was clearly stained for some time. Overall, this product is definitely worth it, compared to the cost of getting your eyebrows coloured professionally!</li>
            <li> OMG!This product is AMAZING!!! I have had no eyebrows for years! And when I went to the Salon I looked like Jack Nicholson as the Joker in Batman! I now have eyebrows that I LOVE!!! Yay!</li>
            <li> I bought the light brown and it turned my eyebrows jet black. It looked ridiculous with my red hair and now I might have to bleach my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I have VERY light eyebrows (like clear) and was very skeptical because everytime I&#x27;ve had my eyebrows done it has been way too dark at first and only lasts a week (Aveda). I tried the medium brown and ended up letting the tint sit for approx 2 minutes each (i tried 1 minute for the first time and wasn&#x27;t quite dark enough), and am EXTREMELY happy with the turnout. Not too dark not too light.  Even if it fades at the same pace as the Aveda tint, it is 9.50 for 4 treatments rather than 30 dollars for something that may only last a week--not to mention you have control over the darkness of the tint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT product.. will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Been using for years!!! Awesome, simple and fast.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply., long lasting, did not stain skin.  Medium brown is very dark almost black.  I wish the color description was more accurate, also I don&#x27;t know who would need the color in a whole capsule, it seems like abut of a waste.</li>
            <li> I use this every four weeks to make my eyebrows appear on my face :-) I have golden blonde hair and fair skin and my lashes and brows are nonexistent without some help.  I was using powder and a brush or a brow pencil but it took a while and the results were uneven sometimes in my morning rush.  I do this in less than five minutes once/month on a Sunday evening before bed and the results are natural and long lasting.  Definitely worth the minimal effort and cost.  I tried having it done at an Aveda salon and it cost over $35 with tip plus all of the travel time, etc., and the results were exactly the same.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This was my first time coloring my graying eyebrows, and I found it to be extremely easy. Each application provides far more than I needed, so I&#x27;ll use a half application next time. Because other reviews recommended going a shade lighter than you think you need, I went for medium brown. However, I found this to still be darker than I needed.</li>
            <li> They try marketing this product as different shades of brown, but really it&#x27;s all one color.  You are not going to get a rich color when you get a light brown or medium brown box.  It is all the same!  The color is black- faded to jet.  And jet black is what you&#x27;ll likely get if you leave on longer than a minute.  Redheads beware!  This will not look good on you.  There are better products than this with more color and more applications per box.  Buy anything else but this!  My eyebrows are the source of my embarrassment right now.</li>
            <li> The only one on the market that works well, and looks so natural! Would have loved it to be premixed, but fine the way it is...</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and color is great, but all the color went away in 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;When you first apply it, the color looks good. Then you take a shower and the color fades by 50%. Then you take another shower, and the color is almost gone.</li>
            <li> leave on longer than recommended by product insert for eye brows you can actually see.  Very easy to apply and cleans up easily.</li>
            <li> i tried this instead of my standby, dylash.  i do not like fussing with the capsules.  I never needed a full one and trying to save the other half was a bit of a pain.  I have gone back to dylash even though I still have some of the godefroy left.  I am not sure if it even lasts as long as the dylash......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times now and it&#x27;s excellent. I often alternate between medium brown and dark as I change my hair color quite frequently and this certainly makes a world of difference. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who wants to put more emphasis on their eyebrows and has medium to dark hair.</li>
            <li> This product worked as promised. I used the wooden applicator that was included and it worked great. My eyebrows are light and sparse and it did a great job tinting them and not staining my skin. I used medium brown and it is dark to me but probably more because I am used to blonde eyebrows then because it is too dark. I recommend this product, especially if like me you just can&#x27;t get the results you want with an eyebrow pencil- I never get them close to the same.</li>
            <li> I use to be a huge fan of this product.  Yes, I does a decent job coloring/tinting eyebrows.  However, over the years the company has become stingy with their product.  A few years ago, you would receive larger capsules of the powdered tint and could easily use one capsule for 2 applications.  Now the company gives their customers smaller applications and has increased the cost as well.  Really?  let&#x27;s be a little more generous.  i&amp;#34;m sure in the coming months we&#x27;ll see even less product with a higher purchase price.  Sorry. will shop elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This literally saves me $40 and looks really great.  I have extremely light eyebrows and the color is dark without looking scary.  Easy to use once you get the hang of the idea that you &amp;#34;mix&amp;#34; the color in the little cup and apply.</li>
            <li> super easy to use. I have naturally bleach blonde brows that take to dye very easily. left on for maybe 2 minutes and have had dark brows for 4+ weeks now after a multi step daily face washing and swimming in chlorinated pools a couple times a week. No staining, used disposable mascara wands to brush through gently, like my professional brow colorist used to do. Getting it done professionally only lasted 2-3 weeks, I am very impressed!!! Wont probably need to re-apply for another 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have resistant grey eyebrow hairs. This tint did not work either.</li>
            <li> This thing is disaster. I got burned. The whole area around my eyebrows is swollen, itchy, irritated. Had to visit my doctor who described cortisone and Benadryl. Has been two weeks of pain and swollen face. Noticed hair fall of my eyebrows. Would not recommend to any one. Crazy stuff. Keep in my mind that my skin is not sensitive at all. Have no allergies but this thing is very very tough and insane. Very upset</li>
            <li> lasts well for about 2weeks, not 6 weeks</li>
            <li> Good and fast transaction</li>
            <li> Great item love that I can do this all at home. It was a easy process and it came out great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
            <li> Works great - I read the reviews of others and how they applied and how long they applied it. Color does take quick, so don&#x27;t leave it on too long.</li>
            <li> The product works good as far as darkening, but there are a few downsides.  Its messy to mix.  You have to break open a capsule filled with powder and add liquid developer in an equal amount, which is difficult to estimate.  The color is good not great.  Its a brown that just off somehow.  But when my brows are dyed, just adding a little brow makeup in the morning makes the color pretty.  Wearing makeup alone looks bad, looks too draw-on and fake.  The dye alone doesn&#x27;t look great either, the color is not quite right and there is still spaces showing in my brows.  But together the results are great!!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how well it worked! I would definitely recommend this. Easy to use and great results if you follow the directions.</li>
            <li> I am a natural redhead and love the look of darker brows, so I used the &amp;#34;Medium Brown&amp;#34; shade. I left the tint on for 60 seconds and my brows looked BLACK on my fair skin. It took about a week for the color to start looking more natural, and after that I was very pleased with the result. It really lasted 6+ weeks as advertised. Blondes or redheads who want a less dramatic look should take note to either buy a light brown shade or leave this tint on for less than the 60 seconds as directed!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  But Beware... it is very dark (The medium brown is almost black).  Definitely test an area before putting the product on your whole eyebrow, and try not to let it touch your skin, because it will stain.  After my third use, I finally have the hang of it.  I am very glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> I have used other eyebrow dyes before and this is by far the best.  I agree with an earlier reviewer, use those small brushes in the toothpaste aisle, I didn&#x27;t attempt to use the enclosed sticks.  There is not the mess that you have with the two step dyes.  The color is already there, so there is no guessing where it has been applied, and you can get it as dark or light as you want.</li>
            <li> The longer you leave the tint on, the darker they get, so be careful. I recently dyed my hair dark, quite dark, and this helped my eyebrows to match.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Very easy to use and the tinted brows and lashes stay tinted for a long time. Mine normally lasts at least 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> As a light haired person, I would prefer to see this product in light brown/taupe.  The little brow comb is helpful.</li>
            <li> The color is moderate, looks very natural and lasts for 10-12 days. If strong cleansers or exfoliators are used to wash the face, it won&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> It seems to work...but just does not last very long.  But I will continue to use it as I need it</li>
            <li> I have very light blonde eyebrows and have always had to use a pencil to fill them in or some sort of brow filler powder. Nothing ever worked that well and they usually ended up looking &amp;#34;drawn on&amp;#34; so I decided to try this dye. It works ok but is extremely hard to apply. I used a clean mascara wand and it still got all over my skin and was difficult to apply to every hair - root to tip. It did dye the hairs but results just were not what I was expecting. Not sure if I will order this again, I will have to keep experimenting with it.</li>
            <li> I discovered this product online and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m blond and kept spending money to get them dyed but not anymore.This is very simple and easy to use. I was worried the first time but it&#x27;s actually fun to do. Especially that I&#x27;m saving so much money.</li>
            <li> Yay! Perfect color for my dirty blonde/light brown hair. Easy to use. Just make sure you get it off the surrounding skin with a q tip. Never paying for salon tinting again! I broke open the capsule and used a tiny amount so this will last forever!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the light brown is actually dark. I was hoping for a good color to go with my blonde hair. I left it on for a minute, mabe next time i&#x27;ll do 40 seconds, other than that great product.</li>
            <li> What a find! This is my second purchase and I am now signed up for auto-delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the description claims it&#x27;ll last 6 weeks but for me I generally get about 3-4 weeks use. Absolutely no complaint. In fact, last month I threw away my eyebrow pencil for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed a lot of previous viewers&#x27; advice the first time I used it, but after that I was able to just do it my own way. I am thrilled with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of caution, however, I don &#x27;t mind my brows a little darker so I use the  &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34;  to get the desired look. You definitely want to be careful. But once you know your own preference you will love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, very little clean -up, very reasonable price, and it looks great! Sold.</li>
            <li> I only have about 4-6 &amp;#34;gray&amp;#34; eyebrow hairs so I just used a tiny bit of the color and a tiny bit of the developer.  Followed the easy directions.  Put left over on other eyebrows.  Whole thing was inexpensive, easy and works.  What more could one want.  Alot simpler than leaving your house and getting someone else to do it (plus $$$)&#x3D;no brainer.</li>
            <li> This tint works really well, and last weeks. The price is great, and you can get several appliations with each capsule of tint powder. Saves you a fortune when you compare to the cost of tinting eyebrows in a salon.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think it lasts as long as stated, but works well for me. I leave it on for only 1 minute and do one brow at a time.</li>
            <li> I love this. My brows look so clean and perfect like I just came from a salon. I got medium brown and its true to the color. For those saying its black , its not black it is the first day but it fades the day after, or maybe you don&#x27;t know how to apply it. Either way I&#x27;m very happy I found this product.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about using an eyebrow tint at home instead of at a salon. Wish I would have started using this years ago! Excellent coverage, I did leave it on for 2 minutes and it was a little dark at first; next time I will just do 1 minute. The tools are kinda flimsy and if you get any dye on anything, it will stain. I would recommend using vaseline under and over the brow; it also helps you get the kind of eyebrow shape you want. No more salon for me!</li>
            <li> It works better than any other eyebrow dye I&#x27;ve used. easy to use &amp; lasts longer. I use it every 4-5  weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 6 months and can say it continues to work beautifully for me although I am having to use it about every 3 weeks in order to keep a good strong color on my brows because I have some white/ grey hairs to dye. Follow the instructions exactly.  Your skin will also absorb some dye but that will fade away in a day.  Just apply carefully so there is minimum contact with your skin except within your eyebrow line.  I use an old mascara wand as an applicator.</li>
            <li> love this product havent had the color on my brows but a couple days so dont know how long itll last no proublems with packing and sell was prompt in sending them to me.yes id order it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Over time my eyebrows have gotten lighter and lighter.  Sooo tired of having to draw them on in the morning and now I don&#x27;t have to.  I found this tint to be much more effective than regular hair dye.  One thing - it is only good for about 2 weeks, but on the bright side it onlytakes about 3 minutes to apply.</li>
            <li> Good product, saves money. The tint doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like - maybe a week or two rather than the month(s) noted. Still, a good value.</li>
            <li> This stuff is life changing! I naturally have a decent amount of brow hairs but they&#x27;re light/clear blonde. Since I dye my hair dark brown I have to spend about 10 minutes a day filling them in with powders and brow gels. Not anymore!!</li>
            <li> This product works very well but the materials are extremely cheap.  The capsule of color is extremely hard to pull apart!  It is truly a pain.  I have used this 6 times now and it spills every single time because the capsule doesn&#x27;t pull apart easily.  Secondly, the little cup is the cheapest, thinnest plastic i&#x27;ve ever seen and this too contributes to spilling. I use a thick medicine cup instead.  Thirdly, the wooden sticks are totally worthless.  I use a makeup brush instead (ie, an eyeliner-shaped brush).  Lastly, the bottle the activator comes in doesn&#x27;t really produce drops so you have to kindof guess about the 10 drops it calls for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the color is consistent, and even though i am extremely pale it stains my skin minimally (just a little and it&#x27;s easily removed with color remover pads), and it lasts a satisfactory length of time - about 4 weeks.  I followed the advice of others and purchased medium brown and it looks dark brown on my eyebrows, which are natively dark brown with some white mixed in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that my eyebrow tint lasts longer if i clean my eyebrows with a washcloth after applying lotions and sunscreen to my face.  those materials seem to fade the color more quickly.</li>
            <li> It is not a mediun-brown! It is black or very dark blue!&lt;br /&gt;My wife says that she will not go out for two month due to the color of her brows.&lt;br /&gt;It is very concentrated&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth about this product is that you can&#x27;t wash it out... for a long time.</li>
            <li> This product worked great, turned out more charcoal but I had to leave it on for a while to get some hairs to take.  I have very blond eyebrows so they are hard to see, now I have eyebrows.  My only suggestion would be to do both eyebrows at once because it&#x27;s easier to get them even</li>
            <li> This product did everything that I wanted it to. Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed! I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and looks great. No more disappearing eyebrows! My hair is silver &amp; i got the medium brown, perfect</li>
