            <li>great find!</li>
            <li>This is the best brush ever!  </li>
            <li>Best brush I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel the best it has ever been.</li>
            <li>I bought a Goody Ouchless brush from Amazon before and it was wonderful.  </li>
            <li>but best I can find</li>
            <li>Awesome hairbrush.</li>
            <li>We own three &amp;#34;ouchless&amp;#34; brushes!!</li>
            <li>strait hair and this brush does a great job of brushing and not pulling.</li>
            <li>Amazing brush!</li>
            <li>The kids are using them, so I guess they are good.</li>
            <li>It pulls, not as good as the brown one.</li>
            <li>I love this brush!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, does a good job, and makes your scalp feel good, and doesn&#x27;t pull hair out.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>I have straight hair, so this brush is the perfect shape for getting the snarls out of my hair.</li>
            <li>but this is a nice one as well.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>word to the wise, when you find something you love the way it works, stock up while you can.</li>
            <li>The price on this was excellent, I give the seller high marks.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I located this brush on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>My favorite hair brush.</li>
            <li>I want my hair to come out smooth and intact!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be so pleased.</li>
            <li>Love the design and color.</li>
            <li>This brush is definitely one of the best choices.</li>
            <li>Better than the WetBrush.</li>
            <li>the bristles the better for me.</li>
            <li>Love theses</li>
            <li>But I think this was more of a gimmick to get me to buy something I didn&#x27;t need and at a raised price...</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I initially asked for an exchange but am happy with the refund because now I don&#x27;t need to be concerned with any damage in transit.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving a 4 star review rather than 3 because the brush I have (exact style) works great for &#x27;ouchless&#x27; brushing and customer service was prompt to respond to my issue.</li>
            <li>These are still great brushes, not painful, but I prefer their older version.</li>
            <li>I also have a daughter and brushing her hair before was a true struggle!</li>
            <li>The way the bristles are designed it allows easy release if there is a knot that is stubborn.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job as advertised and a good value for the use desired in everyday use and cleans up ok.</li>
            <li>Best hairbrush ever spent money on!!</li>
            <li>I bought this brush after a recommendation for my daughters fine curly hair.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m thinking it may be perfect for someone with less curls.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>The brush itself is not as nice as the oval one, it really pulls my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>My daughters liked it so much they begged me to get them one.  </li>
            <li>My niece hates brushing her hair because like mine the tangles and knots hurt using a regular brush; she loved using mine because it was more gentle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It works just as well as her original brush.  </li>
            <li>When the hair is wet, it is great.  </li>
            <li>and I received pink cancer support brushes which was great although I do wish I could have been offered a color selection.  </li>
            <li>Really need I say more?</li>
            <li>I have thick semi curly hair and this brush is awesome...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had some difficulty finding a good replacement brush from my last Goody (which has been discontinued).  </li>
            <li>One cool thing about it is that the rubber &amp;#34;squishy&amp;#34; part of the brush that gives it</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite hairbrush.  </li>
            <li>It is not my first goody hairbrush they are all even greater than it looks at first site.</li>
            <li>VERY highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>They keep coming out with new versions of this brush, but none of them seem to be of better quality.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to have a new one.  </li>
            <li>It really works, my daughter of 10 years old just love it, I also leve it, we have another brushes, but we just want this one!</li>
            <li>Sure do miss my old brush, but it seems to have been discontinued or replaced with this one.</li>
            <li>We have 3 of them in my house right now because girls have a way of misplacing things and we need backups.  </li>
            <li>3 girls with long curly hair means lots of tangles, these brushes are amazing at working through the tangles and not breaking my hair.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying several more including a couple labeled Goody Ouchless</li>
            <li>The first, I bought at Walmart, yet they don&#x27;t seem to carry it anymore.</li>
            <li>It does work much better than any standard brush</li>
            <li>This does not do any better than a regular plastic bristle brush.  </li>
            <li>I had a ouchless brush for many years and it finally broke.</li>
            <li>I bought mine from wal-mart several years ago and haven&#x27;t been able to find it again since.  </li>
            <li>that is a positive.</li>
            <li>Brush was fine upon receipt but the back fell off on the first day and there is really nothing that can be done we attempted to hot glue</li>
            <li>While this is the only brush I have found that does not pull out my hair, the brush falls apart easily.  </li>
            <li>It is really easy to brush out my hair after a shower, I make sure I go slowly and gently.</li>
            <li>She really complains about this brush.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Goody really did it with this one.  </li>
            <li>But not as many tears as other brushes, so</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s a tenderhead, and has curly hair, prone to tangling for sure, but it was not an improvement over our other goody brush.  </li>
            <li>The first two I had were ovals, and I was a little apprehensive getting this one after reading some of the reviews saying the oval is better, but I don&#x27;t have a problem with the paddle at all.</li>
            <li>I bought this one and found this to hurt and get stuck more than the other two I had.</li>
            <li>I have had long thin hair all my life, and this is the best brush I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>We have 2 different shapes, this big square one that will work better with older kids or kids with fuller hair</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>If I could get a dozen more in case we lost a few</li>
            <li>it actually feels nice, like a little head massage.</li>
            <li>I used to get huge rats nests in my hair when I was a kid, but after switching to better shampoo and using this brush, no more pain!!!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ll solve one problem and then have a new one.  </li>
            <li>I have very thin hair, not terribly susceptible to knotting, and this brush was fine.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>When I need to clean all the built up hair off of the brush, this has been easier than any other brush</li>
            <li>I have to hunt it down and get it back - we all love it.</li>
            <li>I have 2 daughters that both have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>But  hoping to find another Goody like my old Goody&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I miss the old fashion brush...</li>
            <li>As I said, my old one was falling apart</li>
            <li>When I first got one for Christmas a couple years ago I thought it seemed gimmicky, but it saves sooo much time &amp; pain!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the gimmick is supposed to be here, but this overpriced brush was a waste of money, and didn&#x27;t work any better on my tangled hair than my regular brushes did.</li>
            <li>The back always falls off the brush, and you can&#x27;t use this particular version in the shower because water gets stuck in it immediately - which over time will just turn into mildew.</li>
            <li>Wanted to replace my lost brush, which was the same brand, ouch-less and a paddle brush, however this one the bristles are much closer together since the brush head is smaller than the old one.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair that tends to get knotty but this brush makes it easy</li>
            <li>I looked everywhere locally to replace our old Ouchless oval shaped brush.  </li>
            <li>I just bought this brush to replace my old one, making this my 3rd ouchless brush.</li>
            <li>But we call this &amp;#34;mama&#x27;s gentle brush&amp;#34; because I can brush her hair when it&#x27;s wet, and it doesn&#x27;t even hurt.</li>
            <li>son recently tried this brush and it doesn&#x27;t bother his sensitive scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>They really are &amp;#34;ouchless&amp;#34; and don&#x27;t pull hair as much as other brushes do.</li>
            <li>My old goody ouchless brushes finally fell apart after a very very long time.</li>
            <li>I have a full head of tightly curly hair and this brush cuts my detangling time in half.</li>

            <li> Although this brush will last me a very long time, if I see another I will buy it for a family member or friend, or just keep it.</li>

            <li> when the hair is dry, it still pulls and causes tears.  </li>
            <li> We received the brush and have had a similar type in the past but left it in a hotel.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be stocking up on a few of them</li>
            <li> I bought one of these brushes at a local store several years ago for my daughter who has outrageously thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I had for 3+ years and never lost a tip off the bristles, this one already did after only 2 and a half months!</li>
            <li> the only negative is that it can be a little difficult to clean and</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand to even brush my hair with any other brushes in the house.  </li>
            <li> One was oval and the other rectangle paddle like this one.  </li>
            <li> Admittedly, my daughters hair is EXTREMELY prone to knots.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brushes, but I just couldn&#x27;t stay away.  </li>
            <li> My daugther is a tough customer but she completely approves.  </li>

            <li> It actually is worse than our old one.  </li>
            <li> She has very long hair and with this brush no more complaining about pulling her hair.</li>
            <li> I noticed less damage and</li>

            <li> Not as &amp;#34;ouchless&amp;#34; as some of my previously goody hairbrushes.  </li>
            <li> ouch less brushes.</li>
            <li> Not like previous version</li>
            <li> This is a bit aggravating because i have thick and long hair,</li>
            <li> Gets the tangles out, doesn&#x27;t tangle up in your hair, no pulling and ripping the hairs out by the little roots.</li>

            <li> We will never own any other brush than a Goody Ouchless ever again.  </li>

            <li> I have 2 daughters that both have naturally curly hair and this is the ONLY brush they will allow to touch their heads!  We have used this brand of brush for 5 years and it is so wonderful.  We have 3 of them in my house right now because girls have a way of misplacing things and we need backups.  We have 2 different shapes, this big square one that will work better with older kids or kids with fuller hair and we have 2 of the medium oval ones.  They get all of the tangles out of the hair without pulling the hair out of their head.  The way the bristles are designed it allows easy release if there is a knot that is stubborn.  It will remove itself from the knot before removing the knot and all the hair from your child.  We will never own any other brush than a Goody Ouchless ever again.  VERY highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I can&#x27;t stand to even brush my hair with any other brushes in the house.  I&#x27;m so glad I located this brush on Amazon.  I will definitely be stocking up on a few of them so I can have one in my car and at work.  I can&#x27;t seem to find them anywhere else...great find!</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere locally to replace our old Ouchless oval shaped brush.  I could not find it so I turned to Amazon.  The price on this was excellent, I give the seller high marks.  The brush itself is not as nice as the oval one, it really pulls my daughter&#x27;s hair.  She really complains about this brush.  I will have to keep looking for the oval style, this one will not cut it for us.</li>
            <li> The bristles in this brush retracts when pushed.  I guess that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s \\&quot;ouchless\\&quot;.  The kids are using them, so I guess they are good.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair, so this brush is the perfect shape for getting the snarls out of my hair. It is really easy to brush out my hair after a shower, I make sure I go slowly and gently.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush after a recommendation for my daughters fine curly hair.  When the hair is wet, it is great.  when the hair is dry, it still pulls and causes tears.  But not as many tears as other brushes, so that is a positive.</li>
            <li> It pulls, not as good as the brown one.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair brush. I can&#x27;t even find one that comes close to it. Detangles without pain!</li>
            <li> Does a good job as advertised and a good value for the use desired in everyday use and cleans up ok.</li>
            <li> These hairbrushes are the BOMB DIGGITY.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! It leaves my hair feeling very soft. It doesn&#x27;t rip my hair, either. I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I bought one of these brushes at a local store several years ago for my daughter who has outrageously thick hair.  Eventually the brush needed to be replaced.  I checked at several stores but couldn&#x27;t find the same brush so I bought a different one.  It wouldn&#x27;t go through her hair.  I ended up buying several more including a couple labeled Goody Ouchless but none of them worked for her hair.  Finally, I looked on Amazon and lo and behold THE brush was there.  It works just as well as her original brush.  I&#x27;m going to order a spare just to have around.</li>
            <li> My child did not find this brush to be \\&quot;ouchless\\&quot; at all.  He&#x27;s a tenderhead, and has curly hair, prone to tangling for sure, but it was not an improvement over our other goody brush.  Bummer.</li>
            <li> I just bought this brush to replace my old one, making this my 3rd ouchless brush. When I first got one for Christmas a couple years ago I thought it seemed gimmicky, but it saves sooo much time &amp; pain! I bring it with me anytime I&#x27;m away overnight. The first two I had were ovals, and I was a little apprehensive getting this one after reading some of the reviews saying the oval is better, but I don&#x27;t have a problem with the paddle at all. Brushes in stores all advertise cushiony handles, but who cares about the handle!? I want my hair to come out smooth and intact! This brush does that.</li>
            <li> Best hairbrush ever spent money on!! Really need I say more? Gets the tangles out, doesn&#x27;t tangle up in your hair, no pulling and ripping the hairs out by the little roots. If I could get a dozen more in case we lost a few I&#x27;d be so pleased. We are estrogen city - Girls, girls, girls!! There is always a hairbrush need!&lt;br /&gt;(Shipping is always on time just as promised, ever had a problem yet)</li>
            <li> I have thick semi curly hair and this brush is awesome... I used to get huge rats nests in my hair when I was a kid, but after switching to better shampoo and using this brush, no more pain!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, does a good job, and makes your scalp feel good, and doesn&#x27;t pull hair out. I&#x27;d like to have one in purse  size, too.</li>
            <li> This is truly the Ouchless brush! Love the design and color. I have 2 of these. The first, I bought at Walmart, yet they don&#x27;t seem to carry it anymore. I was so sad when I didn&#x27;t see it there. I looked it up and here it was. I have had long thin hair all my life, and this is the best brush I have ever owned. I also have a daughter and brushing her hair before was a true struggle! She loves this brush too.</li>
            <li> These are still great brushes, not painful, but I prefer their older version. They are somehow softer on the hair. My hair is waist length and medium in thickness, tends to break. This brush is definitely one of the best choices.</li>
            <li> Horrible for wrist, very awkward to hold</li>
            <li> I have very long curly hair. My old goody ouchless brushes finally fell apart after a very very long time. One was oval and the other rectangle paddle like this one.  I bought this one and found this to hurt and get stuck more than the other two I had. It does work much better than any standard brush and I&#x27;m thinking it may be perfect for someone with less curls. I&#x27;m keeping it.. But  hoping to find another Goody like my old Goody&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I miss the old fashion brush... but this is a nice one as well.&lt;br /&gt;This is a gift for my daughter.</li>
            <li> We received the brush and have had a similar type in the past but left it in a hotel.  Brush was fine upon receipt but the back fell off on the first day and there is really nothing that can be done we attempted to hot glue but now it looks really gross.  We unfortunately threw away the receipt and uncertain how we could return to get a replacement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for almost two years now, and it has held up well.  The color I received is the same as shown in the image.  I was looking for a paddle brush, and while not necessarily looking for an &amp;#34;ouchless&amp;#34; brush, but I can say that this one hasn&#x27;t hurt me!  When I need to clean all the built up hair off of the brush, this has been easier than any other brush I think I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Ouchless?? This is the hardest, harshest brush I&#x27;ve ever owned. The bed of the brush is hard plastic, not the rubber you would typically expect. I don&#x27;t know what the gimmick is supposed to be here, but this overpriced brush was a waste of money, and didn&#x27;t work any better on my tangled hair than my regular brushes did. $11 for this brush is insane, and I feel bad because my wife bought it for me thinking it would be so much better than what I have now. I&#x27;m afraid I waited too long to try it out and now it&#x27;s too late to send it back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly what it says,ouchles;great even for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Better than the WetBrush.</li>
            <li> ...which is quite a statement. She is only 3 and whines when I brush her hair. But we call this &amp;#34;mama&#x27;s gentle brush&amp;#34; because I can brush her hair when it&#x27;s wet, and it doesn&#x27;t even hurt. yay.</li>
            <li> After using this brush about a thousand times its slowly starting to fall apart. I wish I could have used it longer.</li>
            <li> Ouchless brushes are a must in my home! 3 girls with long curly hair means lots of tangles, these brushes are amazing at working through the tangles and not breaking my hair.</li>
            <li> This brush loses a star for quality.  While this is the only brush I have found that does not pull out my hair, the brush falls apart easily.  They keep coming out with new versions of this brush, but none of them seem to be of better quality.  They&#x27;ll solve one problem and then have a new one.  The back always falls off the brush, and you can&#x27;t use this particular version in the shower because water gets stuck in it immediately - which over time will just turn into mildew.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this beush. She has very long hair and with this brush no more complaining about pulling her hair. I noticed less damage and less hair being pulled out.&lt;br /&gt;My son recently tried this brush and it doesn&#x27;t bother his sensitive scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Only negative thing I can say is it&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li> Wanted to replace my lost brush, which was the same brand, ouch-less and a paddle brush, however this one the bristles are much closer together since the brush head is smaller than the old one. This is a bit aggravating because i have thick and long hair, the farther appart the bristles the better for me. Plus the old style(light pink solid colored) I had for 3+ years and never lost a tip off the bristles, this one already did after only 2 and a half months! Sure do miss my old brush, but it seems to have been discontinued or replaced with this one. word to the wise, when you find something you love the way it works, stock up while you can.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush ever!  Goody really did it with this one.  Although this brush will last me a very long time, if I see another I will buy it for a family member or friend, or just keep it.</li>
            <li> It really works, my daughter of 10 years old just love it, I also leve it, we have another brushes, but we just want this one!</li>
            <li> Not as &amp;#34;ouchless&amp;#34; as some of my previously goody hairbrushes.  I have really thick, long hair, curly hair and am very tenderheaded.  I&#x27;ve had some difficulty finding a good replacement brush from my last Goody (which has been discontinued).  This is definitely not it.</li>
            <li> We own three &amp;#34;ouchless&amp;#34; brushes!! My daughter and I have long hair- I will never go back to owning another type of hairbrush again! They really are &amp;#34;ouchless&amp;#34; and don&#x27;t pull hair as much as other brushes do. You can use these in the shower with conditioner in if you have thick/curly hair. I highly recommend</li>
            <li> Amazing brush! Best brush I have ever used! Makes my hair feel the best it has ever been. Only thing is it wasn&#x27;t purple but that&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> Love theses ouch less brushes.</li>
            <li> One cool thing about it is that the rubber &amp;#34;squishy&amp;#34; part of the brush that gives it it&#x27;s cushion is underneath the solid plastic backing (instead of being exposed).</li>
            <li> This does not do any better than a regular plastic bristle brush.  It actually is worse than our old one.  Admittedly, my daughters hair is EXTREMELY prone to knots.  She has average thickness hair.  I have very thin hair, not terribly susceptible to knotting, and this brush was fine.  But I think this was more of a gimmick to get me to buy something I didn&#x27;t need and at a raised price... shame on me for falling for it.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that tends to get knotty but this brush makes it easy (I bought mine at a local store).  My niece hates brushing her hair because like mine the tangles and knots hurt using a regular brush; she loved using mine because it was more gentle.&lt;br /&gt;I bought 2 of these as gifts and I received pink cancer support brushes which was great although I do wish I could have been offered a color selection.  Unfortunately, when the brushes arrived, the brush backs had broken from the paddle.  Not sure why they broke in transit but after providing a snapshot of the brushes, Goody promptly provided a refund.  I initially asked for an exchange but am happy with the refund because now I don&#x27;t need to be concerned with any damage in transit.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving a 4 star review rather than 3 because the brush I have (exact style) works great for &#x27;ouchless&#x27; brushing and customer service was prompt to respond to my issue.</li>
            <li> I had a ouchless brush for many years and it finally broke. I thought this one would do the job on my extremely thick hair. Unfortunately it was terrible. It hardly made it through my hair</li>
            <li> my daughter and sister keep stealing this brush...I have to hunt it down and get it back - we all love it.</li>
            <li> My daugther is a tough customer but she completely approves.  Brushing is faster and less angst-ful!  I tried it too-it actually feels nice, like a little head massage.</li>
            <li> It is not my first goody hairbrush they are all even greater than it looks at first site. Thank you</li>
            <li> detangles damp hair well. I have a full head of tightly curly hair and this brush cuts my detangling time in half. the only negative is that it can be a little difficult to clean and the gel balls on the end tend to come off over a long period of time.</li>
            <li> I bought a Goody Ouchless brush from Amazon before and it was wonderful.  I did not experience any pain when brushing my hair.  My daughters liked it so much they begged me to get them one.  I ordered this brush for them and was surprised that it did not have the &amp;#34;ouchless&amp;#34; quality that the other brush had.  This brush is well made, but not ouchless.  Neither one of my daughters wanted it.</li>
            <li> Not like previous version but best I can find</li>
            <li> Brush broke after a month</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite hairbrush.  I bought mine from wal-mart several years ago and haven&#x27;t been able to find it again since.  Then one day I decided to look on amazon because mine was falling apart and thankfully I found it.  As long as I can find this brush, it will be the only brush I buy and use.  I&#x27;m so glad to have a new one.  As I said, my old one was falling apart but I just couldn&#x27;t let it go.  I&#x27;ve tried other brushes, but I just couldn&#x27;t stay away.  Awesome hairbrush.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have very long, strait hair and this brush does a great job of brushing and not pulling.</li>
