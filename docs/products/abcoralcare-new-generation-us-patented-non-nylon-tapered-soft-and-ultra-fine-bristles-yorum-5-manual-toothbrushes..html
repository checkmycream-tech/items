            <li>Happy healthy brushing!</li>
            <li>May be it good for kids?</li>
            <li>But the price is really good</li>
            <li>One good thing about this brush though:</li>
            <li>I am tossing the Dr. Perio brush as I gave it a good run, but it just feels like plastic when I pick it up these days.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is good.</li>
            <li>have tried Dr. Collins and those are good too</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t bang the good</li>
            <li>Probably good to avoid these.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums are already in good shape, but I think that using these toothbrushes will make them even healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In any case, these are good brushes, and I would buy them again.</li>
            <li>Otherwise he said my teeth were is good condition</li>
            <li>i decide to buy these instead of the nimbus brand, while they are good, they are just not comparable to nimbus.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean and it does an excellent job between teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I tried these.  </li>
            <li>Besides the attractive appearance, the brushes work better than my usuals that I get in the grocery store.</li>
            <li>But if it helps keep them more germ free then awesome!</li>
            <li>I love these tooth brushes!</li>
            <li>but I am sure you can make do!</li>
            <li>But as soon as I got these in the mail my teeth felt better as soon as I used it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep buying this toothbrush, as it&#x27;s cheap, feels great and functions well..</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved them, and was glad I found these.  </li>
            <li>Every nice toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>And effectively removes a lot of the plaque built up.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t ever loved brushing my teeth, but this toothbrush makes it enjoyable.</li>
            <li>out fast, but still cost effective and the best manual toothbrush ever.</li>
            <li>These just get a kind of \\&quot;fuzzy\\</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are super great.</li>
            <li>Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve found for my very sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>The Yorum brushes are much more affordable and I like the results better!</li>
            <li>an antibacterial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tips of these bristles are very fine and do an excellent job of helping clear out the pockets around my teeth and works wonders on my tongue too!  </li>
            <li>Every dentist and hygienist i&#x27;ve talked to says soft is the best for your gums...</li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s nice, but I won&#x27;t use all 5 in the pack, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>These are by far the best toothbrushes I ever used.</li>
            <li>(a good water swish does the trick most times); and they Fit in the curve of my front teeth</li>
            <li>They feel very pleasant, but not overly soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Also, very importantly.</li>
            <li>The bristles are designed to function way better than any US made toothbrush I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>, I believe, is what most dentist&#x27;s recommend.</li>
            <li>I never knew toothbrush love till I encountered these.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love them dearly.</li>
            <li>These are the most awsume tooth brushes I have ever used, and I have been using toothbrushed for 70 years.</li>
            <li>Better than most toothbrushes out there</li>
            <li>My kids love them, too.</li>
            <li>This is the same as the Shaha 5 toothbrush, which is the best toothbrush ever.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel cleaner than they have for years and my gums are healthier to boot! :-)</li>
            <li>This brush also fits better in her mouth.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS TOOTHBRUSH.</li>
            <li>at Target, used it for two days, and had to order more of these immediately.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why everyone should floss, though most of us don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend doesn&#x27;t like that he has to take a bit longer to brush his teeth, but likes the way his mouth feels fresher for more of the day after using it.</li>
            <li>Love these brushes.</li>
            <li>These compact head brushes are wonderful, especially if you have sore gums.  </li>
            <li>Love these toothbrushes!&lt;br /&gt;Wear</li>
            <li>In search for the best manual toothbrush for gums, gum pockets, and back molars</li>
            <li>any more extractions/etc.  </li>
            <li>Healthy Teeth - Healthy Body]]</li>
            <li>Please see my 5 star review for more of my comments on it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an engineer, so I love it when a product&#x27;s results can be measured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Simply put, this is the best toothbrush I have ever used.</li>
            <li>&quot; look to the top.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Want better and healthier gums?</li>
            <li>Will buy again for sure</li>
            <li>I find this handle to be very comfortable and the brush easily moves about my mouth.</li>
            <li>I think this is a great toothbrush for kids and anyone with very sensitive gums and teeth.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed that the bonded spot is becoming darker than the rest of the tooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to get the backs of my front teeth bonded as well because my teeth are becoming increasingly transparent.</li>
            <li>The bristles were noticeably soft and I didn&#x27;t believe it would do a great job of cleaning</li>
            <li>I loved it after first time use, deeply clean, durable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>- now there&#x27;s a notice for it on the product page), nonetheless they are able to get into every crevice of your teeth and gums, leaving an exceptionally clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>Nor do I get any sense that the plastic handles will break easily; they seem sturdy to me.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t even have to clean my tongue any more.</li>
            <li>I thought these were pretty nice when I got them, but over time I realized that they were not efficient at cleaning between my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Amazon for me has become a good place to find products and read actual customer product reviews - I found on Amazon \\&quot;Healthy Teeth, Healthy Body\\&quot; by Tom McGuire</li>
            <li>OMG I really love these tooth brushes , they are perfect not to big and the bristles are gentle on the teeth.</li>
            <li>I like the fine bristles on these brushes.</li>
            <li>Their tapered edge really gets in difficulty spots and they have held up nicely too.</li>
            <li>They are nothing fancy but they are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>, smooth clean.&lt;br /&gt;Enter these brushes&lt;br /&gt;LOVE</li>
            <li>These brushes are amazingly effective and gentle.</li>
            <li>like the brush size as it is great for people with smaller</li>
            <li>The results really are amazing.</li>
            <li>Which is how I discovered these - and available on Amazon which meant with my Prime membership</li>
            <li>I ordered these toothbrushes based on all of the great reviews, so its possible this was a fluke.</li>
            <li>It cleans all of my teeth quite comfortably.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush isn&#x27;t good at all for an adult,  </li>
            <li>A good dentist will tell you to use a soft brush in my experience.</li>
            <li>Soft brushes still go against my grain - I grew up using Boar Bristle brushes and loved them - but the gum damage and enamel damage snuck up on me.  </li>
            <li>Soft and good quality.</li>
            <li>Although the color of the brush head could be made more appealing (like white), I still think this is the best tooth brush ever, better than any other manual/electronic ones.</li>
            <li>again.&lt;br /&gt;it makes me very clean and fresh</li>
            <li>these are waay softer than any toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used before, they feel great, and if you have sensitive gums that bleed easily you can confidently brush the right way (scrubbing at the gum line to get the bristles really into the gums) without the pain associated with harsher toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fell in love with them from the first use.</li>
            <li>These have a shorter life, no more than 3 weeks (and two might be best).</li>
            <li>This works perfect for me since I have a small mouth.  </li>
            <li>I bought these brushes originally for their size and softness.</li>
            <li>Absolutely clean feeling.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean.  </li>
            <li>and I was amazed by how clean my teeth felt.</li>
            <li>Mouth just feels clean when I done brushing.</li>
            <li>But with a tiny bit of patience to do things the right way, these brushes will make your dentist really happy.</li>
            <li>But with a tiny bit of patience to do things the right way, these brushes will make your dentist really happy.</li>
            <li>WaterPik also makes a special tip for the gum pockets [[ASIN:B000V2DN2O</li>
            <li>I have used the entire pack now and those areas are no longer sensitive, but brushing still feels very pleasant.</li>
            <li>I like the very tapered handles and amazingly, the super-soft bristles do seem to do a better job than the store-bought soft toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Overall a good brush though.</li>
            <li>Like i said, soft and nice on the gums.</li>
            <li>loved my toothbrush so much in the first two days, my SO bought a whole pack.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great advantage as many infections of the mouth occurs in these hard to reach places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very fine soft bristles that clean well without killing your&#x27; gums.</li>
            <li>This is my new toothbrush! :-)</li>
            <li>However after using it for a year, I see why it it better for it to be smaller, because I can get in between the teeth much better.</li>
            <li>I am super diligent about oral care.</li>
            <li>We are now a loyal customer</li>
            <li>and it progresses rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, I found these.</li>
            <li>I am happy to see that  they definitely brush better than the standard toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Eventually the gum pocket becomes irritated and inflamed causing this inflamation to deepen the gum pocket to over the 3 mm sized considered to be normal by many professionals.  </li>
            <li>It is so unbelievably soft and the tapered ends really do clean your gumline much better.</li>
            <li>, this is the best cleaning, most comfortable, least damaging to my teeth, longest lasting toothbrush</li>
            <li>I can see how these would be better for someone with very sensitive gums, but they just don&#x27;t get the job done.  </li>
            <li>My mother in low started to use it and she is happy with a new brush.</li>
            <li>; The size is perfect, the black natural antibacterial stuff hasn&#x27;t come off in 6 months.</li>
            <li>I wanted Soft!!!!!</li>
            <li>Loved how smooth my teeth feel and how little irritation there is on my gums.</li>
            <li>Another point I want to make is that it feels so good using this toothbrush that I actually am able to notice when I do start brushing too hard because the sensation changes.  </li>
            <li>so I can brush them with a rotating motion (gently) instead of up/down as I had to before because the Gigantores couldn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>have sensitive teeth that love plaque.</li>
            <li>It gets an okay rating because I did like how soft the bristles were.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and gums, and am satisfied with these brushes.</li>
            <li>but it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Even though they may not be for eeveryone, however is worth a try.</li>
            <li>I almost thought it wouldn&#x27;t do the jobs because of the fine soft bristles but my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li>Yup, you read that right.  </li>
            <li>I think I made the right call.</li>
            <li>Despite the fact that my husband is in dentistry and can get all kinds of toothbrushes cheaply, I order these from Amazon because they are soft but effective and, IMO, far better than the standard brands.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love them, The black bristles are so cool and different.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these comfortable brushes to anyone.</li>
            <li>the ultra-fine, soft bristles get my teeth really clean and my gums seem healthier already!</li>
            <li>Love them, the head is not too large, the bristles are soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles are so fine, it fluffs away the grime quickly and efficiently, and since it&#x27;s so small, it perfectly fits down into the tray, unlike the AFT.     </li>
            <li>- It costs me $4 and is currently available on Amazon from $3.96 New and $0.01 used plus shipping.  </li>
            <li>The handle has been specially designed with engineered bends that allow one to more easily access brushing of the back of the back molars, and its small brush size allows for it to be more effective where the teeth meet together.  </li>
            <li>I had a Sensodyne soft toothbrush that cleaned more thoroughly and gently.</li>
            <li>To be fair I was torn between these and Dr Collins&#x27; but the antibacterial properties of the black dye on the bristles tipped the scale in favour of these and quite frankly</li>
            <li>Super soft bristles, the first set of bruches to get my teeth clean and not make me bleed</li>
            <li>very gentle bristled toothbrush</li>
            <li>not only did not have any initial break-in problems but the toothbrush felt very nice - almost like a massage for the teeth.  </li>
            <li>i know it states soft ultra fine</li>
            <li>that allows the fine soft tips to enter the gum pocket (AKA sulcus) to dislodge the decaying debris.  </li>
            <li>Maybe the upper most bristles could be construed as fine, but it is by no means a soft bristled brush.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re</li>
            <li>They are soft and tapered and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>I initially though the Dr Collins was better, but I have determined my teeth get cleaner and whiter with this</li>
            <li>This is definitely smaller than most of toothbrushes on the U.S market.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is NO bleeding anymore, unless I go to bed without brushing first.</li>
            <li>The brushes last easily more than 6 months each.</li>
            <li>I have used some similar toothbrushes, but these seem to be of higher quality than most.</li>
            <li>I used these toothbrushes at my parent&#x27;s house for the first time</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are far more comfortable to brush with than any brush I could find in local stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush broke during the first use and I ended up with a mouthful of bristle and the handle material.</li>
            <li>The ones I was ordering were pretty...</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s smaller, it takes a bit more time to clean all your teeth but that way you can take your time and actually deliver a thorough clean.</li>
            <li>, I think my teeth was more yellow afterward because as I said the brush is too soft to  effectively clean the teeth.</li>
            <li>The head is a great size for me because I found it very easy to manuever around the back teeth and behind the teeth without irritation.</li>
            <li>No other soft bristle has done such a great job.</li>
            <li>Also, if anyone can compare the softness difference between the Yorum 5 and Sanha 5 (the ultra fine and the sensitive medium) I&#x27;d really appreciate it.</li>
            <li>The brush is OK, and they do a fine job brushing your teeth, but the problem is that the black bristles lose color in your mouth!  </li>
            <li>I find that adult tooth brushes do not get my hind teeth properly clean.</li>
            <li>This is what I&#x27;ve always done, and I have not had an issue with this toothbrush being too soft to help clean my tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is actually a good thing: slow and steady motions over time is far better for your enamel and tooth health.</li>
            <li>Many of the similar toothbrushes I&#x27;ve tried had handles that flexed too much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to reach back molars and the tapered bristles are much better at dislodging food between teeth (if you brush with vertical motions).</li>
            <li>While it might seem a little gross I have found it very important to do my own periodic dental exams</li>
            <li>The brush is not so soft you can&#x27;t apply more pressure if you would like, but you really don&#x27;t have to; even this soft, you can feel the difference.</li>
            <li>I like them pretty much.</li>
            <li>I really hope they continue to manufacture these exactly as they are now.</li>
            <li>think I&#x27;ve covered pretty much everything about the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a soft toothbrush that would be gentle on gums and yet clean well.</li>
            <li>The head is pretty small but actually just perfect for toddlers and young children.  </li>
            <li>So, these bristles are super soft and</li>
            <li>And the black just kind of wears off the ends into like a yellowish color.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li>but the brush size is to large and when trying the children version</li>
            <li>This toothbrush maneuvers very well back there and is able to thoroughly clean every side of my back</li>
            <li>I bought these toothbrushes after I stopped going to my dentist whom also used similar toothbrushes with fine bristles.  </li>
            <li>If you want fine bristle, just buy white or colorless one, don&#x27;t buy black-bristle tooth brush!</li>
            <li>The black bristles are super soft and super fine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why American tooth brushes are so huge.</li>
            <li>Some folks have commented that they didn&#x27;t feel that this tooth brush properly cleaned between their teeth- unless you have huge gaps between your teeth</li>
            <li>I was drawn to these toothbrushes because of the unusual color.  </li>
            <li>They are gentle but thorough.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really like these.</li>
            <li>my whole life</li>
            <li>I found this to be very helpful cleaning my teeth thoroughly.   </li>
            <li>but I really feel the difference and felt like I don&#x27;t even need to use my floss.</li>
            <li>and I really like them.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve been told repeatedly to be gentle when I brush.</li>
            <li>Which I am, but it helps when you have a toothbrush that&#x27;s gentle also.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell a difference.</li>
            <li>The bristles are gentle; they get between the teeth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m convinced you could use one of this toothbrushes  for a whole year.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t do their whole program which includes brushing with the product.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>It brushes off with very vigorous brushing.</li>
            <li>My teeth get much cleaner than with the toothbrushes you get nowadays where the bristles are thicker.</li>
            <li>They do make my mouth feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li>I brush very rigorously and don&#x27;t have issues with tarter or bleeding</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I placed the order I received a really nice personal email from this Vendor - with some extra tips and to contact him with any questions.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>At first most people would say why is it black?  </li>
            <li>numbers\\&quot; (indicator of how much the gums cover the teeth) has significantly improved over my last 2 visits (so 1 year).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i have used soft  soft brushes that adequately clean my teeth and just didnt...</li>
            <li>Stick with the original brush with the white bristles</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not me, this has NEVER happened with any other brush.</li>
            <li>find that my teeth get better cleaning with these than other manual brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been changing up my whole tooth care routine, and these are a main staple in that routine now.</li>
            <li>It fits well in my mouth, is larger than child sized tooth brushes, and leaves my teeth feeling clean all day.</li>
            <li>The bristles work, my teeth feel clean, without further removing enamel.</li>
            <li>I used these to help clean in between my gums and such.</li>
            <li>These are great, especially with people that have small mouths and crowded teeth.</li>
            <li>Another device that helps clean the gum pockets is an oral water irrigator, such as, [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]].  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m doing my best to not brush too hard as my previous brush was a medium.</li>
            <li>The tapered bristles for instance are super refined and manufactured to a  very high standard.</li>
            <li>The small head makes the toothbrush easy to maneuver, and the soft bristles are easy on the gums.</li>
            <li>The only difference is more open space and maneuverability in large mouths.</li>
            <li>For a while I was special ordering similar toothbrushes made from Japan.</li>
            <li>nice toothbrushes, small heads make it really easy to reach the far back teeth, I have all my molars and wisdom teeth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how soft the bristles are (I have receding gums, so I can only use the softest bristles) and how deeply they penetrate.</li>
            <li>The big brushes are good for quick brushing but never good for cleaning everywhere.</li>
            <li>black bristles are an interesting spin.</li>
            <li>I love the black bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most of these Korean, black bristle brushes brag about their activated charcoal.</li>
            <li>only concern is that they wear out quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that I could use them even longer because unlike regular toothbrushes these bristles don&#x27;t have the same wear pattern.</li>
            <li>As I got older, my concerns for dental hygiene have shot through the roof.</li>
            <li>But as the style of toothbrushes changed to these gigantic bristles that barely fit into my smallish mouth AND it became harder to find softer bristles, my gums bled freely and never really felt clean (even with constant flossing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommend them to anyone that uses a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>high quality tooth brush...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>However, I bought the Colgate charcoal soft tooth brush for myself, which was too large to maneuver in a child&#x27;s mouth.</li>
            <li>Soft and clean deep than otherones</li>
            <li>When debris is left in the gum pocket it can block the gum&#x27;s natural ability to use saliva to keep the gum pockets clean.  </li>
            <li>Had to switch to soft brushes a couple of years ago because my gums were receding alarmingly fast.  </li>
            <li>Plus the price is great, at $2 a brush, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li>, DDS - this book has become my plan of action to really take charge of my dental</li>
            <li>I have tried a few dentist-recommended brushes, an electric toothbrush (Oral-B), specialty brushes and located this one day while still searching for a better toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The bristles are small AND soft, perfect for my small mouth and tender gums.</li>
            <li>in all, I am very pleased and I will continue to buy from this manufacturer as long as the larger size toothbrushes are of the same quality.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t quite the same as the ones I was ordering, but it&#x27;s pretty much there.</li>
            <li>After a few months of using this brush, I do feel as if my oral hygiene is better maintained.  </li>
            <li>I agonized over which next generation toothbrush to buy for our 3 year old but luckily decided on these.  </li>
            <li>I do find that since using this toothbrush my gums are less sensitive and respond better to flossing.</li>
            <li>This is the new toothbrush for me.</li>
            <li>The sensation was completely new.</li>
            <li>Activated charcoal is a very very cheap, easy way to whiten your teeth (though it makes a huge mess if you&#x27;re not careful, I do it in the shower or over running water and use my hand to help wash the charcoal down) and this may just seem cosmetic, but since I live with other people...</li>
            <li>Also, the handle is narrow which is a good thing because thicker handles cause people to brush harder.</li>
            <li>This is a comfortable, well made brush, with soft cleaning bristles; however, these are not very suitable for an average adult mouth: the brush head are very small, perhaps best suited to children.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Of special note the author has the only small size dental mirror with an LED light built in I could find anywhere for just under $8</li>
            <li>you want a fast, quick fix for your teeth that brushes down your enamel</li>
            <li>you want a fast, quick fix for your teeth that brushes down your enamel</li>
            <li>My old toothbrush feels like I&#x27;m bulldozing my teeth!  </li>
            <li>The heads are small, but I find the size encourages me to be more mindful and deliberate in the brushing process.</li>
            <li>You can also get these in a larger head as well; I saw two other types and there may be more.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I brush first with activated charcoal, then with regular toothpaste (1 minute each), rinsing with water in between.</li>
            <li>I have an extremely small mouth and tried children&#x27;s toothbrushes but the bristles, if anything were even more abrasive.  </li>
            <li>Enter this brush; wow!</li>
            <li>, is that I have a small spot of that resin bonding stuff on one of my front top teeth where I chipped the surface.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the small head.</li>
            <li>They are smaller than what I preferred, but they worked out pretty well for me.</li>
            <li>Other than that it gets the job done my teeth are clean.</li>
            <li>Soft, cleans deep corner very gently...</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft, long, and very fine - I feel them get into the cracks of my teeth the way that other brushes never have!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a small mouth and have always had problems with full size toothbrushes not getting my back teeth as clean as I like.</li>
            <li>The heads of the brushes are small too, which is nice for people like myself, who have smaller mouths.</li>
            <li>Not only do they look cool, but the germ prevention is a big seller, too.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive gums and so far no irritation.</li>
            <li>other soft toothbrushes would leave my teeth feeling like they just weren&#x27;t that clean.</li>
            <li>The difference is that these are a little bit bigger -- which is totally fine and still works!</li>
            <li>I was curious about them and a little wary, but they arrived quickly and do a wonderful job.</li>
            <li>I have large teeth in a smaller sized jaw; because of this I&#x27;ve frequently purchased child sized tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>Now I see that my former toothbrushes were kind of tearing up the backs of my gums and also discouraging me from brushing molars and neighbors really well because it was just hard to get the brush in back there.  </li>
            <li>After getting use to it, I slept over a friend&#x27;s house and had to use a new toothbrush and brushing with a regular one was a lot more difficult to clean everywhere</li>
            <li>The soft bristles are really gentle on gums, unlike regular toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>The small size of these brushes are great, no more issues brushing in the morning.</li>
            <li>I have a smaller mouth and to top it off, my jaw doesn&#x27;t open as wide as it&#x27;s suppose to.</li>
            <li>&quot; it means soft.</li>
            <li>I sometimes have a problem with sensitive gums and these brushes don&#x27;t hurt  when my gums are sensitive.</li>
            <li>I like how soft they are.</li>
            <li>Those tooth brushes have compact head and soft bristles.</li>
            <li>; I stopped caring when I felt how soft the bristles were, and how microfine they are.</li>
            <li>She told me she opened up of my 8-month old son&#x27;s toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I bought these brushes because my gums are sensitive.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums were sensitive before I began using these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my six-year old.</li>
            <li>You can brush your gums and even your tongue and it feels soft.</li>
            <li>Next time I will purchase the larger size that is available by the same manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t brush thoroughly enough because the soft bristles don&#x27;t scrub as fast as my old walmart electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually natural charcoal which acts as</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t feel to soft either.</li>
            <li>They are durable and soft the way I like a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel like a professional cleaning after</li>
            <li>When switching from a regular Nylon bristled brush you can really tell the difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve read reviews where people did not think these bristles were soft.</li>
            <li>They are the softest I&#x27;ve ever felt, and I was using ultra soft children&#x27;s toothbrushes before I switched.</li>
            <li>An ultra soft children&#x27;s was replaced about every 5 days.</li>
            <li>An adult soft every two weeks.</li>
            <li>It says medium is what we consider soft and all the reviews talk about how soft they are.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>However the relatively low cost of these brushes makes them economical to use even with the short life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I was able to purchase a few, they all had heads that were bigger than I cared for.</li>
            <li>I have extremely thin enamel on my teeth and things like wine or grape juice kind of \\&quot;stick to\\&quot; my teeth.</li>
            <li>BUT the black bristles on this model of the brush are kind of gross - turns your toothpaste grey.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the new generation and new wave of brushes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smaller than the average toothbrush, but this makes it great for getting hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft so it doesn&#x27;t feel like I am destroying my teeth, but still clean my teeth</li>
            <li>they are one of the few that help clean your teeth without hurting your gums.</li>
            <li>In comparison to other manual brushes these seem better than other ones I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These brushes are very soft: I would consider these not just soft but extra soft</li>
            <li>The cheap toothbrushes marketed to children are so hard and cheap, my 3 year old was crying every night when we had to brush his teeth.  </li>
            <li>My mouth is kinda tight back there, so I LOVE the smaller head.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these brushes if you have a smaller mouth.</li>
            <li>Also, I put a little more care into brushing since I don&#x27;t have a massive brush covering my entire mouth.</li>
            <li>The head itself is much smaller than a normal toothbrush</li>
            <li>My dentist said I was doing fine and then during a recent visit he found my back three of my back molars moving further back and creating a space between the teeth in front.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see in the future if that really impacts the brush&#x27;s bactericidal properties.&lt;br /&gt;For maximum effectiveness, brush with your toothpaste of choice (I swap between EarthPaste and Sensodyne), rinse your mouth and your toothbrush, and brush over your teeth for another 20ish seconds with just water.&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to the cleanest your teeth have ever been outside the dentist&#x27;s office!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it two stars for the design and initial feel, but was hoping to be able to rate at least four.</li>
            <li>And if you really want a bigger one, ABC Oralcare has the AFT brushes for larger mouths.</li>
            <li>I assumed that bigger, stronger, firmer would mean better.  </li>
            <li>The small head actually cleans my teeth better than the larger version</li>
            <li>General</li>
            <li>I just got these in the mail today and have brushed twice with them so far.</li>
            <li>I realized awhile back that I needed to buy a softer toothbrush for my sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just worried that maybe they won&#x27;t be soft enough for me.</li>
            <li>The dentist gave a full clearance a few months ago, and actually noted improvement.</li>
            <li>And the toothbrush is just right for my little</li>
            <li>In my experience, using red disclosing tablets to check cleaning, ordinary drug store nylon bristle brushes lose significant cleaning power after just a month.  </li>
            <li>They really do work in areas that other brushes cannot reach.</li>
            <li>They clean well, the bristles do not get hard as a rock like others.</li>
            <li>it said medium, not soft, but these are softer than nylon extra soft brushes!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those bad people who doesn&#x27;t floss regularly, so I am really happy with these smaller bristles that get in between teeth and around the gums.</li>
            <li>I can never reach far back and the back of my front teeth with these brushes.</li>
            <li>Looking at the pictures I was a bit worried that the plastic part of the brush head would be too thick, making access to back teeth a challenge, as is the case with some cheap brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It is these tips when you use this brush and so very gently vibrant it with your brushing hand (about 3 to 4 mm; not much)</li>
            <li>Be using these beautiful black toothbrushes for several years now after switching to them due to concern about how even the softest nylon bristle brushes were irritating my gums &amp; causing some erosion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long these will last since it is very soft.</li>
            <li>This helped considerably but takes a long time to accomplish</li>
            <li>I really like the black bristles.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first of the black bristles but they seem fine.</li>

            <li> May be it good for kids?</li>
            <li> But the price is really good</li>
            <li> One good thing about this brush though:</li>
            <li> I am tossing the Dr. Perio brush as I gave it a good run, but it just feels like plastic when I pick it up these days.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is good.</li>
            <li> have tried Dr. Collins and those are good too</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t bang the good</li>
            <li> Probably good to avoid these.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums are already in good shape, but I think that using these toothbrushes will make them even healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In any case, these are good brushes, and I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> Otherwise he said my teeth were is good condition</li>
            <li> i decide to buy these instead of the nimbus brand, while they are good, they are just not comparable to nimbus.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean and it does an excellent job between teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I tried these.  </li>
            <li> Besides the attractive appearance, the brushes work better than my usuals that I get in the grocery store.</li>
            <li> But if it helps keep them more germ free then awesome!</li>
            <li> I love these tooth brushes!</li>
            <li> but I am sure you can make do!</li>
            <li> But as soon as I got these in the mail my teeth felt better as soon as I used it!</li>

            <li> Every nice toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> And effectively removes a lot of the plaque built up.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t ever loved brushing my teeth, but this toothbrush makes it enjoyable.</li>
            <li> out fast, but still cost effective and the best manual toothbrush ever.</li>
            <li> These just get a kind of \\&quot;fuzzy\\</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are super great.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve found for my very sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> The Yorum brushes are much more affordable and I like the results better!</li>
            <li> an antibacterial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tips of these bristles are very fine and do an excellent job of helping clear out the pockets around my teeth and works wonders on my tongue too!  </li>
            <li> Every dentist and hygienist i&#x27;ve talked to says soft is the best for your gums...</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s nice, but I won&#x27;t use all 5 in the pack, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best toothbrushes I ever used.</li>
            <li> (a good water swish does the trick most times); and they Fit in the curve of my front teeth</li>
            <li> They feel very pleasant, but not overly soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Also, very importantly.</li>
            <li> The bristles are designed to function way better than any US made toothbrush I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> , I believe, is what most dentist&#x27;s recommend.</li>
            <li> I never knew toothbrush love till I encountered these.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love them dearly.</li>
            <li> These are the most awsume tooth brushes I have ever used, and I have been using toothbrushed for 70 years.</li>
            <li> Better than most toothbrushes out there</li>
            <li> My kids love them, too.</li>
            <li> This is the same as the Shaha 5 toothbrush, which is the best toothbrush ever.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner than they have for years and my gums are healthier to boot! :-)</li>
            <li> This brush also fits better in her mouth.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS TOOTHBRUSH.</li>
            <li> at Target, used it for two days, and had to order more of these immediately.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why everyone should floss, though most of us don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend doesn&#x27;t like that he has to take a bit longer to brush his teeth, but likes the way his mouth feels fresher for more of the day after using it.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes.</li>
            <li> These compact head brushes are wonderful, especially if you have sore gums.  </li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes!&lt;br /&gt;Wear</li>
            <li> In search for the best manual toothbrush for gums, gum pockets, and back molars</li>
            <li> any more extractions/etc.  </li>
            <li> Healthy Teeth - Healthy Body]]</li>
            <li> Please see my 5 star review for more of my comments on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an engineer, so I love it when a product&#x27;s results can be measured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Simply put, this is the best toothbrush I have ever used.</li>
            <li> &quot; look to the top.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Want better and healthier gums?</li>
            <li> Will buy again for sure</li>
            <li> I find this handle to be very comfortable and the brush easily moves about my mouth.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great toothbrush for kids and anyone with very sensitive gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed that the bonded spot is becoming darker than the rest of the tooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to get the backs of my front teeth bonded as well because my teeth are becoming increasingly transparent.</li>
            <li> The bristles were noticeably soft and I didn&#x27;t believe it would do a great job of cleaning</li>
            <li> I loved it after first time use, deeply clean, durable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> - now there&#x27;s a notice for it on the product page), nonetheless they are able to get into every crevice of your teeth and gums, leaving an exceptionally clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> Nor do I get any sense that the plastic handles will break easily; they seem sturdy to me.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t even have to clean my tongue any more.</li>
            <li> I thought these were pretty nice when I got them, but over time I realized that they were not efficient at cleaning between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Amazon for me has become a good place to find products and read actual customer product reviews - I found on Amazon \\&quot;Healthy Teeth, Healthy Body\\&quot; by Tom McGuire</li>
            <li> OMG I really love these tooth brushes , they are perfect not to big and the bristles are gentle on the teeth.</li>
            <li> I like the fine bristles on these brushes.</li>
            <li> Their tapered edge really gets in difficulty spots and they have held up nicely too.</li>
            <li> They are nothing fancy but they are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> , smooth clean.&lt;br /&gt;Enter these brushes&lt;br /&gt;LOVE</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazingly effective and gentle.</li>
            <li> like the brush size as it is great for people with smaller</li>
            <li> The results really are amazing.</li>
            <li> Which is how I discovered these - and available on Amazon which meant with my Prime membership</li>
            <li> I ordered these toothbrushes based on all of the great reviews, so its possible this was a fluke.</li>
            <li> It cleans all of my teeth quite comfortably.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush isn&#x27;t good at all for an adult,  </li>
            <li> A good dentist will tell you to use a soft brush in my experience.</li>
            <li> Soft brushes still go against my grain - I grew up using Boar Bristle brushes and loved them - but the gum damage and enamel damage snuck up on me.  </li>
            <li> Soft and good quality.</li>
            <li> Although the color of the brush head could be made more appealing (like white), I still think this is the best tooth brush ever, better than any other manual/electronic ones.</li>
            <li> again.&lt;br /&gt;it makes me very clean and fresh</li>
            <li> these are waay softer than any toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used before, they feel great, and if you have sensitive gums that bleed easily you can confidently brush the right way (scrubbing at the gum line to get the bristles really into the gums) without the pain associated with harsher toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fell in love with them from the first use.</li>
            <li> These have a shorter life, no more than 3 weeks (and two might be best).</li>
            <li> This works perfect for me since I have a small mouth.  </li>
            <li> I bought these brushes originally for their size and softness.</li>
            <li> Absolutely clean feeling.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean.  </li>
            <li> and I was amazed by how clean my teeth felt.</li>
            <li> Mouth just feels clean when I done brushing.</li>
            <li> But with a tiny bit of patience to do things the right way, these brushes will make your dentist really happy.</li>
            <li> But with a tiny bit of patience to do things the right way, these brushes will make your dentist really happy.</li>
            <li> WaterPik also makes a special tip for the gum pockets [[ASIN:B000V2DN2O</li>
            <li> I have used the entire pack now and those areas are no longer sensitive, but brushing still feels very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I like the very tapered handles and amazingly, the super-soft bristles do seem to do a better job than the store-bought soft toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Overall a good brush though.</li>
            <li> Like i said, soft and nice on the gums.</li>
            <li> loved my toothbrush so much in the first two days, my SO bought a whole pack.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great advantage as many infections of the mouth occurs in these hard to reach places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very fine soft bristles that clean well without killing your&#x27; gums.</li>
            <li> This is my new toothbrush! :-)</li>
            <li> However after using it for a year, I see why it it better for it to be smaller, because I can get in between the teeth much better.</li>
            <li> I am super diligent about oral care.</li>
            <li> We are now a loyal customer</li>
            <li> and it progresses rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, I found these.</li>
            <li> I am happy to see that  they definitely brush better than the standard toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Eventually the gum pocket becomes irritated and inflamed causing this inflamation to deepen the gum pocket to over the 3 mm sized considered to be normal by many professionals.  </li>
            <li> It is so unbelievably soft and the tapered ends really do clean your gumline much better.</li>
            <li> , this is the best cleaning, most comfortable, least damaging to my teeth, longest lasting toothbrush</li>
            <li> I can see how these would be better for someone with very sensitive gums, but they just don&#x27;t get the job done.  </li>
            <li> My mother in low started to use it and she is happy with a new brush.</li>
            <li> ; The size is perfect, the black natural antibacterial stuff hasn&#x27;t come off in 6 months.</li>
            <li> I wanted Soft!!!!!</li>
            <li> Loved how smooth my teeth feel and how little irritation there is on my gums.</li>
            <li> Another point I want to make is that it feels so good using this toothbrush that I actually am able to notice when I do start brushing too hard because the sensation changes.  </li>
            <li> so I can brush them with a rotating motion (gently) instead of up/down as I had to before because the Gigantores couldn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> have sensitive teeth that love plaque.</li>
            <li> It gets an okay rating because I did like how soft the bristles were.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and gums, and am satisfied with these brushes.</li>
            <li> but it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Even though they may not be for eeveryone, however is worth a try.</li>
            <li> I almost thought it wouldn&#x27;t do the jobs because of the fine soft bristles but my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> Yup, you read that right.  </li>
            <li> I think I made the right call.</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that my husband is in dentistry and can get all kinds of toothbrushes cheaply, I order these from Amazon because they are soft but effective and, IMO, far better than the standard brands.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love them, The black bristles are so cool and different.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these comfortable brushes to anyone.</li>
            <li> the ultra-fine, soft bristles get my teeth really clean and my gums seem healthier already!</li>
            <li> Love them, the head is not too large, the bristles are soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles are so fine, it fluffs away the grime quickly and efficiently, and since it&#x27;s so small, it perfectly fits down into the tray, unlike the AFT.     </li>
            <li> - It costs me $4 and is currently available on Amazon from $3.96 New and $0.01 used plus shipping.  </li>
            <li> The handle has been specially designed with engineered bends that allow one to more easily access brushing of the back of the back molars, and its small brush size allows for it to be more effective where the teeth meet together.  </li>
            <li> I had a Sensodyne soft toothbrush that cleaned more thoroughly and gently.</li>
            <li> To be fair I was torn between these and Dr Collins&#x27; but the antibacterial properties of the black dye on the bristles tipped the scale in favour of these and quite frankly</li>
            <li> Super soft bristles, the first set of bruches to get my teeth clean and not make me bleed</li>
            <li> very gentle bristled toothbrush</li>
            <li> not only did not have any initial break-in problems but the toothbrush felt very nice - almost like a massage for the teeth.  </li>
            <li> i know it states soft ultra fine</li>
            <li> that allows the fine soft tips to enter the gum pocket (AKA sulcus) to dislodge the decaying debris.  </li>
            <li> Maybe the upper most bristles could be construed as fine, but it is by no means a soft bristled brush.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re</li>
            <li> They are soft and tapered and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> I initially though the Dr Collins was better, but I have determined my teeth get cleaner and whiter with this</li>
            <li> This is definitely smaller than most of toothbrushes on the U.S market.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is NO bleeding anymore, unless I go to bed without brushing first.</li>
            <li> The brushes last easily more than 6 months each.</li>
            <li> I have used some similar toothbrushes, but these seem to be of higher quality than most.</li>
            <li> I used these toothbrushes at my parent&#x27;s house for the first time</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are far more comfortable to brush with than any brush I could find in local stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush broke during the first use and I ended up with a mouthful of bristle and the handle material.</li>
            <li> The ones I was ordering were pretty...</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s smaller, it takes a bit more time to clean all your teeth but that way you can take your time and actually deliver a thorough clean.</li>
            <li> , I think my teeth was more yellow afterward because as I said the brush is too soft to  effectively clean the teeth.</li>
            <li> The head is a great size for me because I found it very easy to manuever around the back teeth and behind the teeth without irritation.</li>
            <li> No other soft bristle has done such a great job.</li>
            <li> Also, if anyone can compare the softness difference between the Yorum 5 and Sanha 5 (the ultra fine and the sensitive medium) I&#x27;d really appreciate it.</li>
            <li> The brush is OK, and they do a fine job brushing your teeth, but the problem is that the black bristles lose color in your mouth!  </li>
            <li> I find that adult tooth brushes do not get my hind teeth properly clean.</li>
            <li> This is what I&#x27;ve always done, and I have not had an issue with this toothbrush being too soft to help clean my tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is actually a good thing: slow and steady motions over time is far better for your enamel and tooth health.</li>
            <li> Many of the similar toothbrushes I&#x27;ve tried had handles that flexed too much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to reach back molars and the tapered bristles are much better at dislodging food between teeth (if you brush with vertical motions).</li>
            <li> While it might seem a little gross I have found it very important to do my own periodic dental exams</li>
            <li> The brush is not so soft you can&#x27;t apply more pressure if you would like, but you really don&#x27;t have to; even this soft, you can feel the difference.</li>
            <li> I like them pretty much.</li>
            <li> I really hope they continue to manufacture these exactly as they are now.</li>
            <li> think I&#x27;ve covered pretty much everything about the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a soft toothbrush that would be gentle on gums and yet clean well.</li>
            <li> The head is pretty small but actually just perfect for toddlers and young children.  </li>
            <li> So, these bristles are super soft and</li>
            <li> And the black just kind of wears off the ends into like a yellowish color.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> but the brush size is to large and when trying the children version</li>
            <li> This toothbrush maneuvers very well back there and is able to thoroughly clean every side of my back</li>
            <li> I bought these toothbrushes after I stopped going to my dentist whom also used similar toothbrushes with fine bristles.  </li>
            <li> If you want fine bristle, just buy white or colorless one, don&#x27;t buy black-bristle tooth brush!</li>
            <li> The black bristles are super soft and super fine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why American tooth brushes are so huge.</li>
            <li> Some folks have commented that they didn&#x27;t feel that this tooth brush properly cleaned between their teeth- unless you have huge gaps between your teeth</li>
            <li> I was drawn to these toothbrushes because of the unusual color.  </li>
            <li> They are gentle but thorough.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really like these.</li>
            <li> my whole life</li>
            <li> I found this to be very helpful cleaning my teeth thoroughly.   </li>
            <li> but I really feel the difference and felt like I don&#x27;t even need to use my floss.</li>
            <li> and I really like them.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve been told repeatedly to be gentle when I brush.</li>
            <li> Which I am, but it helps when you have a toothbrush that&#x27;s gentle also.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell a difference.</li>
            <li> The bristles are gentle; they get between the teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced you could use one of this toothbrushes  for a whole year.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t do their whole program which includes brushing with the product.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> It brushes off with very vigorous brushing.</li>
            <li> My teeth get much cleaner than with the toothbrushes you get nowadays where the bristles are thicker.</li>
            <li> They do make my mouth feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li> I brush very rigorously and don&#x27;t have issues with tarter or bleeding</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I placed the order I received a really nice personal email from this Vendor - with some extra tips and to contact him with any questions.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> At first most people would say why is it black?  </li>
            <li> numbers\\&quot; (indicator of how much the gums cover the teeth) has significantly improved over my last 2 visits (so 1 year).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i have used soft  soft brushes that adequately clean my teeth and just didnt...</li>
            <li> Stick with the original brush with the white bristles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not me, this has NEVER happened with any other brush.</li>
            <li> find that my teeth get better cleaning with these than other manual brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been changing up my whole tooth care routine, and these are a main staple in that routine now.</li>
            <li> It fits well in my mouth, is larger than child sized tooth brushes, and leaves my teeth feeling clean all day.</li>
            <li> The bristles work, my teeth feel clean, without further removing enamel.</li>
            <li> I used these to help clean in between my gums and such.</li>
            <li> These are great, especially with people that have small mouths and crowded teeth.</li>
            <li> Another device that helps clean the gum pockets is an oral water irrigator, such as, [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]].  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m doing my best to not brush too hard as my previous brush was a medium.</li>
            <li> The tapered bristles for instance are super refined and manufactured to a  very high standard.</li>
            <li> The small head makes the toothbrush easy to maneuver, and the soft bristles are easy on the gums.</li>
            <li> The only difference is more open space and maneuverability in large mouths.</li>
            <li> For a while I was special ordering similar toothbrushes made from Japan.</li>
            <li> nice toothbrushes, small heads make it really easy to reach the far back teeth, I have all my molars and wisdom teeth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how soft the bristles are (I have receding gums, so I can only use the softest bristles) and how deeply they penetrate.</li>
            <li> The big brushes are good for quick brushing but never good for cleaning everywhere.</li>
            <li> black bristles are an interesting spin.</li>
            <li> I love the black bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most of these Korean, black bristle brushes brag about their activated charcoal.</li>
            <li> only concern is that they wear out quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that I could use them even longer because unlike regular toothbrushes these bristles don&#x27;t have the same wear pattern.</li>
            <li> As I got older, my concerns for dental hygiene have shot through the roof.</li>
            <li> But as the style of toothbrushes changed to these gigantic bristles that barely fit into my smallish mouth AND it became harder to find softer bristles, my gums bled freely and never really felt clean (even with constant flossing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> highly recommend them to anyone that uses a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> high quality tooth brush...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> However, I bought the Colgate charcoal soft tooth brush for myself, which was too large to maneuver in a child&#x27;s mouth.</li>
            <li> Soft and clean deep than otherones</li>
            <li> When debris is left in the gum pocket it can block the gum&#x27;s natural ability to use saliva to keep the gum pockets clean.  </li>
            <li> Had to switch to soft brushes a couple of years ago because my gums were receding alarmingly fast.  </li>
            <li> Plus the price is great, at $2 a brush, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> , DDS - this book has become my plan of action to really take charge of my dental</li>
            <li> I have tried a few dentist-recommended brushes, an electric toothbrush (Oral-B), specialty brushes and located this one day while still searching for a better toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The bristles are small AND soft, perfect for my small mouth and tender gums.</li>
            <li> in all, I am very pleased and I will continue to buy from this manufacturer as long as the larger size toothbrushes are of the same quality.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t quite the same as the ones I was ordering, but it&#x27;s pretty much there.</li>
            <li> After a few months of using this brush, I do feel as if my oral hygiene is better maintained.  </li>
            <li> I agonized over which next generation toothbrush to buy for our 3 year old but luckily decided on these.  </li>
            <li> I do find that since using this toothbrush my gums are less sensitive and respond better to flossing.</li>
            <li> This is the new toothbrush for me.</li>
            <li> The sensation was completely new.</li>
            <li> Activated charcoal is a very very cheap, easy way to whiten your teeth (though it makes a huge mess if you&#x27;re not careful, I do it in the shower or over running water and use my hand to help wash the charcoal down) and this may just seem cosmetic, but since I live with other people...</li>
            <li> Also, the handle is narrow which is a good thing because thicker handles cause people to brush harder.</li>
            <li> This is a comfortable, well made brush, with soft cleaning bristles; however, these are not very suitable for an average adult mouth: the brush head are very small, perhaps best suited to children.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Of special note the author has the only small size dental mirror with an LED light built in I could find anywhere for just under $8</li>
            <li> you want a fast, quick fix for your teeth that brushes down your enamel</li>
            <li> you want a fast, quick fix for your teeth that brushes down your enamel</li>
            <li> My old toothbrush feels like I&#x27;m bulldozing my teeth!  </li>
            <li> The heads are small, but I find the size encourages me to be more mindful and deliberate in the brushing process.</li>
            <li> You can also get these in a larger head as well; I saw two other types and there may be more.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I brush first with activated charcoal, then with regular toothpaste (1 minute each), rinsing with water in between.</li>
            <li> I have an extremely small mouth and tried children&#x27;s toothbrushes but the bristles, if anything were even more abrasive.  </li>
            <li> Enter this brush; wow!</li>
            <li> , is that I have a small spot of that resin bonding stuff on one of my front top teeth where I chipped the surface.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the small head.</li>
            <li> They are smaller than what I preferred, but they worked out pretty well for me.</li>
            <li> Other than that it gets the job done my teeth are clean.</li>
            <li> Soft, cleans deep corner very gently...</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft, long, and very fine - I feel them get into the cracks of my teeth the way that other brushes never have!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and have always had problems with full size toothbrushes not getting my back teeth as clean as I like.</li>
            <li> The heads of the brushes are small too, which is nice for people like myself, who have smaller mouths.</li>
            <li> Not only do they look cool, but the germ prevention is a big seller, too.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive gums and so far no irritation.</li>
            <li> other soft toothbrushes would leave my teeth feeling like they just weren&#x27;t that clean.</li>
            <li> The difference is that these are a little bit bigger -- which is totally fine and still works!</li>
            <li> I was curious about them and a little wary, but they arrived quickly and do a wonderful job.</li>
            <li> I have large teeth in a smaller sized jaw; because of this I&#x27;ve frequently purchased child sized tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> Now I see that my former toothbrushes were kind of tearing up the backs of my gums and also discouraging me from brushing molars and neighbors really well because it was just hard to get the brush in back there.  </li>
            <li> After getting use to it, I slept over a friend&#x27;s house and had to use a new toothbrush and brushing with a regular one was a lot more difficult to clean everywhere</li>
            <li> The soft bristles are really gentle on gums, unlike regular toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> The small size of these brushes are great, no more issues brushing in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have a smaller mouth and to top it off, my jaw doesn&#x27;t open as wide as it&#x27;s suppose to.</li>
            <li> &quot; it means soft.</li>
            <li> I sometimes have a problem with sensitive gums and these brushes don&#x27;t hurt  when my gums are sensitive.</li>
            <li> I like how soft they are.</li>
            <li> Those tooth brushes have compact head and soft bristles.</li>
            <li> ; I stopped caring when I felt how soft the bristles were, and how microfine they are.</li>
            <li> She told me she opened up of my 8-month old son&#x27;s toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes because my gums are sensitive.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums were sensitive before I began using these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my six-year old.</li>
            <li> You can brush your gums and even your tongue and it feels soft.</li>
            <li> Next time I will purchase the larger size that is available by the same manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t brush thoroughly enough because the soft bristles don&#x27;t scrub as fast as my old walmart electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually natural charcoal which acts as</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t feel to soft either.</li>
            <li> They are durable and soft the way I like a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel like a professional cleaning after</li>
            <li> When switching from a regular Nylon bristled brush you can really tell the difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read reviews where people did not think these bristles were soft.</li>
            <li> They are the softest I&#x27;ve ever felt, and I was using ultra soft children&#x27;s toothbrushes before I switched.</li>
            <li> An ultra soft children&#x27;s was replaced about every 5 days.</li>
            <li> An adult soft every two weeks.</li>
            <li> It says medium is what we consider soft and all the reviews talk about how soft they are.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> However the relatively low cost of these brushes makes them economical to use even with the short life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I was able to purchase a few, they all had heads that were bigger than I cared for.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thin enamel on my teeth and things like wine or grape juice kind of \\&quot;stick to\\&quot; my teeth.</li>
            <li> BUT the black bristles on this model of the brush are kind of gross - turns your toothpaste grey.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the new generation and new wave of brushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than the average toothbrush, but this makes it great for getting hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft so it doesn&#x27;t feel like I am destroying my teeth, but still clean my teeth</li>
            <li> they are one of the few that help clean your teeth without hurting your gums.</li>
            <li> In comparison to other manual brushes these seem better than other ones I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These brushes are very soft: I would consider these not just soft but extra soft</li>
            <li> The cheap toothbrushes marketed to children are so hard and cheap, my 3 year old was crying every night when we had to brush his teeth.  </li>
            <li> My mouth is kinda tight back there, so I LOVE the smaller head.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these brushes if you have a smaller mouth.</li>
            <li> Also, I put a little more care into brushing since I don&#x27;t have a massive brush covering my entire mouth.</li>
            <li> The head itself is much smaller than a normal toothbrush</li>
            <li> My dentist said I was doing fine and then during a recent visit he found my back three of my back molars moving further back and creating a space between the teeth in front.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see in the future if that really impacts the brush&#x27;s bactericidal properties.&lt;br /&gt;For maximum effectiveness, brush with your toothpaste of choice (I swap between EarthPaste and Sensodyne), rinse your mouth and your toothbrush, and brush over your teeth for another 20ish seconds with just water.&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to the cleanest your teeth have ever been outside the dentist&#x27;s office!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it two stars for the design and initial feel, but was hoping to be able to rate at least four.</li>
            <li> And if you really want a bigger one, ABC Oralcare has the AFT brushes for larger mouths.</li>
            <li> I assumed that bigger, stronger, firmer would mean better.  </li>
            <li> The small head actually cleans my teeth better than the larger version</li>
            <li> General</li>
            <li> I just got these in the mail today and have brushed twice with them so far.</li>
            <li> I realized awhile back that I needed to buy a softer toothbrush for my sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just worried that maybe they won&#x27;t be soft enough for me.</li>
            <li> The dentist gave a full clearance a few months ago, and actually noted improvement.</li>
            <li> And the toothbrush is just right for my little</li>
            <li> In my experience, using red disclosing tablets to check cleaning, ordinary drug store nylon bristle brushes lose significant cleaning power after just a month.  </li>
            <li> They really do work in areas that other brushes cannot reach.</li>
            <li> They clean well, the bristles do not get hard as a rock like others.</li>
            <li> it said medium, not soft, but these are softer than nylon extra soft brushes!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those bad people who doesn&#x27;t floss regularly, so I am really happy with these smaller bristles that get in between teeth and around the gums.</li>
            <li> I can never reach far back and the back of my front teeth with these brushes.</li>
            <li> Looking at the pictures I was a bit worried that the plastic part of the brush head would be too thick, making access to back teeth a challenge, as is the case with some cheap brushes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It is these tips when you use this brush and so very gently vibrant it with your brushing hand (about 3 to 4 mm; not much)</li>
            <li> Be using these beautiful black toothbrushes for several years now after switching to them due to concern about how even the softest nylon bristle brushes were irritating my gums &amp; causing some erosion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long these will last since it is very soft.</li>
            <li> This helped considerably but takes a long time to accomplish</li>
            <li> I really like the black bristles.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first of the black bristles but they seem fine.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes can brush the teeth waaay back there (where only the floss could reach) and they fit the space where I lost a tooth and hide with a flipper, although I do still have to slow down</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a small toothbrush, but that&#x27;s irrelevant in my mind because I love the bristles so much.</li>
            <li> actually banged up my gums and mouth the first time I used this because I brush my teeth WAY too hard.</li>
            <li> head is small which allows me to get to my back molars really well.</li>
            <li> The small head is actually just what I needed, and I can&#x27;t explain why, but the surface of my teeth really do feel cleaner when I use these brushes.  </li>
            <li> The bristles feel very nice, I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve brushed my teeth with that plastic crap for so long.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for anyone with a large mouth, but I don&#x27;t see how a small brush would be a problem.</li>
            <li> Brushing does take longer due to the small size but it is worth the time and effort to take care of each individual tooth.  </li>
            <li> Nylon wears a long time, however, the new material in this toothbrush enables the bristle to be made the way they are - softer and some with special very thin tips.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I prefer the clear bristles to these black ones.</li>
            <li> The packaging says nothing about the black calcium placed on them for germ protection; I like that it offers further protection of the brush for my mouth.</li>
            <li> The softness of the brush allows for a gentle massage of gum line without irritation.(Stiff bristled brushes and excessive pressure can cause gum recession.)  </li>
            <li> The small brush and tapered bristles work very well.  </li>
            <li> Even trying to brush soft I would use those up in less than a week.</li>
            <li> far as the black calcium stuff on the bristles, I have not had any problems with it.</li>
            <li> Very soft but firm.</li>
            <li> I bought these looking to try something new from my usual AFT multiple pattern brush.</li>
            <li> addition, the fine bristles can reach the difficult places between tooth and gum as well as between teeth.</li>
            <li> Also, they say they are from black pearls, but I&#x27;ve never seen any pearls that are this black, so I wonder what the powder on the brushes really is, or if it has been dyed.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these toothbrushes if you want a REALLY small and compact head.</li>
            <li> Age, sugar, hard brushes - eliminated two factors and my gums and teeth are much healthier.</li>
            <li> seller is referring to another brush for larger mouths, but the bristles on that brush are widely staggered and not at all like this brush.</li>
            <li> I forgot to reorder these once and had to use a toothbrush I bought at the store for a few days and my teeth felt dirty pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Basically the \\&quot;head\\&quot; is too small and a bit of a pain, the bristles are very soft which</li>
            <li> The only other thing that bugs me is that there is no mention of whether or not the bristles are activated charcoal or carbon bristles.</li>
            <li> Water Pik Ultra Pik Pocket Replacement Tips]], and several other tips.</li>
            <li> My gums were receding because my previous toothbrushes were very rough, despite being labeled as soft.</li>
            <li> I have had gingivitis for years (a dry mouth syndrome I&#x27;ve been told), so my gums bleed even when using the softer commercial/generic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to a conventional toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The white brushes  with the larger head from a different company were way too hard and cumbersome.</li>
            <li> the brush is small and way way way way too soft...</li>
            <li> But with this small and soft toothbrush everywhere is reachable.   </li>
            <li> Micro filaments to get into crevices, soft to prevent damage, small head like my dentist recommended.  </li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are soft and small.</li>
            <li> bout how soft the bristles were and the toothbrush head so small.</li>
            <li> They feel weird at first, but after a few uses, it&#x27;s just like normal.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten any loose bristles either.  </li>
            <li> I have very little enamel left on my teeth, especially the front ones.</li>
            <li> I have had my wisdom teeth removed, but my mouth is very small and my back molars sit very far into the corners of my mouth and are still impossible to get clean with a regular size toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have been buying these toothbrushes for years (my previous ones had white heads though)</li>
            <li> After using these toothbrushes, my teeth and gums are no longer so sensitive to hot and cold foods.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for less than a year.</li>
            <li> I can barely fit in my mouth, and it&#x27;s practically impossible to brush back of my teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are the ultimate weapon for two specific things: people who brush their teeth too hard, and people who whiten their teeth with activated charcoal or use it in their tooth powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the head is smaller than I anticipated, even after looking at the comparison photo they provide.</li>
            <li> I am small, 5&#x27; tall, and small boned, etc., so I didn&#x27;t even bother to offer one to my husband because if it is too small for me then it surely will be too small for him.</li>
            <li> These bristles are rather short and stiff, even though they don&#x27;t appear that way in the photo.</li>
            <li> I moistened the brush, dipped it in baking soda and brushed for less than 30 seconds when I noticed and odd feeling and removed the brush to find it had broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The toothbrush head may be a little small if you&#x27;re an adult (and I bought these without knowing this</li>
            <li> The black bristle tends to fade a little and turn slightly yellow at the tip.</li>
            <li> I thought I must be crazy ordering special toothbrushes online</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews about them I decided to give them a try.  </li>
            <li> I like them as they are smaller than usual</li>
            <li> Have used other brushes that claimed to be \\&quot;soft\\&quot; that felt like sandpaper in my mouth.</li>
            <li> The only thing about the brush I do not like is the head of it is small.</li>
            <li> But these brushes have a tiny head with a small surface of bristles.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The head of this toothbrush is small enough it fits around teeth well without jabbing into me.</li>
            <li> My teeth have been whitened and I&#x27;ve had no issues with staining due to the color of the bristles.</li>
            <li> At first though was skeptical</li>
            <li> I have my wisdom teeth, so the small brush head allows for brushing all the way in back of the mouth.</li>
            <li> On the down side, the heads are shorter than I&#x27;d expected.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the head of this toothbrush is quite small, but it may be because I have big teeth.  </li>
            <li> I have always brushed too hard and this helps from harming your gums!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These already being black and simple in design, the charcoal washes away, and the tiny amounts that do stay behind are invisible, blending in with the already black bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For someone that needs a bit of re-wiring in the thinking department I could have either gone straight electric expensive, or 5 of these guys.</li>
            <li> Also, over time (presumable due to the toothpaste), the black bristles will discolor slightly at the tips</li>
            <li> Those pics that show this toothbrush can go into small space and clean out dirty stuff is misleading.  </li>
            <li> I tried one a few days ago, and not only was it uncomfortable but it felt like I was brushing with sandpaper or something, some rough, flat surface that was not contouring around my teeth.</li>
            <li> The black bristles are also unique...for a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It did take a moment to get over black bristles though.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the black bristles to be at all disconcerting.</li>
            <li> the tops are BLACK.  </li>
            <li> , blending in with the already black bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found my teeth were turning into black while using it,</li>
            <li> My teeth less bleeding then before.</li>
            <li> Also, because I brush with Charcoal, the bristles are black</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to worry about the charcoal turning the bristles black.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the black color fool you.</li>
            <li> And contrary to a review that stated the black color stained their teeth, they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The black of these bristles has not created any sort of issue as that.</li>
            <li> My toothpaste has never gotten a black tint or anything.</li>
            <li> I wonder if maybe the black of the bristles has contributed to the darkening of it.</li>
            <li> &quot; my see through teeth with something that is going to stain in less than a year.</li>
            <li> And I like the black bristles.</li>
            <li> But my teeth get dirty pretty</li>
            <li> so it gets kinda tight</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it goes bad quickly.   </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the  head on these are quite small.</li>
            <li> I am a compulsive hard brusher and have worn enamel and receded gums from my years of brushing very hard (always used a soft toothbrush).</li>
            <li> When I received them I thought what have I wasted my money on</li>
            <li> I just received these toothbrushes a few days ago, but I am already hooked.</li>
            <li> Nice color selection and does what it is intended use is for, cleaning your nasty mouth.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve had trouble with gums receding due to hard bristles on the softest brushes, these were the answer.</li>
            <li> I noticed I would spit black toothpaste!  </li>
            <li> still use my sonic toothbrush, but I use this toothbrush every other day before bed... or if I&#x27;m going to bed late and don&#x27;t want the noise...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to brushing your teeth under 2 minutes like I was, it&#x27;s a very slight learning curve.</li>

            <li> The head is a little small and</li>

            <li> small brush head that reaches anywhere when you brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite small, but it still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Not sure about adults</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the charcoal on these brushes helps or not.</li>
            <li> These are small, about the size of a Sonicare head or a child&#x27;s toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> This small size allowed me to reach my neglected molars.</li>
            <li> I also have a small mouth-</li>
            <li> These small brushes with tapered bristles, get into the sulcus - the small spot between tooth and gum, and allows a thorough cleaning without a lot of brushing.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if it IS an issue</li>
            <li> I was looking for small, compact toothbrushes and found these on Amazon.</li>
            <li> are small</li>
            <li> small.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve got a small mouth</li>
            <li> Using a full-sized toothbrush makes it difficult to get to my back teeth and cleaning under the center teeth is difficult too.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hardly noticeable and does not affect cleaning.  </li>
            <li> No matter how hard I scrubbed (which I tried not doing because of gum health), I could never get them squeaky</li>
            <li> dentists have a hard time working on me.</li>
            <li> This somewhat reminds me of common toothbrushes used in Asia which I missed a lot.  </li>
            <li> Why would I be crazy enough to do this or was it because I didn&#x27;t have anything else to do?&lt;br</li>
            <li> at least stahl</li>
            <li> Upon X-ray examination he told me in a very sorry way that I was experiencing \\&quot;external root</li>
            <li> , the small head allows you to reach difficult places</li>
            <li> and they do allow me to get into the nooks and crannies between and behind my teeth.  </li>
            <li> and he is also addicted to these brushes.</li>
            <li> Not sure how dangerous toothbrushes can be while brushing teeth.  </li>
            <li> Not good!  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t see how this toothbrush can get bad reviews for being small.</li>
            <li> In my search for improved oral health I had been using an expensive sonic toothbrush, with expensive replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Addicted to these toothbrushes!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m even counting the expensive electric ones.</li>
            <li> Brushing caused horrible problems - the brush would tear holes in my gums no matter how softly I brushed.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s crazy.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, but when I used it I could feel the bristles sliding up under my gums.</li>
            <li> I would prefer a longer head, but it&#x27;s not so bad that I would not buy these again.</li>
            <li> Brushing alone will not deter the bad guys from murdering your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> But I was shocked by the rigidity of the bristles.  </li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> These were truly awful.  </li>
            <li> terrible!.</li>

            <li> The bristles are designed to function way better than any US made toothbrush I&#x27;ve tried.  They are soft and tapered and comfortable to use.  My teeth feel cleaner than when I have to use my spare old-school toothbrush. My old toothbrush feels like I&#x27;m bulldozing my teeth!  Why doesn&#x27;t every brand make ones like these?</li>
            <li> I was drawn to these toothbrushes because of the unusual color.  After reading other reviews about them I decided to give them a try.  I like them as they are smaller than usual and they do allow me to get into the nooks and crannies between and behind my teeth.  I haven&#x27;t gotten any loose bristles either.  They are gentle but thorough.  Will order them again.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes rock.  Their tapered edge really gets in difficulty spots and they have held up nicely too.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush and tried t for about 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;I regret the purchase as I received 5. Basically the \\&quot;head\\&quot; is too small and a bit of a pain, the bristles are very soft which, I believe, is what most dentist&#x27;s recommend.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush isn&#x27;t good at all for an adult,  Those pics that show this toothbrush can go into small space and clean out dirty stuff is misleading.  Why? The brush is too soft to anything, let alone dirty stuff and god-know-what-else    I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, I think my teeth was more yellow afterward because as I said the brush is too soft to  effectively clean the teeth. May be it good for kids?</li>
            <li> At first I was disappointed in the small sized head on the toothbrush. However after using it for a year, I see why it it better for it to be smaller, because I can get in between the teeth much better. I have used this and the DR Collins for a year now. I initially though the Dr Collins was better, but I have determined my teeth get cleaner and whiter with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goodluck,&lt;br /&gt;Matthew</li>
            <li> Super soft bristles, the first set of bruches to get my teeth clean and not make me bleed</li>
            <li> the brush is small and way way way way too soft... i know it states soft ultra fine... i have used soft  soft brushes that adequately clean my teeth and just didnt... u have to use tons of pressure to get any results... and its just small.</li>
            <li> small brush head that reaches anywhere when you brush your teeth. Absolutely clean feeling. Although the color of the brush head could be made more appealing (like white), I still think this is the best tooth brush ever, better than any other manual/electronic ones. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I bought these toothbrushes after I stopped going to my dentist whom also used similar toothbrushes with fine bristles.  I absolutely loved them, and was glad I found these.  The toothbrush head may be a little small if you&#x27;re an adult (and I bought these without knowing this - now there&#x27;s a notice for it on the product page), nonetheless they are able to get into every crevice of your teeth and gums, leaving an exceptionally clean feeling.  Also, over time (presumable due to the toothpaste), the black bristles will discolor slightly at the tips but it&#x27;s hardly noticeable and does not affect cleaning.  Just an observation.  They are nothing fancy but they are fantastic.  The black bristles are also unique...for a toothbrush.  These are the only ones I will buy from now on.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I really like these. I was curious about them and a little wary, but they arrived quickly and do a wonderful job. the ultra-fine, soft bristles get my teeth really clean and my gums seem healthier already! I was a medium brush guy my whole life and I am totally hooked on these now. No other soft bristle has done such a great job.</li>
            <li> I never knew toothbrush love till I encountered these.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive teeth that love plaque. I am super diligent about oral care. I floss daily and use mouthwash. But my teeth get dirty pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;All other soft toothbrushes would leave my teeth feeling like they just weren&#x27;t that clean. No matter how hard I scrubbed (which I tried not doing because of gum health), I could never get them squeaky, smooth clean.&lt;br /&gt;Enter these brushes&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THEM&lt;br /&gt;The head is small which allows me to get to my back molars really well. My mouth is kinda tight back there, so I LOVE the smaller head.&lt;br /&gt;The black bristles are an interesting spin. We&#x27;ll see in the future if that really impacts the brush&#x27;s bactericidal properties.&lt;br /&gt;For maximum effectiveness, brush with your toothpaste of choice (I swap between EarthPaste and Sensodyne), rinse your mouth and your toothbrush, and brush over your teeth for another 20ish seconds with just water.&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to the cleanest your teeth have ever been outside the dentist&#x27;s office!&lt;br /&gt;I loved my toothbrush so much in the first two days, my SO bought a whole pack.&lt;br /&gt;Never stop making these! I love them dearly.</li>
            <li> Every nice toothbrushes.  My teeth feel clean.  I have very sensitive gums and so far no irritation. Recommended!</li>
            <li> Best toothbrushes ever. General but get the job done.</li>
            <li> This somewhat reminds me of common toothbrushes used in Asia which I missed a lot.  Thus I discovered this on Amazon and ordered.    This is definitely smaller than most of toothbrushes on the U.S market.  I found this to be very helpful cleaning my teeth thoroughly.   The big brushes are good for quick brushing but never good for cleaning everywhere. I can never reach far back and the back of my front teeth with these brushes. But with this small and soft toothbrush everywhere is reachable.   This toothbrush takes longer time to brush but I really feel the difference and felt like I don&#x27;t even need to use my floss. I still went on flossing anyway and discovered big difference.   I don&#x27;t know how long these will last since it is very soft. But the price is really good so I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it goes bad quickly.   I think this is a great toothbrush for kids and anyone with very sensitive gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazingly effective and gentle. The heads are small, but I find the size encourages me to be more mindful and deliberate in the brushing process. The softness of the brush allows for a gentle massage of gum line without irritation.(Stiff bristled brushes and excessive pressure can cause gum recession.)  In my search for improved oral health I had been using an expensive sonic toothbrush, with expensive replacement heads. The Yorum brushes are much more affordable and I like the results better!</li>
            <li> I love these tooth brushes! I have a smaller mouth and to top it off, my jaw doesn&#x27;t open as wide as it&#x27;s suppose to. Using a full-sized toothbrush makes it difficult to get to my back teeth and cleaning under the center teeth is difficult too. These brushes are very soft: I would consider these not just soft but extra soft so I&#x27;m doing my best to not brush too hard as my previous brush was a medium. A good dentist will tell you to use a soft brush in my experience. The packaging says nothing about the black calcium placed on them for germ protection; I like that it offers further protection of the brush for my mouth. I have always used Oral-B or GUM varieties of brushes but these seem to be of equal quality. I would highly recommend these brushes if you have a smaller mouth. You can also get these in a larger head as well; I saw two other types and there may be more.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my kids, knowing they were for smaller mouths.  But I was shocked by the rigidity of the bristles.  Maybe the upper most bristles could be construed as fine, but it is by no means a soft bristled brush.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re using them, but I will never reorder this brand.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrushes I have ever used</li>
            <li> I have been buying these toothbrushes for years (my previous ones had white heads though) and I really like them. The bristles are soft so it doesn&#x27;t feel like I am destroying my teeth, but still clean my teeth well. The heads of the brushes are small too, which is nice for people like myself, who have smaller mouths.</li>
            <li> I just got these in the mail today and have brushed twice with them so far. The produced discription says &amp;#34;Soft&amp;#34; but on the actual packaging they read &amp;#34;Medium&amp;#34;. I wanted Soft!!!!! and you should too. Every dentist and hygienist i&#x27;ve talked to says soft is the best for your gums...</li>
            <li> very gentle bristled toothbrush</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve found for my very sensitive gums. When it says \\&quot;soft,\\&quot; it means soft. Have used other brushes that claimed to be \\&quot;soft\\&quot; that felt like sandpaper in my mouth. The head is a little small and the price with shipping added, is a bit pricey but I&#x27;d certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> These are the most awsume tooth brushes I have ever used, and I have been using toothbrushed for 70 years. When I received them I thought what have I wasted my money on and then I used it. WOW! This toothbrush got things out of my teeth that I didn&#x27;t know was there. Been using them for a couple of months and they are just as sturdy now as when they were new.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend them to anyone that uses a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> nice toothbrushes, small heads make it really easy to reach the far back teeth, I have all my molars and wisdom teeth so it gets kinda tight but these toothbrushes do the job</li>
            <li> I bought these looking to try something new from my usual AFT multiple pattern brush. Well, it&#x27;s nice, but I won&#x27;t use all 5 in the pack, that&#x27;s for sure. It&#x27;s quite small, but it still gets the job done. My teeth actually feel cleaner with a shorter brushing time than they did with the AFT brush, which makes no sense. Or maybe it does, since I&#x27;m focusing on smaller areas? I don&#x27;t know. All I know is, I&#x27;m gonna go back to the AFT eventually. One good thing about this brush though: it&#x27;s perfect for cleaning mouth trays/retainers/invisalign trays. The bristles are so fine, it fluffs away the grime quickly and efficiently, and since it&#x27;s so small, it perfectly fits down into the tray, unlike the AFT.     Overall, if you&#x27;re unsure about which brush to buy, just follow what abcOralCare says: These Yorums for kids, AFTs for adults.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a soft toothbrush that would be gentle on gums and yet clean well. These bristles are rather short and stiff, even though they don&#x27;t appear that way in the photo. I had a Sensodyne soft toothbrush that cleaned more thoroughly and gently. If softness and fullness are your priorities, you might not like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> - Great material that feels \\&quot;good\\&quot; on your gums&lt;br /&gt;- Durable&lt;br /&gt;- Great price&lt;br /&gt;- Better than most toothbrushes out there&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy them - period.</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that my husband is in dentistry and can get all kinds of toothbrushes cheaply, I order these from Amazon because they are soft but effective and, IMO, far better than the standard brands. I sometimes have a problem with sensitive gums and these brushes don&#x27;t hurt  when my gums are sensitive. My kids love them, too. Though my husband is not as choosy about toothbrushes as I am, I have noticed that he has quietly switched to using these himself at home and doesn&#x27;t bring the standard brand toothbrushes home to use anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I tried these.  The small head is actually just what I needed, and I can&#x27;t explain why, but the surface of my teeth really do feel cleaner when I use these brushes.  Soft brushes still go against my grain - I grew up using Boar Bristle brushes and loved them - but the gum damage and enamel damage snuck up on me.  Had to switch to soft brushes a couple of years ago because my gums were receding alarmingly fast.  Age, sugar, hard brushes - eliminated two factors and my gums and teeth are much healthier.</li>
            <li> I agonized over which next generation toothbrush to buy for our 3 year old but luckily decided on these.  The cheap toothbrushes marketed to children are so hard and cheap, my 3 year old was crying every night when we had to brush his teeth.  I realized he wasn&#x27;t crying for no reason and that the bristles were so hard they were probably hurting his gums.  So, these bristles are super soft and no amount of brushing is going to hurt your gums or theirs.  Plus the price is great, at $2 a brush, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  The head is pretty small but actually just perfect for toddlers and young children.  Not sure about adults but I am sure you can make do! However, I bought the Colgate charcoal soft tooth brush for myself, which was too large to maneuver in a child&#x27;s mouth.</li>
            <li> I like the fine bristles on these brushes. I always have used tooth brushes with smaller heads so the size didn&#x27;t bug me. I like how soft they are. I have very sensitive teeth so I&#x27;ve been told repeatedly to be gentle when I brush. Which I am, but it helps when you have a toothbrush that&#x27;s gentle also. I forgot to reorder these once and had to use a toothbrush I bought at the store for a few days and my teeth felt dirty pretty quickly. But as soon as I got these in the mail my teeth felt better as soon as I used it! I use charcoal sometimes to brush my teeth and it does help them get whiter. I&#x27;m not sure if the charcoal on these brushes helps or not. I can&#x27;t really tell a difference. But if it helps keep them more germ free then awesome! I just don&#x27;t know if it actually does or not. But the shape and size of the brush are wonderful!</li>
            <li> very good qualiy and confortable. I loved it after first time use, deeply clean, durable.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why American tooth brushes are so huge. I can barely fit in my mouth, and it&#x27;s practically impossible to brush back of my teeth. Those tooth brushes have compact head and soft bristles. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. The best toothbrushes you can get.</li>
            <li> This is the same as the Shaha 5 toothbrush, which is the best toothbrush ever.  Micro filaments to get into crevices, soft to prevent damage, small head like my dentist recommended.  BUT the black bristles on this model of the brush are kind of gross - turns your toothpaste grey. Also, they say they are from black pearls, but I&#x27;ve never seen any pearls that are this black, so I wonder what the powder on the brushes really is, or if it has been dyed.  Stick with the original brush with the white bristles, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush I have ever owned. I have tried a few dentist-recommended brushes, an electric toothbrush (Oral-B), specialty brushes and located this one day while still searching for a better toothbrush. I found it. The bristles are not plastic/nylon feeling and I forgot what they are made of; I stopped caring when I felt how soft the bristles were, and how microfine they are. They really do work in areas that other brushes cannot reach. The brush is not so soft you can&#x27;t apply more pressure if you would like, but you really don&#x27;t have to; even this soft, you can feel the difference. I am tossing the Dr. Perio brush as I gave it a good run, but it just feels like plastic when I pick it up these days. I will become a subscriber, but 6 were received and I get the feeling that one will last quite a while (over a month into it and no wear signs at all). (FYI - receding gums issue, no gum inflammation disorders like others have described)  Update: We are back for our next package. We gave one to our sister-in-law who is a dental hygienist and felt a big smug she had not heard of these before. The dentist gave a full clearance a few months ago, and actually noted improvement. We are now a loyal customer</li>
            <li> Yup, you read that right.  In this package of 5, 2 of them broke WHILE I was brushing my teeth.  That&#x27;s crazy.  It gets an okay rating because I did like how soft the bristles were.  It did take a moment to get over black bristles though.  Not sure how dangerous toothbrushes can be while brushing teeth.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not me, this has NEVER happened with any other brush.</li>
            <li> The only thing about the brush I do not like is the head of it is small. Other than that it gets the job done my teeth are clean.</li>
            <li> Soft, cleans deep corner very gently...&lt;br /&gt;Very high quality tooth brush...&lt;br /&gt;Better than my sonic electronic brush.&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommend to friends and family</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is good. Soft and clean deep than otherones I have used. This is my second time to buy.</li>
            <li> I had no idea what a difference it would make to use a softer toothbrush with a smaller head.  Guess as an American I assumed that bigger, stronger, firmer would mean better.  Not so.  Now I see that my former toothbrushes were kind of tearing up the backs of my gums and also discouraging me from brushing molars and neighbors really well because it was just hard to get the brush in back there.  These are great.  I will use them from now on.</li>
            <li> This is softest toothbrush I have ever seen!  I&#x27;ll be buying them again.</li>
            <li> I love the black bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the small head allows you to reach difficult places especially int the back of the mouth when brushing your teeth. This is a great advantage as many infections of the mouth occurs in these hard to reach places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the fine bristles can reach the difficult places between tooth and gum as well as between teeth. And effectively removes a lot of the plaque built up.</li>
            <li> In comparison to other manual brushes these seem better than other ones I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I like the brush size as it is great for people with smaller mouths.&lt;br /&gt;I find that my teeth get better cleaning with these than other manual brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried Dr. Collins and those are good too but the brush size is to large and when trying the children version they just were not the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am unsure if these brushes are still the same as when I purchased them, hopefully they are! they are one of the few that help clean your teeth without hurting your gums.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes. The only complaint I have is the  head on these are quite small. My younger sister was in town visiting, and opened one up to use. She told me she opened up of my 8-month old son&#x27;s toothbrushes. Overall a good brush though. I have sensitive teeth and gums, and am satisfied with these brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes because my gums are sensitive. But these brushes have a tiny head with a small surface of bristles.&lt;br /&gt;The seller is referring to another brush for larger mouths, but the bristles on that brush are widely staggered and not at all like this brush.</li>
            <li> Addicted to these toothbrushes! I thought I must be crazy ordering special toothbrushes online but it is totally worth it. Love Love Love them, The black bristles are so cool and different. They make me happy.</li>
            <li> I have had gingivitis for years (a dry mouth syndrome I&#x27;ve been told), so my gums bleed even when using the softer commercial/generic toothbrushes. Even so, I had to really pay attention to the pressure I used so that my gums wouldn&#x27;t bleed too badly, and that worked for a while. But as the style of toothbrushes changed to these gigantic bristles that barely fit into my smallish mouth AND it became harder to find softer bristles, my gums bled freely and never really felt clean (even with constant flossing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding the abcOralCare toothbrushes have been a godsend! The bristles are small AND soft, perfect for my small mouth and tender gums. Years of having to pay attention to brushing my teeth are just another layer of goodness. These toothbrushes can brush the teeth waaay back there (where only the floss could reach) and they fit the space where I lost a tooth and hide with a flipper, although I do still have to slow down so I don&#x27;t bang the good teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is NO bleeding anymore, unless I go to bed without brushing first. The bristles are gentle; they get between the teeth so I don&#x27;t have to religiously floss after Every meal (a good water swish does the trick most times); and they Fit in the curve of my front teeth so I can brush them with a rotating motion (gently) instead of up/down as I had to before because the Gigantores couldn&#x27;t fit. I&#x27;ve shared these with my family and they&#x27;re impressed as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t thank abcOralCare enough! My teeth feel cleaner than they have for years and my gums are healthier to boot! :-)</li>
            <li> These are small, about the size of a Sonicare head or a child&#x27;s toothbrush head. This small size allowed me to reach my neglected molars. I haven&#x27;t changed toothpaste, but I&#x27;ve seen some whitening occur after using these toothbrushes. These are also the softest bristles I have ever used. My teeth and gums were sensitive before I began using these toothbrushes. My gums were receding because my previous toothbrushes were very rough, despite being labeled as soft. After using these toothbrushes, my teeth and gums are no longer so sensitive to hot and cold foods. These also do a thorough job of brushing between the crevices of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy these toothbrushes again.</li>
            <li> I asked my daughter for Hane&#x27;s white v necked T shirts, (medium) for my birthday.&lt;br /&gt;Instead she got me these toothbrushes. They are real good. I think I got like six of them. All different colors. So, I&#x27;m all set. I&#x27;m drinking a diet Pepsi. I like them pretty much. I drink them all the time. Last week at dinner I had a regular Pepsi and it tasted like medicine. That is all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than the average toothbrush, but this makes it great for getting hard to reach places. I wish I had known about this before, then I wouldn&#x27;t have had to get my wisdom teeth removed. Since it&#x27;s smaller, it takes a bit more time to clean all your teeth but that way you can take your time and actually deliver a thorough clean. The soft bristles are really gentle on gums, unlike regular toothbrushes. I just think it&#x27;s great all around. After getting use to it, I slept over a friend&#x27;s house and had to use a new toothbrush and brushing with a regular one was a lot more difficult to clean everywhere, it was also rougher on my teeth and gums. Highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> These were truly awful.  The brush is OK, and they do a fine job brushing your teeth, but the problem is that the black bristles lose color in your mouth!  I&#x27;ll sometimes brush my teeth while I walk around doing a couple errands, and when I did that I noticed I would spit black toothpaste!  Not good!  Probably good to avoid these.</li>
            <li> I just received these toothbrushes a few days ago, but I am already hooked. The small head makes the toothbrush easy to maneuver, and the soft bristles are easy on the gums. My teeth and gums are already in good shape, but I think that using these toothbrushes will make them even healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I don&#x27;t find the black bristles to be at all disconcerting. Nor do I get any sense that the plastic handles will break easily; they seem sturdy to me.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my six-year old. I am happy to see that  they definitely brush better than the standard toothbrush. This brush also fits better in her mouth.</li>
            <li> Very fine soft bristles that clean well without killing your&#x27; gums.</li>
            <li> I thought these were pretty nice when I got them, but over time I realized that they were not efficient at cleaning between my teeth.  It might be only after they have been used a bit but I need a stiffer bristle unless I want to floss every time I brush (and I don&#x27;t).  I can see how these would be better for someone with very sensitive gums, but they just don&#x27;t get the job done.  On the bright side, they are excellent for cleaning mushrooms!</li>
            <li> The best toothbrush I have ever used and I&#x27;m even counting the expensive electric ones. The results really are amazing. The brushes last easily more than 6 months each. You literally feel the polyester bristle cleaning between your teeth. You can brush your gums and even your tongue and it feels soft. I gave a couple to my parents and the next day the phone call came &amp;#34;Where did you get these? These are amazing!&amp;#34; The size is perfect, the black natural antibacterial stuff hasn&#x27;t come off in 6 months. I&#x27;m convinced you could use one of this toothbrushes  for a whole year. My mouth has never been cleaner. I used to always have this white stuff on my tongue in the mornings that I would have to scrape off...Now I don&#x27;t even have to clean my tongue any more. To be fair I was torn between these and Dr Collins&#x27; but the antibacterial properties of the black dye on the bristles tipped the scale in favour of these and quite frankly I don&#x27;t see myself using a different brush now. I really hope they continue to manufacture these exactly as they are now.</li>
            <li> I was drawn into purchasing these toothbrushes just for the sheer fact that they looked different than what I was used to. I really like the black bristles. Besides the attractive appearance, the brushes work better than my usuals that I get in the grocery store. The bristles are a bit finer which seems to be what makes the difference here. They can make your gums tender until you get used to using it, similar to flossing when you haven&#x27;t done it in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the head is smaller than I anticipated, even after looking at the comparison photo they provide. I am small, 5&#x27; tall, and small boned, etc., so I didn&#x27;t even bother to offer one to my husband because if it is too small for me then it surely will be too small for him. Next time I will purchase the larger size that is available by the same manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am very pleased and I will continue to buy from this manufacturer as long as the larger size toothbrushes are of the same quality.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are super great. I&#x27;ve been changing up my whole tooth care routine, and these are a main staple in that routine now. Fell in love with them from the first use. The set of 5 means you&#x27;ll have enough to last you all year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the ultimate weapon for two specific things: people who brush their teeth too hard, and people who whiten their teeth with activated charcoal or use it in their tooth powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually banged up my gums and mouth the first time I used this because I brush my teeth WAY too hard. I also didn&#x27;t brush thoroughly enough because the soft bristles don&#x27;t scrub as fast as my old walmart electric toothbrushes. This is actually a good thing: slow and steady motions over time is far better for your enamel and tooth health. For someone that needs a bit of re-wiring in the thinking department I could have either gone straight electric expensive, or 5 of these guys. I think I made the right call. these are waay softer than any toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used before, they feel great, and if you have sensitive gums that bleed easily you can confidently brush the right way (scrubbing at the gum line to get the bristles really into the gums) without the pain associated with harsher toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, very importantly. the tops are BLACK.  I brush first with activated charcoal, then with regular toothpaste (1 minute each), rinsing with water in between. Activated charcoal is a very very cheap, easy way to whiten your teeth (though it makes a huge mess if you&#x27;re not careful, I do it in the shower or over running water and use my hand to help wash the charcoal down) and this may just seem cosmetic, but since I live with other people... if you brush a regular white/color toothbrush with charcoal, after ONE time it will look like you scrubbed an oil rig with it and it will NOT go away ever. These already being black and simple in design, the charcoal washes away, and the tiny amounts that do stay behind are invisible, blending in with the already black bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a fast, quick fix for your teeth that brushes down your enamel these are NOT it. If you&#x27;re used to brushing your teeth under 2 minutes like I was, it&#x27;s a very slight learning curve. But with a tiny bit of patience to do things the right way, these brushes will make your dentist really happy., blending in with the already black bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a fast, quick fix for your teeth that brushes down your enamel these are NOT it. If you&#x27;re used to brushing your teeth under 2 minutes like I was, it&#x27;s a very slight learning curve. But with a tiny bit of patience to do things the right way, these brushes will make your dentist really happy.</li>
            <li> I have had severe gingivitis for two decades.  Had the scaling done twice which had no effect whatsoever.  Brushing caused horrible problems - the brush would tear holes in my gums no matter how softly I brushed.  I have an extremely small mouth and tried children&#x27;s toothbrushes but the bristles, if anything were even more abrasive.  So for the last decade or so I&#x27;ve used a nylon shower cloth made by the Japanese - scrubbing each tooth individually.  This helped considerably but takes a long time to accomplish so I&#x27;ve ended up doing it only once a day.  A couple of months ago I ran across a product called ORAmd which are botanical oils - The effect has been almost miraculous and I thought what a shame I couldn&#x27;t do their whole program which includes brushing with the product.&lt;br /&gt;Then I read somewhere on a health blog that although almost all toothbrushes are made of nylon bristles - they are injurious to your teeth and gums; so I did a Google search for non-nylon toothbrush.  Which is how I discovered these - and available on Amazon which meant with my Prime membership I would have them a couple days later.&lt;br /&gt;After I placed the order I received a really nice personal email from this Vendor - with some extra tips and to contact him with any questions.&lt;br /&gt;I not only did not have any initial break-in problems but the toothbrush felt very nice - almost like a massage for the teeth.  Used in conjunction with the ORAmd I felt like I had just had a cleaning done by a dentist.  And the toothbrush is just right for my little mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I am so appreciative for this product - thank you!</li>
            <li> I like these a lot. I have used some similar toothbrushes, but these seem to be of higher quality than most. The tapered bristles for instance are super refined and manufactured to a  very high standard. They feel very pleasant, but not overly soft. I also like the firmness of the handles. Many of the similar toothbrushes I&#x27;ve tried had handles that flexed too much. Looking at the pictures I was a bit worried that the plastic part of the brush head would be too thick, making access to back teeth a challenge, as is the case with some cheap brushes I&#x27;ve used. But these worries proved to be unfounded. On the down side, the heads are shorter than I&#x27;d expected. I would prefer a longer head, but it&#x27;s not so bad that I would not buy these again. The only other thing that bugs me is that there is no mention of whether or not the bristles are activated charcoal or carbon bristles. Most of these Korean, black bristle brushes brag about their activated charcoal. These do not. One reviewer has stated that these brushes have charcoal bristles, and I would like to believe that. However, there is no indication of that on the packaging or on their web site. In any case, these are good brushes, and I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best toothbrushes I ever used. Period. I used these toothbrushes at my parent&#x27;s house for the first time and I was amazed by how clean my teeth felt. They felt like I had just had a cleaning at the dentist. Since then, I have been using these toothbrushes. It&#x27;s amazing how soft the bristles are (I have receding gums, so I can only use the softest bristles) and how deeply they penetrate. In fact, if I floss after I brush my teeth, I notice that I don&#x27;t have anything stuck in my teeth anymore. My husband is a dentist and he is also addicted to these brushes. Try these brushes- you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Personally, I prefer the clear bristles to these black ones. The black bristle tends to fade a little and turn slightly yellow at the tip.</li>
            <li> I found my teeth were turning into black while using it, terrible!. If you want fine bristle, just buy white or colorless one, don&#x27;t buy black-bristle tooth brush!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. Soft and good quality.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS TOOTHBRUSH. I ordered them before, and over the last year used them all up. Out of convenience, I bought a regular tooth brush (&amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; bristles...) at Target, used it for two days, and had to order more of these immediately. I haven&#x27;t ever loved brushing my teeth, but this toothbrush makes it enjoyable. The bristles are soft, long, and very fine - I feel them get into the cracks of my teeth the way that other brushes never have!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s a small toothbrush, but that&#x27;s irrelevant in my mind because I love the bristles so much. BUY EM!</li>
            <li> I have large teeth in a smaller sized jaw; because of this I&#x27;ve frequently purchased child sized tooth brushes. I find that adult tooth brushes do not get my hind teeth properly clean. This tooth brush is amazing! It fits well in my mouth, is larger than child sized tooth brushes, and leaves my teeth feeling clean all day. Some folks have commented that they didn&#x27;t feel that this tooth brush properly cleaned between their teeth- unless you have huge gaps between your teeth I don&#x27;t know how any toothbrush could. That&#x27;s why everyone should floss, though most of us don&#x27;t. I do find that since using this toothbrush my gums are less sensitive and respond better to flossing. My boyfriend doesn&#x27;t like that he has to take a bit longer to brush his teeth, but likes the way his mouth feels fresher for more of the day after using it.</li>
            <li> At first most people would say why is it black?  But it only makes it easier to identify my toothbrush.  It&#x27;s actually natural charcoal which acts as an antibacterial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tips of these bristles are very fine and do an excellent job of helping clear out the pockets around my teeth and works wonders on my tongue too!  My only complaint is that the head of this toothbrush is quite small, but it may be because I have big teeth.  GREAT buy with 6 brushes in the pack!</li>
            <li> this is wonderful&lt;br /&gt;my children and i all the time use this only.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again and again.&lt;br /&gt;it makes me very clean and fresh</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are soft and small. My teeth less bleeding then before. My mother in low started to use it and she is happy with a new brush.</li>
            <li> Be using these beautiful black toothbrushes for several years now after switching to them due to concern about how even the softest nylon bristle brushes were irritating my gums &amp; causing some erosion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are far more comfortable to brush with than any brush I could find in local stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is that they wear out quickly.  In my experience, using red disclosing tablets to check cleaning, ordinary drug store nylon bristle brushes lose significant cleaning power after just a month.  These have a shorter life, no more than 3 weeks (and two might be best). However the relatively low cost of these brushes makes them economical to use even with the short life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(So then the only problem is really the amount of waste.  If the company would make these as detachable brush heads that can be affixed to a permanent handle, I&#x27;d give them 5 stars.)</li>
            <li> I have very little enamel left on my teeth, especially the front ones. It&#x27;s a combo of eating lemons and limes like apples when I was a kid and brushing like a maniac. I also have a small mouth- dentists have a hard time working on me. The head of this toothbrush is small enough it fits around teeth well without jabbing into me. The bristles work, my teeth feel clean, without further removing enamel. I also can brush long enough to keep the sensitive teeth toothpaste on long enough to work!</li>
            <li> I realized awhile back that I needed to buy a softer toothbrush for my sensitive gums. While I was able to purchase a few, they all had heads that were bigger than I cared for. I have \\&quot;short\\&quot; teeth so when brushing, the gums can get irrititated. Enter this brush; wow! I almost thought it wouldn&#x27;t do the jobs because of the fine soft bristles but my teeth feel so clean. The head is a great size for me because I found it very easy to manuever around the back teeth and behind the teeth without irritation. I hope that this product never changes or discontinues, because they have a lifetime purchaser in me.</li>
            <li> I used these to help clean in between my gums and such. They feel weird at first, but after a few uses, it&#x27;s just like normal. They don&#x27;t feel to soft either.</li>
            <li> This is a comfortable, well made brush, with soft cleaning bristles; however, these are not very suitable for an average adult mouth: the brush head are very small, perhaps best suited to children.</li>
            <li> I ordered these toothbrushes based on all of the great reviews, so its possible this was a fluke. The brush broke during the first use and I ended up with a mouthful of bristle and the handle material. I moistened the brush, dipped it in baking soda and brushed for less than 30 seconds when I noticed and odd feeling and removed the brush to find it had broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very hesitant to use another one of the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave it two stars for the design and initial feel, but was hoping to be able to rate at least four.</li>
            <li> This is the new toothbrush for me. They are durable and soft the way I like a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.  This works perfect for me since I have a small mouth.  Also, because I brush with Charcoal, the bristles are black so I don&#x27;t have to worry about the charcoal turning the bristles black.  Mouth just feels clean when I done brushing.</li>
            <li> Very good quality and great for kids.</li>
            <li> These are great, especially with people that have small mouths and crowded teeth. Loved how smooth my teeth feel and how little irritation there is on my gums. Very happily buy again!!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. Very soft but firm. My teeth feel like a professional cleaning after</li>
            <li> These compact head brushes are wonderful, especially if you have sore gums.  The soreness probably comes from plaque that you cannot reach with a regular OTC toothbrush.  These small brushes with tapered bristles, get into the sulcus - the small spot between tooth and gum, and allows a thorough cleaning without a lot of brushing.  Highly recommended.  Also, if you get a lot of surface buildup, you should try the Hannuli version.</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes!&lt;br /&gt;Wear out fast, but still cost effective and the best manual toothbrush ever.</li>
            <li> * I just did a search on Amazon for \\&quot;toothbrush\\&quot; and came up with 16,975 Results so how can I make the statement that in my opinion this is the \\&quot;Best Manual Toothbrush for Gums on Amazon\\&quot;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; In search for the best manual toothbrush for gums, gum pockets, and back molars about six months ago I went through a search on Amazon for \\&quot;toothbrush\\&quot; and found a somewhat lower number of toothbrush listings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Why would I be crazy enough to do this or was it because I didn&#x27;t have anything else to do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; My dentist said I was doing fine and then during a recent visit he found my back three of my back molars moving further back and creating a space between the teeth in front.  Upon X-ray examination he told me in a very sorry way that I was experiencing \\&quot;external root absorption\\&quot; - this is where the body decides to start re-absorbing the tooth root and it progresses rather quickly.  Otherwise he said my teeth were is good condition and he said their isn&#x27;t any established reason why this happens.  So during last year I had six molars (including two wisdom teeth, one impacted) extracted, two sinus lifts, and an implant completed.  This was to say the least not a lot of fun.  I went on a quest to research, study, and implement the best plan I could come up with to hopefully at least stahl any more extractions/etc.  Amazon for me has become a good place to find products and read actual customer product reviews - I found on Amazon \\&quot;Healthy Teeth, Healthy Body\\&quot; by Tom McGuire, DDS - this book has become my plan of action to really take charge of my dental health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:0981563023 Healthy Teeth - Healthy Body]] - It costs me $4 and is currently available on Amazon from $3.96 New and $0.01 used plus shipping.  Please see my 5 star review for more of my comments on it. Of special note the author has the only small size dental mirror with an LED light built in I could find anywhere for just under $8 otherwise one could take a standard pen flashlight and tape it to a standard dental exam mirror.  While it might seem a little gross I have found it very important to do my own periodic dental exams so I see what the dental professionals see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; My rationale for why this toothbrush rates a 5 star plus rating.  (1) Since sometime in the 1950s Dupont introduced nylon for the bristles in the toothbrush and that is what is used today.  Nylon wears a long time, however, the new material in this toothbrush enables the bristle to be made the way they are - softer and some with special very thin tips.  It is these tips when you use this brush and so very gently vibrant it with your brushing hand (about 3 to 4 mm; not much) that allows the fine soft tips to enter the gum pocket (AKA sulcus) to dislodge the decaying debris.  When debris is left in the gum pocket it can block the gum&#x27;s natural ability to use saliva to keep the gum pockets clean.  Eventually the gum pocket becomes irritated and inflamed causing this inflamation to deepen the gum pocket to over the 3 mm sized considered to be normal by many professionals.  (2) The handle has been specially designed with engineered bends that allow one to more easily access brushing of the back of the back molars, and its small brush size allows for it to be more effective where the teeth meet together.  These also come in white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Another device that helps clean the gum pockets is an oral water irrigator, such as, [[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]].  Or, if you&#x27;d prefer [[ASIN:B000UWAWQU Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless PLUS]].  Or, if you&#x27;d prefer both [[ASIN:B0047MDIPG Waterpik Waterflosser Ultra And Waterpik Cordless Plus Combo Pack Includes 12 Accessory Tips &amp; Travel Case]].  WaterPik also makes a special tip for the gum pockets [[ASIN:B000V2DN2O Water Pik Ultra Pik Pocket Replacement Tips]], and several other tips.</li>
            <li> i decide to buy these instead of the nimbus brand, while they are good, they are just not comparable to nimbus.  i wont be buying these again im going to stick with nimbus.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes originally for their size and softness. Since I&#x27;ve had trouble with gums receding due to hard bristles on the softest brushes, these were the answer. Don&#x27;t let the black color fool you. And contrary to a review that stated the black color stained their teeth, they don&#x27;t. My teeth have been whitened and I&#x27;ve had no issues with staining due to the color of the bristles. I highly recommend these comfortable brushes to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an engineer, so I love it when a product&#x27;s results can be measured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got back from the dentist and my \\&quot;dental pocket numbers\\&quot; (indicator of how much the gums cover the teeth) has significantly improved over my last 2 visits (so 1 year).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use my sonic toothbrush, but I use this toothbrush every other day before bed... or if I&#x27;m going to bed late and don&#x27;t want the noise... or if I&#x27;m traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife&#x27;s seen similar measurable results.</li>
            <li> Simply put, this is the best toothbrush I have ever used. It is so unbelievably soft and the tapered ends really do clean your gumline much better. When switching from a regular Nylon bristled brush you can really tell the difference. I was very skeptical, but when I used it I could feel the bristles sliding up under my gums. The sensation was completely new. It was like a gum massage. I have used the entire pack now and those areas are no longer sensitive, but brushing still feels very pleasant. I will never go back to a conventional toothbrush. I tried one a few days ago, and not only was it uncomfortable but it felt like I was brushing with sandpaper or something, some rough, flat surface that was not contouring around my teeth. It felt horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read reviews where people did not think these bristles were soft. They are the softest I&#x27;ve ever felt, and I was using ultra soft children&#x27;s toothbrushes before I switched. I am a compulsive hard brusher and have worn enamel and receded gums from my years of brushing very hard (always used a soft toothbrush). After trying several techniques to try to brush softer my dentist finally gave me a baby toothbrush and told me to have at it. Even trying to brush soft I would use those up in less than a week. This toothbrush is not only softer, but sturdier. If that makes any sense. An ultra soft children&#x27;s was replaced about every 5 days. An adult soft every two weeks. I purchased this pack of five on June 9 with 2 day shipping. I am just now about to reorder. That&#x27;s just over 15 weeks for 5 brushes. So about every three weeks. I&#x27;m sure that I could use them even longer because unlike regular toothbrushes these bristles don&#x27;t have the same wear pattern. Regular toothbrushes get a deep, smashed indention in the middle with the surrounded bristles  all bent and frazzled. These just get a kind of \\&quot;fuzzy\\&quot; look to the top. Everything is still in place. Another point I want to make is that it feels so good using this toothbrush that I actually am able to notice when I do start brushing too hard because the sensation changes.  Also, about the tongue, I brush my tongue with my toothbrush after my teeth and then use a tongue scraper. This is what I&#x27;ve always done, and I have not had an issue with this toothbrush being too soft to help clean my tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the black calcium stuff on the bristles, I have not had any problems with it. I have extremely thin enamel on my teeth and things like wine or grape juice kind of \\&quot;stick to\\&quot; my teeth. One sip and my teeth will be purple. It brushes off with very vigorous brushing. The black of these bristles has not created any sort of issue as that. My toothpaste has never gotten a black tint or anything. And the black just kind of wears off the ends into like a yellowish color. But only on the tips; the rest of the bristle has stayed black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only \\&quot;issue\\&quot; I have, and I&#x27;m not sure if it IS an issue, is that I have a small spot of that resin bonding stuff on one of my front top teeth where I chipped the surface. I have extremely white teeth (maybe from all the aggressive brushing) and I&#x27;ve noticed that the bonded spot is becoming darker than the rest of the tooth. I&#x27;ve only had it for less than a year. I wonder if maybe the black of the bristles has contributed to the darkening of it. I&#x27;m about to get the backs of my front teeth bonded as well because my teeth are becoming increasingly transparent. I am also a teeth grinder and have not gotten a night guard made yet. So, the last thing I want to do is \\&quot;fix\\&quot; my see through teeth with something that is going to stain in less than a year. I have no evidence to support the idea that the toothbrush has contributed to it, but, just in case, I am thinking of trying the Sanha 5 medium brushes which have white bristles. It says medium is what we consider soft and all the reviews talk about how soft they are. I&#x27;m just worried that maybe they won&#x27;t be soft enough for me. I haven&#x27;t found a review that compares the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the shape and size of the toothbrush. I LOVE the small head. I have a small mouth and have always had problems with full size toothbrushes not getting my back teeth as clean as I like. I can&#x27;t speak for anyone with a large mouth, but I don&#x27;t see how a small brush would be a problem. Our teeth, gums, tongue, etc. are all basically the same size. The only difference is more open space and maneuverability in large mouths. You don&#x27;t brush the air; you brush your teeth, gums, tongue, etc. so I don&#x27;t see how this toothbrush can get bad reviews for being small. And if you really want a bigger one, ABC Oralcare has the AFT brushes for larger mouths. Also, the handle is narrow which is a good thing because thicker handles cause people to brush harder. I find this handle to be very comfortable and the brush easily moves about my mouth. It cleans all of my teeth quite comfortably. I have had my wisdom teeth removed, but my mouth is very small and my back molars sit very far into the corners of my mouth and are still impossible to get clean with a regular size toothbrush. This toothbrush maneuvers very well back there and is able to thoroughly clean every side of my back molars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up, this is the best cleaning, most comfortable, least damaging to my teeth, longest lasting toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ve covered pretty much everything about the toothbrush. I hope this review helps. If anyone has any questions, please don&#x27;t hesitate to ask in the comments. Also, if anyone can compare the softness difference between the Yorum 5 and Sanha 5 (the ultra fine and the sensitive medium) I&#x27;d really appreciate it.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are smaller than I&#x27;m used to. They recommend a larger product in the item title. The bristles feel very nice, I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve brushed my teeth with that plastic crap for so long. Color coded for sharing with guests. If I ever recommend a manual toothbrush it will be this one.</li>
            <li> The small brush and tapered bristles work very well.  My teeth feel clean and it does an excellent job between teeth.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. The small head actually cleans my teeth better than the larger version and I don&#x27;t gag anymore. This is my new toothbrush! :-)</li>
            <li> I like the very tapered handles and amazingly, the super-soft bristles do seem to do a better job than the store-bought soft toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I was looking for small, compact toothbrushes and found these on Amazon. They are smaller than what I preferred, but they worked out pretty well for me. I may try the larger version when I&#x27;ve gone through this pack. The black bristles are super soft and super fine. They seem to hold up well after months of use, so I&#x27;m quite impressed. I prefer this toothbrush over my electric toothbrush and over all of the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothbrushes I&#x27;ve tried. I highly recommend these toothbrushes if you want a REALLY small and compact head.</li>
            <li> really nice toothbrushes! Unsure if actually made with charcoal but I like the bristles and the softness!They are small but I prefer that.</li>
            <li> These are probably the best toothbrushes I have ever used. At first though was skeptical bout how soft the bristles were and the toothbrush head so small. But after my first use, no more. My teeth get much cleaner than with the toothbrushes you get nowadays where the bristles are thicker. I recommend these for everyone to try. Even though they may not be for eeveryone, however is worth a try.</li>
            <li> I have always brushed too hard and this helps from harming your gums!&lt;br /&gt;I was worried bc when it came in it said medium, not soft, but these are softer than nylon extra soft brushes!!</li>
            <li> Like i said, soft and nice on the gums. Nice color selection and does what it is intended use is for, cleaning your nasty mouth.</li>
            <li> No complaints at all. They clean well, the bristles do not get hard as a rock like others. Buying again.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth. I also have a fear of the inevitable receding gum line. As I got older, my concerns for dental hygiene have shot through the roof. For a while I was special ordering similar toothbrushes made from Japan. Now, I found these on Amazon! I was actually looking for the \\&quot;nimbus\\&quot; brush my dentist advised me. Luckily, I found these. They aren&#x27;t quite the same as the ones I was ordering, but it&#x27;s pretty much there. The difference is that these are a little bit bigger -- which is totally fine and still works! The ones I was ordering were pretty... small. I am so happy with these. This is definitely the new generation and new wave of brushes. Want better and healthier gums? Start brushing with these (but of course, remember proper brushing technique!) Happy healthy brushing!</li>
            <li> I like the toothbrushes. They do make my mouth feel much cleaner. I will be ordering these again. great product.</li>
            <li> This is my second order, bought 3 packs this time. Love them, the head is not too large, the bristles are soft. The white brushes  with the larger head from a different company were way too hard and cumbersome. I prefer these, they get below the gum line with ease. I don&#x27;t even buy regular toothbrushes anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I can use my herbal toothpowder and it doesn&#x27;t stain these bristles.</li>
            <li> OMG I really love these tooth brushes , they are perfect not to big and the bristles are gentle on the teeth. Will buy again for sure</li>
            <li> I knew these were smaller to begin with, so it took awhile in getting used to.  The bristles were noticeably soft and I didn&#x27;t believe it would do a great job of cleaning but it actually does!  I can finally have proper brushing and reach at the back of my teeth.  Brushing does take longer due to the small size but it is worth the time and effort to take care of each individual tooth.  After a few months of using this brush, I do feel as if my oral hygiene is better maintained.  Will this prevent cavities and gingivitis?  Only time or if I will ever go see a dentist will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to brush AND floss!  Brushing alone will not deter the bad guys from murdering your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for awhile now and have to say they work quite well. I&#x27;m one of those bad people who doesn&#x27;t floss regularly, so I am really happy with these smaller bristles that get in between teeth and around the gums. I brush very rigorously and don&#x27;t have issues with tarter or bleeding gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I have my wisdom teeth, so the small brush head allows for brushing all the way in back of the mouth. And I like the black bristles. Not only do they look cool, but the germ prevention is a big seller, too. I think these last longer than a standard toothbrush, too, without the bristles falling out or getting warped.</li>
            <li> Bigger toothbrushes trigger my gag reflex. The small size of these brushes are great, no more issues brushing in the morning. These can also reach smaller areas in the back of the mouth. Also, I put a little more care into brushing since I don&#x27;t have a massive brush covering my entire mouth.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first of the black bristles but they seem fine. I guess they are colored that way to reduce bacteria on the bristles. The head itself is much smaller than a normal toothbrush but I&#x27;ve got a small mouth and I&#x27;ve gotten used to it. It&#x27;s much easier to reach back molars and the tapered bristles are much better at dislodging food between teeth (if you brush with vertical motions). I&#x27;ll keep buying this toothbrush, as it&#x27;s cheap, feels great and functions well..</li>
