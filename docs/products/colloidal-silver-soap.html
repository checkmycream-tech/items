            <li>The Reason I Purchased Soap Instead Of The Liquid Kind</li>
            <li>this is a nice product and it is a fragrant bath soap</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to recommend a product you know delivers and it won&#x27;t be a embarrassment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is nice soap because of its ingredients and it probably is better than most soaps I have tried.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find this product and bought it for my home first aid kit.  </li>
            <li>It makes you feel squeaky clean, but more importantly it&#x27;s good for the skin.</li>
            <li>I do love this soap.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>However, I was looking for more of the healing properties that are supposed to be connected to the colloidal silver.</li>
            <li>how can i be completely sure colloidal silver is even &#x27;in&#x27;</li>
            <li>Do more Research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This bar of soap was okay nothing to brag about.</li>
            <li>Had a n ok scent to it.</li>
            <li>This person is HIV+ and doctors have not been able to identify what the bumps were or how to get rid of them.  </li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my skin feel ....</li>
            <li>Safe Soap.</li>
            <li>Love the product, I have leg ulcers</li>
            <li>I am about to reorder much more.</li>
            <li>Was pleased with it.</li>
            <li>This soap was recommended for my skin (mostly the face) to help with clearing up my acne and soothe redness/</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure whether or not it was an infection or allergy</li>
            <li>but after 3 days of using this soap I was all better.</li>
            <li>Enjoyed the soap...nice</li>
            <li>It had more of the medicinal ingredients I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It really makes your skin feel great</li>
            <li>Not quite sure or not if it has helped, but to test it I quit using it  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband, and he says it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it, so I can&#x27;t give any more feedback than his.</li>
            <li>But, he didn&#x27;t say he didn&#x27;t like it. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to look for a spot type that might work better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m reordering more.</li>
            <li>Nice soap, leaves my skin feeling clean not oily, doesn&#x27;t have a perfume scent.</li>
            <li>We send our boys to camp with this soap to keep them healthy by killing bacteria, so far great.</li>
            <li>It keeps the skin soft and is great for people with MRSA.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Finally I found good soap for my kids !</li>
            <li>He liked the abundant lather he got and the soft feel after rinsing.</li>
            <li>A strong remedy against bacteria and infection, and skin problems.</li>
            <li>By far the most superior of the Amazon offered colloidal soaps.</li>
            <li>When he tells me about his first use of this new soap, it delighted me that he liked it so well.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t bother me its light</li>
            <li>This soap is great, my husband has skin issues and this soap is the only soap that has helped him.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my skin smooth and free of flaking and itching.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li>is important</li>
            <li>I am happy with the soap and use it for acne, and disinfectant to wash open wounds.</li>
            <li>Not only does it contain colloidal silver but coconut and olive which are both great anti-fungals and moisturizing to boot.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>When this product delivered good results quickly, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>This bar is worth the price!</li>
            <li>her skin was so dry and flaky and it worked great.  </li>
            <li>it leaves the skin hydrated, clean, and refreshed.</li>
            <li>This soap is not only great as an antibacterial but it&#x27;s great to clean him when he has an outbreak, I don&#x27;t worry about it getting into his open wounds because it is so gentle.  </li>
            <li>Works well, it arrived on time and in good condition, I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li>Left my skin feeling fairly moisturized too.  </li>
            <li>Soap has helped tremendously.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s also incontinent and to be able to find a product that I can use to wash his undercarriage multiple times a day is fantastic!</li>
            <li>it in a container in your shower so it won&#x27;t melt quickly.</li>
            <li>I like this soap and continue to purchase more, I feel leaves say your groin area cleaner than normal soap.</li>
            <li>My skin has improved and I feel so much cleaner, if that makes any sense at all, but it&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li>and it is worth a look if you have any pesky skin issues.  </li>
            <li>Amazing soap really feel a difference with it and is helping clear my skin up</li>
            <li>It is worth the price, I will buy it again.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>the trade-off was worth it.</li>
            <li>and it is very healthy for cuts and  dry skin.</li>
            <li>Will definitely keep ordering more.</li>
            <li>First time to try a silver soap.</li>
            <li>I love this soap for my face especially.  </li>
            <li>First few days, I thought it was good stuff.  </li>
            <li>If it works I will update as I am willing to try anything.  </li>
            <li>If improvement in skin continues will be back for more.</li>
            <li>I keep reading about how it cures all these skin conditions for other people, but I think it&#x27;s just really nice soap.</li>
            <li>Last, but not least it&#x27;s not pricey :)</li>
            <li>Love the soap, super sudsy  with just a little bit.</li>
            <li>I certainly do like it and so does my skin.</li>
            <li>fast ship, use it in the shower...</li>
            <li>My son is really struggling with acne and this soap has been so helpful in clearing his face up.  </li>
            <li>High quality ingredients and silver to boot!</li>
            <li>Cleans skin very well without drying out.</li>
            <li>I lather  some up in my hands and gently message into the affected area for about 30 seconds, then rinse.  </li>
            <li>The soap was very calming for a severe rash I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of.</li>
            <li>but I like the way it looks in the wrapper so much</li>
            <li>and then I can tell how much I really like it.</li>
            <li>We really like it and it helps with acne too.</li>
            <li>so it is important to keep the area as sterile as possible.</li>
            <li>I have acne prone skin and find that using the Colloidal Silver Soap really helps with healing.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice an benefit</li>
            <li>The price was very prohibitive, $12.95.  </li>
            <li>Did some research and found here and shipping is free with $35.00 total purchase.  </li>
            <li>miracle soap~ fast</li>
            <li>but it really didn&#x27;t help with my problem</li>
            <li>Who wouldn&#x27;t want mother natures antibiotic over-the-counter for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I can even use this on my face without becoming too dry.</li>
            <li>It has NO SMELL and is slippery more so than other soaps.</li>
            <li>As a nurse and a person with a low immunity when I wash my hands I want them to really be clean.</li>
            <li>I am back for more for me and my son who has the same issues.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you have skin problems you try it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend a bar of this in every household.</li>
            <li>High quality but did not work for me.</li>
            <li>He said rinsing it off was a little more labor intensive than normal bath soap but</li>
            <li>If the price was for two bars of this soap at the same size I might think it was a little more worth the cost.</li>
            <li>expensive, but yet great soap</li>
            <li>It helped clear up a rash that had started and while I was using Silver Gel to take care of it, this product just did the process so much quicker.  </li>
            <li>First learned of this soap when I visited The Vermont General Store.  </li>
            <li>and then it took me a few more days to figure out it was from this soap.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t use it long enough to see better results</li>
            <li>I rate it with 5 stars not only because it leaves my skin soft and squeaky clean (no grease/residue,) but it has helped clear and soothe my skin through my acne struggles!</li>
            <li>A lovely sudsy bar, but not very effective silver content for my needs..</li>
            <li>Leaves the skin soft!</li>
            <li>Wow, what a difference it has made!  </li>
            <li>Leave skin so soft and takes itch out of all their bug bites!</li>
            <li>I would go with the higher ppm next time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping for some medicinal properties to become evident, so his scalp problems will be diminished or totally disappear.</li>
            <li>But right now my skin looks normal and is mildly dry.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t clear up an unidentified rash I have.  </li>
            <li>The side effects of the prescription led me on a rollercoaster of clear skin and breaking out again, but I continue to use the soap because it helps soothe the side effects Differin caused.</li>
            <li>Seems gentle enough for sensitive skin though.</li>
            <li>It works, my skin was clear in 2 days</li>
            <li>It cleanes my skin  and stops  the itch completely.  </li>
            <li>so it is ready for next use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing I use on my whole body.</li>
            <li>My 12 year old son has had eczema on his face since he was an infant</li>
            <li>I when i use this soapfigured since silver is a natural antibiotic and anti fungal</li>
            <li>After one use my skin is so soft.  </li>
            <li>I have a problem with adult acne.  </li>
            <li>I have only used this soap about 6 times and can all ready feel and see the difference.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and only patches where this might have helped</li>
            <li>it actually dissipated really fast too&lt;</li>
            <li>If you never uses a natural soap, this is the one you should get.</li>
            <li>The slight infection disappeared and healing began quickly.  </li>
            <li>I began using Colloidal Silver Soap because of a rash but then noticed it work really well on my dry skin.</li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t feel any different and nothing was expected other than knowing it&#x27;s a healthy alternative to regular soaps</li>
            <li>I started feeling a tingling but with no adverse reaction my face feels really clean but a little dry</li>
            <li>No fragrance to this, and is very slick and smooth in texture.</li>
            <li>I expected better results, or at least a larger bar of soap.</li>
            <li>I gave this soap to my daughter&#x27;s family following my grandson&#x27;s major surgery and the months following when a sterile environment was needed during bi-daily bandage changes.</li>
            <li>I like this soap; my skin felt soft and wasn&#x27;t dry after use.</li>
            <li>ive gotten many different types of soaps organic or not over the past few years to try and control my rosacea and problem skin</li>
            <li>I cannot testify to how good or bad it is</li>
    </ol>

            <li> However, I was looking for more of the healing properties that are supposed to be connected to the colloidal silver.</li>
            <li> how can i be completely sure colloidal silver is even &#x27;in&#x27;</li>
            <li> Do more Research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This bar of soap was okay nothing to brag about.</li>
            <li> Had a n ok scent to it.</li>
            <li> This person is HIV+ and doctors have not been able to identify what the bumps were or how to get rid of them.  </li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel ....</li>
            <li> Safe Soap.</li>
            <li> Love the product, I have leg ulcers</li>
            <li> I am about to reorder much more.</li>
            <li> Was pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This soap was recommended for my skin (mostly the face) to help with clearing up my acne and soothe redness/</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t sure whether or not it was an infection or allergy</li>
            <li> but after 3 days of using this soap I was all better.</li>
            <li> Enjoyed the soap...nice</li>

            <li> I bought this for my husband, and he says it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it, so I can&#x27;t give any more feedback than his.</li>
            <li> But, he didn&#x27;t say he didn&#x27;t like it. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to look for a spot type that might work better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reordering more.</li>

            <li> is important</li>
            <li> I am happy with the soap and use it for acne, and disinfectant to wash open wounds.</li>
            <li> Not only does it contain colloidal silver but coconut and olive which are both great anti-fungals and moisturizing to boot.</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> When this product delivered good results quickly, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This bar is worth the price!</li>

            <li> it leaves the skin hydrated, clean, and refreshed.</li>
            <li> This soap is not only great as an antibacterial but it&#x27;s great to clean him when he has an outbreak, I don&#x27;t worry about it getting into his open wounds because it is so gentle.  </li>
            <li> Works well, it arrived on time and in good condition, I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Left my skin feeling fairly moisturized too.  </li>
            <li> Soap has helped tremendously.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s also incontinent and to be able to find a product that I can use to wash his undercarriage multiple times a day is fantastic!</li>
            <li> it in a container in your shower so it won&#x27;t melt quickly.</li>
            <li> I like this soap and continue to purchase more, I feel leaves say your groin area cleaner than normal soap.</li>
            <li> My skin has improved and I feel so much cleaner, if that makes any sense at all, but it&#x27;s true!</li>

            <li> the trade-off was worth it.</li>
            <li> and it is very healthy for cuts and  dry skin.</li>
            <li> Will definitely keep ordering more.</li>
            <li> First time to try a silver soap.</li>
            <li> I love this soap for my face especially.  </li>
            <li> First few days, I thought it was good stuff.  </li>
            <li> If it works I will update as I am willing to try anything.  </li>
            <li> If improvement in skin continues will be back for more.</li>
            <li> I keep reading about how it cures all these skin conditions for other people, but I think it&#x27;s just really nice soap.</li>
            <li> Last, but not least it&#x27;s not pricey :)</li>
            <li> Love the soap, super sudsy  with just a little bit.</li>
            <li> I certainly do like it and so does my skin.</li>
            <li> fast ship, use it in the shower...</li>
            <li> My son is really struggling with acne and this soap has been so helpful in clearing his face up.  </li>
            <li> High quality ingredients and silver to boot!</li>
            <li> Cleans skin very well without drying out.</li>
            <li> I lather  some up in my hands and gently message into the affected area for about 30 seconds, then rinse.  </li>
            <li> The soap was very calming for a severe rash I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of.</li>
            <li> but I like the way it looks in the wrapper so much</li>
            <li> and then I can tell how much I really like it.</li>
            <li> We really like it and it helps with acne too.</li>
            <li> so it is important to keep the area as sterile as possible.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and find that using the Colloidal Silver Soap really helps with healing.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice an benefit</li>
            <li> The price was very prohibitive, $12.95.  </li>
            <li> Did some research and found here and shipping is free with $35.00 total purchase.  </li>
            <li> miracle soap~ fast</li>
            <li> but it really didn&#x27;t help with my problem</li>
            <li> Who wouldn&#x27;t want mother natures antibiotic over-the-counter for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I can even use this on my face without becoming too dry.</li>
            <li> It has NO SMELL and is slippery more so than other soaps.</li>
            <li> As a nurse and a person with a low immunity when I wash my hands I want them to really be clean.</li>
            <li> I am back for more for me and my son who has the same issues.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you have skin problems you try it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend a bar of this in every household.</li>
            <li> High quality but did not work for me.</li>
            <li> He said rinsing it off was a little more labor intensive than normal bath soap but</li>
            <li> If the price was for two bars of this soap at the same size I might think it was a little more worth the cost.</li>
            <li> expensive, but yet great soap</li>
            <li> It helped clear up a rash that had started and while I was using Silver Gel to take care of it, this product just did the process so much quicker.  </li>
            <li> First learned of this soap when I visited The Vermont General Store.  </li>
            <li> and then it took me a few more days to figure out it was from this soap.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t use it long enough to see better results</li>
            <li> I rate it with 5 stars not only because it leaves my skin soft and squeaky clean (no grease/residue,) but it has helped clear and soothe my skin through my acne struggles!</li>
            <li> A lovely sudsy bar, but not very effective silver content for my needs..</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin soft!</li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference it has made!  </li>
            <li> Leave skin so soft and takes itch out of all their bug bites!</li>
            <li> I would go with the higher ppm next time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping for some medicinal properties to become evident, so his scalp problems will be diminished or totally disappear.</li>
            <li> But right now my skin looks normal and is mildly dry.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t clear up an unidentified rash I have.  </li>
            <li> The side effects of the prescription led me on a rollercoaster of clear skin and breaking out again, but I continue to use the soap because it helps soothe the side effects Differin caused.</li>
            <li> Seems gentle enough for sensitive skin though.</li>
            <li> It works, my skin was clear in 2 days</li>
            <li> It cleanes my skin  and stops  the itch completely.  </li>
            <li> so it is ready for next use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing I use on my whole body.</li>
            <li> My 12 year old son has had eczema on his face since he was an infant</li>
            <li> I when i use this soapfigured since silver is a natural antibiotic and anti fungal</li>
            <li> After one use my skin is so soft.  </li>
            <li> I have a problem with adult acne.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this soap about 6 times and can all ready feel and see the difference.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and only patches where this might have helped</li>
            <li> it actually dissipated really fast too&lt;</li>
            <li> If you never uses a natural soap, this is the one you should get.</li>
            <li> The slight infection disappeared and healing began quickly.  </li>
            <li> I began using Colloidal Silver Soap because of a rash but then noticed it work really well on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel any different and nothing was expected other than knowing it&#x27;s a healthy alternative to regular soaps</li>
            <li> I started feeling a tingling but with no adverse reaction my face feels really clean but a little dry</li>
            <li> No fragrance to this, and is very slick and smooth in texture.</li>
            <li> I expected better results, or at least a larger bar of soap.</li>
            <li> I gave this soap to my daughter&#x27;s family following my grandson&#x27;s major surgery and the months following when a sterile environment was needed during bi-daily bandage changes.</li>
            <li> I like this soap; my skin felt soft and wasn&#x27;t dry after use.</li>
            <li> ive gotten many different types of soaps organic or not over the past few years to try and control my rosacea and problem skin</li>
            <li> I cannot testify to how good or bad it is</li>
            <li> Over the last year or so I developed a skin rash and a sensitivity to chemicals which may be due to candida overgrowth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only docking a star because it didn&#x27;t last as long as I hoped it would have.  </li>
            <li> I had a strange itch on my lower back</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the bar is long lasting when kept out of moisture.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s my new everyday face soap...</li>
            <li> Use the soap to wash only affectedvareas and dry the bar</li>
            <li> would recommend for people with skin problems such as dry skin.</li>
            <li> It may very well work for other skin disorders, especially those with excessive oil problems.</li>
            <li> It has been the only thing I&#x27;ve used to clear up my skin over the past five years.</li>
            <li> I plan on continuing with this and see what happens in the long run</li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of the smell, its unscented but you can smell the ingredients that make it up, not really noticeable except while its all over you and perhaps on your face.</li>
            <li> The healing process after surgery was taking way too long until I started using this soap.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t notice anything different from any other bar of soap.</li>
            <li> After a skin care product caused a bad reaction, this completed eliminated all symptoms and left silky, smooth clean skin behind.  </li>
            <li> made my skin sort of dry but worked well for an alternative to shampoo.</li>
            <li> It has worked well on my dry skin, but I haven&#x27;t had any luck curing anything stronger than that.</li>
            <li> This soap is rather drying to my already dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The itchy dry skin....</li>
            <li> I use this silver soap on my heels and feet so as to protect them from infection in my lil dry spots...</li>
            <li> I have dry skin that cracks.</li>
            <li> My legs are always dry and it did wonders for them.  </li>
            <li> suggest people should be careful about what they buy.  </li>
            <li> and now he won&#x27;t use any other soap.  </li>
            <li> so gonna use this combined with an aloe vera or tea tree oil bodywash combined to help with the itchiness but other than that</li>
            <li> /&gt;a lot faster than other bars of soap</li>
            <li> Until I suddenly realized I was walking around with an icky layer of film on my body</li>
            <li> this to me is not your average soap</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t love it didn&#x27;t hate it.</li>
            <li> This time of year my skin usually looks like chalk and is painfully dry.</li>
            <li> I wish it cost lot less.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for 5 months and found Amazon had it for $5 less</li>
            <li> I also used the soap on my little dog</li>
            <li> the dry feeling must be because of its antiseptic qualities I just put on my moisturizer a little heavier but again my face is really cleaned of any bacteria that might start clogging my pores  for me to have a soap that cleans my face without any bad effects</li>
            <li> DISLIKED:  </li>
            <li> but my face was another story after I used this soapfor a few days on my face</li>
            <li> I began using this silver soap a few months ago</li>
            <li> Some people do t experience such results but at this low price don&#x27;t fail to give it a try!  </li>
            <li> but it is Not worth the ridiculous price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to think about this soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not magic.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s quite hard to convince to try something new, but he was so desperate that he tried this soap</li>
            <li> It beats the heck out of anything your Doctor is going to give you for your skin and bacteria is hard pressed to become resistant to it.</li>
            <li> let it sit on ur skin at least two mins then wash off the smell</li>
            <li> While it seemed expensive I bought one for a friend who has these mystery bumps on their arms and other areas.  </li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s a little expensive</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t a bunch of scary chemicals (I learned the hard way)</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
            <li> Keeps bad bacteria away and trust me it is out there.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> This soap is supposed to have healing properties. Let&#x27;s see if it works!</li>
            <li> excellent, love it !!!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t love it didn&#x27;t hate it. made my skin sort of dry but worked well for an alternative to shampoo.</li>
            <li> I do love this soap. It has worked well on my dry skin, but I haven&#x27;t had any luck curing anything stronger than that. I keep reading about how it cures all these skin conditions for other people, but I think it&#x27;s just really nice soap. It definitely makes my skin softer, and takes the winter itches away. Great lather, and no scent. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> fast ship, use it in the shower...just because....it won&#x27;t hurt you.</li>
            <li> expensive, but yet great soap</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It feels great on your skin. I use it for my face only to help with a skin condition I have. I think it helps but I know it doesn&#x27;t hurt my condition.</li>
            <li> I love this soap!  My son is really struggling with acne and this soap has been so helpful in clearing his face up.  Will definitely keep ordering more.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more of this soap, it lathers up really good but best of all my skin just feels cleaner when using it.</li>
            <li> Love the soap, super sudsy  with just a little bit. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel any different and nothing was expected other than knowing it&#x27;s a healthy alternative to regular soaps so I will continue to buy this product just because it does have the silver. I use the silver gel when rashes break out and it works great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t  like to write  reviews about anything. But when it comes this soap,  I have to write something about it.  It cleanes my skin  and stops  the itch completely.  My only issue is with the price. I wish it cost lot less.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, I just placed another order for the soap.  It has been the only thing I&#x27;ve used to clear up my skin over the past five years.</li>
            <li> Since I was a child I have had topical dermatitis and I never know what will set my skin off next. I had heard about the properties of colloidal silver, and when I saw this bar of soap I thought I would try it. It is nice soap because of its ingredients and it probably is better than most soaps I have tried. However, I was looking for more of the healing properties that are supposed to be connected to the colloidal silver. I have not experienced any noticeable difference. If the price was for two bars of this soap at the same size I might think it was a little more worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really loving this soap. It&#x27;ll last me about a month it looks like. High quality ingredients and silver to boot! Leaves the skin soft!</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful, the smell isn&#x27;t that great but they way ur skin feels after using it, wonderful!  I would suggest this to anyone with skin problems let it sit on ur skin at least two mins then wash off the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me its light</li>
            <li> This soap is great, my husband has skin issues and this soap is the only soap that has helped him.  He&#x27;s quite hard to convince to try something new, but he was so desperate that he tried this soap and now he won&#x27;t use any other soap.  He&#x27;s been using this soap for about a year now and his skin has improved noticeably.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to think about this soap.&lt;br /&gt;Of course Lye Soap is known to Relief a variety of skin symptoms. Hive, Rashes, etc.&lt;br /&gt;And how can i be completely sure colloidal silver is even &#x27;in&#x27; this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The label claims to have put colloidal silver in the Soap but How do i know?&lt;br /&gt;People like to take advantage of Miracles cures like Colloidal Silver ...&lt;br /&gt;I suggest people should be careful about what they buy.  Do more Research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone can make a website and claim their making &#x27;Colloidal Silver&#x27;  Soap when actually its only \\&quot;Lye soap\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Good soap. I&#x27;ll write more after I use it! LOL</li>
            <li> Finally I found good soap for my kids !</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use steroids forever!  Found that regular use of this. Soap has helped tremendously.  Highly recommend if you have skin problems you try it.  Some people do t experience such results but at this low price don&#x27;t fail to give it a try!  I also found the gel was soothing.</li>
            <li> This bar of soap was okay nothing to brag about. Had a n ok scent to it. Not something that I would go the extra mile&lt;br /&gt;to buy again!</li>
            <li> On advice of wound specialist I tried Silver Gel from this vendor and saw this soap.  While it seemed expensive I bought one for a friend who has these mystery bumps on their arms and other areas.  They used the soap and these bumps went away.  This person is HIV+ and doctors have not been able to identify what the bumps were or how to get rid of them.  This treatment is simple, nontoxic and it works.  Now it is pricey but so is silver.  Use the soap to wash only affectedvareas and dry the bar so it is ready for next use.  This extends the life of the product.  After my friend used this we ordered his elderly mom a bar because of outdoor bug bites, this worked equally well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I can&#x27;t Guarantee this will work for you, it works well for us and it is worth a look if you have any pesky skin issues.  Good luck.</li>
            <li> My boxer/Great Dane &amp;#34;Buddy&amp;#34; caught MRSA during a surgery at the shelter he was in.  It was about a year before we got it under control and I tried everything.  This soap is not only great as an antibacterial but it&#x27;s great to clean him when he has an outbreak, I don&#x27;t worry about it getting into his open wounds because it is so gentle.  He&#x27;s also incontinent and to be able to find a product that I can use to wash his undercarriage multiple times a day is fantastic! I love this soap!</li>
            <li> I like this soap; my skin felt soft and wasn&#x27;t dry after use. I have a skin rash and it noticeable lighter after 3 uses.</li>
            <li> Not magic. Helped with my acne, but didn&#x27;t cure it.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t keep the soap bar in a covered soap container between washings, it will shrink-up and start cracking.</li>
            <li> Lathers good. Cleans skin very well without drying out. Time will tell if it helps with skin issues</li>
            <li> Hello everyone, I have eczema. I have 3 prescriptions from my doctors. Then I bought this soap and had a great improvement. It&#x27;s the only thing I use on my whole body. It has helped with my scalp a lot. Although I had great and poo in my scalp I still have some issues. I&#x27;m on my third bar soap</li>
            <li> Great product, use it on my dog.  Thank you</li>
            <li> good soap, clears up your feet if you have blemishes and helps if you have a fungus on your toes also.</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap based upon a majority of the reveiews of those with skin issues.  My 12 year old son has had eczema on his face since he was an infant so I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to give this a try seeing how everything else we&#x27;ve tried doesn&#x27;t work.  Wow, what a difference it has made!  I lather  some up in my hands and gently message into the affected area for about 30 seconds, then rinse.  Although this soap is kind of expensive,it&#x27;s extremely effective and we will never be without it in our home.</li>
            <li> This soap has worked wonders for my husbands itchy skin and it has moisturizers in it to use every day!</li>
            <li> The soap was very calming for a severe rash I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of.</li>
            <li> This bar is worth the price! Excellent soap for whole family.  Esp. great for kids at camp/swim ponds or lakes...We send our boys to camp with this soap to keep them healthy by killing bacteria, so far great. Leave skin so soft and takes itch out of all their bug bites!</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel ....no residue and it smells good!</li>
            <li> Safe Soap. Doesn&#x27;t leave a ring.</li>
            <li> I cannot testify to how good or bad it is but I like the way it looks in the wrapper so much, I am presently using it for a bathroom decoration.  I will use it one of these days and then I can tell how much I really like it.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this several times.  We really like it and it helps with acne too.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. She said it cleans her face well and says you can feel it.</li>
            <li> Love the product, I have leg ulcers so it is important to keep the area as sterile as possible. This soap seems to draw out some of the impurities from the pores. I am about to reorder much more.Thanx,John</li>
            <li> Helps relieve skin itchiness &amp; rashes</li>
            <li> this soap is great for eczema!</li>
            <li> This soap is rather drying to my already dry skin.  It didn&#x27;t clear up an unidentified rash I have.  It may very well work for other skin disorders, especially those with excessive oil problems. My husband has rosacea so he will be trying it next.</li>
            <li> Allergy season has taken a toll on me.  This has worked wonders for me.  The itchy dry skin.... gone, I&#x27;m getting more of this stuff!</li>
            <li> Itchy allergy be gone.  This soap is amazing!  After a skin care product caused a bad reaction, this completed eliminated all symptoms and left silky, smooth clean skin behind.  There aren&#x27;t a bunch of scary chemicals (I learned the hard way) so it&#x27;s my new everyday face soap...great price, too.</li>
            <li> Item not ordered,, was sent to me anyhow.</li>
            <li> works like it supposed to</li>
            <li> Works well, cleans good. Burns if you get it in your eyes. I like silver soap. I gave some to my sister for her psoriasis.</li>
            <li> It makes you feel squeaky clean, but more importantly it&#x27;s good for the skin.</li>
            <li> First time to try a silver soap. Was pleased with it. Although it&#x27;s a little expensive</li>
            <li> Great soap. I&#x27;m a big believer in the power of collodial silver so it&#x27;s wonderful to see it in soap. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I use this silver soap on my heels and feet so as to protect them from infection in my lil dry spots...so far so good.</li>
            <li> Great to control my seborrhea. I am back for more for me and my son who has the same issues. I wash my face and entire body with it. Keeps my skin smooth and free of flaking and itching.&lt;br /&gt;Keep it in a container in your shower so it won&#x27;t melt quickly.</li>
            <li> Nice soap, leaves my skin feeling clean not oily, doesn&#x27;t have a perfume scent. I like it.</li>
            <li> Haven.t used it yet keeping it for Medical Purposes But The Benefits From Silver Is No Virus Can Sustain Life In The Presence Of Silver The Reason I Purchased Soap Instead Of The Liquid Kind For Now As An Anti Germ Agent On The Skin</li>
            <li> I love this soap for my face especially.  I do use it in the shower, but notice that it helps with skin conditions that pop up on my face.  It has no odor that I can detect, and it seems to be very effective.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and find that using the Colloidal Silver Soap really helps with healing.</li>
            <li> this soap is amazing! I highly recommend a bar of this in every household. A strong remedy against bacteria and infection, and skin problems.</li>
            <li> We use silver soap for bathing and hand washing for its infection fighting properties.  I gave this soap to my daughter&#x27;s family following my grandson&#x27;s major surgery and the months following when a sterile environment was needed during bi-daily bandage changes. Use silver as directed, anything over and beyond will have side effects.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for 5 months and found Amazon had it for $5 less then I was paying elsewhere. I began using Colloidal Silver Soap because of a rash but then noticed it work really well on my dry skin. This time of year my skin usually looks like chalk and is painfully dry. But right now my skin looks normal and is mildly dry. A big deal for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent soap. Would recommend to EVERYONE! We use daily, and one bar last one person about 1 month. Keeps bad bacteria away and trust me it is out there. Heard it helps with excema also. LOVE that the ingredients are things I feel great about putting on my skin!</li>
            <li> As a nurse and a person with a low immunity when I wash my hands I want them to really be clean.</li>
            <li> This soap was recommended for my skin (mostly the face) to help with clearing up my acne and soothe redness/irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this soap as a cleanser (when I wake up and before bed) for about 4 months. I rate it with 5 stars not only because it leaves my skin soft and squeaky clean (no grease/residue,) but it has helped clear and soothe my skin through my acne struggles! It also helps soothe/heal wax burns! Last, but not least it&#x27;s not pricey :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extra Tip:&lt;br /&gt;Using this soap as a cleanser and lemon juice as a toner (for about a month), I noticed my skin clearing from acne! Even though my skin was clearing I&#x27;ve never had acne before and consulted a Doctor in which I was then prescribed a topical cream, Differin for 3 months. The side effects of the prescription led me on a rollercoaster of clear skin and breaking out again, but I continue to use the soap because it helps soothe the side effects Differin caused. Currently I still use this product and will not be changing it!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin that cracks. I&#x27;ve been using this on my feet and anywhere that I have skin issues, even bug bites, and it has definitely helped. No fragrance to this, and is very slick and smooth in texture. Great product.</li>
            <li> Works well, it arrived on time and in good condition, I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Cleared up a skin issue I had after traveling abroad. Left my skin feeling fairly moisturized too.  I&#x27;m only docking a star because it didn&#x27;t last as long as I hoped it would have.  Seems gentle enough for sensitive skin though.</li>
            <li> This soap has saved my life I have morgellons for those who know what it is or have it I would so encourage u to try it.IT WORKS</li>
            <li> The p&lt;br /&gt;The bumps I had on my chest and back are gone after using this product. The itching stopped immediately.</li>
            <li> I had a strange itch on my lower back and I wasn&#x27;t sure whether or not it was an infection or allergy but after 3 days of using this soap I was all better.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this soap.</li>
            <li> Enjoyed the soap...nice</li>
            <li> REASON PURCHASED:  I was buying ABL&#x27;s silver gel when I saw this soap and thought, &amp;#34;Awesome! A silver soap? Genius! I&#x27;m so in!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REASON DISLIKED:  First few days, I thought it was good stuff.  Until I suddenly realized I was walking around with an icky layer of film on my body and then it took me a few more days to figure out it was from this soap.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about it anymore though,  it was so ashamed of sliming me that it melted away into a milky white puddle.</li>
            <li> Amazing soap really feel a difference with it and is helping clear my skin up not a five star cause I feel a bit itchy afterwards so gonna use this combined with an aloe vera or tea tree oil bodywash combined to help with the itchiness but other than that Iam seeing a difference this soap is amazing!</li>
            <li> Only used one bar. It lasted for about 8 showers. Didn&#x27;t use it long enough to see better results but I did see results. Switched to the Defense bar. It had more of the medicinal ingredients I was looking for.</li>
            <li> High quality but did not work for me.</li>
            <li> this to me is not your average soap ive gotten many different types of soaps organic or not over the past few years to try and control my rosacea and problem skin most worked great on my body but my face was another story after I used this soapfor a few days on my face I started feeling a tingling but with no adverse reaction my face feels really clean but a little dry I when i use this soapfigured since silver is a natural antibiotic and anti fungal the dry feeling must be because of its antiseptic qualities I just put on my moisturizer a little heavier but again my face is really cleaned of any bacteria that might start clogging my pores  for me to have a soap that cleans my face without any bad effects is important I plan on continuing with this and see what happens in the long run</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do what I thought it would do. I would go with the higher ppm next time.</li>
            <li> SOMETHING YOU WILL NEED.</li>
            <li> great for face and keeping germs away</li>
            <li> this is a nice product and it is a fragrant bath soap but it is Not worth the ridiculous price. Come on eight buck per bar. I expected better results, or at least a larger bar of soap.</li>
            <li> This soap is so awesome.  After one use my skin is so soft.  I had a pimple on my chin and after a couple days it was just about gone. My legs are always dry and it did wonders for them.  I also used the soap on my little dog her skin was so dry and flaky and it worked great.  I think I am going to try it on my scalp to see if it helps with my dandruff.  If it works I will update as I am willing to try anything.  RX&#x27;s and shampoos have not helped at all. So we will see..It has NO SMELL and is slippery more so than other soaps.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice an benefit but then I suppose since we used it to avoid infection in cuts/scrapes  and there weren&#x27;t any, it did what it was suppose to.</li>
            <li> It keeps the skin soft and is great for people with MRSA.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend for people with skin problems such as dry skin.</li>
            <li> It simply works. Love it.</li>
            <li> One of the best products I have ever found.  It helped clear up a rash that had started and while I was using Silver Gel to take care of it, this product just did the process so much quicker.  It is my new best friend!</li>
            <li> The only soap I want to use.I used it on my face and my body.Cleans deep without chemicals.</li>
            <li> clearing up rash good buy</li>
            <li> Very good for my skin condition.</li>
            <li> It really makes your skin feel great and it is very healthy for cuts and  dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with adult acne.  I have only used this soap about 6 times and can all ready feel and see the difference.  First learned of this soap when I visited The Vermont General Store.  The price was very prohibitive, $12.95.  If you have to order from them another $5.95 in shipping costs.  Did some research and found here and shipping is free with $35.00 total purchase.  If improvement in skin continues will be back for more.</li>
            <li> This has helped my husband&#x27;s skin a lot. It is worth the price, I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> By far the most superior of the Amazon offered colloidal soaps.</li>
            <li> Since I began using this soap my Restless Leg Syndrome pain at night has lessen.  Not quite sure or not if it has helped, but to test it I quit using it  and the night pains began again.  So I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> miracle soap~ fast ship~</li>
            <li> a great product from a great company at a great price</li>
            <li> I am a beliver in Colloidal Silver.  I am happy with the soap and use it for acne, and disinfectant to wash open wounds.</li>
            <li> I began using this silver soap a few months ago and now I&#x27;m addicted. Not only does it contain colloidal silver but coconut and olive which are both great anti-fungals and moisturizing to boot. I can even use this on my face without becoming too dry. Over the last year or so I developed a skin rash and a sensitivity to chemicals which may be due to candida overgrowth. My skin has improved and I feel so much cleaner, if that makes any sense at all, but it&#x27;s true! I&#x27;m planning on stocking up so that I never run out and buying it for my entire family.</li>
            <li> It works, my skin was clear in 2 days</li>
            <li> Not sure exactly what this soap was supposed to do but it really didn&#x27;t help with my problem and I didn&#x27;t notice anything different from any other bar of soap.</li>
            <li> Works great on the skin</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, and he says it&#x27;s ok. I haven&#x27;t used it, so I can&#x27;t give any more feedback than his. But, he didn&#x27;t say he didn&#x27;t like it. :)</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin and smells great too.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this product and bought it for my home first aid kit.  I know the healing benefits of silver especially for burns and/or rashes.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and only patches where this might have helped but it was just making my skin greasy.  Again, that&#x27;s me, not the soap.  On those patches, I think it helped.  I&#x27;m going to look for a spot type that might work better.  I don&#x27;t recommend this if you have combo skin or oily skin like mine.  Otherwise, the bar is long lasting when kept out of moisture.</li>
            <li> I like this soap and continue to purchase more, I feel leaves say your groin area cleaner than normal soap. I am not a big fan of the smell, its unscented but you can smell the ingredients that make it up, not really noticeable except while its all over you and perhaps on your face.</li>
            <li> The healing process after surgery was taking way too long until I started using this soap.  The slight infection disappeared and healing began quickly.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This purchase was made to address a persistent rash that became infected.  In two days the infection was gone, and now the rash is healing nicely.  I use the soap on my leg only once daily.  In addition to the soap I also bought the Silver Miracles Colloidal Silver Gel, and I apply it three times a day.  I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> When he tells me about his first use of this new soap, it delighted me that he liked it so well. I&#x27;m hoping for some medicinal properties to become evident, so his scalp problems will be diminished or totally disappear. He liked the abundant lather he got and the soft feel after rinsing. He said rinsing it off was a little more labor intensive than normal bath soap but the trade-off was worth it.</li>
            <li> A lovely sudsy bar, but not very effective silver content for my needs..</li>
            <li> Who wouldn&#x27;t want mother natures antibiotic over-the-counter for a reasonable price. It beats the heck out of anything your Doctor is going to give you for your skin and bacteria is hard pressed to become resistant to it. There is no downside that I can see.</li>
            <li> This product works well.</li>
            <li> It has been used for centuries for its antinfection properties. I certainly do like it and so does my skin.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. It has a good consistency and good lather. I would reorder.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t help my psoriasis at all&lt;br /&gt;and it actually dissipated really fast too&lt;br /&gt;a lot faster than other bars of soap&lt;br /&gt;i wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> Great lather, non-scented ( ie no perfumes). this soap is good for those who have any skin issues also. it leaves the skin hydrated, clean, and refreshed. If you never uses a natural soap, this is the one you should get. it is pricy if you are used to buying 3 packs of chemically induced soaps, but it does last longer.  if this review is helpful, hit the button.</li>
            <li> My expectations were conservative from the outset. When this product delivered good results quickly, I was pleasantly surprised. I&#x27;m reordering more. I&#x27;ve also recommended the product to others in my family. It&#x27;s nice to be able to recommend a product you know delivers and it won&#x27;t be a embarrassment.&lt;br /&gt;  Please keep the Silver Soap working.</li>
