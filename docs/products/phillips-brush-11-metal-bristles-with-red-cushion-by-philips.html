            <li>I compared this one to my beloved (made in France) brush and</li>
            <li>It is a rather good replacement for the Scalpmaster 125 brush that is not made anymore.</li>
            <li>this brush is great for my fine hair which tangles very easily, this brush untangles my hair and feels great on the scalp.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this brush!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and that might be true, but we KNOW they are good for us!</li>
            <li>$ PERFECT, THANKS</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best hair brush ever.</li>
            <li>Liked the weight of the brush</li>
            <li>it is the best alternative that I have found so far</li>
            <li>Maybe after it softens up a bit it will be fine!  </li>
            <li>but my first reaction when I got it was why so many people found it so great?</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It was more like torture when I tried brushing my hair.</li>
            <li>I was able to return it with no problems.</li>
            <li>My brother purchased six, one each for all his family, and one to put in the safe.</li>
            <li>I wish it was more bulbous.</li>
            <li>Was so glad to find the metal bristle brush again.</li>
            <li>I love the way it flows through my hair.  </li>
            <li>It pulls more</li>
            <li>It is my favorite ever.</li>
            <li>I have tried many look alikes</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower after a shampoo and the scalp and hair have never been better.  </li>
            <li>Beauty supply stores don&amp;#34;&#x27;t seem to carry them anymore, so I am glad to have found this brush on line.</li>
            <li>So glad I am able to get them.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find anything better than this.  </li>
            <li>I wish the metal ends were more rounded and bulbous in shape.</li>
            <li>I wanted a brush with metal bristles because plastic ones contribute to static.</li>
            <li>We all have longer hair, and they seem to help keep our hair healthy.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could find more like it.</li>
            <li>I love this brush and will recommend it to my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just be sure you leave a comment on your order that it will be used for a person, and not a dog.</li>
            <li>So glad i found it.</li>
            <li>The price is also better.</li>
            <li>this brush is as close as I have found to takes it&#x27;s place and for a much better price.</li>
            <li>PRETTY DARN GOOD BRUSH,  for not being a Scalpmaster 125</li>
            <li>Awesome for long hair!</li>
            <li>This Brush is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful brush for detangling my daughter&#x27;s fine long hair without hurting.  </li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>their own growing up- golden retrievers, newfies, malamutes, etc.</li>
            <li>Without the ball tips, you can easily detract hair from the brush, if you happen find a knot, to work through it from the bottom.   </li>
            <li>(whoever thought of that did not want us long hairs to keep it healthy and beautiful).</li>
            <li>I just found a much better alternative since the original Scalpmaster 125 is no longer available: the Madan pin brush for dog grooming.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and have been using this brand since the 1980s.</li>
            <li>The metal bristles cut through tangles and rarely cause static like plastic brushes.</li>
            <li>According to my wife, it could take upwards of a year for light use.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent brush for scalp stimulation and for scraping off dead skin.  </li>
            <li>I was so happy to find out they are still making them, just under a different name.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know the original brand of brush I bought, but I tried this one</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s not the original Scalpmaster.  </li>
            <li>The original Scalpmasters are gone.  </li>
            <li>One benefit is that it is super easy to clean the hair on the brush--it slips right off!</li>
            <li>Very well made and easy on your hair!</li>
            <li>its a happy medium considering the untimely departure of my other brush.  </li>
            <li>The more you use it, the softer and more conforming the red pad becomes.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and is a great little brush.</li>
            <li>Finally a brush that does not cause static in my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Phillips bought the factory in France and continue to produce the same brush under their own name.</li>
            <li>Not the static of natural or poly brushes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rare to find a brush like this</li>
            <li>the French one had nice and neat tapered ends.</li>
            <li>I understand that this brush is supposed to be made in the same factory in France that used to make the now-discontinued Scalpmaster brushes that were so popular.  </li>
            <li>Those people are right.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, she very generously may send you a free dog toy or bow with your order ;)</li>
            <li>The one nice thing is the head is large enough to just hold in your hand.</li>
            <li>I wish I had this year&#x27;s ago, I have long fine hair that tangles easily</li>
            <li>We love it overall</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Great brush for thick hair.</li>
            <li>The quality has remained consistent and durable, and I bet you we go through one about every 8 years.</li>
            <li>Pretty genius invention.</li>
            <li>and they are exactly like the ones I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li>so I was relieved to see that this one was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I found this one here on Amazon, ordered it, and it is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>hopefully with cleanings it will soften up even more and will last longer than the 125.</li>
            <li>this is very close to the old 125 and works fine on my dogs</li>
            <li>Better than I expected and thanks for the quick shipper..</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted, thanks</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and exactly like the one I needed replaced.</li>
            <li>It seems to have a decent handle and the quality of the rubber pad into which the steel pins were firmly embedded was good.  </li>
            <li>perfect for long thick hair.</li>
            <li>The bristles are a little pointier than nylon bristles and take a little getting used to, but I am confident that this was a good purchase.</li>
            <li>My old metal bristle brush kicked the bucket after using it since elementary school.</li>
            <li>I really like them though.</li>
            <li>I need a straight pin brush to get through their fur.</li>
            <li>IT is a very durable quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but I will be more careful with this one!</li>
            <li>However, we can hold the original Scalpmaster next to this one and the pins are identical in every respect (size, shape, tip, position...).  </li>
            <li>it is better than the other one that is a 126.  </li>
            <li>This is a LOT better than any other brush I could find.  </li>
            <li>My hair is long and fine.</li>
            <li>Everything seemed of sound quality but the metal bristle ends seemed pretty sharp.  </li>
            <li>Anyone who remembers buying a new original Scalpmaster will know that the original brush pads are stiff.  </li>
            <li>a decent replacement for the scalpmaster 125.</li>
            <li>I have short baby fine hair, and although it brushed through my hair okay, even the slightest pressure brought extreme discomfort.  </li>
            <li>I will never own another kind of brush.</li>
            <li>My issue has to do with the pins:  they are not machined so that the ends are smooth, and some had sharp edges like cut wire.  </li>
            <li>UPDATE: Going to have to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>I got a brush like this once at Ray&#x27;s Beauty in New York and it changed my life.</li>
            <li>Plus, she really likes the gentle scalp massage as her hair is brushed out.</li>
            <li>The thicker bristle gets through dense coats much better than the flimsy bristles found on most pet brushes, and the lack of those little balls on the end mean the bristle will disengage so that the hair isn&#x27;t pulled until it hurts or splits.</li>
            <li>If I could find my French lovely if go back in an instant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;SO pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon !</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine but thick.</li>
            <li>I have been using metal bristle brushes since I was a kid, they are the only thing that works well on my very long and fine hair without knotting it.  </li>
            <li>There is much less static electricity, too, than with regular brushes</li>
            <li>The bristles are much stiffer, so it does pull more on tangles or wet hair, and is slightly rougher on the scalp, but I would still choose it over any brush out there.</li>
            <li>It is a bit more hard on the scalp.  </li>
            <li>This brush is identical to my old Scalpmaster brushes.</li>
            <li>Yes the bristles are sharper but completely tolerable.  </li>
            <li>My wife had a Scalpmaster that was about as old as she was, and it broke one day when it smacked on something.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this phillips brush #11 to replace my Scalpmaster 25, which is no longer being made, as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>I have been using this brush since the &#x27;70s (even under the old brand name before Phillips bought it), and all of my family still uses this brush exclusively.</li>
            <li>However, it would be better if they were at least plastic dipped on the tips, or if they were sanded or something</li>
            <li>My 125&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;are years old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 70 years old</li>
            <li>Maybe a little intense at first</li>
            <li>If the original Scalpmaster 125 was 5 stars, this is 4 1/2 for me, for brushing out long, wet hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great brush for thick hair, not so much for thin hair.</li>
            <li>Does not have the blunt bristle ends, so ends are pretty sharp..</li>
            <li>Handle is &#x27;just&#x27; long enough with these large hands.  </li>
            <li>Bristles were too soft and after two uses several pins were bent.</li>
            <li>I have very thick, strong and long hair, where my husbands is finer and curly, and it works on any length hair very well.</li>
            <li>Very pointy and sharp bristles</li>
            <li>I am not exaggerating when I say that there is not a single comb or pick or brush at any store that can get through my hair without tearing it all up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had to replace them after about 3-4 years of use because the red rubber part breaks down so much that the metal bristles push into the brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Goes easily through my very thick coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>Not as comfortable to use as other metal brushes I&#x27;ve used in the past</li>
            <li>It is hard to find them without little balls on top.  </li>
            <li>The rubber pad has already softened a little, hopefully it won&#x27;t get too much softer.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my little girls, and if I am gentle, they don&#x27;t mind it either.</li>
            <li>This is a great quality brush and is less expensive than the other.  </li>

            <li> We all have longer hair, and they seem to help keep our hair healthy.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could find more like it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush and will recommend it to my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just be sure you leave a comment on your order that it will be used for a person, and not a dog.</li>
            <li> So glad i found it.</li>
            <li> The price is also better.</li>
            <li> this brush is as close as I have found to takes it&#x27;s place and for a much better price.</li>
            <li> PRETTY DARN GOOD BRUSH,  for not being a Scalpmaster 125</li>
            <li> Awesome for long hair!</li>
            <li> This Brush is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful brush for detangling my daughter&#x27;s fine long hair without hurting.  </li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> their own growing up- golden retrievers, newfies, malamutes, etc.</li>
            <li> Without the ball tips, you can easily detract hair from the brush, if you happen find a knot, to work through it from the bottom.   </li>
            <li> (whoever thought of that did not want us long hairs to keep it healthy and beautiful).</li>
            <li> I just found a much better alternative since the original Scalpmaster 125 is no longer available: the Madan pin brush for dog grooming.</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and have been using this brand since the 1980s.</li>
            <li> The metal bristles cut through tangles and rarely cause static like plastic brushes.</li>
            <li> According to my wife, it could take upwards of a year for light use.  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent brush for scalp stimulation and for scraping off dead skin.  </li>
            <li> I was so happy to find out they are still making them, just under a different name.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know the original brand of brush I bought, but I tried this one</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s not the original Scalpmaster.  </li>
            <li> The original Scalpmasters are gone.  </li>
            <li> One benefit is that it is super easy to clean the hair on the brush--it slips right off!</li>
            <li> Very well made and easy on your hair!</li>
            <li> its a happy medium considering the untimely departure of my other brush.  </li>
            <li> The more you use it, the softer and more conforming the red pad becomes.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and is a great little brush.</li>
            <li> Finally a brush that does not cause static in my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Phillips bought the factory in France and continue to produce the same brush under their own name.</li>
            <li> Not the static of natural or poly brushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rare to find a brush like this</li>
            <li> the French one had nice and neat tapered ends.</li>
            <li> I understand that this brush is supposed to be made in the same factory in France that used to make the now-discontinued Scalpmaster brushes that were so popular.  </li>
            <li> Those people are right.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, she very generously may send you a free dog toy or bow with your order ;)</li>
            <li> The one nice thing is the head is large enough to just hold in your hand.</li>
            <li> I wish I had this year&#x27;s ago, I have long fine hair that tangles easily</li>
            <li> We love it overall</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Great brush for thick hair.</li>
            <li> The quality has remained consistent and durable, and I bet you we go through one about every 8 years.</li>
            <li> Pretty genius invention.</li>
            <li> and they are exactly like the ones I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> so I was relieved to see that this one was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I found this one here on Amazon, ordered it, and it is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> hopefully with cleanings it will soften up even more and will last longer than the 125.</li>
            <li> this is very close to the old 125 and works fine on my dogs</li>
            <li> Better than I expected and thanks for the quick shipper..</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, thanks</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and exactly like the one I needed replaced.</li>
            <li> It seems to have a decent handle and the quality of the rubber pad into which the steel pins were firmly embedded was good.  </li>
            <li> perfect for long thick hair.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a little pointier than nylon bristles and take a little getting used to, but I am confident that this was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> My old metal bristle brush kicked the bucket after using it since elementary school.</li>
            <li> I really like them though.</li>
            <li> I need a straight pin brush to get through their fur.</li>
            <li> IT is a very durable quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> but I will be more careful with this one!</li>
            <li> However, we can hold the original Scalpmaster next to this one and the pins are identical in every respect (size, shape, tip, position...).  </li>
            <li> it is better than the other one that is a 126.  </li>
            <li> This is a LOT better than any other brush I could find.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long and fine.</li>
            <li> Everything seemed of sound quality but the metal bristle ends seemed pretty sharp.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who remembers buying a new original Scalpmaster will know that the original brush pads are stiff.  </li>
            <li> a decent replacement for the scalpmaster 125.</li>
            <li> I have short baby fine hair, and although it brushed through my hair okay, even the slightest pressure brought extreme discomfort.  </li>
            <li> I will never own another kind of brush.</li>
            <li> My issue has to do with the pins:  they are not machined so that the ends are smooth, and some had sharp edges like cut wire.  </li>
            <li> UPDATE: Going to have to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> I got a brush like this once at Ray&#x27;s Beauty in New York and it changed my life.</li>
            <li> Plus, she really likes the gentle scalp massage as her hair is brushed out.</li>
            <li> The thicker bristle gets through dense coats much better than the flimsy bristles found on most pet brushes, and the lack of those little balls on the end mean the bristle will disengage so that the hair isn&#x27;t pulled until it hurts or splits.</li>
            <li> If I could find my French lovely if go back in an instant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;SO pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon !</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine but thick.</li>
            <li> I have been using metal bristle brushes since I was a kid, they are the only thing that works well on my very long and fine hair without knotting it.  </li>
            <li> There is much less static electricity, too, than with regular brushes</li>
            <li> The bristles are much stiffer, so it does pull more on tangles or wet hair, and is slightly rougher on the scalp, but I would still choose it over any brush out there.</li>
            <li> It is a bit more hard on the scalp.  </li>
            <li> This brush is identical to my old Scalpmaster brushes.</li>
            <li> Yes the bristles are sharper but completely tolerable.  </li>
            <li> My wife had a Scalpmaster that was about as old as she was, and it broke one day when it smacked on something.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this phillips brush #11 to replace my Scalpmaster 25, which is no longer being made, as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush since the &#x27;70s (even under the old brand name before Phillips bought it), and all of my family still uses this brush exclusively.</li>
            <li> However, it would be better if they were at least plastic dipped on the tips, or if they were sanded or something</li>
            <li> My 125&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;are years old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 70 years old</li>
            <li> Maybe a little intense at first</li>
            <li> If the original Scalpmaster 125 was 5 stars, this is 4 1/2 for me, for brushing out long, wet hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for thick hair, not so much for thin hair.</li>
            <li> Does not have the blunt bristle ends, so ends are pretty sharp..</li>
            <li> Handle is &#x27;just&#x27; long enough with these large hands.  </li>
            <li> Bristles were too soft and after two uses several pins were bent.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, strong and long hair, where my husbands is finer and curly, and it works on any length hair very well.</li>
            <li> Very pointy and sharp bristles</li>
            <li> I am not exaggerating when I say that there is not a single comb or pick or brush at any store that can get through my hair without tearing it all up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had to replace them after about 3-4 years of use because the red rubber part breaks down so much that the metal bristles push into the brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Goes easily through my very thick coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> Not as comfortable to use as other metal brushes I&#x27;ve used in the past</li>
            <li> It is hard to find them without little balls on top.  </li>
            <li> The rubber pad has already softened a little, hopefully it won&#x27;t get too much softer.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my little girls, and if I am gentle, they don&#x27;t mind it either.</li>
            <li> This is a great quality brush and is less expensive than the other.  </li>
            <li> bristles are a bit sharp; this could be a disadvantage if you have a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> It is not the same as the scalpmaster and does not last as long</li>
            <li> The only reason I marked it down a star was because it was made of plastic.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like the idea or feeling of metal, flat tipped pins on your head, don&#x27;t buy the brush.  </li>
            <li> This looked like a good replacement but was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have very long fine hair that gets some very nasty tangles, my daughter has long hair that has a lot of body (more like frizz and ringlets) and this brush works well on both.  </li>
            <li> (I knew from reading other reviews that I should be a little careful at first.)</li>
            <li> They are easy to clean with soda water, and the wire bristles don&#x27;t have those stupid little balls on the end that give you split ends</li>
            <li> Just ordered another one, afraid that I won&#x27;t be able to find it again.</li>
            <li> My hair is about 3 feet long or so.</li>
            <li> How long does it take for the bristles to scrape the skin off your scalp?  </li>
            <li> Pins are durable for long coats.</li>
            <li> I have thick straight hair.</li>
            <li> Not exactly a ball point but not completely flat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s flat, which is harder to hold onto with these arthritic hands (I&#x27;m ambidextrous).</li>
            <li> This one (the Phillips) had the ends abruptly cut off at all different angles sort of</li>
            <li> I was really sad, completely frustrated and going bananas trying to track one down (for pretty much the better part of 5 years now).</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair and when the weather gets dry (like in the winter)</li>
            <li> Works well on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine and it tangles like crazy.</li>
            <li> The ends of the bristles on this brush are extremely sharp.  </li>
            <li> Metal bristles are a bit sharp.  </li>
            <li> The tips of the bristles are sharper than the other I had</li>
            <li> Just what I expected!</li>
            <li> and I think lent to the slightly sharp ends.  </li>
            <li> so they weren&#x27;t so sharply cut on the ends.</li>
            <li> so three should last me until I&#x27;m dead!</li>
            <li> All of my other brushes like this have been made of wood, but I did&#x27;t think plastic would make a difference.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I like this product.</li>
            <li> The ends are roughly cut and are a little sharp on the scalp.</li>
            <li> This is a very stiff brush and definitely massages your scalp.  </li>
            <li> These are the only brushes that work with my long, thick hair!  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time, gets into small areas like ears, mouth and under chest.</li>
            <li> I broke down and bought this one.</li>
            <li> but it also cost less.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and will never use any other type of brush!</li>
            <li> Though the bristles were a bit stiff for my taste, they are metal &amp; I can deal with it &amp; would by this product again, as it is in all other ways satisfactory.</li>
            <li> She has long thick hair.</li>
            <li> It somehow gets through my hair with a minimum amount of strokes and little to no damage.</li>
            <li> but it still gets the tangles out with a little care.</li>
            <li> Bristles are a little scratchy</li>
            <li> I had looked everywhere to replace this style brush ,but all I could find was ones with the little balls on tips.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it still pulls my hair a little bit.  </li>
            <li> Have to be careful how hard you brush your hair.  </li>
            <li> This brush is too stiff for my hair.</li>
            <li> The rubber base on this brush is not quite as soft as the 125 but close enough to take</li>
            <li> I am not sure it will work well even on ethnic hair</li>
            <li> It is a stiff brush though, so if you don&#x27;t like really hard bristles</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t brush as hard.</li>
            <li> Metal Bristles are too hard on the scalp.</li>
            <li> I compensated by not brushing as hard...</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t press hard.</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding brushes that don&#x27;t have balls on the end of the bristles</li>
            <li> After years of using the scalpmaster I was desperate to find something after my last brush wore out and broke.  </li>
            <li> (at least too much).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s at least why my wife likes it.</li>
            <li> I was desperate enough to try a wire dog brush and found out they put them on those also.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Until then, this Phillips will be the stand in since all other brushes are useless to me.</li>
            <li> There is no better option!</li>
            <li> Seriously, I&#x27;ve been looking for this hair brush for 20 years.</li>
            <li> You must have a tough head to use though as bristles feel</li>
            <li> but there are cracks on each side of the head from the stress of going through my very thick hair.</li>
            <li> They need to be used to be broken in and softened.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The poor dogs that have to deal with them.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I got a bad head or what</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t find these anywhere without those annoying balls on the ends of the bristles.</li>
            <li> Worst brush</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just what we needed.&lt;br /&gt;This works well and was recommended by the retailer.&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive, but all that we needed.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> The ends of the bristles on this brush are extremely sharp.  I have short baby fine hair, and although it brushed through my hair okay, even the slightest pressure brought extreme discomfort.  The tips of the bristles need to be re-designed.</li>
            <li> The brush is great  I love it</li>
            <li> This brush is too stiff for my hair. I am not sure it will work well even on ethnic hair but my first reaction when I got it was why so many people found it so great? I had to return it.</li>
            <li> Best brush ever.  Good for the scalp.</li>
            <li> I could not get the brush we had always used before so tried the Phillips brush 11.  So far it&#x27;s great. I hope it holds up well.</li>
            <li> Metal bristles are a bit sharp.  Have to be careful how hard you brush your hair.  Not as comfortable to use as other metal brushes I&#x27;ve used in the past</li>
            <li> My old metal bristle brush kicked the bucket after using it since elementary school. (I&#x27;m now 31!) This looked like a good replacement but was disappointed. It was more like torture when I tried brushing my hair. I was able to return it with no problems.</li>
            <li> Great brush, once you start using it you won&#x27;t want to be without.  I&#x27;m a hairdresser and I have used this brush&lt;br /&gt;my entire career, and continue now.  I have had clients, family and friends purchase these in bulk to give as gifts.  My brother purchased six, one each for all his family, and one to put in the safe.</li>
            <li> I waited a month before writing this. Yes, the pins took me about 2 days to get used to. (I knew from reading other reviews that I should be a little careful at first.) I really like them though. The rubber pad has already softened a little, hopefully it won&#x27;t get too much softer. This Brush is very easy to clean.  This brush removes tangles, almost as well as using your fingers. It doesn&#x27;t pull. Without the ball tips, you can easily detract hair from the brush, if you happen find a knot, to work through it from the bottom.   Works well on wet or dry hair. Goes easily through my very thick coarse hair.  I have no idea why, but since getting this I don&#x27;t feel the need to re-brush my 10x a day. I&#x27;m happy with 1-2 times.  The reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is the handle. I wish it was more bulbous. It&#x27;s flat, which is harder to hold onto with these arthritic hands (I&#x27;m ambidextrous). Handle is &#x27;just&#x27; long enough with these large hands.  UPDATE: Going to have to buy a new one. Not sure if I got a bad head or what but there are cracks on each side of the head from the stress of going through my very thick hair. I will be replacing it with one of the same. Wish these still used a wood body instead of thinner plastic. The one nice thing is the head is large enough to just hold in your hand.</li>
            <li> Very pointy and sharp bristles</li>
            <li> My hair is about 3 feet long or so. It&#x27;s fine and it tangles like crazy. I am not exaggerating when I say that there is not a single comb or pick or brush at any store that can get through my hair without tearing it all up. Nothing at Sally&#x27;s, none of those hand held palm brushes, none of them work. I got a brush like this once at Ray&#x27;s Beauty in New York and it changed my life. It somehow gets through my hair with a minimum amount of strokes and little to no damage. Instead of taking ten or fifteen minutes to comb out, I can brush out my hair in a minute with this. I don&#x27;t know the original brand of brush I bought, but I tried this one and it&#x27;s just about the same. So I definitely recommend to anyone with tangly hair!!</li>
            <li> 100 $ PERFECT, THANKS A LOT !!!!!!</li>
            <li> Was so glad to find the metal bristle brush again. The tips of the bristles are sharper than the other I had so I don&#x27;t brush as hard. I love the way it flows through my hair.  My hair is long and fine. My sons girlfriend loves it also. She has long thick hair. We love it overall</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and is a great little brush. Works excellent on my Great Pyrenese. The handle could be somewhat reinforced but I will be more careful with this one!</li>
            <li> This brush works great for my Shelties. I need a straight pin brush to get through their fur. A lot of pin brushes have rounded pins and those will not go through a doubled coated dog coat. I use this in conjunction with a slicker brush and they look beautiful Good price too!</li>
            <li> This product replaces the Scalpmaster that used to be made in France. Phillips bought the factory in France and continue to produce the same brush under their own name. This brush is identical to my old Scalpmaster brushes.</li>
            <li> After years of using the scalpmaster I was desperate to find something after my last brush wore out and broke.  I have very long fine hair that gets some very nasty tangles, my daughter has long hair that has a lot of body (more like frizz and ringlets) and this brush works well on both.  It is not the same as the scalpmaster and does not last as long but it also cost less.  It pulls more but it still gets the tangles out with a little care. Yes the bristles are sharper but completely tolerable.  All in all I&#x27;m glad I purchased it and very happy to have something that is so close to the scalpmaster.</li>
            <li> I use this as a wig brush. Works fine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand of brush for over 15 years. It is my favorite ever. My hair is very fine but thick. The metal bristles cut through tangles and rarely cause static like plastic brushes. I will never own another kind of brush.</li>
            <li> My wife had a Scalpmaster that was about as old as she was, and it broke one day when it smacked on something.  We got her this one as a replacement.  Three things you should know when buying this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1: It&#x27;s not the original Scalpmaster.  It is branded Phillips.  The original Scalpmasters are gone.  However, it is built practically identical to the scalpmaster and has been pulled through some of the toughest hair you can find, with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2: Anyone who remembers buying a new original Scalpmaster will know that the original brush pads are stiff.  They&#x27;re like a leather glove.  They need to be used to be broken in and softened.  The more you use it, the softer and more conforming the red pad becomes.  According to my wife, it could take upwards of a year for light use.  Also, toughing it out and toughening your skin on your head doesn&#x27;t hurt either (at least too much).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3: It&#x27;s a metal bristle brush.  Don&#x27;t expect feathers to comb through your hair.  It&#x27;s made this way on purpose for a purpose.  If you don&#x27;t like the idea or feeling of metal, flat tipped pins on your head, don&#x27;t buy the brush.  However, we can hold the original Scalpmaster next to this one and the pins are identical in every respect (size, shape, tip, position...).  If you get one, expect that it will feel like metal bristles on your head because that&#x27;s what it is and that&#x27;s at least why my wife likes it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this phillips brush #11 to replace my Scalpmaster 25, which is no longer being made, as far as I can tell. The bristles are much stiffer, so it does pull more on tangles or wet hair, and is slightly rougher on the scalp, but I would still choose it over any brush out there. I also use it on my little girls, and if I am gentle, they don&#x27;t mind it either.</li>
            <li> it is better than the other one that is a 126.  this is very close to the old 125 and works fine on my dogs</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush!  It doesn&#x27;t have the knobs on the ends of the bristles so it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair and after it gets broke in it feels great on your scalp.  When my friends use it, they all want one too!</li>
            <li> This is just as good as the scalp master!!! I have tried many look alikes but this is as close as I have come. Love it</li>
            <li> Wonderful brush for detangling my daughter&#x27;s fine long hair without hurting.  Plus, she really likes the gentle scalp massage as her hair is brushed out.</li>
            <li> Feels excellent on the scalp, improves hair quality.</li>
            <li> Awesome for long hair! Not the static of natural or poly brushes. No knobs to catch in hair. The best!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent brush for scalp stimulation and for scraping off dead skin.  I use it in the shower after a shampoo and the scalp and hair have never been better.  It&#x27;s rare to find a brush like this so I bought several because eventually they will wear out.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  Beauty supply stores don&amp;#34;&#x27;t seem to carry them anymore, so I am glad to have found this brush on line.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected! Bristles are a little scratchy but you get used to it. Great brush for thick hair.</li>
            <li> These are the only brushes that work with my long, thick hair!  Great at dealing with tangles!</li>
            <li> Just like the one I had in the 70&#x27;s except the handle is a durable plastic rather than wood.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I purchased the brush.  The best brush I&#x27;ve ever bought! ! ! ! !</li>
            <li> Great brushes.  So glad I am able to get them.  have used them for years.</li>
            <li> It is a bit more hard on the scalp.  I can&#x27;t find anything better than this.  I would order another one.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best hair brush ever. I have been using this brush since the &#x27;70s (even under the old brand name before Phillips bought it), and all of my family still uses this brush exclusively. The quality has remained consistent and durable, and I bet you we go through one about every 8 years. They are easy to clean with soda water, and the wire bristles don&#x27;t have those stupid little balls on the end that give you split ends (whoever thought of that did not want us long hairs to keep it healthy and beautiful). I have very thick, strong and long hair, where my husbands is finer and curly, and it works on any length hair very well. We even used to get our dogs their own growing up- golden retrievers, newfies, malamutes, etc. The thicker bristle gets through dense coats much better than the flimsy bristles found on most pet brushes, and the lack of those little balls on the end mean the bristle will disengage so that the hair isn&#x27;t pulled until it hurts or splits. My mom&#x27;s Maine Coon cat loves it, too. Pretty genius invention.</li>
            <li> This is a very stiff brush and definitely massages your scalp.  Does not have the blunt bristle ends, so ends are pretty sharp..</li>
            <li> Metal Bristles are too hard on the scalp. It actually hurts when using this brush. I have thick straight hair. I wish the metal ends were more rounded and bulbous in shape. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying the Scalpmaster from France for almost 20 years now. I was really sad, completely frustrated and going bananas trying to track one down (for pretty much the better part of 5 years now). Finally figured out they aren&#x27;t making them anymore.. or whatever the deal is.  I&#x27;ve always had to replace them after about 3-4 years of use because the red rubber part breaks down so much that the metal bristles push into the brush.&lt;br /&gt;So I broke down and bought this one. Everything seemed of sound quality but the metal bristle ends seemed pretty sharp.  I compensated by not brushing as hard...its a happy medium considering the untimely departure of my other brush.  I compared this one to my beloved (made in France) brush and the French one had nice and neat tapered ends. Not exactly a ball point but not completely flat. This one (the Phillips) had the ends abruptly cut off at all different angles sort of and I think lent to the slightly sharp ends.  If I could find my French lovely if go back in an instant. Until then, this Phillips will be the stand in since all other brushes are useless to me.</li>
            <li> I wanted a brush with metal bristles because plastic ones contribute to static. So in that way this is great. The ends are roughly cut and are a little sharp on the scalp. At firs this bothered me a lot, but I have gotten used to it. I just don&#x27;t press hard. However, it would be better if they were at least plastic dipped on the tips, or if they were sanded or something so they weren&#x27;t so sharply cut on the ends. Maybe this exists but I didn&#x27;t look for that. One benefit is that it is super easy to clean the hair on the brush--it slips right off!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, thanks</li>
            <li> One reviewer states that it will take up to a year for the pad to soften.  How long does it take for the bristles to scrape the skin off your scalp?  Worst brush I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I am returning it.</li>
            <li> Great brush. I have fine hair and have been using this brand since the 1980s. I go through about two a year. Once the pins start sinking into the pad, it&#x27;s time to replace.</li>
            <li> I had looked everywhere to replace this style brush ,but all I could find was ones with the little balls on tips.&lt;br /&gt;SO pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon !Fast delivery and exactly like the one I needed replaced.IT is a very durable quality.Best hair brush you could ever want.</li>
            <li> this brush is great for my fine hair which tangles very easily, this brush untangles my hair and feels great on the scalp.  Maybe a little intense at first but it feels great to me!</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time, gets into small areas like ears, mouth and under chest. Pins are durable for long coats.</li>
            <li> I had my &amp;#34;scalp master 125&amp;#34; for like a hundred years; and have been looking for a brush with out those pain-in-the-ass&lt;br /&gt;rubber tips for like forever. I was desperate enough to try a wire dog brush and found out they put them on those also.&lt;br /&gt;The poor dogs that have to deal with them. Those rubber tips catch and pull your hair and hurt! what are they thinking?&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I digress. I was extremely happy to find these. They seem just a tad bit stiffer but who am I to say. My 125&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;are years old. I am a happy camper. thank you</li>
            <li> Just like the two I already have. They do a great job on my hair!</li>
            <li> wished one could get these brushes is stores â€¦.. they are awesome</li>
            <li> not quite the scalp master brush from France it is the best alternative that I have found so far</li>
            <li> Finally a brush that does not cause static in my fine hair.  You must have a tough head to use though as bristles feel like they scratch you so this may not be the brush for anyone that is tender headed</li>
            <li> Seriously, I&#x27;ve been looking for this hair brush for 20 years. I just got the two I ordered and they are exactly like the ones I&#x27;ve been looking for. Just ordered another one, afraid that I won&#x27;t be able to find it again. I&#x27;m 70 years old so three should last me until I&#x27;m dead! You can&#x27;t find these anywhere without those annoying balls on the ends of the bristles. So Happy!!!</li>
            <li> Though the bristles were a bit stiff for my taste, they are metal &amp; I can deal with it &amp; would by this product again, as it is in all other ways satisfactory.</li>
            <li> I have been using metal bristle brushes since I was a kid, they are the only thing that works well on my very long and fine hair without knotting it.  After years of looking to replace my current brush I decided to buy this one.  I have had a hard time finding brushes that don&#x27;t have balls on the end of the bristles so I was relieved to see that this one was exactly what I was looking for.  It is a stiff brush though, so if you don&#x27;t like really hard bristles I wouldn&#x27;t advice getting it.  The only reason I marked it down a star was because it was made of plastic.  All of my other brushes like this have been made of wood, but I did&#x27;t think plastic would make a difference.  I have very dry hair and when the weather gets dry (like in the winter) the plastic causes my hair to become staticky.  Other than that I like this product.</li>
            <li> Great, durable brush for humans or show dogs (which is what I buy these for) They are great to not break coat and a good price compared to the show vendors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Scalpmaster brush for years but they either changed the design or are using a different manufacturer and it&#x27;s junk.  This is a great quality brush and is less expensive than the other.  Very well made and easy on your hair!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a replacement brush for my Scalpmaster 125 and this is perfect! I have long thick hair and will never use any other type of brush! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a LOT better than any other brush I could find.  It is hard to find them without little balls on top.  However, it still pulls my hair a little bit.  Maybe after it softens up a bit it will be fine!  There is no better option!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this brush!!  Easy to use, no pulling, perfect size, and it feels good in my hand.  Hope they never stop making them.</li>
            <li> My daughter has an American Girl Doll and you can only use metal bristle brushes on the doll&#x27;s hair This works great, and I even like using it on my hair</li>
            <li> All the women in our family use these brushes and we LOVE them!!!! We all have longer hair, and they seem to help keep our hair healthy.  Some would say they&#x27;re for dogs or horses.....and that might be true, but we KNOW they are good for us!</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  I wish I could find more like it.</li>
            <li> I have used a sclapmaster 125 made in france my entire life. When iI found out they had stopped making them I didn&#x27;t know what to do. I was so happy to find out they are still making them, just under a different name. The Phillips 11 made in France! Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this brush! I have a picture of the two together. I will gry to post it on here so you can see them. Happy day for my scalp and hair!</li>
            <li> Great brush! Better than I expected and thanks for the quick shipper.. A++++ seller.. Would definitely recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a hairbrush with metal bristles forever; stores just don&#x27;t seem to carry them. I found this one here on Amazon, ordered it, and it is exactly what I wanted. The brush is sturdy, bristles don&#x27;t tangle in my hair, don&#x27;t break off. There is much less static electricity, too, than with regular brushes I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are a bit sharp; this could be a disadvantage if you have a sensitive scalp. I don&#x27;t have a problem with it though.</li>
            <li> I wish I had this year&#x27;s ago, I have long fine hair that tangles easily and this brush just glides through without pulling or ripping the hair. My hair is healthier than ever. I love this brush and will recommend it to my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth A Weir</li>
            <li> Bristles were too soft and after two uses several pins were bent. The cushion held the pins well.  Liked the weight of the brush but I prefer Scalpmaster brushed to Phillips Brush</li>
            <li> I just found a much better alternative since the original Scalpmaster 125 is no longer available: the Madan pin brush for dog grooming. They have several different firmness choices (for the pneumatic rubber cushion the pins are anchored in). For me, the Indigo Purple medium firmness was the best. If the original Scalpmaster 125 was 5 stars, this is 4 1/2 for me, for brushing out long, wet hair. The lady at TopLinePet.com has a great selection and service was prompt. Just be sure you leave a comment on your order that it will be used for a person, and not a dog. Otherwise, she very generously may send you a free dog toy or bow with your order ;)</li>
            <li> It is awesome. So glad i found it.</li>
            <li> It is a rather good replacement for the Scalpmaster 125 brush that is not made anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought this, hearing that it was a great idea to use a metal-bristled brush if you had dandruff. Those people are right. The bristles are a little pointier than nylon bristles and take a little getting used to, but I am confident that this was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> PRETTY DARN GOOD BRUSH,  for not being a Scalpmaster 125</li>
            <li> perfect for long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have hair extensions and this is the best brush I have found to use on them.</li>
            <li> a decent replacement for the scalpmaster 125. The rubber base on this brush is not quite as soft as the 125 but close enough to take it&#x27;s  place. The price is also better. This is a great brush for thick hair, not so much for thin hair. If your use to the scalpmaster 125 this brush is as close as I have found to takes it&#x27;s place and for a much better price. hopefully with cleanings it will soften up even more and will last longer than the 125.</li>
            <li> I understand that this brush is supposed to be made in the same factory in France that used to make the now-discontinued Scalpmaster brushes that were so popular.  I don&#x27;t know if I believe that, or perhaps the one that I received was counterfeit.  It seems to have a decent handle and the quality of the rubber pad into which the steel pins were firmly embedded was good.  My issue has to do with the pins:  they are not machined so that the ends are smooth, and some had sharp edges like cut wire.  Sending it back because of the scratching.</li>
