            <li>but it gives great results.</li>
            <li>I used the peel every five days for a month and my skin looks and feels amazing!  </li>
            <li>My face hasnt looked this great in a good year or so.</li>
            <li>Make sure to follow the directions, and I waited longer between each peel than suggested, but still had excellent results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m especially excited to move on to the level 3 products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>is the perfect percentage for my skin and its not to strong....</li>
            <li>Although the company said this would be good for hyperpigmentation, I didn&#x27;t know just how good ... until now.</li>
            <li>i am a fair skinned woman</li>
            <li>This is a good product for the money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be fair, I&#x27;ve used this once.</li>
            <li>Peel does a good job and evens your skin tone out and replenishes some luminosity to your skin.</li>
            <li>Good luck, and</li>
            <li>I never get as good as results without the peel.</li>
            <li>, I loved it.</li>
            <li>Best to use it after mild extractions.</li>
            <li>So I was more than happy with the results.     </li>
            <li>I love it great product A</li>
            <li>And I love it!  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty dang awesome.</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>they work for me, I am 40 and people tell me all of the time I look like I am in my 20&#x27;s gotta love that!</li>
            <li>Make sure you moisturize and stay out of the sun because YOU WILL BURN!</li>
            <li>It is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>The difference is amazing.  </li>
            <li>but my skin feels nicely hydrated.</li>
            <li>Thrilled with this product and the price.</li>
            <li>now?\\&quot; I don&#x27;t have that kind of patience.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the ability to do this on my own and not have to pay hundreds</li>
            <li>You can also mix your own neutralizer using baking soda and water.&lt;br /&gt;-Moisturize</li>
            <li>You can also mix your own neutralizer using baking soda and water.&lt;br /&gt;-Moisturize</li>
            <li>Well worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, just make sure you follow the instructions to a perfectly.</li>
            <li>The is the best peel I have used by far.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been very happy with everything I&#x27;ve purchased from this company.  </li>
            <li>Neutralizer skin pH balancer helps balance the pH of your skin for the safe and effective neutralization after peeling.]].</li>
            <li>I suffer from acne and very fine lines.</li>
            <li>i have a redheads complexion very light</li>
            <li>I have used 35% solutions that did more to my face than this product can.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used so many depigmenting creams/gels</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m hoping for more improvement.    </li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s more improvement: The spots are fading more.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>It looks more youthful and even toned.</li>
            <li>on it&#x27;s own, it&#x27;s ok, but with this lactic acid peel it is FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to continue using this product though because I think it&#x27;s better to have it than not.      </li>
            <li>The Skin Laboratory Glycolic 50% works better for me.</li>
            <li>Its better to apply it in the evening before bed, but if you&#x27;re going to use it during the day, make sure you use plenty of sunscreen.</li>
            <li>so it makes my moisturisers etc seem to work better too.  </li>
            <li>Also make sure you wear lots of sunscreen on your face for the weeks you are using this as I&#x27;ve heard horror stories of home peels sensitizing faces to sun damage and people ending up with brown blotchy faces.</li>
            <li>(Google it just to be sure of the web site.)</li>
            <li>I had hoped that my face would be all one color and the under eye circles would magically go away.  </li>
            <li>I like glycolic acid better...</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this instead of glycolic or salylic,</li>
            <li>I read many reviews and decided to go with this product.</li>
            <li>Do not leave on for more than 7 minutes because you may not feel the burn</li>
            <li>my make-up goes on so much better.</li>
            <li>Oh one more thing,</li>
            <li>My hands looked so much better after one treatment.</li>
            <li>but  i find that retina works  better for me</li>
            <li>after using many times i see no difference at all.  </li>
            <li>IDEA make sure the time is within the time indicated on the directions.</li>
            <li>Do not do it for more than that</li>
            <li>My skin looks noticeably better and there was no downtime.</li>
            <li>I really love this formula and have been using it for about a month.</li>
            <li>I thought to better play it safe, and start at 50% for the home based peel.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>Its my face, I can&#x27;t hide it, so I&#x27;d rather be safe than sorry.&lt;br</li>
            <li>do it more often than they recommend.  </li>
            <li>sure you wash off ALL of the acid.</li>
            <li>It works but I am still trying to find one more like the MD formulations one.  </li>
            <li>This one has been my favorite to use after, [[ASIN:B00700H128</li>
            <li>This one has been my favorite to use after, [[ASIN:B00700H128</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin looking healthy and revived.</li>
            <li>Maybe this is ok for 20something year olds.</li>
            <li>but i love it</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS...</li>
            <li>My skin feels smoother and younger, spots lighter, and I LOVE it!!!</li>
            <li>To be honest, the burning feeling was not bad at all</li>
            <li>and I am excited to see how that one works!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited and hope to see more improvement with more treatments..</li>
            <li>My skin feels much more hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li>So far I havent experienced any peeling.</li>
            <li>Comparing this to the other acid treatments, this one is the best.</li>
            <li>I thought this was very mild</li>
            <li>Love the glow after a few treatments and my face feels awesome after!</li>
            <li>This is a very mild peel, on a pain scale, I&#x27;d rate it at a 2.  </li>
            <li>This acide is very mild and didnt irrate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product, and no I did not even buy my 88% strong peel at Amazon.</li>
            <li>and I think this peel is just as good,(although not as strong).</li>
            <li>50% is strong so you might want to start with a lower acid rate and build up.  </li>
            <li>really strong and burns like hell</li>
            <li>The first time you use it, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>as someone pointed out,you HAVE to be really good about using sunscreen whenever you use a peel,otherwise you&#x27;ll damage your new skin.</li>
            <li>I have some acne spots on my chin area (from stress) that I am trying to get rid of, and some fine lines.  </li>
            <li>It was fine.</li>
            <li>I would say that the lactic peel is much more mild than the glycolic, but I do like using them together.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look and feel great, without the expense of a spa facial.</li>
            <li>I see my face different, so I&#x27;m so happy.</li>
            <li>Light body and darker face and hands</li>
            <li>And lightly pat your face with vitamin e oil after.</li>
            <li>you will have smooth skin</li>
            <li>But after it peeled his skin looks so smooth now.</li>
            <li>Great for cystic or flaring red acne or getting rid of spots over time.  </li>
            <li>I used a fan brush and the product went on smoothly without problems.</li>
            <li>please everyone who plans to use this don&#x27;t not take the word \\&quot;ACID\\&quot; lightly.</li>
            <li>I tolerated the 50% well as I am somewhat used to glycolic, but honestly this peel if pretty mild.  </li>
            <li>I like to shower right after to make sure its all gone.  </li>
            <li>I felt better right away.  </li>
            <li>my skin looks a bit cleaner but the only downfall/dislike about this product is that I&#x27;ve seen more pimples popping up on my face!!</li>
            <li>Did not even tingle, DO NOT waste your money!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Pores were clearer and scars were significantly reduced and faded.  </li>
            <li>And PLEASE seek the advice of your friendly neighborhood dermatologist and/or esthetician before even attempting to peel.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>i have tried many acid peels, this peel makes my skin buttery soft does not burn or sting unlike many peels costing over twice the cost of this one.i</li>
            <li>Some are ok 1 min the first time, others the full 4 min.  </li>
            <li>Loved how it left my skin.</li>
            <li>I use it with another acid to get the full effect.</li>
            <li>Not strong as glycolic and very good for starter.</li>
            <li>I noticed a subtle improvement on my face each time and was so impressed.</li>
            <li>Yes, the skin underneath looked amazing, but really, who wants to look like Medusa for a couple of days in order to look like Venus?</li>
            <li>The coconut goes on oily, but absorbs quickly and does not clog my pores at all.</li>
            <li>Quick History of My Skin:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure with continued use it will only get better.</li>
            <li>I have used SO MANY products before this, both high end and drugstore.</li>
            <li>The very first time I used it</li>
            <li>My very first acid purchase from amazon.  </li>
            <li>Lactic acid is my new favorite product.</li>
            <li>I could really tell the difference!!</li>
            <li>Cannot tell if it does much for fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I Think i was a bit more accurate than the 2nd</li>
            <li>I will use it more frequently and longer as my skin adjusts.</li>
            <li>and  I see a really fresh glow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not an experienced user, but I do use a lactic acid lotion daily, so maybe that&#x27;s why my skin isn&#x27;t as sensitive to it as some.  </li>
            <li>A friend of mine got professional peels that cost a LOT of money, and she didn&#x27;t seem to have any better results.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, after using both peels, I think the only reason I get pimples now is because I still touch my face</li>
            <li>Watching a you-tube video put out by someone who is qualified is a good alternative if you are not much of a reader.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This&lt;br /&gt;line of items is always worth the money.</li>
            <li>I am fine with that, and since the first time didn&#x27;t seem to do much anything, I kept this on for 7 minutes in my head.</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t believe anyone in their right mind would say this burns their face.  </li>
            <li>And it burned my chin, but I didn&#x27;t do it right, so it&#x27;s not anyone&#x27;s fault but mine.</li>
            <li>We all want immediate results and some people have resistant skin that can get away with plunging in to the deeper peels right away</li>
            <li>You pour onto cottonball and sweep your face right after peel, then wash it off with water.</li>
            <li>My skin is much more luminous and the pigmentation seems to be really breaking apart and dissolving (this is normal).</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and visually see results for a do it yourself beauty product.  </li>
            <li>I had read somewhere that milk maids of old had beautiful hands due to lactc acid and decided it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try.</li>
            <li>and I have a hand held red light therapy light that I use right after it so that may help -</li>
            <li>so I would recommend it as best to use before bed time and to make sure you follow the directions carefully as I could see how it could burn your skin if left on too long.  </li>
            <li>It was not very painful at all.  </li>
            <li>Even though this product seems more gentle than the other peels, you still should not use it more than once a week.</li>
            <li>My husband works outside and has sun damaged skin, especially on has face and hands, he is two toned, Lol...</li>
            <li>And this is makin my break outs clear up very quickly.</li>
            <li>you are doing your peels, make sure you start with a clean DRY face</li>
            <li>It does tingle but very tolerable and makes your skin look smooth, even skin tone and super soft!</li>
            <li>love that peel as it really helped clear up my skin on a permanent basis from the time I first started using it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s already faded out some (not all) of the acne and the fine lines aren&#x27;t nearly as noticeable.</li>
            <li>you can, the best luck I have had with other skin products are using sulphur soap (available on amazon), biore blackhead face wash (green with beads in it, can&#x27;t really find it in stores anymore</li>
            <li>I used this peel on my leg and had the first peel May 27.</li>
            <li>After my first use, I felt no tingling, no sensation, nothing and thought it hadn&#x27;t worked</li>
            <li>the peel smells kinda funny</li>
            <li>But I stopped and I actually got more acne spots</li>
            <li>Always apply spf of 30 or more afterward and before starting with this 50% lactic prime your skin a week before by using 2-5% glycolic wash.</li>
            <li>Make up actually stays on better now.</li>
            <li>But, I got scared and didn&#x27;t use it at first (what if I burned off my face??</li>
            <li>The peel does that for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the lactic acid first and then followed with the 50% glycolic.</li>
            <li>This product works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I am Black/Filipino (medium brown complexion) and it helped with my acne and my hyper-pigmentation in just the first use.</li>
            <li>I read that it is just temporary and that if you&#x27;re willing to stick through the first week or two, it is going to deliver.</li>
            <li>This was the first peel I have ever used.</li>
            <li>and she wanted to get rid of some wrinkles and puffiness under her eyes, her skin was practically glowing after the first application.</li>
            <li>Overall, I will say I wasn&#x27;t satisfied since the product didn&#x27;t work as I hoped it would.</li>
            <li>His forehead brightened it is funny</li>
            <li>and I must say my skin looks visibly smoother, after the first application...</li>
            <li>recommend it to first time chemical peel users....</li>
            <li>Not really sure it this peel is best for African Americans.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>The first time I&#x27;ve used this, it didn&#x27;t burn or anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the first time, I think I&#x27;ve used it for 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>you have never tried a peel before, I would first recommend using their salicylic acid peel.</li>
            <li>Have been using the regular, switchd for sure.</li>
            <li>I let it sit for 8 minutes, (wouldn&#x27;t recommend for beginners, it took a while to build up to that with the glycolic peel, it does sting alot when you first start using them, but everyone is different)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>looks really fresh and very cleaned out.</li>
            <li>Also noncomengenic and hyper-allergenic are the key words you want to see in your sunscreen to make sure it doesn&#x27;t break you out.</li>
            <li>This stuff works very well !</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I tried this peel, I started with a one minute application.</li>
            <li>Only photofacials had been able to remove it but it returned with the slightest bit of sun (hyper-active melanocytes)</li>
            <li>So, I ordered a higher percentage gel for her which is Glyco-Lac/60</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or leave a residue.ball and sweep your face right after peel, then wash it off with water.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only done two peels using this so far (also used a 50% Glycolic peel after the lactic peel), but my skin already looks a 100 times better!</li>
            <li>The acid is very strong, so be careful in the first application.</li>
            <li>so it felt really good to hear comments after only the second appl.  </li>
            <li>Love the gel peel, easier on the face and does not burn as much as the regular peels.  </li>
            <li>Just be careful, it is very strong.</li>
            <li>If you do not have anything in your back ground that gives you understanding about these peels then I would strongly suggest doing some reading first, so that you can familiarize yourself with them and get an understanding of how this stuff works.</li>
            <li>but after the first use I don&#x27;t really feel like I see a difference after using this product.  </li>
            <li>It really is not difficult to use and it was gentle for my skin; this may be because I have had peels done before.  </li>
            <li>So, I am pretty much a makeup/skin care whore...</li>
            <li>I am not really a skin care kind of person and now that I am getting older I need to be.</li>
            <li>The breakouts have gotten smaller very quickly.</li>
            <li>Washed face with a mild cleanser and then applied a moisturizer with natural ingradients with a touch of EVOO.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it was strong enough for my skin, that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li>This high quality peel is exactly what you pay 200 and plus dollars for one treatment at the dermatologist office.</li>
            <li>have some discoloration from sun damage, and this is the only acid that has faded those areas.also a huge diffrence of the texture, and tighter pores.</li>
            <li>only keeping a few staples in my life - the stuff that is so great</li>
            <li>Did&#x27;nt really help with my age spots like I was hoping</li>
            <li>i moisturize and stay out of the sun as much as i can.</li>
            <li>But...this instructions did say that you really start to see results after the sixth application.  </li>
            <li>Very unpappy with results.</li>
            <li>Please purchase the fan it really helps in applying the product vs using a cotton ball which really soaks up the peel.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product for it because It really helps my legs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m curious to see how it works over time and will update with more results.  </li>
            <li>another note: a girlfriend of mine used the peel and felt absolutely nothing... not even a tingle.  </li>
            <li>So, you see, it really does depend on the sensitivity of your skin as to whether it will burn or not.</li>
            <li>Nothing to worry about really.</li>
            <li>This product does get rid of pimples really well though, as it will reduce them overnight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I can feel the stinging, the burning, but it&#x27;s very tolerable for 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li>and they all worked very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, but I didn&#x27;t feel much anything</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if I didn&#x27;t put much on or</li>
            <li>really wish it would help with my skin, but I doubt it will do that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll do what I want it to really do.</li>
            <li>I have a chemistry back ground, so I felt comfortable using it on myself.</li>
            <li>Getting ready to upgrade soon.</li>
            <li>and we can tell a real difference in her</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say it has done this, not yet any way.  </li>
            <li>a couple times literally took off to much skin, ended up with lines and scars.</li>
            <li>Has reduced the discoloration on my face it did take maybe 3 bottles like a year before I saw a real difference</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or leave a residue.</li>
            <li>I think it is too gentle if u are used to stronger peels</li>
            <li>I have been using lactic acid 50% for about two years now and it really improved the condition of my skin (post-acne hyperpigmentation).</li>
            <li>My suggestion is to have all your supplies ready because when it&#x27;s time to remove mask you will want it off fast.  </li>
            <li>Have it ready.</li>
            <li>I have tried this one out a few times now, and I can say that it&#x27;s extremely effective at evening out your skin tone and reducing the appearance of acne scars.</li>
            <li>The bottle of this I received doesn&#x27;t seem work as effectively with my body as the Glycolic 50% does but every bottle strength may vary some, everyone use frequencies vary, time adjustments for everyone vary and everyone body responds different to different stimuli.</li>
            <li>The peeling action on hands reveals really smooth skin that is silky soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this 2x so far, and I&#x27;m pleased with the ease of use and results.</li>
            <li>Start out slow and follow with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s generally tolerated better by the skin and many of the products we use now contain salicylic acid, so your skin will be less sensitive to it.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>After using the acid peel, my skin is so bright and radiant that I would sometimes go out without a trace of make up on, which I previously wouldn&#x27;t have dare stepped out of the house bare face.</li>
            <li>but this has always been my favorite face wash), Walgreen Alphahydroxy face cream (in the past this also helps tremendously with breakouts), and any noncomengenic, hyper-allergenic lotion to keep your face moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have no noticeable issues with my skin right now, but the product leaves it unbelievably soft.</li>
            <li>no, it&#x27;s not GONE, but it&#x27;s more improvement than I&#x27;ve seen with any other product.  </li>
            <li>(he would love me anyhow, but he would think I was NUTS if he saw all the crap I do to be pretty lol)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how people are getting these amazing results.</li>
            <li>2 weeks is a mighty long time when you have people staring at the pimples on your face, thinking \\&quot;Shouldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>The product comes with a detailed pamphlet on how to use the product, how to prepare your skin- before and after, how long to leave on, and how to neutralize it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this product for three weeks, I have sensitive skin so upon using this product for the first time</li>
            <li>I add a spoon full to a bottle of my daily face scrub and it makes me glow every day.</li>
            <li>It not only made the skin look softer any other products I put on for a couple of days after using this seem to be absorbed better</li>
            <li>This once a week will have your skin in tip top shape and allows me to wear less makeup.</li>
            <li>i use a fan brush and now do the peel every month (began the regimen by doing it every 10 days), you can do it more or less often, and it does not make your skin dependent on it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m particularly hopeful that it helps some with the scarring.  </li>
            <li>I use the salicylic peel about once a week, but when I started using this one I quickly learned that you have to give it a little more time, maybe 10-14 days before doing a different peel.</li>
            <li>burns because its an acid at a relatively high concentration, so you can try a lower concentration or just prepare yourself for the fact that it hurts.  </li>
            <li>company is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>My face was on complete fire!!</li>
            <li>Its brighter, the scars a re a little lighter and my skin tone more even with each day after.</li>
            <li>The combination of the sulphur soap and any of the peels really works into your pores to clear everything out.</li>
            <li>I have melasma near my eyes from pregnancy and this is really helping to lighten it.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews on TCA on African-American kin, especially darker ones like me, I thought i was pretty much screwed, but tried it anyway.</li>
            <li>I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED WITH THIS PRODUCT, RESULTS THE NEXT DAY WERE: A NOTICABLE GLOW, TIGHTENING OF THE SKIN AND MORE EVEN SKIN TONE, LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT APPLICATION!</li>
            <li>I think in the long run, a person will get a better overall result with using peels and masks than with using acne meds.</li>
            <li>You get that immediate fresh look from the peel but without the gross peeling.</li>
            <li>I cannot leave it on for more than a few minutes because it begins to sting.</li>
            <li>Initial usage is pretty much what the product advertises.</li>
            <li>After that, she told me the gel peel really worked to reduce a little bit of her brown spots and fine lines.</li>
            <li>Every time I use it, my skin gets a little bit more sensitive to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the new skin it is a lot smother</li>
            <li>Your skin has to have time to heal and develop new skin before you strip it away again.&lt;br /&gt;-You</li>
            <li>OK so you should wear sunscreen on your face all the time but be extra careful while using this.</li>
            <li>so i scar regularly but this diminishes it fast without needing to wear so much makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw</li>
            <li>first time I applied it with a cotton ball...very lightly and washed it off after only 3 minutes due to reviews about burning.  </li>
            <li>The little age spots that sit in the deepest part of my eye circles are still there but becoming lighter.</li>
            <li>my skin is very soft now and every week i notice a difference.</li>
            <li>I am using to fade dark spots but its also making my face smooth as a baby, no lines whatsoever</li>
            <li>actually asked me what I was doing to my skin the day after I first used this.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>BUT when it peeled away I had new soft skin</li>
            <li>LEAVES SKIN SMOOTH AND IS HALF THE PRICE OF MY DERMATOLOGIST PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li>I noticed mild tingling and not much else</li>
            <li>It works very similar to the glycolic acid and seems to tolerate it even better with less redness.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping just to exfoliate some of the dullness from my skin with this, but was surprised at just how much of a difference it made to my facial skin.      </li>
            <li>I tried this product to help clear up some mild/moderate acne on my chin, forehead and sides of my face.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Key words are just to be patient, realise its going to take a couple months to do work on scars, but in the short term either peel really should help clear out the skin, and keep acne</li>
            <li>but maybe my skin is too far gone.  </li>
            <li>For safety issues we would have never sold professional peel products to anyone to do at home.</li>
            <li>far as results-</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, so i use my peel 3 times a week, followed by the tri luma cream.</li>
            <li>The second application was much milder.  </li>
            <li>I go out quite frequently without</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used this product about 4 times (every 5 days)</li>
            <li>and I am 49 years old.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the fact that this peel makes my face glow without the harsh look of a peel.</li>
            <li>I have had professional peels</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t, especially now that my boyfriend lives with me.  </li>
            <li>far, I have noticeably reduced the redness in my face</li>
            <li>I am a 55 year old olive skinned Caucasian.  </li>
            <li>Naturally, I had hoped in a miracle.  </li>
            <li>It has softened the fines lines and lightened the sunspots on my face considerably</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten professional peels before</li>
            <li>So far i have noticed my face is clearing up.</li>
            <li>2nd time I used it, I really washed my face to get rid of all the oils.&lt;br /&gt;Holy</li>
            <li>so I want to even out my skin as much as possible before I am in the sun to much to use the peels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, i have hormonal issues causing adult acne</li>
            <li>Hydrating Repair Peptide Wrinkle Cream (Post Peel) - Enhanced with Matrixyl® 3000, Argireline®, Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Natural Botanical Extracts]].</li>
            <li>Hydrating Repair Peptide Wrinkle Cream (Post Peel) - Enhanced with Matrixyl® 3000, Argireline®, Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Natural Botanical Extracts]].</li>
            <li>This is my least favorite.</li>
            <li>The second time it stung just as much, but again I could tolerate it.  </li>
            <li>I was very nervous about attempting a home peel, but I believe if you start with leaving it on for short amounts of time and work up, you should not have any problems.</li>
            <li>Its my favorite because its hard to find high spf that doesn&#x27;t leave a white haze, smell funky or make your eyes tear</li>
            <li>I also have pretty dry skin</li>
            <li>Still finishing up this one,, before I start the new one above,, can&#x27;t rate the new one yet.</li>
            <li>If you keep up a consistent routine, it really helps to keep the dead skin exfoliated and pores clear.</li>
            <li>First, this is a strong acid peel and you have to take it seriously when you apply it by following the instructions explicitly.</li>
            <li>No down time and no redness for my case.</li>
            <li>They sent free small bonus bottle of salicylic 20% too but haven&#x27;t use that yet.</li>
            <li>I was very nervous at first and watched the clock down to the second.</li>
            <li>It also helped with skin pigmentation from breakouts/scars which is why I primarily started using, I had very uneven skin tone and lots of scar</li>
            <li>It takes your skin (depending on age) 20-42 days for brand-new skin cells to work their way up to the surface of the epidermis, if your constantly stripping your damaging your new skin cells.</li>
            <li>The whole point of \\&quot;Peeling\\&quot; is to clear away the old dead skin cells and allow new ones to surface.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure I have previously written about their glycolic peel, as I had used it for several years, usually in the winter months, from when I was 20ish to 23</li>
            <li>This product works well as a before-bedtime peel for S. Asian and Middle Eastern skin in evening out skin tone but does not seem to work for ridding dark acne scar spots nor addressing fine lines/wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I used this 2 times the first time it lightened my skin and helped remove some old acne dark spots.</li>
            <li>This peel is a great way to start if you are new to peels because its hard to go wrong with it and it will allow you to practice your technique before you get into peels that have a higher potential for damage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received &#x27;professional&#x27; peels in the past and paid out so much $$$$, but didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li>Glycolic is too volatile and salicylic loses its strength/effectiveness quickly and only works on certain types of skin conditions.</li>
            <li>after just a little over a week, they are fading and healing, and my skin feel so fresh.</li>
            <li>Be careful with that though, if you get too bold you could end up with dry, flaking skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just be careful with your acid peel strategy particularly in how you choose to approach your sensitive skin areas and care for them afterwards.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little red, but not bad at all.  </li>
            <li>Patience is needed with peels and generally a series of 4-6 are needed depending on your expectations.</li>
            <li>I have used four applications so far and will definitely continue to use this product.  </li>
            <li>but if you naturally have big pores; this will not shrink them.</li>
            <li>I have combo to oily skin, I&#x27;m 30 years old and still get the occasional breakout.</li>
            <li>Sensitive enough for my skin, I used water afterwards didnt need my neutralizer.</li>
            <li>and I barely felt anything.</li>
            <li>I like this so far, only used it twice.</li>
            <li>Have only used it a couple of times so far.</li>
            <li>but the next morning my face felt sooo soft and moisturized</li>
            <li>I have only used this product once so far.</li>
            <li>but I think that normal because the same thing happened when I got a facial at the spa.  </li>
            <li>The first application I felt a lot of tingling and slight burning.  </li>
            <li>It really will even out the pigment of your skin due to scarring, acne, etc.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She said the Lactic Acid 50% gel was a little light chemical peeling for her aged skin.</li>
            <li>I used the fan brush and left it on for about a minute and a half on my first use.&lt;br /&gt;After 2 days</li>
            <li>Must apply frequently and each time, leave on a LONG time.</li>
            <li>It burns the first few times, I space treatments a week apart.</li>
            <li>I feel like it really takes the sting out of the peel too and calms my skin down.</li>
            <li>She is around early 60 years old and starts complaining about her skin that has some dark spots and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I used the product exactly according to the directions, and used some baking soda mixed with water to neutralize the acid after it sat on my face for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Also, I would definitely not use more than once a week to ten days, since peels can thin your skin and cause long term damage if abused.</li>
            <li>I have naturally dry peeling, flaking skin, so I saw a little bit of peeling with this, and I love the way my face looks a few days later.</li>
            <li>Also, sunscreen is supremely important keeping in mind to reapply often as it may tend to wear off from those specific areas through excessive touching/rubbing as with sniffling or itchy dry noses, licking dry lips, playing with earrings/scarves/hair, etc.</li>

            <li> but my skin feels nicely hydrated.</li>
            <li> Thrilled with this product and the price.</li>
            <li> now?\\&quot; I don&#x27;t have that kind of patience.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the ability to do this on my own and not have to pay hundreds</li>
            <li> You can also mix your own neutralizer using baking soda and water.&lt;br /&gt;-Moisturize</li>
            <li> You can also mix your own neutralizer using baking soda and water.&lt;br /&gt;-Moisturize</li>
            <li> Well worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, just make sure you follow the instructions to a perfectly.</li>
            <li> The is the best peel I have used by far.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been very happy with everything I&#x27;ve purchased from this company.  </li>
            <li> Neutralizer skin pH balancer helps balance the pH of your skin for the safe and effective neutralization after peeling.]].</li>
            <li> I suffer from acne and very fine lines.</li>
            <li> i have a redheads complexion very light</li>
            <li> I have used 35% solutions that did more to my face than this product can.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used so many depigmenting creams/gels</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hoping for more improvement.    </li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s more improvement: The spots are fading more.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> It looks more youthful and even toned.</li>
            <li> on it&#x27;s own, it&#x27;s ok, but with this lactic acid peel it is FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to continue using this product though because I think it&#x27;s better to have it than not.      </li>
            <li> The Skin Laboratory Glycolic 50% works better for me.</li>
            <li> Its better to apply it in the evening before bed, but if you&#x27;re going to use it during the day, make sure you use plenty of sunscreen.</li>
            <li> so it makes my moisturisers etc seem to work better too.  </li>
            <li> Also make sure you wear lots of sunscreen on your face for the weeks you are using this as I&#x27;ve heard horror stories of home peels sensitizing faces to sun damage and people ending up with brown blotchy faces.</li>
            <li> (Google it just to be sure of the web site.)</li>
            <li> I had hoped that my face would be all one color and the under eye circles would magically go away.  </li>
            <li> I like glycolic acid better...</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this instead of glycolic or salylic,</li>
            <li> I read many reviews and decided to go with this product.</li>
            <li> Do not leave on for more than 7 minutes because you may not feel the burn</li>
            <li> my make-up goes on so much better.</li>
            <li> Oh one more thing,</li>
            <li> My hands looked so much better after one treatment.</li>
            <li> but  i find that retina works  better for me</li>
            <li> after using many times i see no difference at all.  </li>
            <li> IDEA make sure the time is within the time indicated on the directions.</li>
            <li> Do not do it for more than that</li>
            <li> My skin looks noticeably better and there was no downtime.</li>
            <li> I really love this formula and have been using it for about a month.</li>
            <li> I thought to better play it safe, and start at 50% for the home based peel.</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> Its my face, I can&#x27;t hide it, so I&#x27;d rather be safe than sorry.&lt;br</li>
            <li> do it more often than they recommend.  </li>
            <li> sure you wash off ALL of the acid.</li>
            <li> It works but I am still trying to find one more like the MD formulations one.  </li>
            <li> This one has been my favorite to use after, [[ASIN:B00700H128</li>
            <li> This one has been my favorite to use after, [[ASIN:B00700H128</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin looking healthy and revived.</li>
            <li> Maybe this is ok for 20something year olds.</li>
            <li> but i love it</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS...</li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother and younger, spots lighter, and I LOVE it!!!</li>
            <li> To be honest, the burning feeling was not bad at all</li>
            <li> and I am excited to see how that one works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited and hope to see more improvement with more treatments..</li>
            <li> My skin feels much more hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li> So far I havent experienced any peeling.</li>
            <li> Comparing this to the other acid treatments, this one is the best.</li>
            <li> I thought this was very mild</li>
            <li> Love the glow after a few treatments and my face feels awesome after!</li>
            <li> This is a very mild peel, on a pain scale, I&#x27;d rate it at a 2.  </li>
            <li> This acide is very mild and didnt irrate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, and no I did not even buy my 88% strong peel at Amazon.</li>
            <li> and I think this peel is just as good,(although not as strong).</li>
            <li> 50% is strong so you might want to start with a lower acid rate and build up.  </li>
            <li> really strong and burns like hell</li>
            <li> The first time you use it, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> as someone pointed out,you HAVE to be really good about using sunscreen whenever you use a peel,otherwise you&#x27;ll damage your new skin.</li>
            <li> I have some acne spots on my chin area (from stress) that I am trying to get rid of, and some fine lines.  </li>
            <li> It was fine.</li>
            <li> I would say that the lactic peel is much more mild than the glycolic, but I do like using them together.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look and feel great, without the expense of a spa facial.</li>
            <li> I see my face different, so I&#x27;m so happy.</li>
            <li> Light body and darker face and hands</li>
            <li> And lightly pat your face with vitamin e oil after.</li>
            <li> you will have smooth skin</li>
            <li> But after it peeled his skin looks so smooth now.</li>
            <li> Great for cystic or flaring red acne or getting rid of spots over time.  </li>
            <li> I used a fan brush and the product went on smoothly without problems.</li>
            <li> please everyone who plans to use this don&#x27;t not take the word \\&quot;ACID\\&quot; lightly.</li>
            <li> I tolerated the 50% well as I am somewhat used to glycolic, but honestly this peel if pretty mild.  </li>
            <li> I like to shower right after to make sure its all gone.  </li>
            <li> I felt better right away.  </li>
            <li> my skin looks a bit cleaner but the only downfall/dislike about this product is that I&#x27;ve seen more pimples popping up on my face!!</li>
            <li> Did not even tingle, DO NOT waste your money!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Pores were clearer and scars were significantly reduced and faded.  </li>
            <li> And PLEASE seek the advice of your friendly neighborhood dermatologist and/or esthetician before even attempting to peel.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> i have tried many acid peels, this peel makes my skin buttery soft does not burn or sting unlike many peels costing over twice the cost of this one.i</li>
            <li> Some are ok 1 min the first time, others the full 4 min.  </li>
            <li> Loved how it left my skin.</li>
            <li> I use it with another acid to get the full effect.</li>
            <li> Not strong as glycolic and very good for starter.</li>
            <li> I noticed a subtle improvement on my face each time and was so impressed.</li>
            <li> Yes, the skin underneath looked amazing, but really, who wants to look like Medusa for a couple of days in order to look like Venus?</li>
            <li> The coconut goes on oily, but absorbs quickly and does not clog my pores at all.</li>
            <li> Quick History of My Skin:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure with continued use it will only get better.</li>
            <li> I have used SO MANY products before this, both high end and drugstore.</li>
            <li> The very first time I used it</li>
            <li> My very first acid purchase from amazon.  </li>
            <li> Lactic acid is my new favorite product.</li>
            <li> I could really tell the difference!!</li>
            <li> Cannot tell if it does much for fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I Think i was a bit more accurate than the 2nd</li>
            <li> I will use it more frequently and longer as my skin adjusts.</li>
            <li> and  I see a really fresh glow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an experienced user, but I do use a lactic acid lotion daily, so maybe that&#x27;s why my skin isn&#x27;t as sensitive to it as some.  </li>
            <li> A friend of mine got professional peels that cost a LOT of money, and she didn&#x27;t seem to have any better results.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, after using both peels, I think the only reason I get pimples now is because I still touch my face</li>
            <li> Watching a you-tube video put out by someone who is qualified is a good alternative if you are not much of a reader.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This&lt;br /&gt;line of items is always worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am fine with that, and since the first time didn&#x27;t seem to do much anything, I kept this on for 7 minutes in my head.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t believe anyone in their right mind would say this burns their face.  </li>
            <li> And it burned my chin, but I didn&#x27;t do it right, so it&#x27;s not anyone&#x27;s fault but mine.</li>
            <li> We all want immediate results and some people have resistant skin that can get away with plunging in to the deeper peels right away</li>
            <li> You pour onto cottonball and sweep your face right after peel, then wash it off with water.</li>
            <li> My skin is much more luminous and the pigmentation seems to be really breaking apart and dissolving (this is normal).</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and visually see results for a do it yourself beauty product.  </li>
            <li> I had read somewhere that milk maids of old had beautiful hands due to lactc acid and decided it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try.</li>
            <li> and I have a hand held red light therapy light that I use right after it so that may help -</li>
            <li> so I would recommend it as best to use before bed time and to make sure you follow the directions carefully as I could see how it could burn your skin if left on too long.  </li>
            <li> It was not very painful at all.  </li>
            <li> Even though this product seems more gentle than the other peels, you still should not use it more than once a week.</li>
            <li> My husband works outside and has sun damaged skin, especially on has face and hands, he is two toned, Lol...</li>
            <li> And this is makin my break outs clear up very quickly.</li>
            <li> you are doing your peels, make sure you start with a clean DRY face</li>
            <li> It does tingle but very tolerable and makes your skin look smooth, even skin tone and super soft!</li>
            <li> love that peel as it really helped clear up my skin on a permanent basis from the time I first started using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s already faded out some (not all) of the acne and the fine lines aren&#x27;t nearly as noticeable.</li>
            <li> you can, the best luck I have had with other skin products are using sulphur soap (available on amazon), biore blackhead face wash (green with beads in it, can&#x27;t really find it in stores anymore</li>
            <li> I used this peel on my leg and had the first peel May 27.</li>
            <li> After my first use, I felt no tingling, no sensation, nothing and thought it hadn&#x27;t worked</li>
            <li> the peel smells kinda funny</li>
            <li> But I stopped and I actually got more acne spots</li>
            <li> Always apply spf of 30 or more afterward and before starting with this 50% lactic prime your skin a week before by using 2-5% glycolic wash.</li>
            <li> Make up actually stays on better now.</li>
            <li> But, I got scared and didn&#x27;t use it at first (what if I burned off my face??</li>
            <li> The peel does that for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the lactic acid first and then followed with the 50% glycolic.</li>
            <li> This product works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I am Black/Filipino (medium brown complexion) and it helped with my acne and my hyper-pigmentation in just the first use.</li>
            <li> I read that it is just temporary and that if you&#x27;re willing to stick through the first week or two, it is going to deliver.</li>
            <li> This was the first peel I have ever used.</li>
            <li> and she wanted to get rid of some wrinkles and puffiness under her eyes, her skin was practically glowing after the first application.</li>
            <li> Overall, I will say I wasn&#x27;t satisfied since the product didn&#x27;t work as I hoped it would.</li>
            <li> His forehead brightened it is funny</li>
            <li> and I must say my skin looks visibly smoother, after the first application...</li>
            <li> recommend it to first time chemical peel users....</li>
            <li> Not really sure it this peel is best for African Americans.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> The first time I&#x27;ve used this, it didn&#x27;t burn or anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the first time, I think I&#x27;ve used it for 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li> you have never tried a peel before, I would first recommend using their salicylic acid peel.</li>
            <li> Have been using the regular, switchd for sure.</li>
            <li> I let it sit for 8 minutes, (wouldn&#x27;t recommend for beginners, it took a while to build up to that with the glycolic peel, it does sting alot when you first start using them, but everyone is different)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> looks really fresh and very cleaned out.</li>
            <li> Also noncomengenic and hyper-allergenic are the key words you want to see in your sunscreen to make sure it doesn&#x27;t break you out.</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well !</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I tried this peel, I started with a one minute application.</li>
            <li> Only photofacials had been able to remove it but it returned with the slightest bit of sun (hyper-active melanocytes)</li>
            <li> So, I ordered a higher percentage gel for her which is Glyco-Lac/60</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or leave a residue.ball and sweep your face right after peel, then wash it off with water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only done two peels using this so far (also used a 50% Glycolic peel after the lactic peel), but my skin already looks a 100 times better!</li>
            <li> The acid is very strong, so be careful in the first application.</li>
            <li> so it felt really good to hear comments after only the second appl.  </li>
            <li> Love the gel peel, easier on the face and does not burn as much as the regular peels.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful, it is very strong.</li>
            <li> If you do not have anything in your back ground that gives you understanding about these peels then I would strongly suggest doing some reading first, so that you can familiarize yourself with them and get an understanding of how this stuff works.</li>
            <li> but after the first use I don&#x27;t really feel like I see a difference after using this product.  </li>
            <li> It really is not difficult to use and it was gentle for my skin; this may be because I have had peels done before.  </li>
            <li> So, I am pretty much a makeup/skin care whore...</li>
            <li> I am not really a skin care kind of person and now that I am getting older I need to be.</li>
            <li> The breakouts have gotten smaller very quickly.</li>
            <li> Washed face with a mild cleanser and then applied a moisturizer with natural ingradients with a touch of EVOO.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it was strong enough for my skin, that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> This high quality peel is exactly what you pay 200 and plus dollars for one treatment at the dermatologist office.</li>
            <li> have some discoloration from sun damage, and this is the only acid that has faded those areas.also a huge diffrence of the texture, and tighter pores.</li>
            <li> only keeping a few staples in my life - the stuff that is so great</li>
            <li> Did&#x27;nt really help with my age spots like I was hoping</li>
            <li> i moisturize and stay out of the sun as much as i can.</li>
            <li> But...this instructions did say that you really start to see results after the sixth application.  </li>
            <li> Very unpappy with results.</li>
            <li> Please purchase the fan it really helps in applying the product vs using a cotton ball which really soaks up the peel.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product for it because It really helps my legs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m curious to see how it works over time and will update with more results.  </li>
            <li> another note: a girlfriend of mine used the peel and felt absolutely nothing... not even a tingle.  </li>
            <li> So, you see, it really does depend on the sensitivity of your skin as to whether it will burn or not.</li>
            <li> Nothing to worry about really.</li>
            <li> This product does get rid of pimples really well though, as it will reduce them overnight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I can feel the stinging, the burning, but it&#x27;s very tolerable for 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li> and they all worked very well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, but I didn&#x27;t feel much anything</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if I didn&#x27;t put much on or</li>
            <li> really wish it would help with my skin, but I doubt it will do that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll do what I want it to really do.</li>
            <li> I have a chemistry back ground, so I felt comfortable using it on myself.</li>
            <li> Getting ready to upgrade soon.</li>
            <li> and we can tell a real difference in her</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say it has done this, not yet any way.  </li>
            <li> a couple times literally took off to much skin, ended up with lines and scars.</li>
            <li> Has reduced the discoloration on my face it did take maybe 3 bottles like a year before I saw a real difference</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or leave a residue.</li>
            <li> I think it is too gentle if u are used to stronger peels</li>
            <li> I have been using lactic acid 50% for about two years now and it really improved the condition of my skin (post-acne hyperpigmentation).</li>
            <li> My suggestion is to have all your supplies ready because when it&#x27;s time to remove mask you will want it off fast.  </li>
            <li> Have it ready.</li>
            <li> I have tried this one out a few times now, and I can say that it&#x27;s extremely effective at evening out your skin tone and reducing the appearance of acne scars.</li>
            <li> The bottle of this I received doesn&#x27;t seem work as effectively with my body as the Glycolic 50% does but every bottle strength may vary some, everyone use frequencies vary, time adjustments for everyone vary and everyone body responds different to different stimuli.</li>
            <li> The peeling action on hands reveals really smooth skin that is silky soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this 2x so far, and I&#x27;m pleased with the ease of use and results.</li>
            <li> Start out slow and follow with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s generally tolerated better by the skin and many of the products we use now contain salicylic acid, so your skin will be less sensitive to it.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> After using the acid peel, my skin is so bright and radiant that I would sometimes go out without a trace of make up on, which I previously wouldn&#x27;t have dare stepped out of the house bare face.</li>
            <li> but this has always been my favorite face wash), Walgreen Alphahydroxy face cream (in the past this also helps tremendously with breakouts), and any noncomengenic, hyper-allergenic lotion to keep your face moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have no noticeable issues with my skin right now, but the product leaves it unbelievably soft.</li>
            <li> no, it&#x27;s not GONE, but it&#x27;s more improvement than I&#x27;ve seen with any other product.  </li>
            <li> (he would love me anyhow, but he would think I was NUTS if he saw all the crap I do to be pretty lol)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how people are getting these amazing results.</li>
            <li> 2 weeks is a mighty long time when you have people staring at the pimples on your face, thinking \\&quot;Shouldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> The product comes with a detailed pamphlet on how to use the product, how to prepare your skin- before and after, how long to leave on, and how to neutralize it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for three weeks, I have sensitive skin so upon using this product for the first time</li>
            <li> I add a spoon full to a bottle of my daily face scrub and it makes me glow every day.</li>
            <li> It not only made the skin look softer any other products I put on for a couple of days after using this seem to be absorbed better</li>
            <li> This once a week will have your skin in tip top shape and allows me to wear less makeup.</li>
            <li> i use a fan brush and now do the peel every month (began the regimen by doing it every 10 days), you can do it more or less often, and it does not make your skin dependent on it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m particularly hopeful that it helps some with the scarring.  </li>
            <li> I use the salicylic peel about once a week, but when I started using this one I quickly learned that you have to give it a little more time, maybe 10-14 days before doing a different peel.</li>
            <li> burns because its an acid at a relatively high concentration, so you can try a lower concentration or just prepare yourself for the fact that it hurts.  </li>
            <li> company is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My face was on complete fire!!</li>
            <li> Its brighter, the scars a re a little lighter and my skin tone more even with each day after.</li>
            <li> The combination of the sulphur soap and any of the peels really works into your pores to clear everything out.</li>
            <li> I have melasma near my eyes from pregnancy and this is really helping to lighten it.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews on TCA on African-American kin, especially darker ones like me, I thought i was pretty much screwed, but tried it anyway.</li>
            <li> I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED WITH THIS PRODUCT, RESULTS THE NEXT DAY WERE: A NOTICABLE GLOW, TIGHTENING OF THE SKIN AND MORE EVEN SKIN TONE, LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT APPLICATION!</li>
            <li> I think in the long run, a person will get a better overall result with using peels and masks than with using acne meds.</li>
            <li> You get that immediate fresh look from the peel but without the gross peeling.</li>
            <li> I cannot leave it on for more than a few minutes because it begins to sting.</li>
            <li> Initial usage is pretty much what the product advertises.</li>
            <li> After that, she told me the gel peel really worked to reduce a little bit of her brown spots and fine lines.</li>
            <li> Every time I use it, my skin gets a little bit more sensitive to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the new skin it is a lot smother</li>
            <li> Your skin has to have time to heal and develop new skin before you strip it away again.&lt;br /&gt;-You</li>
            <li> OK so you should wear sunscreen on your face all the time but be extra careful while using this.</li>
            <li> so i scar regularly but this diminishes it fast without needing to wear so much makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw</li>
            <li> first time I applied it with a cotton ball...very lightly and washed it off after only 3 minutes due to reviews about burning.  </li>
            <li> The little age spots that sit in the deepest part of my eye circles are still there but becoming lighter.</li>
            <li> my skin is very soft now and every week i notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I am using to fade dark spots but its also making my face smooth as a baby, no lines whatsoever</li>
            <li> actually asked me what I was doing to my skin the day after I first used this.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> BUT when it peeled away I had new soft skin</li>
            <li> LEAVES SKIN SMOOTH AND IS HALF THE PRICE OF MY DERMATOLOGIST PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> I noticed mild tingling and not much else</li>
            <li> It works very similar to the glycolic acid and seems to tolerate it even better with less redness.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping just to exfoliate some of the dullness from my skin with this, but was surprised at just how much of a difference it made to my facial skin.      </li>
            <li> I tried this product to help clear up some mild/moderate acne on my chin, forehead and sides of my face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Key words are just to be patient, realise its going to take a couple months to do work on scars, but in the short term either peel really should help clear out the skin, and keep acne</li>
            <li> but maybe my skin is too far gone.  </li>
            <li> For safety issues we would have never sold professional peel products to anyone to do at home.</li>
            <li> far as results-</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, so i use my peel 3 times a week, followed by the tri luma cream.</li>
            <li> The second application was much milder.  </li>
            <li> I go out quite frequently without</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used this product about 4 times (every 5 days)</li>
            <li> and I am 49 years old.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the fact that this peel makes my face glow without the harsh look of a peel.</li>
            <li> I have had professional peels</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t, especially now that my boyfriend lives with me.  </li>
            <li> far, I have noticeably reduced the redness in my face</li>
            <li> I am a 55 year old olive skinned Caucasian.  </li>
            <li> Naturally, I had hoped in a miracle.  </li>
            <li> It has softened the fines lines and lightened the sunspots on my face considerably</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten professional peels before</li>
            <li> So far i have noticed my face is clearing up.</li>
            <li> 2nd time I used it, I really washed my face to get rid of all the oils.&lt;br /&gt;Holy</li>
            <li> so I want to even out my skin as much as possible before I am in the sun to much to use the peels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , i have hormonal issues causing adult acne</li>
            <li> Hydrating Repair Peptide Wrinkle Cream (Post Peel) - Enhanced with Matrixyl® 3000, Argireline®, Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Natural Botanical Extracts]].</li>
            <li> Hydrating Repair Peptide Wrinkle Cream (Post Peel) - Enhanced with Matrixyl® 3000, Argireline®, Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Natural Botanical Extracts]].</li>
            <li> This is my least favorite.</li>
            <li> The second time it stung just as much, but again I could tolerate it.  </li>
            <li> I was very nervous about attempting a home peel, but I believe if you start with leaving it on for short amounts of time and work up, you should not have any problems.</li>
            <li> Its my favorite because its hard to find high spf that doesn&#x27;t leave a white haze, smell funky or make your eyes tear</li>
            <li> I also have pretty dry skin</li>
            <li> Still finishing up this one,, before I start the new one above,, can&#x27;t rate the new one yet.</li>
            <li> If you keep up a consistent routine, it really helps to keep the dead skin exfoliated and pores clear.</li>
            <li> First, this is a strong acid peel and you have to take it seriously when you apply it by following the instructions explicitly.</li>
            <li> No down time and no redness for my case.</li>
            <li> They sent free small bonus bottle of salicylic 20% too but haven&#x27;t use that yet.</li>
            <li> I was very nervous at first and watched the clock down to the second.</li>
            <li> It also helped with skin pigmentation from breakouts/scars which is why I primarily started using, I had very uneven skin tone and lots of scar</li>
            <li> It takes your skin (depending on age) 20-42 days for brand-new skin cells to work their way up to the surface of the epidermis, if your constantly stripping your damaging your new skin cells.</li>
            <li> The whole point of \\&quot;Peeling\\&quot; is to clear away the old dead skin cells and allow new ones to surface.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure I have previously written about their glycolic peel, as I had used it for several years, usually in the winter months, from when I was 20ish to 23</li>
            <li> This product works well as a before-bedtime peel for S. Asian and Middle Eastern skin in evening out skin tone but does not seem to work for ridding dark acne scar spots nor addressing fine lines/wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I used this 2 times the first time it lightened my skin and helped remove some old acne dark spots.</li>
            <li> This peel is a great way to start if you are new to peels because its hard to go wrong with it and it will allow you to practice your technique before you get into peels that have a higher potential for damage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received &#x27;professional&#x27; peels in the past and paid out so much $$$$, but didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Glycolic is too volatile and salicylic loses its strength/effectiveness quickly and only works on certain types of skin conditions.</li>
            <li> after just a little over a week, they are fading and healing, and my skin feel so fresh.</li>
            <li> Be careful with that though, if you get too bold you could end up with dry, flaking skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just be careful with your acid peel strategy particularly in how you choose to approach your sensitive skin areas and care for them afterwards.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little red, but not bad at all.  </li>
            <li> Patience is needed with peels and generally a series of 4-6 are needed depending on your expectations.</li>
            <li> I have used four applications so far and will definitely continue to use this product.  </li>
            <li> but if you naturally have big pores; this will not shrink them.</li>
            <li> I have combo to oily skin, I&#x27;m 30 years old and still get the occasional breakout.</li>
            <li> Sensitive enough for my skin, I used water afterwards didnt need my neutralizer.</li>
            <li> and I barely felt anything.</li>
            <li> I like this so far, only used it twice.</li>
            <li> Have only used it a couple of times so far.</li>
            <li> but the next morning my face felt sooo soft and moisturized</li>
            <li> I have only used this product once so far.</li>
            <li> but I think that normal because the same thing happened when I got a facial at the spa.  </li>
            <li> The first application I felt a lot of tingling and slight burning.  </li>
            <li> It really will even out the pigment of your skin due to scarring, acne, etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She said the Lactic Acid 50% gel was a little light chemical peeling for her aged skin.</li>
            <li> I used the fan brush and left it on for about a minute and a half on my first use.&lt;br /&gt;After 2 days</li>
            <li> Must apply frequently and each time, leave on a LONG time.</li>
            <li> It burns the first few times, I space treatments a week apart.</li>
            <li> I feel like it really takes the sting out of the peel too and calms my skin down.</li>
            <li> She is around early 60 years old and starts complaining about her skin that has some dark spots and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I used the product exactly according to the directions, and used some baking soda mixed with water to neutralize the acid after it sat on my face for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Also, I would definitely not use more than once a week to ten days, since peels can thin your skin and cause long term damage if abused.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dry peeling, flaking skin, so I saw a little bit of peeling with this, and I love the way my face looks a few days later.</li>
            <li> Also, sunscreen is supremely important keeping in mind to reapply often as it may tend to wear off from those specific areas through excessive touching/rubbing as with sniffling or itchy dry noses, licking dry lips, playing with earrings/scarves/hair, etc.</li>
            <li> After reading these results I was really expecting something dramatic, especially after 9 treatments but absolutely nothing has happened.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it and each time since there has been tingling and some slight burning but nothing extreme.</li>
            <li> more that once every 10 days will thin out your skin and will cause problems down the line.</li>
            <li> A little purging seems to be happening, which is normal since it is an exfoliant.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was pretty sceptical as I&#x27;m an aesthetician and had a hard time belieiving it would work as well as the peels I had done on clients in the office.</li>
            <li> Red peeling skin around nostrils, lip line and ear lobe creases is possible given these areas may have more sensitive skin to begin with or have indentations that enable the acid to pool into an inadvertently thicker application and also remain on skin longer if not adequately washed off from such crannies with diligence and copious amounts of cold water along with loads of moisturizer overnight.</li>
            <li> I have had problem skin in the past, but I really feel these peels have helped me.</li>
            <li> It is long lasting and will reorder once I run out.</li>
            <li> It really improved the dull red appearance and</li>
            <li> I left it on for about 4 minutes since I have a high tolerance, and yes my skin did get a little pink.</li>
            <li> i am an african american/native american woman with melasma and dark spots from different skin issues.</li>
            <li> My skin does feels so soft and tight.</li>
            <li> Redness last for a day or two and do not use other treatments for several days before or after</li>
            <li> to date, have received no marked improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture, tone nor any noticeable reduction in break outs.</li>
            <li> This peel will be something that I will use as long as I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just be careful if you have picked anything before peeling, you will burn that spot and leave it red!  </li>
            <li> The second time it burned into that rough skin around my mouth and nose.</li>
            <li> I did get little white heads on my face the next day</li>
            <li> So finally the other night I went for it...</li>
            <li> It only burns a little when you actually have it on.</li>
            <li> and I have used other exfoliants such as Glycolic acid,  Retin A and salicylic acid</li>
            <li> Sometimes her face looked like dull and much older than her age.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Professional)]]I have spent a fortune on expensive hand creams that don&#x27;t really smooth skin on my hands....</li>
            <li> I wash my face, swipe it with alcohol on a cotton ball to remove any leftover oils and to help dry it.</li>
            <li> and I have had no new acne and my lines on my forehead</li>
            <li> I had no redness, only very slight irritation that was not visually noticeable.</li>
            <li> I had recently stopped taking my depo-shot and had a dark overcast on my face.</li>
            <li> For the record, I had a few chemical peels from my dermatologist (at $100 a pop, and you need at least 3) and my whole face would peel off and look totally gross for a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend who never noticed when I had 6\\&quot; of hair cut off and my hair dyed from dark brown to red noticed</li>
            <li> my dark skin definitely did not want to be lighter, I just wanted to even out my tone &amp; get rid of darker spots my chest, but I have yet to see results with those I bought this 3 weeks ago btw.</li>
            <li> i live by this product, i have had acne scars for a long time and this peel fades them away in just a few uses!!</li>
            <li> I used this while pregnant as I got a lot of acne my first trimester and hated the scars I had left over.</li>
            <li> There is a slight tingle as some reviewers have claimed which suggests that there is some acid in the solution ... given my experience, possibly 10%!</li>
            <li> On my Asian skin it does slightly burn/</li>
            <li> when I was pregnant i got a weird case of dermatitis around my mouth and nose</li>
            <li> I got a slight burn from using a cotton pad, I will use a flat brush with less on the applicator next time.</li>
            <li> It has helped my little age spots/freckles, but it has taken several uses.  </li>
            <li> Tingles just a little on skin, I&#x27;ve managed to keep it on 4 minutes already the 2nd time.</li>
            <li> it doesnt particularly clear acne, just removes dead dry skin, and if your acne is caused by excessive dry skin (like mine) it can help the acne situation</li>
            <li> Follow instructions carefully, it could still burn your skin.</li>
            <li> I am starting Accutane in a few weeks and wanted to get some smoothness and get rid of scarring before starting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars on masks, cleansers, toners and fade creams.</li>
            <li> We use a standard spf 30 sunscreen everyday before stepping out of the house too.</li>
            <li> Expected skin to peel.  </li>
            <li> but the skin around my mouth did feel rough.</li>
            <li> I was extremely careful.</li>
            <li> Then I take a break - you only have so much dead skin cells to take off after that you are damaging yourself.</li>
            <li> Well, after 2 months of using, I can say there is absolutely no difference in my skin, and the product does nothing for me, its as if its just water on my face.</li>
            <li> Weaker than expected.</li>
            <li> I think that the change (for me) has been slow and gradual although my skin feels incredibly soft post peel.  </li>
            <li> I use this peel (not 50%) actually at 88% raw on my face and leave it on for maybe five minutes then neutralize with wet baking soda.</li>
            <li> I got this product specifically to get rid of dark marks and splotches I had from acne a few years back.</li>
            <li> Since am not new to using lactic acid, i expected this to sting just a little</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any major improvements yet, but you have to do at least 6 series to notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Take a look at the other reviews, and click on \\&quot;see all reviews by this person\\&quot;, that helps in determining if someone is just padding the rating.</li>
            <li> No odor or drying, no headaches or other side effects.  </li>
            <li> I am using and seeing a difference with my other products as well.</li>
            <li> Maybe once a week for a month or every other week for two months depending on the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other peels.</li>
            <li> Apparently this one is since they are slowly fading now.</li>
            <li> I have thin, dry, slightly discolored, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> it works its active and you must use with care ..</li>
            <li> and it was clear to me that after a while these peels become weak</li>
            <li> When i break out its very hard to get them to clear up.</li>
            <li> The white heads are very small and not really noticable</li>
            <li> After a month a two I noticed my dark spots faded.</li>
            <li> I left it on for at least 10 minutes both times.  </li>
            <li> I also have dark circles under my eyes and had hoped that the peel would help.  </li>
            <li> My skin was not red and it didn&#x27;t react negative to the product.</li>
            <li> I am 19 and suffered from acne, dark circles under my eyes and hyper pigmentation in my skin since I began college.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product once a week for about a month and still no changes in my dark marks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to lighten up some dark spots on the sides of my face.</li>
            <li> cause they are really dark it softens them</li>
            <li> It smells like sour milk.  </li>
            <li> Which is probably not great for sensitive skin or a novice...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to knock down the look that comes</li>
            <li> and I also on my small legs because I have terribly dry and ithchy skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin does go a little pink for a few hours after use</li>
            <li> After about 3-4 days my face peels slightly</li>
            <li> As for the lightening effect, it has slightly improved but</li>
            <li> much less drying and less abrasive.</li>
            <li> If it wasnt for the tingling and slight burning sensation I wouldn&#x27;t have even known I was using the product.</li>
            <li> there is a slight tingling and thats it.  </li>
            <li> My skin is noticeably smoother and less sun damaged than before</li>
            <li> (it is sour milk smelling) but it is less harsh than the glycolic which i have used as well.</li>
            <li> she have that mess under control by</li>
            <li> The small bottle has enough for several treatments at half the price of expensive hand cream.  </li>
            <li> but I think they absorb product so you will waste some and get less peels out of your bottle.&lt;br /&gt;-Watch</li>
            <li> No significant difference at all.</li>
            <li> have been getting a little lighter but idk</li>
            <li> and I put little to no effort into taking care of my skin.</li>
            <li> this peel will remove my dark spots!</li>
            <li> was a little cautious going in and read lots of information on the internet about peels.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I did not even peel a little with this product.</li>
            <li> but i have not seen results on my feet a a little on my hands.</li>
            <li> Actually my skin became a little worse.</li>
            <li> The Positive reviews for this product have to be fake!</li>
            <li> I even ended up with a few burns where my scars already were.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I had a few spots/scars that just would not go away...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t wait the recommended 5 days between treatments as my face is used to harsh abrasive type treatments....</li>
            <li> tan it so in the dead of winter people at work asked me if I went on vacation or went tanning.</li>
            <li> it was there for a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a few months before moving to Hawaii from cloudy Seattle</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve typically found that after a few times, your skin can handle going past their 8 minute time limit.  </li>
            <li> These peels, week by week, (along with a combination of other products I have listed on my profile), slowly faded them.</li>
            <li> It burned very slightly.</li>
            <li> it burned him pretty bad</li>
            <li> A slight tinge, but hardly noticable.&lt;br /&gt;I received 30% glycolac complimentory to my purchase, and the glycolac is stronger than the glycolic...</li>
            <li> I would actually take a deep breath when applying this because it smells so badly.  </li>
            <li> and also no more itch.  </li>
            <li> This product just might join the elite few!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using 30% glycolic pads 2-3 times per week for the past two years, so my skin was accustomed to the stinging.</li>
            <li> I usually do the peel every 10 to 14 days.</li>
            <li> Use it no more than once a week.  </li>
            <li> I usually leave it on for around 10 minutes or so with no adverse side effects.</li>

            <li> He said I looked less tired and happier.  </li>
            <li> I learned that the hard way.</li>
            <li> Not only did this do NOTHING for me after 7 months (followed directions 100%), but it STINKS.  </li>
            <li> I have received compliments lately and I truly believe it is because of this peel.</li>
            <li> it works don&#x27;t listen to the negative comments.</li>
            <li> I use this peel at least once a week, even twice.</li>
            <li> Thats why they recommend you start slow.  </li>
            <li> I plan to use this once a week/two weeks, slowly leaving the product on longer each time.</li>
            <li> as you can see from other reviews, it didnt work for every body, but it MAY work for you, and it is not so expensive</li>
            <li> I use a Cerave plain moisturizer after and then apply sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to when I can do another one!!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about using yet another product for my acne and blotches.  </li>
            <li> I applied it for only 1 minute, it did burn but not so bad that i couldn&#x27;t tolerate it.</li>
            <li> I do think this product could be dangerous if you got it in your eyes, so you should be careful.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you have to be afraid to use this, if you follow the directions carefully.  </li>
            <li> I have bad acne scars and this has taken them down quite a bit in the past 2 months.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> It also caused my already scar prone skin to scar even worse then before.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hide behind makeup</li>
            <li> I carefully read the reviews and watched you tubes videos of this product online before purchasing it, but was really disappointed when it arrived.</li>
            <li> no more expensive hand treatments for me!</li>
            <li> Ladies it was a little painful but beauty requires sacrifice.</li>
            <li> The annoying dark marks refused to fade, so I tried this product in hopes of helping my skin.</li>
            <li> but i might have done it wrong...</li>
            <li> Without having to pay for the expensive peel done at the skin</li>
            <li> (yes, that&#x27;s weird,</li>
            <li> so photofacials were just too expensive as a temporary solution.  </li>
            <li> i just got a bad batch of product but am not happy with this.</li>
            <li> The tingling/burning isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as at the doctors, and I kinda like it</li>
            <li> and I have never had a bad reaction to it.&lt;br /&gt;Great for sun damage and acne scars.</li>
            <li> or you will burn yourself bad.</li>
            <li> - I suspect it would be painful.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> crap this burnt.</li>
            <li> I used to get microdermabrasion, but almost everytime each person was an idiot and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> it looked horrible!</li>
            <li> When it peels off, it looks awful and you have to tie your hands to not touch it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Did&#x27;nt really help with my age spots like I was hoping but maybe my skin is too far gone.  I would buy again.  I also but a drop in my night time lotion.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy this product again!  It makes my skin look and feel great, without the expense of a spa facial.</li>
            <li> The Positive reviews for this product have to be fake! This product is diluted and does not contain 50% Glycol ... I have used 35% solutions that did more to my face than this product can. There is a slight tingle as some reviewers have claimed which suggests that there is some acid in the solution ... given my experience, possibly 10%! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I used this peel on my leg and had the first peel May 27. Although the company said this would be good for hyperpigmentation, I didn&#x27;t know just how good ... until now. I&#x27;ve had some brown spots from a laser procedure and I&#x27;ve used so many depigmenting creams/gels but they didn&#x27;t work. Apparently this one is since they are slowly fading now. I&#x27;ll do my second peel soon and I&#x27;m hoping for more improvement.    ETA: I did my second peel today and there&#x27;s more improvement: The spots are fading more. I can&#x27;t wait for my sixth peel, which will happen sometime later this month. Since I&#x27;m used to AHAs, my skin can tolerate peels every five days. And this peel is nonirritating.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product. I have to say I was pretty sceptical as I&#x27;m an aesthetician and had a hard time belieiving it would work as well as the peels I had done on clients in the office. For safety issues we would have never sold professional peel products to anyone to do at home. This product works just as well. Just be careful, it is very strong. Follow instructions carefully, it could still burn your skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this hoping it would go all out and just peel the skin on my face to shreds.  I wanted the wrinkles gone, the sun damage, all of it.  Well, I received this and put it on my face and left it on for about 10 minutes............................. nothing.  It didn&#x27;t burn, didn&#x27;t peel, didn&#x27;t do anything.  I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was payed a lot money for my face treament, my freind told about Lactic Acid 50% used with Triluma or any generic because Triluma is out the market. I see my face different, so I&#x27;m so happy.</li>
            <li> I had recently stopped taking my depo-shot and had a dark overcast on my face. It also caused my already scar prone skin to scar even worse then before. With that said, I recently (like 5-6 months ago) had an onslaught of breakouts especially in the forehead area. I finally bought the Lactic acid so I could prepare my skin for using a TCA peel. After reading reviews on TCA on African-American kin, especially darker ones like me, I thought i was pretty much screwed, but tried it anyway. After my first use, I felt no tingling, no sensation, nothing and thought it hadn&#x27;t worked and I needed 70%. Then I tried it again later that week. My face was on complete fire!! I even ended up with a few burns where my scars already were. Every time I use it, my skin gets a little bit more sensitive to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as results- I love them. I have naturally dry peeling, flaking skin, so I saw a little bit of peeling with this, and I love the way my face looks a few days later. Its brighter, the scars a re a little lighter and my skin tone more even with each day after. My mom loves the way it makes her skin so soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, after waiting for almost a year to purchase this, I am beyond happy that I did. My face hasnt looked this great in a good year or so.</li>
            <li> My skin feels great after using this peel. It looks more youthful and even toned. I&#x27;ve only used it once. Left it on for 5 minutes. My skin is used to peels and micros. I used it on Sunday and plan to use it on Wednesday again. I will use it more frequently and longer as my skin adjusts. I also purchased the BHA+ peel. That is a level 4. Waiting for it to arrive.</li>
            <li> Out of all the peels, this one should be one the one to get. It&#x27;s great. I use to spend 100 bucks for a peel but now, with the economy falling, I do these peels. Great!!</li>
            <li> May be i just got a bad batch of product but am not happy with this. Since am not new to using lactic acid, i expected this to sting just a little but it didn&#x27;t. I might as well just put water on my skin. What i did was wipe the skin with wipe and some alcohol but i might have done it wrong... maybe. This is not the only buyer i have bought lactic acid that didn&#x27;t do anything. I bought this to treat discoloration on my leg from a bruise that i got but i guess the strength is just for the face.</li>
            <li> i am an african american/native american woman with melasma and dark spots from different skin issues. i am a fair skinned woman so everything show on me. I tried the fade creams and finally coughed up money for tri-luma. on it&#x27;s own, it&#x27;s ok, but with this lactic acid peel it is FANTASTIC. i don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, so i use my peel 3 times a week, followed by the tri luma cream. i moisturize and stay out of the sun as much as i can. i have been using it for 3 weeks and my results are great. i would recommend this for people looking for a solution to their hyperpigmentation issues. my skin is very soft now and every week i notice a difference. i will use it for another 3 weeks and take a break. the peel smells kinda funny (it is sour milk smelling) but it is less harsh than the glycolic which i have used as well. i recommend it. for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> My face has gotten clearer and smoother after one use. My pores are smaller and my makeup seems to go on smoother.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about using yet another product for my acne and blotches.  The first application I felt a lot of tingling and slight burning.  The second application was much milder.  After the second application I had two co-workers and my husband state how well my skin was clearing.  I don&#x27;t hide behind makeup I go out quite frequently without so it felt really good to hear comments after only the second appl.  I have used four applications so far and will definitely continue to use this product.  Well worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> WILL PURCHASE AGAIN.  GREAT FOR ACNE.  LEAVES SKIN SMOOTH AND IS HALF THE PRICE OF MY DERMATOLOGIST PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used this product about 4 times (every 5 days) and I like it but I don&#x27;t LOVE it.  The very first time I used it I felt like I noticed a difference in my face but after the first use I don&#x27;t really feel like I see a difference after using this product.  But...this instructions did say that you really start to see results after the sixth application.  I&#x27;m going to continue using this product though because I think it&#x27;s better to have it than not.      The first time you use it, it&#x27;s amazing. My mositurizer seemed to sink into my skin deeper, if that makes any sense.  I did get little white heads on my face the next day but I think that normal because the same thing happened when I got a facial at the spa.  The white heads are very small and not really noticable so don&#x27;t worry. Plus they go away in like a day or so.</li>
            <li> I use this peel (not 50%) actually at 88% raw on my face and leave it on for maybe five minutes then neutralize with wet baking soda. After about 3-4 days my face peels slightly and  I see a really fresh glow. I am using to fade dark spots but its also making my face smooth as a baby, no lines whatsoever and I am 49 years old. I would recommend this product, and no I did not even buy my 88% strong peel at Amazon.</li>
            <li> No significant difference at all. Very unpappy with results. Have used product well over 8 times with nothing. Actually my skin became a little worse. Very unhappy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product SEVERAL months ago. Gave it time to work.  I used it as directed but...to date, have received no marked improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture, tone nor any noticeable reduction in break outs. It did irritate my skin though....and it did burn. I do believe that was supposed to happen though, as spa peels have burned me as well...but...hmmm. it was \\&quot;ok\\&quot;. Wouldnt buy again.</li>
            <li> i have tried many acid peels, this peel makes my skin buttery soft does not burn or sting unlike many peels costing over twice the cost of this one.i have some discoloration from sun damage, and this is the only acid that has faded those areas.also a huge diffrence of the texture, and tighter pores. but my skin feels nicely hydrated.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this peel because I had been using the HQ+ peel, but was concerned about the safety of hydroquinone. I have tried this one out a few times now, and I can say that it&#x27;s extremely effective at evening out your skin tone and reducing the appearance of acne scars. I used to have severe acne, so my face is covered in scars. Now I just have moderate acne, and this peel helps target that as well.     Even though this product seems more gentle than the other peels, you still should not use it more than once a week. Also, always remember your SPF!</li>
            <li> I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED WITH THIS PRODUCT, RESULTS THE NEXT DAY WERE: A NOTICABLE GLOW, TIGHTENING OF THE SKIN AND MORE EVEN SKIN TONE, LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT APPLICATION!</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I saw results as soon as we rinsed it off. Immediately our complection was brighter. I could not believe the results!!! My husband works outside and has sun damaged skin, especially on has face and hands, he is two toned, Lol... Light body and darker face and hands... Anyway when we used the peel on him it brightened his face to match the rest of his body, literally! Love this peel!!!!</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars because I&#x27;ve only done one treatment.  I have keratosis pilaris on my upper arms and applied the peel there.  2 days later I can see some improvement!  no, it&#x27;s not GONE, but it&#x27;s more improvement than I&#x27;ve seen with any other product.  and only after 1 treatment!  I&#x27;m so excited and hope to see more improvement with more treatments.. I&#x27;m particularly hopeful that it helps some with the scarring.  I thought this was very mild (although I only left it on 1-2 minutes) and next time may go up to the next strength.  I&#x27;m not an experienced user, but I do use a lactic acid lotion daily, so maybe that&#x27;s why my skin isn&#x27;t as sensitive to it as some.  I&#x27;m going to stay hopeful that I&#x27;ll see improvement with more treatments!!!</li>
            <li> I used this while pregnant as I got a lot of acne my first trimester and hated the scars I had left over. I used the fan brush and left it on for about a minute and a half on my first use.&lt;br /&gt;After 2 days I could really tell the difference!! Pores were clearer and scars were significantly reduced and faded.  Thrilled with this product and the price. I use a Cerave plain moisturizer after and then apply sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to when I can do another one!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product a few months ago. With continued use you will see a improvement in your skin. Please purchase the fan it really helps in applying the product vs using a cotton ball which really soaks up the peel. You can balance your skin ph with a equal mixture of baking soda and water toner. Or you can use witch hazel. And lightly pat your face with vitamin e oil after. After a month a two I noticed my dark spots faded. But I stopped and I actually got more acne spots so it went back. But that was my mistake.</li>
            <li> Not only did this do NOTHING for me after 7 months (followed directions 100%), but it STINKS.  It smells like sour milk.  I would actually take a deep breath when applying this because it smells so badly.  I tried and I tried, for seven months, hoping the results would outweigh the stink.  I&#x27;m not sure how people are getting these amazing results. Take a look at the other reviews, and click on \\&quot;see all reviews by this person\\&quot;, that helps in determining if someone is just padding the rating.</li>
            <li> As a licensed esthetician, I am cringing reading the reviews of some of the users of this product.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Applying and leaving on\\&quot;  \\&quot;Applying 3 times a week\\&quot; \\&quot;Using as a daily exfoliator\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;If your not going to seek the advice of your dermatologist or esthetician, please buy a book on Chemical Peels to understand how they work.&lt;br /&gt;Applying more that once every 10 days will thin out your skin and will cause problems down the line. The whole point of \\&quot;Peeling\\&quot; is to clear away the old dead skin cells and allow new ones to surface. It takes your skin (depending on age) 20-42 days for brand-new skin cells to work their way up to the surface of the epidermis, if your constantly stripping your damaging your new skin cells. Patience is needed with peels and generally a series of 4-6 are needed depending on your expectations. Always apply spf of 30 or more afterward and before starting with this 50% lactic prime your skin a week before by using 2-5% glycolic wash. And PLEASE seek the advice of your friendly neighborhood dermatologist and/or esthetician before even attempting to peel.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to you all.&lt;br /&gt;**Oh and regardless of what the manufacturer claims it does not change the \\&quot;size\\&quot; of your pores, they may appear smaller because the chemical de-congests the follicle but if you naturally have big pores; this will not shrink them.</li>
            <li> I use the product only for a couple of weeks and I also on my small legs because I have terribly dry and ithchy skin.  It seems to help my legs.  With the new skin it is a lot smother and also no more itch.  I will continue to use this product for it because It really helps my legs.</li>
            <li> The Skin Laboratory Glycolic 50% works better for me. The bottle of this I received doesn&#x27;t seem work as effectively with my body as the Glycolic 50% does but every bottle strength may vary some, everyone use frequencies vary, time adjustments for everyone vary and everyone body responds different to different stimuli. They sent free small bonus bottle of salicylic 20% too but haven&#x27;t use that yet. This is review of my experience. On products like this always remember Don&#x27;t take review as advice.</li>
            <li> This high quality peel is exactly what you pay 200 and plus dollars for one treatment at the dermatologist office. It really will even out the pigment of your skin due to scarring, acne, etc. I highly recommend it, just make sure you follow the instructions to a perfectly. Great product.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the fact that this peel makes my face glow without the harsh look of a peel. It does not get rid of the pigmentation problem, but it deadens the blow! I did purchase the next step up and I am excited to see how that one works!</li>
            <li> I have already finished a bottle of Lactic Acid 50% Gel peel and the result is a radiant looking skin. Without having to pay for the expensive peel done at the skin doctor.&lt;br /&gt;2 minutes of application, once a week is usually enough to do the job. No down time and no redness for my case. After using the acid peel, my skin is so bright and radiant that I would sometimes go out without a trace of make up on, which I previously wouldn&#x27;t have dare stepped out of the house bare face. Make up actually stays on better now. As for the lightening effect, it has slightly improved but I guess I still need some time before I can see the result that I wanted, afterall our skin takes 21 days to renew. I am definitely going to continue with this peel on a weekly basis, perhaps a stronger strength occasionally.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and decided to give this product a try.  I have had professional peels and I get a facial once a month.  I started to use this peel once a week because I was nervous about over exfoliating my face.  It really is not difficult to use and it was gentle for my skin; this may be because I have had peels done before.  Since I started using this product my face is glowing and I have fewer breakouts.  I don&#x27;t feel a need to get monthly facials, although I may continue because I emjoy them.  I would recommend this product to anyone who does not want to pay for facials and wants to improve their skin without using harsh acne medications.  I think in the long run, a person will get a better overall result with using peels and masks than with using acne meds.</li>
            <li> So, I am pretty much a makeup/skin care whore... I won&#x27;t lie, I flit from thing to thing to thing... only keeping a few staples in my life - the stuff that is so great I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever change! This product just might join the elite few! For the record, I had a few chemical peels from my dermatologist (at $100 a pop, and you need at least 3) and my whole face would peel off and look totally gross for a couple of days.  Yes, the skin underneath looked amazing, but really, who wants to look like Medusa for a couple of days in order to look like Venus?? I really didn&#x27;t, especially now that my boyfriend lives with me.  (he would love me anyhow, but he would think I was NUTS if he saw all the crap I do to be pretty lol) So after reading reviews, I decided to try this stuff. But, I got scared and didn&#x27;t use it at first (what if I burned off my face?? lol) So finally the other night I went for it... And I love it!  I&#x27;ve only used it twice now- and I have a hand held red light therapy light that I use right after it so that may help - but it&#x27;s pretty dang awesome. In fact, I had to force myself not to use it too soon - as I know that is counter-productive lol. You get that immediate fresh look from the peel but without the gross peeling. I have some acne spots on my chin area (from stress) that I am trying to get rid of, and some fine lines.  It&#x27;s already faded out some (not all) of the acne and the fine lines aren&#x27;t nearly as noticeable. (which is why I have to force myself not to use it too soon! Immediate Results are impressive!) The tingling/burning isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as at the doctors, and I kinda like it (yes, that&#x27;s weird, I know)  I know that final results will show after a couple of months of using... so I will post again in a month to let you guys know what I think.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only done two peels using this so far (also used a 50% Glycolic peel after the lactic peel), but my skin already looks a 100 times better! I had a few spots/scars that just would not go away...after just a little over a week, they are fading and healing, and my skin feel so fresh. I would say that the lactic peel is much more mild than the glycolic, but I do like using them together. Also, I would definitely not use more than once a week to ten days, since peels can thin your skin and cause long term damage if abused. Also, DO NOT exfoliate before or after using this. The peel does that for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the lactic acid first and then followed with the 50% glycolic. Which is probably not great for sensitive skin or a novice...I&#x27;ve been using 30% glycolic pads 2-3 times per week for the past two years, so my skin was accustomed to the stinging. Start out slow and follow with a good moisturizer. I&#x27;ve recently discovered coconut oil and have been using that after peels. I have combo to oily skin, I&#x27;m 30 years old and still get the occasional breakout. The coconut goes on oily, but absorbs quickly and does not clog my pores at all. I feel like it really takes the sting out of the peel too and calms my skin down. There is a lot of research that it helps with acne too. Just a suggestion...every person&#x27;s skin is different though.</li>
            <li> Sensitive enough for my skin, I used water afterwards didnt need my neutralizer. Loved how it left my skin. Buying after this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Can see a  big difference in my face.  Does not sting or burn,  just wipe it on , let on for a minute or so and the rinse off. you will have smooth skin</li>
            <li> I have put like three times and my brown spots went lighter. I hope soon the Melasma will disappear. The acid is very strong, so be careful in the first application.</li>
            <li> This product works exactly as described. The gel is a bonus, easier to use and control, especially if you have to isolate a spot and don&#x27;t want to use it on the entire face or area. No odor or drying, no headaches or other side effects.  Use as directed!     Comparing this to the other acid treatments, this one is the best. Glycolic is too volatile and salicylic loses its strength/effectiveness quickly and only works on certain types of skin conditions.</li>
            <li> The is the best peel I have used by far. I&#x27;ve received &#x27;professional&#x27; peels in the past and paid out so much $$$$, but didn&#x27;t see much of a difference. I am Black/Filipino (medium brown complexion) and it helped with my acne and my hyper-pigmentation in just the first use. People assume now that I&#x27;m wearing make-up when I have none on!! Make sure to follow the directions, and I waited longer between each peel than suggested, but still had excellent results. Its better to apply it in the evening before bed, but if you&#x27;re going to use it during the day, make sure you use plenty of sunscreen. I would definitely purchase AGAIN!</li>
            <li> This is a good product for the money. I use it about once a week, and my freckles and sun spots have lightened.  A friend of mine got professional peels that cost a LOT of money, and she didn&#x27;t seem to have any better results.  I do think this product could be dangerous if you got it in your eyes, so you should be careful.  It does sting when it&#x27;s on, but as soon as it&#x27;s washed off, the stinging sensation goes away.  My skin feels smoother and younger, spots lighter, and I LOVE it!!!</li>
            <li> I used this product on a scare every two days since I saw no change for two weeks.  as of now still no drastic change.  I actually regreted buying this product.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about doing a chemical peel on my face without a specialist around so I bought one of the gentler formulas to use on my face.  I was hoping just to exfoliate some of the dullness from my skin with this, but was surprised at just how much of a difference it made to my facial skin.      My boyfriend who never noticed when I had 6\\&quot; of hair cut off and my hair dyed from dark brown to red noticed actually asked me what I was doing to my skin the day after I first used this.  He said I looked less tired and happier.  So I was more than happy with the results.     It not only made the skin look softer any other products I put on for a couple of days after using this seem to be absorbed better so it makes my moisturisers etc seem to work better too.  My skin does go a little pink for a few hours after use so I would recommend it as best to use before bed time and to make sure you follow the directions carefully as I could see how it could burn your skin if left on too long.  Also make sure you wear lots of sunscreen on your face for the weeks you are using this as I&#x27;ve heard horror stories of home peels sensitizing faces to sun damage and people ending up with brown blotchy faces. OK so you should wear sunscreen on your face all the time but be extra careful while using this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third treatment.  I didn&#x27;t wait the recommended 5 days between treatments as my face is used to harsh abrasive type treatments....I&#x27;ve been waiting 3-4 days between applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I have noticeably reduced the redness in my face and I can say it&#x27;s similar to Proactive in that sense.  *Some* of my acne scars have diminished in appearance.  Yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I applied it with a cotton ball...very lightly and washed it off after only 3 minutes due to reviews about burning.  The next two apps I used a gauze pad folded in fours (like the directions suggest) and applied a thicker coat.  I left it on for at least 10 minutes both times.  Yes, it stung like a sunburn so I just sat in front of a fan...no big deal.  It was not very painful at all.  Once it&#x27;s washed off there is no burning what-so-ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m curious to see how it works over time and will update with more results.  I&#x27;m especially excited to move on to the level 3 products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH!  If you order from [...] it&#x27;s only $16!  (Google it just to be sure of the web site.)</li>
            <li> I am a 55 year old olive skinned Caucasian.  I have thin, dry, slightly discolored, sensitive skin.  I use this product to lighten the discolorations and to try to soften the wrinkles on my face.  I also have dark circles under my eyes and had hoped that the peel would help.  I cannot leave it on for more than a few minutes because it begins to sting. It has helped my little age spots/freckles, but it has taken several uses.  I usually do the peel every 10 to 14 days. (sometimes only once a month). I think that the change (for me) has been slow and gradual although my skin feels incredibly soft post peel.  I have received compliments lately and I truly believe it is because of this peel. Naturally, I had hoped in a miracle.  I had hoped that my face would be all one color and the under eye circles would magically go away.  The little age spots that sit in the deepest part of my eye circles are still there but becoming lighter. This peel will be something that I will use as long as I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note: a girlfriend of mine used the peel and felt absolutely nothing... not even a tingle.  So, you see, it really does depend on the sensitivity of your skin as to whether it will burn or not.</li>
            <li> did not do anything..</li>
            <li> I like glycolic acid better... this one burns a lot and makes my skin oily, clogs my pores, etc... I read that it is just temporary and that if you&#x27;re willing to stick through the first week or two, it is going to deliver. Well, I don&#x27;t know... 2 weeks is a mighty long time when you have people staring at the pimples on your face, thinking \\&quot;Shouldn&#x27;t she have that mess under control by now?\\&quot; I don&#x27;t have that kind of patience.</li>
            <li> After two weeks of using this peel i did not feel anything and it was clear to me that after a while these peels become weak</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product couple of weeks and my underarms and face have been getting a little lighter but idk</li>
            <li> Quick History of My Skin:&lt;br /&gt;I have had acne for 4 years and have treated it with antibiotics, retinoids, you name it. I am starting Accutane in a few weeks and wanted to get some smoothness and get rid of scarring before starting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results:&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I&#x27;ve used this once. It is AMAZING. I left it on for about 4 minutes since I have a high tolerance, and yes my skin did get a little pink. Nothing to worry about really. My skin is much more luminous and the pigmentation seems to be really breaking apart and dissolving (this is normal). A little purging seems to be happening, which is normal since it is an exfoliant. My skin feels much more hydrated and smooth. I have used SO MANY products before this, both high end and drugstore. This beats everything out of the water. This once a week will have your skin in tip top shape and allows me to wear less makeup. LOVE this product. I&#x27;m glad I bought this instead of glycolic or salylic, much less drying and less abrasive.</li>
            <li> I tried this product to help clear up some mild/moderate acne on my chin, forehead and sides of my face.  I used the peel every five days for a month and my skin looks and feels amazing!  I tolerated the 50% well as I am somewhat used to glycolic, but honestly this peel if pretty mild.  Just be careful if you have picked anything before peeling, you will burn that spot and leave it red!  Best to use it after mild extractions.</li>
            <li> I am not really a skin care kind of person and now that I am getting older I need to be. I read many reviews and decided to go with this product. I was very nervous at first and watched the clock down to the second. Trust me you can tell it is working. Burns and itches. This was the first peel I have ever used. My skin was not red and it didn&#x27;t react negative to the product. It only burns a little when you actually have it on. Remembering my science class, I used a mixture of baking soda and water to rinse it off, then used regular water. Worked great. I think you should do this.</li>
            <li> it works don&#x27;t listen to the negative comments. BUT DO NOT USE WITH KOLJIC ACID AND DO NOT PEEL IT YOURSELF LET IT FALL OFF</li>
            <li> My mom and I are african american and use this product once a week. It is absolutely amazing. My mom is 53 and she wanted to get rid of some wrinkles and puffiness under her eyes, her skin was practically glowing after the first application. I am 19 and suffered from acne, dark circles under my eyes and hyper pigmentation in my skin since I began college. I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars on masks, cleansers, toners and fade creams. Lactic acid is my new favorite product. It helped with the oily areas of my cheeks and the dryness on my forehead. My skin does feels so soft and tight. When this bottle finishes, I definitely want to order a stronger formula like 70%. We use a standard spf 30 sunscreen everyday before stepping out of the house too.</li>
            <li> I am an esthetician and home with my kids now. I am using and seeing a difference with my other products as well. Love the glow after a few treatments and my face feels awesome after!</li>
            <li> I got this product specifically to get rid of dark marks and splotches I had from acne a few years back. The annoying dark marks refused to fade, so I tried this product in hopes of helping my skin. For reference, I&#x27;m a male with olive skin and I put little to no effort into taking care of my skin. I just wanted to get rid of some nagging hyper-pigmentation. I&#x27;ve been using this product once a week for about a month and still no changes in my dark marks. This product does get rid of pimples really well though, as it will reduce them overnight. I used the product exactly according to the directions, and used some baking soda mixed with water to neutralize the acid after it sat on my face for a few minutes. To be honest, the burning feeling was not bad at all and I barely felt anything. I also applied some non-pore clogging cream to help with the dryness caused by the product. Overall, I will say I wasn&#x27;t satisfied since the product didn&#x27;t work as I hoped it would.</li>
            <li> Still finishing up this one,, before I start the new one above,, can&#x27;t rate the new one yet. I appreciate the ability to do this on my own and not have to pay hundreds</li>
            <li> This peel works. I have bad acne scars and this has taken them down quite a bit in the past 2 months. I use this peel at least once a week, even twice. It does not make my skin peel and I have never had a bad reaction to it.&lt;br /&gt;Great for sun damage and acne scars. Cannot tell if it does much for fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Peel does a good job and evens your skin tone out and replenishes some luminosity to your skin. Do not leave on for more than 7 minutes because you may not feel the burn but it burns if you leave it on.</li>
            <li> My very first acid purchase from amazon.  Expected skin to peel.  Not quite what happened.  I have not seen any noticeable results but will continue to use all of product.</li>
            <li> when I was pregnant i got a weird case of dermatitis around my mouth and nose it looked horrible! It cleared up after I had the baby but the skin around my mouth did feel rough. I used this 2 times the first time it lightened my skin and helped remove some old acne dark spots. The second time it burned into that rough skin around my mouth and nose. It hurt and looked like a flare up of the dermatitis again. BUT when it peeled away I had new soft skin and I am so very happy. I used this on my husband it burned him pretty bad we applied elocon cream from the Dr. But after it peeled his skin looks so smooth now. It also helped him with his folliculitus on his chin. His forehead brightened it is funny you do look happier with a brighter complexion!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 51 and have been using this product once a week for 4 weeks. I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference in my skin. It has softened the fines lines and lightened the sunspots on my face considerably and I&#x27;m sure with continued use it will only get better. I&#x27;ve gotten professional peels before and I think this peel is just as good,(although not as strong). It really improved the dull red appearance and my make-up goes on so much better.I&#x27;m getting compliments on my skin again! Oh one more thing,as someone pointed out,you HAVE to be really good about using sunscreen whenever you use a peel,otherwise you&#x27;ll damage your new skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for three weeks, I have sensitive skin so upon using this product for the first time I was extremely careful. The first time I used it and each time since there has been tingling and some slight burning but nothing extreme. I&#x27;ve used this three times a week since i&#x27;ve owned it. I decided to wait and write a review until I&#x27;d had ample time to review the results. Might I also add that my sister has also used the same bottle of product that ive used. NEITHER of us has seen any change in our skin. After reading these results I was really expecting something dramatic, especially after 9 treatments but absolutely nothing has happened. If it wasnt for the tingling and slight burning sensation I wouldn&#x27;t have even known I was using the product. My advice is to find something else because I can&#x27;t believe all of these people actually saw results.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000PNXBU8 Lactic Acid 50% Gel Peel, 30ml (Professional)]]I have spent a fortune on expensive hand creams that don&#x27;t really smooth skin on my hands.... I got lactic acid for exfoliating skin on my face and decided to try it on my hands. I had read somewhere that milk maids of old had beautiful hands due to lactc acid and decided it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try. WOW!!! My hands looked so much better after one treatment. The small bottle has enough for several treatments at half the price of expensive hand cream.  It also fades age spots and freckles. The peeling action on hands reveals really smooth skin that is silky soft. I&#x27;ll keep using this...no more expensive hand treatments for me!</li>
            <li> Did not work for me at all! Tried it for stretch marks but nothing happened. Not even the slightest be of anything happened</li>
            <li> I like this so far, only used it twice. Tingles just a little on skin, I&#x27;ve managed to keep it on 4 minutes already the 2nd time. I&#x27;m trying to lighten up some dark spots on the sides of my face. Haven&#x27;t seen any major improvements yet, but you have to do at least 6 series to notice a difference. I have faith this peel will remove my dark spots!</li>
            <li> Item as pictured and described.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because am still awaiting for results as mention on the description of the product...since using this product my skin looks a bit cleaner but the only downfall/dislike about this product is that I&#x27;ve seen more pimples popping up on my face!! I dont know why that is happening. I wouldnt recommend this product to anyone as yet until I see the proposed results as decribed on myself!!</li>
            <li> Great for cystic or flaring red acne or getting rid of spots over time.  Use it no more than once a week.  50% is strong so you might want to start with a lower acid rate and build up.  Start with 1 or 2 minutes and rinse with plenty of water.  On my Asian skin it does slightly burn/tan it so in the dead of winter people at work asked me if I went on vacation or went tanning.</li>
            <li> I used this tonight and I must say my skin looks visibly smoother, after the first application...&lt;br /&gt;will be doing this every 2 to 3 weeks...for skin  maintenance....&lt;br /&gt;I was a little cautious going in and read lots of information on the internet about peels.&lt;br /&gt;This is the perfect percentage for my skin and its not to strong....&lt;br /&gt;I used baking soda and water to neutralize it and bingo the tingling stops...&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to first time chemical peel users....</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I&#x27;m keeping it on for 3 minutes and I don&#x27;t need any neutralizer besides water.  This is a very mild peel, on a pain scale, I&#x27;d rate it at a 2.  I can feel the stinging, the burning, but it&#x27;s very tolerable for 3 minutes.  I&#x27;ll either try a 75% acid for my next purchase or try leaving this one on at 5 min.  I have no noticeable issues with my skin right now, but the product leaves it unbelievably soft.</li>
            <li> Did not even tingle, DO NOT waste your money!!!!!! This product did nothing for me at all. I left it on my forearm for 10 min and I got no reaction at all. Those 5 star reviews are a bunch of lies. Don&#x27;t wast your money.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the reviews. I applied it for only 1 minute, it did burn but not so bad that i couldn&#x27;t tolerate it. It was fine. Waiting 5 days before i apply it for the 2nd time. So far i have noticed my face is clearing up. I have acne scars and some break outs on my chin. The breakouts have gotten smaller very quickly. When i break out its very hard to get them to clear up. It takes a month or two. And this is makin my break outs clear up very quickly. I cant wait to do a 2nd application!&lt;br /&gt;Oh and i use witch hazel before applying it. Then olay spf 15 moisturizer after.</li>
            <li> Initial usage is pretty much what the product advertises. Have only used it a couple of times so far. I&#x27;m trying to knock down the look that comes w/ this &amp;#34;later-in-life&amp;#34; eczema, so it doesn&#x27;t look so angry-red.</li>
            <li> It burns the first few times, I space treatments a week apart. After awhile it&#x27;s nothing. Some improvement. Not really sure it this peel is best for African Americans.</li>
            <li> I did not see any change on my skin. Waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> I use this once a week. It leaves my face smooth and soft. It is long lasting and will reorder once I run out.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me. I have olive skin and I have used other exfoliants such as Glycolic acid,  Retin A and salicylic acid and they all worked very well. I did not even peel a little with this product. Nothing happened. It actually left my skin feeling clogged rather than exfoliated. Not for everyone.</li>
            <li> The peels did not mix well with solutions I needed to compound.Didn&#x27;t work well, as too oily. My fault for not investigating. Found another source that had solutions rather than peels</li>
            <li> This acide is very mild and didnt irrate my skin at all. I use it with another acid to get the full effect.</li>
            <li> i like it but  i find that retina works  better for me</li>
            <li> there is a slight tingling and thats it.  after using many times i see no difference at all.  i can&#x27;t believe anyone in their right mind would say this burns their face.  i have a redheads complexion very light and when i use this there is not a speck of redness left.  back it goes</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it was strong enough for my skin, that&#x27;s all. And it burned my chin, but I didn&#x27;t do it right, so it&#x27;s not anyone&#x27;s fault but mine.</li>
            <li> The first time I&#x27;ve used this, it didn&#x27;t burn or anything.&lt;br /&gt;My facial skin is always flaking. I don&#x27;t know why either. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this three times.&lt;br /&gt;But the first time, I think I&#x27;ve used it for 3-5 minutes. I don&#x27;t know, but I didn&#x27;t feel much anything and it didn&#x27;t seem to do much.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I didn&#x27;t put much on or what.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the soap I used didn&#x27;t strip the oils that were on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2nd time I used it, I really washed my face to get rid of all the oils.&lt;br /&gt;Holy crap this burnt. Well, was tolerable, but it burned. I am fine with that, and since the first time didn&#x27;t seem to do much anything, I kept this on for 7 minutes in my head. I think I used it for 8-10 minutes or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAD IDEA make sure the time is within the time indicated on the directions. Do not do it for more than that or you will burn yourself bad. I washed it off and it kept burning me. While I was showering, when the water touched my face it burnt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked in the mirror and my nose area showed burns on it.&lt;br /&gt;And it was there for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it the 3rd time and I counted the 7 minutes in my head again, but I Think i was a bit more accurate than the 2nd time.&lt;br /&gt;It burned like the 2nd time, but it didn&#x27;t last or burned me and showed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it as I think it is actually doing what it should be doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish it would help with my skin, but I doubt it will do that.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll do what I want it to really do. But I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff!! I add a spoon full to a bottle of my daily face scrub and it makes me glow every day. I also use it as a peel as needed</li>
            <li> I have had problem skin in the past, but I really feel these peels have helped me. I started with the salicylic peel, but after a while, my skin just got too used to it. So I bought this one and started alternating peels. I also have pretty dry skin and this one defiantly helps keep it moisturized. If you keep up a consistent routine, it really helps to keep the dead skin exfoliated and pores clear. Honestly, after using both peels, I think the only reason I get pimples now is because I still touch my face (BIG no-no!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve typically found that after a few times, your skin can handle going past their 8 minute time limit.  I usually leave it on for around 10 minutes or so with no adverse side effects. Be careful with that though, if you get too bold you could end up with dry, flaking skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing you should be warned of: you can&#x27;t do these peels as often as a salicylic peel! I learned that the hard way. I use the salicylic peel about once a week, but when I started using this one I quickly learned that you have to give it a little more time, maybe 10-14 days before doing a different peel. My skin got red for a couple days. That could just be me though, A lot of the process is trial and error to find what works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never tried a peel before, I would first recommend using their salicylic acid peel. It&#x27;s generally tolerated better by the skin and many of the products we use now contain salicylic acid, so your skin will be less sensitive to it.</li>
            <li> I used to have acne scars on my face, but not anymore. When it peels off, it looks awful and you have to tie your hands to not touch it. but in just three days I literally had perfect healthy, smooth skin!!!! Ladies it was a little painful but beauty requires sacrifice. You have to avoid exposure to the sun even in winter, use sunscreen lotions.</li>
            <li> Used roughly a teaspoon to cover my face/neck area with a thin coat. It took about 3 minutes to cover the neck and face. I started neutralizing the areas I started with after 5 minutes with baking soda and lukewarm water. Washed face with a mild cleanser and then applied a moisturizer with natural ingradients with a touch of EVOO. My skin looks noticeably better and there was no downtime. Perfect.</li>
            <li> First, this is a strong acid peel and you have to take it seriously when you apply it by following the instructions explicitly. I have a chemistry back ground, so I felt comfortable using it on myself. If you do not have anything in your back ground that gives you understanding about these peels then I would strongly suggest doing some reading first, so that you can familiarize yourself with them and get an understanding of how this stuff works. Watching a you-tube video put out by someone who is qualified is a good alternative if you are not much of a reader.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said this is a great product! I use it sporadically. Maybe once a week for a month or every other week for two months depending on the condition of my skin. Then I take a break - you only have so much dead skin cells to take off after that you are damaging yourself. I get great results in terms of line reduction, miniaturization and improving the evenness of my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It burns because its an acid at a relatively high concentration, so you can try a lower concentration or just prepare yourself for the fact that it hurts.  Redness last for a day or two and do not use other treatments for several days before or after - I suspect it would be painful.</li>
            <li> My complexion is beautiful.  I really love this formula and have been using it for about a month. Has helped greatly with complexion and spots.  Getting ready to upgrade soon.</li>
            <li> Anyone know what the ph is on lactic 50 and sal 20</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;I bought the 50% glycolic acid peel, because I&#x27;ve had some peels done at the derma, up to 70%. I thought to better play it safe, and start at 50% for the home based peel. Well, after 2 months of using, I can say there is absolutely no difference in my skin, and the product does nothing for me, its as if its just water on my face. A slight tinge, but hardly noticable.&lt;br /&gt;I received 30% glycolac complimentory to my purchase, and the glycolac is stronger than the glycolic...</li>
            <li> I like to alternate between Glycolic, Lactic &amp; Salicylic  Acid peels  they work for me, I am 40 and people tell me all of the time I look like I am in my 20&#x27;s gotta love that!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and visually see results for a do it yourself beauty product.  I would rec commend this peel.</li>
            <li> I have used the glycolic acid from Skin Laboratory before and thought I would try their Lactic Acid formula on my sun damaged skin.  It works very similar to the glycolic acid and seems to tolerate it even better with less redness.  So far I&#x27;ve been very happy with everything I&#x27;ve purchased from this company.  My skin is noticeably smoother and less sun damaged than before and now my wife is using it daily and we can tell a real difference in her skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rick</li>
            <li> Weaker than expected. Must apply frequently and each time, leave on a LONG time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks now. Wow! The difference is amazing.  It&#x27;s a must have</li>
            <li> Not strong as glycolic and very good for starter. After couple uses, it preps you to go for stronger glycolic.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for one month.  In that time, I applied it nine times, only to the sides of my face, forehead, and chin, not to the under eye or front cheeks.  Towards the end of the month, I was leaving it on for ten minutes.  For me, it has the feeling of just being &amp;#34;prickily&amp;#34; and I never saw any peeling.  I am using it to lighten sun or age spots.  I can&#x27;t really say it has done this, not yet any way.  I don&#x27;t think you have to be afraid to use this, if you follow the directions carefully.  I think I might want to try a stronger acid peel now that this has prepared my skin.  Good luck, and I appreciate all the product reviews from others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this 2x so far, and I&#x27;m pleased with the ease of use and results. I used a fan brush and the product went on smoothly without problems.</li>
            <li> I carefully read the reviews and watched you tubes videos of this product online before purchasing it, but was really disappointed when it arrived. It feels like nothing is happening and after using it several times, I feel like nothing has happened to improve my skin.</li>
            <li> I have favorable results after just one use. My skin is noticeable smoother, and softer. The product comes with a detailed pamphlet on how to use the product, how to prepare your skin- before and after, how long to leave on, and how to neutralize it. I will be using this once a week.</li>
            <li> This may be my fault I didn&#x27;t fully research how to properly use this...please everyone who plans to use this don&#x27;t not take the word \\&quot;ACID\\&quot; lightly. Do not use with another exfoliation serum either &amp; give it time to rest. This thing gave a blotch of lightened skin-which I didn&#x27;t want-I love my dark skin definitely did not want to be lighter, I just wanted to even out my tone &amp; get rid of darker spots my chest, but I have yet to see results with those I bought this 3 weeks ago btw.</li>
            <li> This is a great line of products.  One for every type of result.  Nix the need for salon treatments!  This&lt;br /&gt;line of items is always worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love the gel peel, easier on the face and does not burn as much as the regular peels.  Have been using the regular, switchd for sure.</li>
            <li> I am only going to use this twice a year(don&#x27;t ruin your face, people). My face looked best 5 days after the peel. I got a slight burn from using a cotton pad, I will use a flat brush with less on the applicator next time.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure I have previously written about their glycolic peel, as I had used it for several years, usually in the winter months, from when I was 20ish to 23-24.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that peel as it really helped clear up my skin on a permanent basis from the time I first started using it. It also helped with skin pigmentation from breakouts/scars which is why I primarily started using, I had very uneven skin tone and lots of scar dots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just need to be patient, do it weekly, then go on a break. Make sure you moisturize and stay out of the sun because YOU WILL BURN! DONT TAN EITHER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just tried their lactic peel to switch it up. I let it sit for 8 minutes, (wouldn&#x27;t recommend for beginners, it took a while to build up to that with the glycolic peel, it does sting alot when you first start using them, but everyone is different)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then used a bar of sulphur soap as the soap to wash it off. Put alot of the soap into my hands, and then massaged the soap and peel already on my face for probably about 5 minutes. The combination of the sulphur soap and any of the peels really works into your pores to clear everything out. I never get as good as results without the peel. Then I used warm/hot water to flush everything out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin looks really fresh and very cleaned out. I have a few months before moving to Hawaii from cloudy Seattle so I want to even out my skin as much as possible before I am in the sun to much to use the peels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This company is highly recommended. I used to get microdermabrasion, but almost everytime each person was an idiot and a couple times literally took off to much skin, ended up with lines and scars. The glycolic peel back then helped even everything out that the dermabrasion screwed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key words are just to be patient, realise its going to take a couple months to do work on scars, but in the short term either peel really should help clear out the skin, and keep acne away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can, the best luck I have had with other skin products are using sulphur soap (available on amazon), biore blackhead face wash (green with beads in it, can&#x27;t really find it in stores anymore but this has always been my favorite face wash), Walgreen Alphahydroxy face cream (in the past this also helps tremendously with breakouts), and any noncomengenic, hyper-allergenic lotion to keep your face moisturized. Also noncomengenic and hyper-allergenic are the key words you want to see in your sunscreen to make sure it doesn&#x27;t break you out.</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well ! Has reduced the discoloration on my face it did take maybe 3 bottles like a year before I saw a real difference</li>
            <li> i ordered this to use on my hands and feet cause they are really dark it softens them but i have not seen results on my feet a a little on my hands.</li>
            <li> i live by this product, i have had acne scars for a long time and this peel fades them away in just a few uses!! if like me, you have suffered with self esteem issues because of acne scars and you perpetuate acne by wearing more makeup, this peel may be able to stop that nasty cycle.  as you can see from other reviews, it didnt work for every body, but it MAY work for you, and it is not so expensive so why not try it. i use a fan brush and now do the peel every month (began the regimen by doing it every 10 days), you can do it more or less often, and it does not make your skin dependent on it, i have hormonal issues causing adult acne so i scar regularly but this diminishes it fast without needing to wear so much makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw it doesnt particularly clear acne, just removes dead dry skin, and if your acne is caused by excessive dry skin (like mine) it can help the acne situation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good luck, and i hope it is your solution like it was mine &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This peel is a great way to start if you are new to peels because its hard to go wrong with it and it will allow you to practice your technique before you get into peels that have a higher potential for damage. My initial experience with peels were at a salon and [[ASIN:B000WZPOJ0 MD Formulations My Personal Peel System]] ( 20% glycolic). I read that Lactic acid was milder than glycolic so decided to go with the 50% Lactic to start with. I don&#x27;t know the specifics of how this works but your face has to build up a tolerance level to the peels so thats why they recommend you start low and build up. We all want immediate results and some people have resistant skin that can get away with plunging in to the deeper peels right away but, personally, I don&#x27;t want to find out that I am not one of them after the fact. Its my face, I can&#x27;t hide it, so I&#x27;d rather be safe than sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried this peel, I started with a one minute application. I noticed mild tingling and not much else but the next morning my face felt sooo soft and moisturized, I loved it. I added 1 min each time until I was doing 5-6 minutes.  I noticed a subtle improvement on my face each time and was so impressed. I&#x27;ve struggled with stubborn, resistant hyper-pigmentation (melasma) around my eyes for years. I tried countless products that seemed to work for others but did not work for me. Only photofacials had been able to remove it but it returned with the slightest bit of sun (hyper-active melanocytes) so photofacials were just too expensive as a temporary solution.  These peels, week by week, (along with a combination of other products I have listed on my profile), slowly faded them. As I moved on to stronger peels, its like 95% gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTES ON PEELS:&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t do it more often than they recommend.  They recommend you do it every so often for a reason. Your skin has to have time to heal and develop new skin before you strip it away again.&lt;br /&gt;-You HAVE to wear sunblock. Your skin is more exposed and vulnerable to damage from sun. Protect it. If you don&#x27;t you are canceling out or even reversing your progress. I like this one, [[ASIN:B004ZF75LS Ole Henriksen Protect the Truth Sunscreen SPF 50+-1.7 oz]].  Its not the best moisturizer but as a sunblock, its great.  Its my favorite because its hard to find high spf that doesn&#x27;t leave a white haze, smell funky or make your eyes tear up.&lt;br /&gt;-When you are doing your peels, make sure you start with a clean DRY face, water will dilute the acid in your peel. I am wondering if thats why some people did not see any results.  I wash my face, swipe it with alcohol on a cotton ball to remove any leftover oils and to help dry it. Wait 10-15 minutes, then apply the peel.&lt;br /&gt;-Use a fan brush like this one[[ASIN:B004NMF63W Taklon Fan Mask Brush Acid Applicator for Glycolic Lactic TCA Skin Peel / Masques (Small)]]. Mine has lasted over a year. You can use cotton balls/squares but I think they absorb product so you will waste some and get less peels out of your bottle.&lt;br /&gt;-Watch your face when the peel is on.  The recommended time is a guideline, everyones skin is different and reacts differently. Thats why they recommend you start slow.  Some are ok 1 min the first time, others the full 4 min.  Once your skin starts looking pinkish, its time to remove. If it gets red, you&#x27;ve gone too long.&lt;br /&gt;-Make sure you wash off ALL of the acid. Wash, rewash, wash again.  I like to shower right after to make sure its all gone.  Any leftover acid will continue to work its way into your skin. I like to use a post peel neutralizer as an extra precaution. MD Formulations had a post peel neutralizer that was AWESOME but they don&#x27;t sell it individually. I am trying this one [[ASIN:B000VEN3RW Neutralizer skin pH balancer helps balance the pH of your skin for the safe and effective neutralization after peeling.]]. It works but I am still trying to find one more like the MD formulations one.  You pour onto cottonball and sweep your face right after peel, then wash it off with water. You can also mix your own neutralizer using baking soda and water.&lt;br /&gt;-Moisturize after. This one has been my favorite to use after, [[ASIN:B00700H128 Hydrating Repair Peptide Wrinkle Cream (Post Peel) - Enhanced with Matrixyl® 3000, Argireline®, Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Natural Botanical Extracts]]. I also use it as a night cream. Very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or leave a residue.ball and sweep your face right after peel, then wash it off with water.

            <li> I love it great product A + + + + +  + + + + + + + ++ +</li>
            <li> I have purchased other peels. This is my least favorite. I think it is too gentle if u are used to stronger peels</li>
            <li> I have melasma near my eyes from pregnancy and this is really helping to lighten it. Might try glycolic for better/faster results? It does tingle but very tolerable and makes your skin look smooth, even skin tone and super soft! I bought the refresh facial cream for after and a brush for applying the peel.</li>
            <li> I have been using lactic acid 50% for about two years now and it really improved the condition of my skin (post-acne hyperpigmentation). I would recommend this product to anyone trying to fade out acne marks.</li>
            <li> This product works well as a before-bedtime peel for S. Asian and Middle Eastern skin in evening out skin tone but does not seem to work for ridding dark acne scar spots nor addressing fine lines/wrinkles. Red peeling skin around nostrils, lip line and ear lobe creases is possible given these areas may have more sensitive skin to begin with or have indentations that enable the acid to pool into an inadvertently thicker application and also remain on skin longer if not adequately washed off from such crannies with diligence and copious amounts of cold water along with loads of moisturizer overnight. Also, sunscreen is supremely important keeping in mind to reapply often as it may tend to wear off from those specific areas through excessive touching/rubbing as with sniffling or itchy dry noses, licking dry lips, playing with earrings/scarves/hair, etc. Just be careful with your acid peel strategy particularly in how you choose to approach your sensitive skin areas and care for them afterwards. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> After using this product for a couple of months, I have not seen any difference on my skin. This is not good for black spots.</li>
            <li> Great product. Leaves my skin looking healthy and revived. I started at 2 minutes and have worked up to 5, waiting 2-3 weeks in between uses. So far I havent experienced any peeling. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Maybe this is ok for 20something year olds. If youre 35+, go for a tca 35% peel. One million of these peels will never equal one deep TCA peel. I can leave this on for 30 minutes with no peeling, burning, redness. Just not deep enough.</li>
            <li> I am a licensed esthetician do not buy this if you do not know how to use acids it works its active and you must use with care ..but i love it</li>
            <li> really strong and burns like hell but it gives great results.</li>
            <li> OOOO I LOVE THIS... DID WONDERS FOR MY FACE...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this twice since it arrived.  After about a minute my face started sting, but I could tolerate it.  I left it on about 3 minutes.  I wanted to leave it on longer, but didn&#x27;t want to overdo it.  The second time it stung just as much, but again I could tolerate it.  I do think I see an improvement in my face, it seems tighter.  I&#x27;m 45 and am starting to get the frown lines and that&#x27;s the only place that I&#x27;m peeling.  It&#x27;s a little red, but not bad at all.  I&#x27;m going to continue to use.  My suggestion is to have all your supplies ready because when it&#x27;s time to remove mask you will want it off fast.  When I applied the mixed solution of baking soda and water I felt better right away.  Have it ready.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my mother-in-low as a gift. She is around early 60 years old and starts complaining about her skin that has some dark spots and wrinkles. Sometimes her face looked like dull and much older than her age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She said the Lactic Acid 50% gel was a little light chemical peeling for her aged skin. So, I ordered a higher percentage gel for her which is Glyco-Lac/60, Level 2 Gel Peel. After that, she told me the gel peel really worked to reduce a little bit of her brown spots and fine lines.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product once so far. I applied the gel peel to my face for 1 minute. It burned very slightly. I rinsed the gel peel off my face with copious amounts of water. I had no redness, only very slight irritation that was not visually noticeable. I suffer from acne and very fine lines. It has been one week since I applied the fist peel and I have had no new acne and my lines on my forehead look reduced. I plan to use this once a week/two weeks, slowly leaving the product on longer each time. I was very nervous about attempting a home peel, but I believe if you start with leaving it on for short amounts of time and work up, you should not have any problems.</li>
            <li> Works well, no irritation.</li>
