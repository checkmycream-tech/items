            <li> This is the best lotion I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  Very natural and healing.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this is the best hand lotion I have ever tried.  It is pricier than other brands but something I can&#x27;t and never want to do without,  I first tried a sample of Naked Bee lotion at a store selling honey.  I immediately noted the difference in how it felt and lasted.  I was working two jobs that both involved repeated hand washing.  My hands got so chapped and sore that other lotions I tried actually made my hands sting and feel worse.  Naked Bee immediately soothed and healed my hands. I was shocked at the difference and always keep two tubes on hand. I love the delicate orange blossom scent as well. This is my all time favorite personal care product!  If you try it, I hope you will be as impressed with it as I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller shipped my order very quickly and the tubes arrived well packaged.</li>

            <li> I love this lotion.  It keeps my skin soft, supple and non flaky for an extended period of time.  The small bottle lasts longer than you would think it would also.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. And I received it within a couple days of placing my order</li>
            <li> Naked Bee Hand and Body lotion smells good, feels good and it works!  That is the reason I bought it!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite creams for dry hands. It has a pleasant smell and sinks into your skin right away without leaving a sticky or oily feeling.</li>
            <li> This came recommended by a naturopath so I ordered forty something dollars worth of products. She said it was good for her eczema. As anyone with eczema knows, fragrance is to be avoided. My daughter broke out in a rash. The smell gave me a headache and no one in my household can use it due to the ingredients. Wish I could return it!</li>
            <li> This stuff feels good, but the best part is that the awesome, giving it as gifts too! Would recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> The best lotion I have ever used!  I never want to run out of it!</li>
            <li> Originally found this at a premium supermarket in St. Helena, CA for $9.99 plus tax.  Tried a test from the sample bottle and ended up buying the 6.7 oz tube. Check-out girl told me she loves it. It has really made a difference in my skin and the price on Amazon is less. I keep a regular stock of this now so I won&#x27;t run out. Like the subtle orange scent as well.</li>
            <li> bought this at a nursery of all places and I LOVE it , smells great , skin is smooth and soft</li>
            <li> Soakes in quickly and leaves my hands soft. Nice amell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Naked Bee for years.  This is a great product.  I prefer their same lotion with SPF 30 though.  It&#x27;s a more general purpose lotion that still smells great and is perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff:::just what I wanted</li>
            <li> This lotion smells delicious!!! Will definitely order again!!! Thanks!</li>
            <li> love it! it doesn&#x27;t leave my hands greasy like other lotions... love the scent and it makes my skin smooth...</li>
