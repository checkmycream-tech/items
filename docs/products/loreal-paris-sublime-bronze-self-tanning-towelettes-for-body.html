            <li>LOL  </li>
            <li>So this product works great</li>
            <li>These wipes are great to travel with and produce a great color.</li>
            <li>Great job L&#x27;Oreal.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Seems it just needs some improving and it will be a great product.</li>
            <li>These tanning wipes are a great product.  </li>
            <li>so much more conveniant !!</li>
            <li>Moisturizes the skin very nicely.</li>
            <li>Like I said, I&#x27;ve successfully used self-tanners before but never a towelette.  </li>
            <li>LOVE these - they are the best!</li>
            <li>They solution on the wipes/towels does not stink and is pleasant - and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky (maybe just a touch).</li>
            <li>The color is decent, but I&#x27;ve tried and tried to apply it perfectly and it never comes out perfect.</li>
            <li>Works well, easy to apply and best of all</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned</li>
            <li>i have used these for years and always got good color...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned, but it gives me a good even tone.</li>
            <li>I suggest having a loved one assist with putting it on.</li>
            <li>No smell - no smudges - looks good in sunlight, too.  </li>
            <li>Even my husband, who hates the sun, has a good \\&quot;tan\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Good color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredible &amp; I have never found better.</li>
            <li>I tried Comodyne brand also, and the L&#x27;Oreal product is vastly superior.</li>
            <li>All in all, this is a good product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned</li>
            <li>so I thought this would be a good time to start self tanning.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used my fair share of sunless tanning lotions and sprays.</li>
            <li>They give a good glow and tan to your body.</li>
            <li>I am a fair skinned person and have been using self tanners for years.</li>
            <li>it all looked good aside from one streak on my thigh.</li>
            <li>I was delighted with the product and bought a box or two wherever I saw it being sold.  </li>
            <li>Good tanning towel.  </li>
            <li>And, for the ease of use, I think this brand is as good as any on the market.  </li>
            <li>smooth and tan looks great!!</li>
            <li>I have fair skin in the winter and after I use about 3 days in a row of these I get to a color</li>
            <li>but it accually looks good and</li>
            <li>Good product...</li>
            <li>Love love love this!!!</li>
            <li>These are ok but nothing great.</li>
            <li>I feel like a narcissist admitting that I own a self-tanning product, but I have to say how good this stuff is.</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>Love them!  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff !</li>
            <li>Be sure to wash off your palms!  </li>
            <li>I got these towelettes and got better results!  </li>
            <li>Love these towelettes!  </li>
            <li>MUCH better than all the lotions, sprays and foams I&#x27;ve used!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this one!</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>WILL purchase more!</li>
            <li>I love these towelettes!</li>
            <li>I have been using the Subscribe and Save, just love it!  </li>
            <li>but I think that&#x27;s more user error that a defect of the product :o)</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and great results</li>
            <li>Was so happy to fine it on&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair &amp; this gives me a nice, golden, even tone.</li>
            <li>Being a mom of two kids I have no time to get that amazing tan</li>
            <li>It also works nicely on the face.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and love the color that I get from these.</li>
            <li>I had reached a nice sun kissed look.</li>
            <li>Being fair skinned, I&#x27;ve tried many brands of self tanners for a number of years.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best tanner I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>I use one every Friday evening after I get home from work and then have a nice even tan for the weekend.</li>
            <li>but I had to wait until it faded on its own.</li>
            <li>It fades nicely as well.  </li>
            <li>It takes me 2 to build it up to a nice medium tone.  </li>
            <li>a nice color on.</li>
            <li>Nice item.</li>
            <li>I went for two weeks without applying any self-tanner while it wore away on its own.</li>
            <li>Also sometimes it streaks but to be honest</li>
            <li>ya know moms still like to look good to &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Nice even tanning.  </li>
            <li>I prefer a nice tan look year</li>
            <li>spreads nicely and your hands don&#x27;t get all</li>
            <li>Nice</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- nice, lightweight feel</li>
            <li>Very nice, smooth, even tan.  </li>
            <li>Super easy to apply, great color, not orange, virtually no smell, and NO STREAKS!  </li>
            <li>I did two applications and the end result is a beautiful golden tan.</li>
            <li>Great item for quick tan.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and good color.</li>
            <li>This is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>but it produces great color and is super easy to use!</li>
            <li>and I have a wonderful natural looking glow.  </li>
            <li>I am sure my ancestors were nice people...</li>
            <li>This provides a good color and is streak free.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy, streak free and does not have a &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; to it, which is great.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, my face always ended up looking nice!</li>
            <li>I  like these toweletts for quick self tanning,The scent is fairly pleasant and not over whelming(a bit like you</li>
            <li>I immediately detected a very strong perfumy/self-tanner odor, but honestly if it worked, I would have been fine with it.  </li>
            <li>I might mention I have very light skin.</li>
            <li>and it is very cheap.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I stumbled on these one day at Target and absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>Be sure to wash hands with bar soap and that&#x27;s it.  </li>
            <li>Will continue buying more on line, even cheaper than in the stores.</li>
            <li>These are great for us fair skinned folks that only need a bit of color.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to wash your hands off so your palms aren&#x27;t stained from using these.</li>
            <li>I am a competitive ballroom dancer and most of my friends spend up to $40.</li>
            <li>Be sure to exfoliate in the shower before using.</li>
            <li>Love these tanning towelettes.</li>
            <li>How do I make sure to get the BODY towelettes each time?  </li>
            <li>Okay, streaks I can understand because maybe I missed applying, but</li>
            <li>I know most people seem to love them</li>
            <li>I have used self tanners before, these are ok.</li>
            <li>Overall definitely a wonderful product that I will purchase again!</li>
            <li>I have tried several self tanners and I found this one to be the best.  </li>
            <li>Go Get You Some Because You WILL Love It.</li>
            <li>This product creates, like many, more yellowish undertones of a tan.</li>
            <li>This also did not seem to have an orange color as many self tanners do.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product after reading many of the reviews and wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>Also, be sure to give a swipe to those tricky spots: elbows, hands, ankles, and feet.</li>
            <li>Love these towelettes.  </li>
            <li>if I do tan even  in the tanner I wear a 30 spf and never go more than 4 times i a year.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love these.  </li>
            <li>Better Self Tanning Solution</li>
            <li>This summer I have not been able to lay out..</li>
            <li>got SO many compliments about how tan I am and questions on how I have found time to lay out.  </li>
            <li>These are so much better.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love them.</li>
            <li>i love this product  </li>
            <li>It was what was recommended to me by a friend, and I&#x27;ve been satisfied with the way it works for a couple years now.</li>
            <li>I will be glad to order it again when needed.</li>
            <li>Love it wish the color was instant,however.</li>
            <li>I love pricey salon sprays but can&#x27;t always find the time to get them.</li>
            <li>That said, these are the best things out there-they are easy to use, dry quickly, have a great tone and are portable.</li>
            <li>This is the very best self tanner I have used on my lily white legs.  </li>
            <li>And my legs were not orange as with many others products.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased that the color lasted a week before all washing away.</li>
            <li>Love love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I applied more to see if I could blend it</li>
            <li>but, again, more streaks.</li>
            <li>Better value than TanTowel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used so many kinds and they all do so</li>
            <li>LOVE these  LOREAL BRONZE  TOWELETTES  -</li>
            <li>The price is much better than anything else I&#x27;ve seen as well.</li>
            <li>They cost more here than what I paid in Houston</li>
            <li>I have used many self tanners in hopes of keeping myself out of the tanning bed in the winter.  </li>
            <li>and i also prefer the one that has some color to be able to see where we put.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>And in most cases, you will have to use two wipes to cover your body.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that you can travel with these.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many.</li>
            <li>And the more often you use them the darker the tan.</li>
            <li>Iv&#x27;e used it many times before, and still do.</li>
            <li>i have been through so many self bronzer..</li>
            <li>but i used to not be able to afford tanning beds.</li>
            <li>i love how there towelets and ur more in controle then sprays or lotions..</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Amazon prices are better</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>Pretty good product.</li>
            <li>A single application will make you a shade darker, perfect for a weekend trip or event,</li>
            <li>Great, natural tan!</li>
            <li>I have used these for special occasions and they give a nice smooth not - orange tan</li>
            <li>I use it mostly on my legs, twice a week keeps a light tan on my legs.</li>
            <li>It is important to make sure you cover every spot on your leg.  </li>
            <li>I feel sure no brand is fool proof if excess amounts aren&#x27;t lightly rubbed off to prevent build-up in wrinkles...</li>
            <li>Enjoy:)</li>
            <li>These take a bit of practice to use (since you can&#x27;t see where it is going on), but after becoming an expert with the Tan Towels, these were easy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen tanning sheets on the shopping channels but didn&#x27;t believe they worked as easily as they said - WITHOUT STREAKING - until I tried the L&#x27;Oreal Towelettes.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The towelettes are easy to use and can be carried in your purse.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>easy application -</li>
            <li>easy to put on and stays on for some time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to use</li>
            <li>I bought these wipes because they were supposed to be easy to use and would not leave the tell-tale self-tanner</li>
            <li>Easy to apply,,  </li>
            <li>so easy to use and even reuse if you dampen it.  </li>
            <li>This product is easy to apply, but you need to put it on the day before you want the tan.  </li>
            <li>It smells strongly and it lingers.</li>
            <li>The towelletes do not have any strong smells and my bronzed body stays tanned for about 5 days.</li>
            <li>It does not smear or have a strong odor.  </li>
            <li>have been using this self-tanner for years &amp; I am constantly given compliments on how beautiful my skin tone is.</li>
            <li>She will look gorgeous for New Years.</li>
            <li>Its fabulous and so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I have tried many tanning products in the past and this one is the best.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be comfortable wearing something with this strong of smell to a job or date.</li>
            <li>It has no nasty odor and dries on the skin quickly.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and I am able to put my clothes on almost immediately.</li>
            <li>This is a good product and easy to work with but needs to come in a deeper color and last for more than&lt;</li>
            <li>I just love them they are easy to put one and last really good.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to apply, portable, and highly recommended!!  </li>
            <li>Smooth, even color.</li>
            <li>These are fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Also, the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li>Indoors, the color looks amazing and like a real tan.  </li>
            <li>This type of information is important when reading tanner reviews)&lt;br</li>
            <li>My legs are streak free and the tan is even all the way around</li>
            <li>But the L&#x27;Oréal is cheap &amp; does the job.</li>
            <li>In the morning, I awake to a light tan.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the product does not anywhere say that someone with light skin couldn&#x27;t not use it.</li>
            <li>and this gives me a healthy, golden glow.  </li>
            <li>this seems like a great product only used it once</li>
            <li>And most importantly, even though I exfoliated first and kept my skin moisturized, for the first time ever, I looked at my arms and could see my skin kind of flaking off, as if I hadn&#x27;t exfoliated.</li>
            <li>terrific product works great.....</li>
            <li>so far so good.  </li>
            <li>B0017JDUFA TanTowel Self-Tan Towelette Classic 10 PACK]] is MUCH better!</li>
            <li>I have used these for a few yrs and found them easy, portable, dependable, generally effective and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>The handwashing after you&#x27;re done is very important or your hands will have a funny color.  </li>
            <li>I do not feel the need to use another towel to do my legs, but will most certainly do so once Spring hits!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a quick and easy tan.</li>
            <li>Large cloth and easy to apply!  </li>
            <li>This is the best self-tanner that I have ever used, &amp; I&#x27;ve used self-tanners of every caliber &amp; price over the past 8 years.</li>
            <li>I did not purchase this product through Amazon but like many of you I always look on Amazon first for reviews</li>
            <li>I want the most tan first (i.e. face, arms, legs) followed by the rest.  </li>
            <li>next morning I have a nice glow!</li>
            <li>I am a white woman and I have had great success using sunless tanning lotions, so I figured I&#x27;d try this version.</li>
            <li>I have used different types of self tanners, including spray tans, and this by far is the best!!</li>
            <li>and its worth the money especially if it keeps her happy.</li>
            <li>Some may even think this is a positive, because it allows you more control over your tan.  </li>
            <li>I used it for the first time last week (9 days ago) and still looks great.  </li>
            <li>These things though do a good job of actually making you noticeably tanner looking.</li>
            <li>I love them so much that I tell all my friends about them.  </li>
            <li>Been looking very forward to my latest shipment for summer.</li>
            <li>I like the towelette format versus the cream because I have more control over how much to apply.</li>
            <li>In fact, getting ready to order some more.  </li>
            <li>but I even use these on my face and use a Qtip to lightly run around my eyes where I have smile lines.  </li>
            <li>Good for instant color.</li>
            <li>I loved was a product with finally NO smell!</li>
            <li>Not bad</li>
            <li>no bad smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Sublime Bronze tinted self-tanning lotion for years, and these towellets are far superior since it&#x27;s so much easier to smooth the tint all over, evenly and quickly, rather than tube-to-hand then hand-to-body.  </li>
            <li>This product is so easy to use, leaves no streaks and is very portable to pack on trips!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this tanning for any busy moms who want to still have that nice healthy glow ..</li>
            <li>Now they have a &#x27;new scent&#x27; which is not any better than the original scent, AND the degree of darkness is lighter than I was used to.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to exfoliate and apply to dry skin and use even applications, going lightly over knees, elbows and ankles where the skin will take in more color.</li>
            <li>Dries incredibly quickly.  </li>
            <li>but I was able to rectify it with the second application and truthfully it was probably user error, not the product.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and develops a bronze tan.</li>
            <li>and I am lucky I don&#x27;t have to leave the house today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The more regularly you use it the more even it gets and the fewer you need to use.</li>
            <li>If you need a quick tan these are the way to go.</li>
            <li>It looks small but one towelette can give you a great color and without any marks and strong smells.</li>
            <li>But in general i&#x27;ll buy again since the color is amazing.</li>
            <li>first then rub all over your legs, lightly running over ankles, toes and knees.  </li>
            <li>I have always been pleased with the mailing package until this arrived, it must be a new way of mailing the items (to save on weight, etc.</li>
            <li>I love this product because: it doesn&#x27;t smell bad like the others, better, it doesn&#x27;t have any smell at all, it is easy to apply, you can use a rubber glove to apply it so your hands are clean when you finish, it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>I loved the quick dry!</li>
            <li>Work great on my face and one of the few things that doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li>I just got these, tried it 2x, and loved the outcome so much that I already ordered my second box.</li>
            <li>I have tried the loreal spray and am not crazy about that either because I worry about what else it is getting on besides me.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the &amp;#34;new fresh scent&amp;#34; fool you.</li>
            <li>BUT YOU GET TO CONTROL THE APPLICATION TO A FAR GREATER DEGREE THAN SPRAY TANS.</li>
            <li>trying these wipes, I&#x27;m convinced there s no self-tanning product that is worth buying.</li>
            <li>It looks more natural</li>
            <li>However, the smell is overwhelming for me because I have a sensitive nose.  </li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It provides a nice, deep streak-free tan.</li>
            <li>My advice would also be to avoid or very lightly brush over areas such as elbows, knees, ankles, wrists, etc as is the case with most self-tanners, but truth be told, this self-tanner is pretty much fool proof even if you cover those areas.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t exfoliate very often and &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; every other day with great results.</li>
            <li>I saw a noticeable difference upon application, but it seemed to fade pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>but it dries pretty quickly &amp; doesn&#x27;t have the stench that some sunless tanners have.</li>
            <li>The color of that is so much more realistic and it&#x27;s so much easier to apply.</li>
            <li>I applied it every other day and was delighted with the increasing depth of my tan.  </li>
            <li>Seems about foolproof, right?</li>
            <li>but its easy to use,u dont have to worry about getting messy, makes a nice even tan.</li>
            <li>When I am attending a special event &amp; want to look like I just got back from the Bahamas, I first apply this self-tanner, &amp; after it dries, I top it with a self-tanning lotion or a tinted spray-tan.</li>
            <li>If I want it even darker, I generally will put on the Banana Boat one on top of this.</li>
            <li>Leaves a nice even tan that stays for a long time.  </li>
            <li>These are really easy to use and not messy.</li>
            <li>sometimes two is needed to cover my whole body, but i really love the natural look they create.</li>
            <li>Very way to use with quick results.</li>
            <li>There is another product like this, more expensive but it works great and has virtually no smell once it dries.</li>
            <li>just needs to use on clean skin, put lotion on any dry areas...and wait 10-15 or more minutes before putting on clothing.  </li>
            <li>So easy to use and the color is quite natural.</li>
            <li>and I really can see the difference in color after just the first time!</li>
            <li>They are easy to use, one towel can be used on your whole body, and the color is very natural.  </li>
            <li>Make sure your skin is exfoliated &amp; shaved prior to application.</li>
            <li>so you really get your money&#x27;s worth with this</li>
            <li>No streaking is evident from using them.</li>
            <li>I tried these L’Oreal Towelettes last night and woke up looking like an albino tiger; super streaky and super orange!</li>
            <li>Pretty tan color &amp; for me no noticeable smell.</li>
            <li>I have an automatice shipment order for the Loreal Self Tanning BODY towelettes, received correct shipment first time...</li>
            <li>Of course the hands are tricky to tan evenly, as with most product; I rub the towel all over the tops of my hands last and rub a cottonball soaked in rubbing alcohol on the fingers and palms of my hands to avoid orange palms.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time ever using anything to fakebake.</li>
            <li>I did get a streak on my leg the first time I applied</li>
            <li>I had a coupon and bought this for the first time at Target store.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t over think it, just make sure you wipe your entire body</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t purchase this from amazon, but felt that I&#x27;d like to share the review for those (like me) that come here first to check things out.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>When I first began using this self-tanner</li>
            <li>every product mentioned in articles on removal of self-tanner  --  mostly abrasives such as baking powder and salt scrubs.  </li>
            <li>I waited a day and then used another toilette and covered that spot first and then finished my legs.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t notice at first as it takes a couple hours for the color to start working.  </li>
            <li>First, use gloves.</li>
            <li>This item really works!</li>
            <li>This is the first self tanner I&#x27;d ever tried.</li>
            <li>After using this I switched to fake bake flawless.</li>
            <li>however the smeel sucks lol and it can make u not quit orange, but not brown eighter..</li>
            <li>Next time, I will give those areas a quick and light swipe.</li>
            <li>and I thought that this would be good, but I end up having patches of color and patches of plain skin after a couple of days.</li>
            <li>I exfoliated before, made sure my skin was dry, followed all the directions/online tips and still didn’t turn out right.</li>
            <li>The wipes/towels are large enough to cover most bodies.</li>
            <li>I use one towelette and am able to do my whole upper body ..</li>
            <li>The sheets apply very easily with expected results.</li>
            <li>It looks good on the upper body/arms, but always streaky on my legs no matter what I do, and the color definitely looks orange in certain lights.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product many times, love the fact it travels with you, is not messy and gives a tan in a few hours.   </li>
            <li>this is a great value because I have 4 sheets left to apply other times.  </li>
            <li>This tanning product works very well if you do exactly as directed.  </li>
            <li>but these towelettes from Loreal are just as good if not better.</li>
            <li>Not bad inside, but standing in the natural sun</li>
            <li>Other tanners do not seem natural in color, this one really looks good.</li>
            <li>The application is extremely easy: just open one of the tanning towelettes &amp; wipe in a buffing motion onto your skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- non streaking (just be sure to exfoliate then use a bit of moisturizer on dry areas - like elbows, knees &amp; ankles - before applying the self tanner)</li>
            <li>The only good thing about these wipes is that the color lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I will try to find original packages in my local stores, not an easy task as it&#x27;s not widely carried.</li>
            <li>I will certainly buy this again and use it weekly during the summer times.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not so drastic that you would realize I forgot to wipe it on certain body parts.  </li>
            <li>The wipes are large and loaded with plenty of product.  </li>
            <li>I have tried some pretty expensive ones too and these are the best by far..</li>
            <li>But on the bright side, the color is very long lasting.</li>
            <li>Great price on Amazon - several $ less that at Target.</li>
            <li>Also doesn&#x27;t take long time to dry on your skin after applying and the smell is pretty good too.</li>
            <li>It is sooo hard for me to do a good job</li>
            <li>Just clean your hands after application as with any tanner and even if a little too much color gets on elbows, knees, or something, it&#x27;s easy to even out the color by rubbing with a damp facecloth.</li>
            <li>For me, it takes about 12 hours before I will really notice the effects of an application and it lasts about a week.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would not smell as much since it&#x27;s not a lotion</li>
            <li>The Tan Towels were just getting to be very pricey.  </li>
            <li>but I think it works very well and is never streaky.</li>
            <li>I really like that the color doesn&#x27;t transfer onto my clothes.</li>
            <li>After skin cancer and lots of self tanners, I really like the wipes.  </li>
            <li>So I use these once a week followed by some lightly tanned lotion daily.  </li>
            <li>the product doesn&#x27;t smell much when you put it on but throughout the day you&#x27;ll notice the smell and if you workout before rinsing it off- whew</li>
            <li>this really dries your skin out&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just like a real suntan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>arms , and stomach from scratching so much.</li>
            <li>And my friends know how much that bothers me.  </li>
            <li>One towelette will cover your whole body, including your face.</li>
            <li>If you really scrub the towel on your skin (like a wash cloth), there will be no streaks.</li>
            <li>After just 2 applications, people asked me how I got so tan so fast.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>it really covers well...</li>
            <li>I achieve a much lighter color</li>
            <li>The toilettes are much easier than any lotion or spray I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>very streaky..</li>
            <li>REALLY WORKS</li>
            <li>It blends very well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>This is the answer for every sundamage concerned person who still wants a glow.  </li>
            <li>I REALLY like it because I can use it on my face without worrying about breaking out.  </li>
            <li>One wipe covered my whole body.</li>
            <li>and I would never trust this product to get me beach ready.</li>
            <li>There is no way I could apply it evenly to my whole body.</li>
            <li>I did not get much color at all.</li>
            <li>reasonably priced&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just be sure to wash your hands carefully and not splash water on your arms afterwards or wear gloves.</li>
            <li>i just think its so much easier.there is alot of self tanner on each towel</li>
            <li>so i can do my whole body in one shot</li>
            <li>from my point of view the tan looks real not orange at all</li>
            <li>it really didn&#x27;t do hole lot for me.</li>
            <li>my daughter likes myself not so much.</li>
            <li>I am very picky when it comes to my skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s close enough to natural looking for me to continue to subscribe to this product on a monthly basis so that I can avoid the sun&#x27;s harmful rays, but keep a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>I bought this product hoping to add some nice color to my pale complexion.</li>
            <li>This product still has that sunless tanner smell, but I&#x27;ve smelled much stronger odor in most other products.  </li>
            <li>the downside, there&#x27;s the strong chemical smell that you have to live with until your next shower.</li>
            <li>When I want to use 1/2 of the towlette, and save the other half for another day soon they are easily cut into 2 pieces which make it alittle more economical too.</li>
            <li>It also does not stain clothes or sheets like many other self tanners do.  </li>
            <li>The color is not as believable as other self tanners I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>the color does get dark fast and can be made darker by applying more.</li>
            <li>Very light smell that fades quickly, dries almost immediately, and very forgiving - no streaks or orange color, but instead a subtle difference</li>
            <li>Second, apply well in advance before your special event or vacation.</li>
            <li>As it is the medium and not the dark, I thought I was safe.</li>
            <li>I am light skinned (but not pale) and have eczema on my arms that make them red.</li>
            <li>I prefer these to most of the more expensive boutique brands.</li>
            <li>but gosh, the must have ALL been super white.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried SOOO many different self tanning products over the years, and this one is definitely a winner.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many brands of bronzer at high and low price ranges and gotten stripes, smears and every nightmare possible.  </li>
            <li>I consider myself more olive skinned (tan very well in the summer), but the winter always leaves me feeling pale.</li>
            <li>While the towelettes themselves smell lovely (a mild rain scent mixed with a little sandalwood), you will still have that maple syrup/nail file smell that all self-tanners posses.</li>
            <li>so I highly recommend using a lotion that does not have any mineral oils in it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them for years and highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>A bit on the high side, but if you want a tan overnight, just put it on before you go to bed.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The directions are missing some very important steps.</li>
            <li>i didnt have high hopes for this</li>
            <li>No worry about messy liquids spilling as I&#x27;ve experienced with other products.</li>
            <li>When I use this product it makes my skin tone look more even (as well as giving me a little color) and my eczema is not as noticeable.</li>
            <li>the ones I just got must be old or something--they are not working!!</li>
            <li>AND, I wash my hands immediately afterward and use the MUCH lighter Jergens natural glow lotion on my hands instead, this also helps with the streaking factor.</li>
            <li>Great fake tanning product.</li>
            <li>The gentle formula does not irritate or give me pimples on my oily and sensitive face.</li>
            <li>It is pretty simple to use without needing much of preparation.</li>
            <li>They were really simple to use and pretty forgiving if you missed a spot or put too much around the knees/hands/feet area.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t expect miracles when you have very white skin, but these did give a nice color, especially after using the second one.  </li>
            <li>I had a few packages left from last year and used them first before reordering; they were still good.  </li>
            <li>Work very well with no mess.</li>
            <li>and I am only wearing pants right now</li>
            <li>Then I remembered a few reviews stating that what looked fine inside was a different story in true sunlight.  </li>
            <li>Does not have that typical smell most self tanners do..has a faint but pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>I have now applied on both complete arms, also put on my upper leggs, which are completely white,  Will see if color is good enough to be seen in public.  </li>
            <li>twice a week - tan looks very natural and does not come off in spots at all like a spray tan.  </li>
            <li>Color is very natural.  </li>
            <li>no streaking and looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>I love a tan &amp; usually start my summer with help from self-tanners, but always used the lotions.  </li>
            <li>When I first applied it, I noticed the streaks the next day.</li>
            <li>The price is super and they work just as well as the ones that cost twice as much and cover half the area.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s IMPOSSIBLE to use on your hands and even though I&#x27;ve blended it perfectly smoothly its always blotchy in full spectrum light.</li>
            <li>It has a slight smell but not bad, compared to the older creams.</li>
            <li>USED PROPERLY, I THINK THESE TOWELETTES ARE SUPERIOR TO OTHER MORE EXPENSIVE TANNING PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li>I will never buy these again; I will stick to my Jergen’s lotion and professional airbrushes as these seem to yield the best/most natural results!</li>
            <li>Another positive about these towelettes is that they leave  hardly little to no odor which is a positive for me!</li>
            <li>Just be careful to cover the area fully because you do get a nice dark at home tan with this product and if you miss a spot it will be noticeable!</li>
            <li>its easy fast only thing is u may need two one for the upper body and the other for the lower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually stupid at applying these things but this is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>Just want that clear, I don&#x27;t promote tanning beds and laying in the sun to bake wrinkle your skin.  </li>
            <li>this box from amazon is probably old or they have changed.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasanly surprised.</li>
            <li>for a professional spray-on tan.</li>
            <li>you could give this 5 stars unless your basing it off of your soft orange lighting in your bathroom.</li>
            <li>I look like my 4 year old daughter that just spilled glitter all over herself.</li>
            <li>Also, as far as the color is concerned, there is no orange color.  </li>
            <li>They look really natural</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m also not a daily shower-er, so I can&#x27;t vouch for how much fades that way yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>Gives a sunny looking tan that looks completely natural.  </li>
            <li>So if you have sensitive skin, I would stay away from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Once the tan was completely gone, the itching stopped,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Do your face last so that the color isn&#x27;t so intense.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re really in  a hurry, apply another one about 4 hours later.</li>
            <li>looks like a natural tan</li>
            <li>i knew i had completely covered well.</li>
            <li>In this case, I can&#x27;t lay fault completely to the product, but I will say that the biggest problems were not caused by</li>
            <li>One packet tans my entire body (5&#x27;3) very well.</li>
            <li>Natural looking.</li>
            <li>1 towelette is enough for the whole body.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps if I reapplied daily or every other day I may see a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>But if you just want to do half your body for a quick touch up or use in tandem with the self tanning Gel.</li>
            <li>Be careful around knees, ankles, and feet too - as the skin in those areas tends to color darker and more rapidly than other parts of the body!</li>
            <li>These are very quick drying (probably dried totally within 2-3 min</li>
            <li>- I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be as careful and lucky with future applications).  </li>
            <li>odor.&lt;br /&gt;I exfoliated first and thought I carefully covered my legs and arms.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gradually growing &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; with minimal hand transfer (&amp;#34;orange palms&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t turn orange, and are easy to use (hard to get streaky lines with these).</li>
            <li>Wait to dry and apply another if you really really want to be bronze for the beach.</li>
            <li>My only negative is the smell, as with most tanners.</li>
            <li>The towelletes are big enough so you can wipe your face and whole body.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper to buy through amazon than at your local drug store or big retail shop.</li>
            <li>They are very very obvious, and honestly.. its not remotely attractive.</li>
            <li>These give you a nice even looking natural tan, no blotchy looking weird orangy color.</li>
            <li>The color isn&#x27;t too orangey or overwhelmingly tan, &amp; you are in complete control of how dark of a tan you&#x27;ll have depending upon the number of times you apply this product per week.&lt;br /&gt;Also, as a side note, this is great as a base color under other self-tanning products, in case you really want to amp up your overall tan with ease.</li>
            <li>Ok...at first when I was going to write my review, I was going to give it 1 star because it left a few very noticeable streaks on my legs.</li>
            <li>This product goes on easily and a only take a few applications to get to desired color!</li>
            <li>all - seems like my natural tan color, and it gave me a pretty decent glow after only 2 tries (back to back).  </li>
            <li>I use two towels per application--one for my top half and one for the bottom half.  </li>
            <li>I generally self tan on a Friday/Saturday night with a tinted product like St.</li>
            <li>I generally have to use 2 towels each application</li>
            <li>Produces a naturally looking tan within several hours.</li>
            <li>in the direct sunlight it stills looks a tiny bit orange.  </li>
            <li>This is the only tanning product that gives me a natural glow without streaks and smell.</li>
            <li>I followed another reviewers advice and made sure I shaved the day before using, and showered the day of, but let my skin dry for at least 15 minutes afterwards before applying the towelette to it.</li>
            <li>Simple to use, no mess, no staining, no smell.  </li>
            <li>This is a simple to use tanner with no mess.  </li>
            <li>This works as well as more expensive brands I have tried and looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>I ordered a more expensive &#x27;tan-towel&#x27; last month, but these seem to do a better job (a least for me).  </li>
            <li>But I do think one is not enough for full body use(I am a small person).</li>
            <li>The color builds slowly over 2-3 applications but lasts about a week and fades fairly evenly, at least in my case.  </li>
            <li>One towel truly covered my whole average sized body from neck to toe (did not use on face).</li>
            <li>Straight up and down motions cause streaks.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty set for my little poolside adventure next weekend</li>
            <li>Usually I use the Banana Boat one, but I have been loving these lately.  </li>
            <li>I apply with latex gloves (otherwise my hands soak up the tanner while I&#x27;m applying elsewhere) and be sure to shower and exfoliate well before application (I recommend using a little lotion on dry spots like knees, elbows, hands, feet- to avoid uneven absorption of the tanning solution)</li>
            <li>Does not streak (unless you forget to apply to a section) or go on unevenly (even if you reapply to a certain area).  </li>
            <li>Also, I found that putting a little bit of lotion on my writs after application really helps with the steaking on my wrists (this was a problem area for me).</li>
            <li>However, it seems like it takes a few more applications with the Loreal brand to get the same color as Tan Towels, but for this price that hardly matters.  </li>
            <li>I like the towelettes they are easy to apply dry quick, and does not smell so bad.  </li>

            <li> These tanning wipes are a great product.  </li>
            <li> so much more conveniant !!</li>
            <li> Moisturizes the skin very nicely.</li>
            <li> Like I said, I&#x27;ve successfully used self-tanners before but never a towelette.  </li>
            <li> LOVE these - they are the best!</li>
            <li> They solution on the wipes/towels does not stink and is pleasant - and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky (maybe just a touch).</li>
            <li> The color is decent, but I&#x27;ve tried and tried to apply it perfectly and it never comes out perfect.</li>
            <li> Works well, easy to apply and best of all</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned</li>
            <li> i have used these for years and always got good color...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned, but it gives me a good even tone.</li>
            <li> I suggest having a loved one assist with putting it on.</li>
            <li> No smell - no smudges - looks good in sunlight, too.  </li>
            <li> Even my husband, who hates the sun, has a good \\&quot;tan\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Good color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredible &amp; I have never found better.</li>
            <li> I tried Comodyne brand also, and the L&#x27;Oreal product is vastly superior.</li>
            <li> All in all, this is a good product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned</li>
            <li> so I thought this would be a good time to start self tanning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my fair share of sunless tanning lotions and sprays.</li>
            <li> They give a good glow and tan to your body.</li>
            <li> I am a fair skinned person and have been using self tanners for years.</li>
            <li> it all looked good aside from one streak on my thigh.</li>
            <li> I was delighted with the product and bought a box or two wherever I saw it being sold.  </li>
            <li> Good tanning towel.  </li>
            <li> And, for the ease of use, I think this brand is as good as any on the market.  </li>
            <li> smooth and tan looks great!!</li>
            <li> I have fair skin in the winter and after I use about 3 days in a row of these I get to a color</li>
            <li> but it accually looks good and</li>
            <li> Good product...</li>
            <li> Love love love this!!!</li>
            <li> These are ok but nothing great.</li>
            <li> I feel like a narcissist admitting that I own a self-tanning product, but I have to say how good this stuff is.</li>
            <li> Love these!</li>
            <li> Love them!  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff !</li>

            <li> Love these towelettes!  </li>
            <li> MUCH better than all the lotions, sprays and foams I&#x27;ve used!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this one!</li>
            <li> I love these!</li>
            <li> Love these!</li>
            <li> WILL purchase more!</li>
            <li> I love these towelettes!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Subscribe and Save, just love it!  </li>
            <li> but I think that&#x27;s more user error that a defect of the product :o)</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and great results</li>
            <li> Was so happy to fine it on&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair &amp; this gives me a nice, golden, even tone.</li>
            <li> Being a mom of two kids I have no time to get that amazing tan</li>
            <li> It also works nicely on the face.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and love the color that I get from these.</li>
            <li> I had reached a nice sun kissed look.</li>
            <li> Being fair skinned, I&#x27;ve tried many brands of self tanners for a number of years.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best tanner I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I use one every Friday evening after I get home from work and then have a nice even tan for the weekend.</li>
            <li> but I had to wait until it faded on its own.</li>
            <li> It fades nicely as well.  </li>
            <li> It takes me 2 to build it up to a nice medium tone.  </li>
            <li> a nice color on.</li>
            <li> Nice item.</li>
            <li> I went for two weeks without applying any self-tanner while it wore away on its own.</li>
            <li> Also sometimes it streaks but to be honest</li>
            <li> ya know moms still like to look good to &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Nice even tanning.  </li>
            <li> I prefer a nice tan look year</li>
            <li> spreads nicely and your hands don&#x27;t get all</li>
            <li> Nice</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- nice, lightweight feel</li>
            <li> Very nice, smooth, even tan.  </li>
            <li> Super easy to apply, great color, not orange, virtually no smell, and NO STREAKS!  </li>
            <li> I did two applications and the end result is a beautiful golden tan.</li>
            <li> Great item for quick tan.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and good color.</li>
            <li> This is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> but it produces great color and is super easy to use!</li>
            <li> and I have a wonderful natural looking glow.  </li>
            <li> I am sure my ancestors were nice people...</li>
            <li> This provides a good color and is streak free.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy, streak free and does not have a &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; to it, which is great.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, my face always ended up looking nice!</li>
            <li> I  like these toweletts for quick self tanning,The scent is fairly pleasant and not over whelming(a bit like you</li>
            <li> I immediately detected a very strong perfumy/self-tanner odor, but honestly if it worked, I would have been fine with it.  </li>
            <li> I might mention I have very light skin.</li>
            <li> and it is very cheap.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I stumbled on these one day at Target and absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> Be sure to wash hands with bar soap and that&#x27;s it.  </li>
            <li> Will continue buying more on line, even cheaper than in the stores.</li>
            <li> These are great for us fair skinned folks that only need a bit of color.  </li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to wash your hands off so your palms aren&#x27;t stained from using these.</li>
            <li> I am a competitive ballroom dancer and most of my friends spend up to $40.</li>
            <li> Be sure to exfoliate in the shower before using.</li>
            <li> Love these tanning towelettes.</li>
            <li> How do I make sure to get the BODY towelettes each time?  </li>
            <li> Okay, streaks I can understand because maybe I missed applying, but</li>
            <li> I know most people seem to love them</li>
            <li> I have used self tanners before, these are ok.</li>
            <li> Overall definitely a wonderful product that I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I have tried several self tanners and I found this one to be the best.  </li>
            <li> Go Get You Some Because You WILL Love It.</li>
            <li> This product creates, like many, more yellowish undertones of a tan.</li>
            <li> This also did not seem to have an orange color as many self tanners do.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product after reading many of the reviews and wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> Also, be sure to give a swipe to those tricky spots: elbows, hands, ankles, and feet.</li>
            <li> Love these towelettes.  </li>
            <li> if I do tan even  in the tanner I wear a 30 spf and never go more than 4 times i a year.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love these.  </li>
            <li> Better Self Tanning Solution</li>
            <li> This summer I have not been able to lay out..</li>
            <li> got SO many compliments about how tan I am and questions on how I have found time to lay out.  </li>
            <li> These are so much better.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> i love this product  </li>
            <li> It was what was recommended to me by a friend, and I&#x27;ve been satisfied with the way it works for a couple years now.</li>
            <li> I will be glad to order it again when needed.</li>
            <li> Love it wish the color was instant,however.</li>
            <li> I love pricey salon sprays but can&#x27;t always find the time to get them.</li>
            <li> That said, these are the best things out there-they are easy to use, dry quickly, have a great tone and are portable.</li>
            <li> This is the very best self tanner I have used on my lily white legs.  </li>
            <li> And my legs were not orange as with many others products.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased that the color lasted a week before all washing away.</li>
            <li> Love love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I applied more to see if I could blend it</li>
            <li> but, again, more streaks.</li>
            <li> Better value than TanTowel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used so many kinds and they all do so</li>
            <li> LOVE these  LOREAL BRONZE  TOWELETTES  -</li>
            <li> The price is much better than anything else I&#x27;ve seen as well.</li>
            <li> They cost more here than what I paid in Houston</li>
            <li> I have used many self tanners in hopes of keeping myself out of the tanning bed in the winter.  </li>
            <li> and i also prefer the one that has some color to be able to see where we put.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li> And in most cases, you will have to use two wipes to cover your body.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that you can travel with these.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many.</li>
            <li> And the more often you use them the darker the tan.</li>
            <li> Iv&#x27;e used it many times before, and still do.</li>
            <li> i have been through so many self bronzer..</li>
            <li> but i used to not be able to afford tanning beds.</li>
            <li> i love how there towelets and ur more in controle then sprays or lotions..</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Amazon prices are better</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> Pretty good product.</li>
            <li> A single application will make you a shade darker, perfect for a weekend trip or event,</li>
            <li> Great, natural tan!</li>
            <li> I have used these for special occasions and they give a nice smooth not - orange tan</li>
            <li> I use it mostly on my legs, twice a week keeps a light tan on my legs.</li>
            <li> It is important to make sure you cover every spot on your leg.  </li>
            <li> I feel sure no brand is fool proof if excess amounts aren&#x27;t lightly rubbed off to prevent build-up in wrinkles...</li>
            <li> Enjoy:)</li>
            <li> These take a bit of practice to use (since you can&#x27;t see where it is going on), but after becoming an expert with the Tan Towels, these were easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen tanning sheets on the shopping channels but didn&#x27;t believe they worked as easily as they said - WITHOUT STREAKING - until I tried the L&#x27;Oreal Towelettes.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The towelettes are easy to use and can be carried in your purse.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> easy application -</li>
            <li> easy to put on and stays on for some time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to use</li>
            <li> I bought these wipes because they were supposed to be easy to use and would not leave the tell-tale self-tanner</li>
            <li> Easy to apply,,  </li>
            <li> so easy to use and even reuse if you dampen it.  </li>
            <li> This product is easy to apply, but you need to put it on the day before you want the tan.  </li>
            <li> It smells strongly and it lingers.</li>
            <li> The towelletes do not have any strong smells and my bronzed body stays tanned for about 5 days.</li>
            <li> It does not smear or have a strong odor.  </li>
            <li> have been using this self-tanner for years &amp; I am constantly given compliments on how beautiful my skin tone is.</li>
            <li> She will look gorgeous for New Years.</li>
            <li> Its fabulous and so easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I have tried many tanning products in the past and this one is the best.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be comfortable wearing something with this strong of smell to a job or date.</li>
            <li> It has no nasty odor and dries on the skin quickly.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and I am able to put my clothes on almost immediately.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and easy to work with but needs to come in a deeper color and last for more than&lt;</li>
            <li> I just love them they are easy to put one and last really good.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to apply, portable, and highly recommended!!  </li>
            <li> Smooth, even color.</li>
            <li> These are fabulous.  </li>
            <li> Also, the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li> Indoors, the color looks amazing and like a real tan.  </li>
            <li> This type of information is important when reading tanner reviews)&lt;br</li>
            <li> My legs are streak free and the tan is even all the way around</li>
            <li> But the L&#x27;Oréal is cheap &amp; does the job.</li>
            <li> In the morning, I awake to a light tan.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the product does not anywhere say that someone with light skin couldn&#x27;t not use it.</li>
            <li> and this gives me a healthy, golden glow.  </li>
            <li> this seems like a great product only used it once</li>
            <li> And most importantly, even though I exfoliated first and kept my skin moisturized, for the first time ever, I looked at my arms and could see my skin kind of flaking off, as if I hadn&#x27;t exfoliated.</li>
            <li> terrific product works great.....</li>
            <li> so far so good.  </li>
            <li> B0017JDUFA TanTowel Self-Tan Towelette Classic 10 PACK]] is MUCH better!</li>
            <li> I have used these for a few yrs and found them easy, portable, dependable, generally effective and pleasant.  </li>
            <li> The handwashing after you&#x27;re done is very important or your hands will have a funny color.  </li>
            <li> I do not feel the need to use another towel to do my legs, but will most certainly do so once Spring hits!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a quick and easy tan.</li>
            <li> Large cloth and easy to apply!  </li>
            <li> This is the best self-tanner that I have ever used, &amp; I&#x27;ve used self-tanners of every caliber &amp; price over the past 8 years.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this product through Amazon but like many of you I always look on Amazon first for reviews</li>
            <li> I want the most tan first (i.e. face, arms, legs) followed by the rest.  </li>
            <li> next morning I have a nice glow!</li>
            <li> I am a white woman and I have had great success using sunless tanning lotions, so I figured I&#x27;d try this version.</li>
            <li> I have used different types of self tanners, including spray tans, and this by far is the best!!</li>
            <li> and its worth the money especially if it keeps her happy.</li>
            <li> Some may even think this is a positive, because it allows you more control over your tan.  </li>
            <li> I used it for the first time last week (9 days ago) and still looks great.  </li>
            <li> These things though do a good job of actually making you noticeably tanner looking.</li>
            <li> I love them so much that I tell all my friends about them.  </li>
            <li> Been looking very forward to my latest shipment for summer.</li>
            <li> I like the towelette format versus the cream because I have more control over how much to apply.</li>
            <li> In fact, getting ready to order some more.  </li>
            <li> but I even use these on my face and use a Qtip to lightly run around my eyes where I have smile lines.  </li>
            <li> Good for instant color.</li>
            <li> I loved was a product with finally NO smell!</li>
            <li> Not bad</li>
            <li> no bad smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Sublime Bronze tinted self-tanning lotion for years, and these towellets are far superior since it&#x27;s so much easier to smooth the tint all over, evenly and quickly, rather than tube-to-hand then hand-to-body.  </li>
            <li> This product is so easy to use, leaves no streaks and is very portable to pack on trips!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this tanning for any busy moms who want to still have that nice healthy glow ..</li>
            <li> Now they have a &#x27;new scent&#x27; which is not any better than the original scent, AND the degree of darkness is lighter than I was used to.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to exfoliate and apply to dry skin and use even applications, going lightly over knees, elbows and ankles where the skin will take in more color.</li>
            <li> Dries incredibly quickly.  </li>
            <li> but I was able to rectify it with the second application and truthfully it was probably user error, not the product.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and develops a bronze tan.</li>
            <li> and I am lucky I don&#x27;t have to leave the house today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The more regularly you use it the more even it gets and the fewer you need to use.</li>
            <li> If you need a quick tan these are the way to go.</li>
            <li> It looks small but one towelette can give you a great color and without any marks and strong smells.</li>
            <li> But in general i&#x27;ll buy again since the color is amazing.</li>
            <li> first then rub all over your legs, lightly running over ankles, toes and knees.  </li>
            <li> I have always been pleased with the mailing package until this arrived, it must be a new way of mailing the items (to save on weight, etc.</li>
            <li> I love this product because: it doesn&#x27;t smell bad like the others, better, it doesn&#x27;t have any smell at all, it is easy to apply, you can use a rubber glove to apply it so your hands are clean when you finish, it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> I loved the quick dry!</li>
            <li> Work great on my face and one of the few things that doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> I just got these, tried it 2x, and loved the outcome so much that I already ordered my second box.</li>
            <li> I have tried the loreal spray and am not crazy about that either because I worry about what else it is getting on besides me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the &amp;#34;new fresh scent&amp;#34; fool you.</li>
            <li> BUT YOU GET TO CONTROL THE APPLICATION TO A FAR GREATER DEGREE THAN SPRAY TANS.</li>
            <li> trying these wipes, I&#x27;m convinced there s no self-tanning product that is worth buying.</li>
            <li> It looks more natural</li>
            <li> However, the smell is overwhelming for me because I have a sensitive nose.  </li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> It provides a nice, deep streak-free tan.</li>
            <li> My advice would also be to avoid or very lightly brush over areas such as elbows, knees, ankles, wrists, etc as is the case with most self-tanners, but truth be told, this self-tanner is pretty much fool proof even if you cover those areas.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t exfoliate very often and &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; every other day with great results.</li>
            <li> I saw a noticeable difference upon application, but it seemed to fade pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> but it dries pretty quickly &amp; doesn&#x27;t have the stench that some sunless tanners have.</li>
            <li> The color of that is so much more realistic and it&#x27;s so much easier to apply.</li>
            <li> I applied it every other day and was delighted with the increasing depth of my tan.  </li>
            <li> Seems about foolproof, right?</li>
            <li> but its easy to use,u dont have to worry about getting messy, makes a nice even tan.</li>
            <li> When I am attending a special event &amp; want to look like I just got back from the Bahamas, I first apply this self-tanner, &amp; after it dries, I top it with a self-tanning lotion or a tinted spray-tan.</li>
            <li> If I want it even darker, I generally will put on the Banana Boat one on top of this.</li>
            <li> Leaves a nice even tan that stays for a long time.  </li>
            <li> These are really easy to use and not messy.</li>
            <li> sometimes two is needed to cover my whole body, but i really love the natural look they create.</li>
            <li> Very way to use with quick results.</li>
            <li> There is another product like this, more expensive but it works great and has virtually no smell once it dries.</li>
            <li> just needs to use on clean skin, put lotion on any dry areas...and wait 10-15 or more minutes before putting on clothing.  </li>
            <li> So easy to use and the color is quite natural.</li>
            <li> and I really can see the difference in color after just the first time!</li>
            <li> They are easy to use, one towel can be used on your whole body, and the color is very natural.  </li>
            <li> Make sure your skin is exfoliated &amp; shaved prior to application.</li>
            <li> so you really get your money&#x27;s worth with this</li>
            <li> No streaking is evident from using them.</li>
            <li> I tried these L’Oreal Towelettes last night and woke up looking like an albino tiger; super streaky and super orange!</li>
            <li> Pretty tan color &amp; for me no noticeable smell.</li>
            <li> I have an automatice shipment order for the Loreal Self Tanning BODY towelettes, received correct shipment first time...</li>
            <li> Of course the hands are tricky to tan evenly, as with most product; I rub the towel all over the tops of my hands last and rub a cottonball soaked in rubbing alcohol on the fingers and palms of my hands to avoid orange palms.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time ever using anything to fakebake.</li>
            <li> I did get a streak on my leg the first time I applied</li>
            <li> I had a coupon and bought this for the first time at Target store.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t over think it, just make sure you wipe your entire body</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t purchase this from amazon, but felt that I&#x27;d like to share the review for those (like me) that come here first to check things out.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> When I first began using this self-tanner</li>
            <li> every product mentioned in articles on removal of self-tanner  --  mostly abrasives such as baking powder and salt scrubs.  </li>
            <li> I waited a day and then used another toilette and covered that spot first and then finished my legs.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t notice at first as it takes a couple hours for the color to start working.  </li>
            <li> First, use gloves.</li>
            <li> This item really works!</li>
            <li> This is the first self tanner I&#x27;d ever tried.</li>
            <li> After using this I switched to fake bake flawless.</li>
            <li> however the smeel sucks lol and it can make u not quit orange, but not brown eighter..</li>
            <li> Next time, I will give those areas a quick and light swipe.</li>
            <li> and I thought that this would be good, but I end up having patches of color and patches of plain skin after a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I exfoliated before, made sure my skin was dry, followed all the directions/online tips and still didn’t turn out right.</li>
            <li> The wipes/towels are large enough to cover most bodies.</li>
            <li> I use one towelette and am able to do my whole upper body ..</li>
            <li> The sheets apply very easily with expected results.</li>
            <li> It looks good on the upper body/arms, but always streaky on my legs no matter what I do, and the color definitely looks orange in certain lights.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product many times, love the fact it travels with you, is not messy and gives a tan in a few hours.   </li>
            <li> this is a great value because I have 4 sheets left to apply other times.  </li>
            <li> This tanning product works very well if you do exactly as directed.  </li>
            <li> but these towelettes from Loreal are just as good if not better.</li>
            <li> Not bad inside, but standing in the natural sun</li>
            <li> Other tanners do not seem natural in color, this one really looks good.</li>
            <li> The application is extremely easy: just open one of the tanning towelettes &amp; wipe in a buffing motion onto your skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- non streaking (just be sure to exfoliate then use a bit of moisturizer on dry areas - like elbows, knees &amp; ankles - before applying the self tanner)</li>
            <li> The only good thing about these wipes is that the color lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I will try to find original packages in my local stores, not an easy task as it&#x27;s not widely carried.</li>
            <li> I will certainly buy this again and use it weekly during the summer times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not so drastic that you would realize I forgot to wipe it on certain body parts.  </li>
            <li> The wipes are large and loaded with plenty of product.  </li>
            <li> I have tried some pretty expensive ones too and these are the best by far..</li>
            <li> But on the bright side, the color is very long lasting.</li>
            <li> Great price on Amazon - several $ less that at Target.</li>
            <li> Also doesn&#x27;t take long time to dry on your skin after applying and the smell is pretty good too.</li>
            <li> It is sooo hard for me to do a good job</li>
            <li> Just clean your hands after application as with any tanner and even if a little too much color gets on elbows, knees, or something, it&#x27;s easy to even out the color by rubbing with a damp facecloth.</li>
            <li> For me, it takes about 12 hours before I will really notice the effects of an application and it lasts about a week.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would not smell as much since it&#x27;s not a lotion</li>
            <li> The Tan Towels were just getting to be very pricey.  </li>
            <li> but I think it works very well and is never streaky.</li>
            <li> I really like that the color doesn&#x27;t transfer onto my clothes.</li>
            <li> After skin cancer and lots of self tanners, I really like the wipes.  </li>
            <li> So I use these once a week followed by some lightly tanned lotion daily.  </li>
            <li> the product doesn&#x27;t smell much when you put it on but throughout the day you&#x27;ll notice the smell and if you workout before rinsing it off- whew</li>
            <li> this really dries your skin out&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just like a real suntan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> arms , and stomach from scratching so much.</li>
            <li> And my friends know how much that bothers me.  </li>
            <li> One towelette will cover your whole body, including your face.</li>
            <li> If you really scrub the towel on your skin (like a wash cloth), there will be no streaks.</li>
            <li> After just 2 applications, people asked me how I got so tan so fast.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> it really covers well...</li>
            <li> I achieve a much lighter color</li>
            <li> The toilettes are much easier than any lotion or spray I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> very streaky..</li>
            <li> REALLY WORKS</li>
            <li> It blends very well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> This is the answer for every sundamage concerned person who still wants a glow.  </li>
            <li> I REALLY like it because I can use it on my face without worrying about breaking out.  </li>
            <li> One wipe covered my whole body.</li>
            <li> and I would never trust this product to get me beach ready.</li>
            <li> There is no way I could apply it evenly to my whole body.</li>
            <li> I did not get much color at all.</li>
            <li> reasonably priced&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just be sure to wash your hands carefully and not splash water on your arms afterwards or wear gloves.</li>
            <li> i just think its so much easier.there is alot of self tanner on each towel</li>
            <li> so i can do my whole body in one shot</li>
            <li> from my point of view the tan looks real not orange at all</li>
            <li> it really didn&#x27;t do hole lot for me.</li>
            <li> my daughter likes myself not so much.</li>
            <li> I am very picky when it comes to my skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s close enough to natural looking for me to continue to subscribe to this product on a monthly basis so that I can avoid the sun&#x27;s harmful rays, but keep a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping to add some nice color to my pale complexion.</li>
            <li> This product still has that sunless tanner smell, but I&#x27;ve smelled much stronger odor in most other products.  </li>
            <li> the downside, there&#x27;s the strong chemical smell that you have to live with until your next shower.</li>
            <li> When I want to use 1/2 of the towlette, and save the other half for another day soon they are easily cut into 2 pieces which make it alittle more economical too.</li>
            <li> It also does not stain clothes or sheets like many other self tanners do.  </li>
            <li> The color is not as believable as other self tanners I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> the color does get dark fast and can be made darker by applying more.</li>
            <li> Very light smell that fades quickly, dries almost immediately, and very forgiving - no streaks or orange color, but instead a subtle difference</li>
            <li> Second, apply well in advance before your special event or vacation.</li>
            <li> As it is the medium and not the dark, I thought I was safe.</li>
            <li> I am light skinned (but not pale) and have eczema on my arms that make them red.</li>
            <li> I prefer these to most of the more expensive boutique brands.</li>
            <li> but gosh, the must have ALL been super white.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried SOOO many different self tanning products over the years, and this one is definitely a winner.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many brands of bronzer at high and low price ranges and gotten stripes, smears and every nightmare possible.  </li>
            <li> I consider myself more olive skinned (tan very well in the summer), but the winter always leaves me feeling pale.</li>
            <li> While the towelettes themselves smell lovely (a mild rain scent mixed with a little sandalwood), you will still have that maple syrup/nail file smell that all self-tanners posses.</li>
            <li> so I highly recommend using a lotion that does not have any mineral oils in it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for years and highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> A bit on the high side, but if you want a tan overnight, just put it on before you go to bed.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The directions are missing some very important steps.</li>
            <li> i didnt have high hopes for this</li>
            <li> No worry about messy liquids spilling as I&#x27;ve experienced with other products.</li>
            <li> When I use this product it makes my skin tone look more even (as well as giving me a little color) and my eczema is not as noticeable.</li>
            <li> the ones I just got must be old or something--they are not working!!</li>
            <li> AND, I wash my hands immediately afterward and use the MUCH lighter Jergens natural glow lotion on my hands instead, this also helps with the streaking factor.</li>
            <li> Great fake tanning product.</li>
            <li> The gentle formula does not irritate or give me pimples on my oily and sensitive face.</li>
            <li> It is pretty simple to use without needing much of preparation.</li>
            <li> They were really simple to use and pretty forgiving if you missed a spot or put too much around the knees/hands/feet area.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t expect miracles when you have very white skin, but these did give a nice color, especially after using the second one.  </li>
            <li> I had a few packages left from last year and used them first before reordering; they were still good.  </li>
            <li> Work very well with no mess.</li>
            <li> and I am only wearing pants right now</li>
            <li> Then I remembered a few reviews stating that what looked fine inside was a different story in true sunlight.  </li>
            <li> Does not have that typical smell most self tanners do..has a faint but pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I have now applied on both complete arms, also put on my upper leggs, which are completely white,  Will see if color is good enough to be seen in public.  </li>
            <li> twice a week - tan looks very natural and does not come off in spots at all like a spray tan.  </li>
            <li> Color is very natural.  </li>
            <li> no streaking and looks very natural.  </li>
            <li> I love a tan &amp; usually start my summer with help from self-tanners, but always used the lotions.  </li>
            <li> When I first applied it, I noticed the streaks the next day.</li>
            <li> The price is super and they work just as well as the ones that cost twice as much and cover half the area.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s IMPOSSIBLE to use on your hands and even though I&#x27;ve blended it perfectly smoothly its always blotchy in full spectrum light.</li>
            <li> It has a slight smell but not bad, compared to the older creams.</li>
            <li> USED PROPERLY, I THINK THESE TOWELETTES ARE SUPERIOR TO OTHER MORE EXPENSIVE TANNING PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> I will never buy these again; I will stick to my Jergen’s lotion and professional airbrushes as these seem to yield the best/most natural results!</li>
            <li> Another positive about these towelettes is that they leave  hardly little to no odor which is a positive for me!</li>
            <li> Just be careful to cover the area fully because you do get a nice dark at home tan with this product and if you miss a spot it will be noticeable!</li>
            <li> its easy fast only thing is u may need two one for the upper body and the other for the lower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually stupid at applying these things but this is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Just want that clear, I don&#x27;t promote tanning beds and laying in the sun to bake wrinkle your skin.  </li>
            <li> this box from amazon is probably old or they have changed.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasanly surprised.</li>
            <li> for a professional spray-on tan.</li>
            <li> you could give this 5 stars unless your basing it off of your soft orange lighting in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> I look like my 4 year old daughter that just spilled glitter all over herself.</li>
            <li> Also, as far as the color is concerned, there is no orange color.  </li>
            <li> They look really natural</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m also not a daily shower-er, so I can&#x27;t vouch for how much fades that way yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> Gives a sunny looking tan that looks completely natural.  </li>
            <li> So if you have sensitive skin, I would stay away from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Once the tan was completely gone, the itching stopped,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Do your face last so that the color isn&#x27;t so intense.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re really in  a hurry, apply another one about 4 hours later.</li>
            <li> looks like a natural tan</li>
            <li> i knew i had completely covered well.</li>
            <li> In this case, I can&#x27;t lay fault completely to the product, but I will say that the biggest problems were not caused by</li>
            <li> One packet tans my entire body (5&#x27;3) very well.</li>
            <li> Natural looking.</li>
            <li> 1 towelette is enough for the whole body.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps if I reapplied daily or every other day I may see a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> But if you just want to do half your body for a quick touch up or use in tandem with the self tanning Gel.</li>
            <li> Be careful around knees, ankles, and feet too - as the skin in those areas tends to color darker and more rapidly than other parts of the body!</li>
            <li> These are very quick drying (probably dried totally within 2-3 min</li>
            <li> - I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be as careful and lucky with future applications).  </li>
            <li> odor.&lt;br /&gt;I exfoliated first and thought I carefully covered my legs and arms.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gradually growing &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; with minimal hand transfer (&amp;#34;orange palms&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t turn orange, and are easy to use (hard to get streaky lines with these).</li>
            <li> Wait to dry and apply another if you really really want to be bronze for the beach.</li>
            <li> My only negative is the smell, as with most tanners.</li>
            <li> The towelletes are big enough so you can wipe your face and whole body.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper to buy through amazon than at your local drug store or big retail shop.</li>
            <li> They are very very obvious, and honestly.. its not remotely attractive.</li>
            <li> These give you a nice even looking natural tan, no blotchy looking weird orangy color.</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t too orangey or overwhelmingly tan, &amp; you are in complete control of how dark of a tan you&#x27;ll have depending upon the number of times you apply this product per week.&lt;br /&gt;Also, as a side note, this is great as a base color under other self-tanning products, in case you really want to amp up your overall tan with ease.</li>
            <li> Ok...at first when I was going to write my review, I was going to give it 1 star because it left a few very noticeable streaks on my legs.</li>
            <li> This product goes on easily and a only take a few applications to get to desired color!</li>
            <li> all - seems like my natural tan color, and it gave me a pretty decent glow after only 2 tries (back to back).  </li>
            <li> I use two towels per application--one for my top half and one for the bottom half.  </li>
            <li> I generally self tan on a Friday/Saturday night with a tinted product like St.</li>
            <li> I generally have to use 2 towels each application</li>
            <li> Produces a naturally looking tan within several hours.</li>
            <li> in the direct sunlight it stills looks a tiny bit orange.  </li>
            <li> This is the only tanning product that gives me a natural glow without streaks and smell.</li>
            <li> I followed another reviewers advice and made sure I shaved the day before using, and showered the day of, but let my skin dry for at least 15 minutes afterwards before applying the towelette to it.</li>
            <li> Simple to use, no mess, no staining, no smell.  </li>
            <li> This is a simple to use tanner with no mess.  </li>
            <li> This works as well as more expensive brands I have tried and looks very natural.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a more expensive &#x27;tan-towel&#x27; last month, but these seem to do a better job (a least for me).  </li>
            <li> But I do think one is not enough for full body use(I am a small person).</li>
            <li> The color builds slowly over 2-3 applications but lasts about a week and fades fairly evenly, at least in my case.  </li>
            <li> One towel truly covered my whole average sized body from neck to toe (did not use on face).</li>
            <li> Straight up and down motions cause streaks.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty set for my little poolside adventure next weekend</li>
            <li> Usually I use the Banana Boat one, but I have been loving these lately.  </li>
            <li> I apply with latex gloves (otherwise my hands soak up the tanner while I&#x27;m applying elsewhere) and be sure to shower and exfoliate well before application (I recommend using a little lotion on dry spots like knees, elbows, hands, feet- to avoid uneven absorption of the tanning solution)</li>
            <li> Does not streak (unless you forget to apply to a section) or go on unevenly (even if you reapply to a certain area).  </li>
            <li> Also, I found that putting a little bit of lotion on my writs after application really helps with the steaking on my wrists (this was a problem area for me).</li>
            <li> However, it seems like it takes a few more applications with the Loreal brand to get the same color as Tan Towels, but for this price that hardly matters.  </li>
            <li> I like the towelettes they are easy to apply dry quick, and does not smell so bad.  </li>
            <li> It tans well, but I wish there were some color initially when you wipe it on because it ended up a streaky mess, despite my trying to be really careful and consistent.</li>
            <li> First, let me preface that I am a very pale woman with lots of self-tanning experience.</li>
            <li> * As for orange-yness: My skin naturally has very very pink undertones.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work real well the first application, but I figured out what I was doing wrong.</li>
            <li> I also rub my dry elbows with extra oil before using...and rub around my toes and next to soles with a washcloth when finished.  </li>
            <li> It looked incredibly dry and it was only a day later that the color was peeling</li>
            <li> My wife has tried countless &amp;#34;tanning&amp;#34; creams - and none work as good as the L&#x27;Oreal tanning towels - and these are a lot less expensive too!</li>
            <li> They take overnight (for me at least) to develop, but the color is very natural looking without the old &amp;#34;orangey&amp;#34; color found in some self</li>
            <li> For the price and how long they last, I&#x27;ll continue buying these!</li>
            <li> THEY DON&#x27;T LAST LONG</li>
            <li> FYI: If you notice the inside bend of your arms getting darker than the rest,  do your arms last so the tanner doesn&#x27;t build up in the crease from repeatedly bending your arms before the tanner is dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After bathing and exfoliating my skin, I apply a generous amount of lotion to my elbows, knees, knuckles, etc... and area that tends to be extra dry.  </li>
            <li> I had given up on self tanners over the years because I had such poor success.  </li>
            <li> Like it as the color is natural and easy to use but not gave it 5 stars as the towelettes is a little thick so not easy to use</li>
            <li> A single towelette does my entire body.</li>
            <li> but this is one of the few products that leaves you looking sun kissed and bronzed naturally without skin irritation !  </li>
            <li> It looks very natural, even though I&#x27;ve always had extremely pale, Polish skin.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it has the same old tanning product smell that I can&#x27;t stand.</li>
            <li> I spent an hour prepping my skin (bathing, exfoliating, drying properly, adding moisturizer to knees elbows..</li>
            <li> These appear to be old/past their date as they completely do not work AT ALL.</li>
            <li> As long as applied liberally it does not streak.  </li>
            <li> But...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tan does not stay long.</li>
            <li> Be careful in application, as with any tanning product, it is possible to get streaks.</li>
            <li> I typically use one towel for the entire body, occasionally I&#x27;ll use 2 towels.</li>
            <li> and didn&#x27;t last as long as other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The odor was minimal, but I was a streaky mess when the color developed.</li>
            <li> The same exact product I have bought at CVS makes a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> I have tried the gels, foams, and other towelettes from spas and department stores for several times the price.  </li>
            <li> Have used self tanners for years, usually i get a nice base tan, they lay off real exposure and apply self tanner.  </li>
            <li> I bought a box and tried them 2 different times now, both times being very careful to go over every area and blend well.</li>
            <li> let dry for a minute or two before putting clothes on.</li>
            <li> I have also found that after it dries, using lotion helps keep my skin from getting really dry.</li>
            <li> SO much easier and less messy than sprays, they are easy to maintain (use 1 a day)and difficult to mess up.</li>
            <li> The smell is fine, doesn&#x27;t get weird like other self tanners, though it will change on your body over time.</li>
            <li> I am Blonde and Blue eyed pale face.  </li>
            <li> and I thought the med would be dark enough for me.</li>
            <li> So, to maintain that dark, deep tan, I use one towelette every 3 days.  </li>
            <li> As does St Tropez dark but not regular St tropez.</li>
            <li> They have a light spray tan smell-way lower on the spectrum than other products I&#x27;ve used-and even have a faint l&#x27;Oreal scented smell.</li>
            <li> I used these as directed and discovered that they don&#x27;t work nearly as well as the L&#x27;Oreal cream self-tanning product that I have used in the past...</li>
            <li> these will last you 1 or 2 months, just wipe down on friday&#x27;s for the weekend</li>
            <li> Left my skin slightly orange.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I cut the wipe in half if I want to do a specific area.</li>
            <li> I have used other expensive self tanning products and they rarely worked and if they did they gave my skin an orange tone, this one did not!</li>
            <li> I have even cut the sheets in half and find it has enough lotion to cover face, arms and legs, therefore doubling the product.</li>
            <li> how long I let it dry, the next day I am a streaky mess!</li>
            <li> and I see millions of tiny little sparkles in this \\&quot;lovely\\&quot; tanner.</li>
            <li> Thousands of tiny little sparkles that don&#x27;t wash off in the shower are covering my body.</li>
            <li> Next, I notice after applying that it is drying a dark orange color and that its flaking off!</li>
            <li> then I tried lightly wiping the second time with bad results.</li>
            <li> Not messy like lotions but works at least as well.  </li>
            <li> Within a few hours, a deep, natural-looking tan develops.</li>
            <li> As expected.  </li>
            <li> just spent the day in the sunshine).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all about diligence, which is a drag, but hey, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not a spray</li>
            <li> and I spent a fortune buying</li>
            <li> and if I happen to apply it unevenly, I can fix it with the next application.  </li>
            <li> The wipe was wetter than I expected</li>
            <li> Soo, when I spend about ten dollars for something I will only get a few uses out of, it&#x27;s not cool!</li>
            <li> After a few hours I could see the color change and saw that I had left a small white streak on one leg.  </li>
            <li> 1 box will get you from that pale winter white skin to a luxurious tan - i usually use 1 towel a day for several days before the start of the summer season to give me a jump start on the summer tan.</li>
            <li> Only suggestion is that you shower and dry at least 30 minutes before application.</li>
            <li> One leg is darker orange than the other...</li>
            <li> Repeat with other leg.  </li>
            <li> Odor is stronger than some of the other ones but for the money and once a week use, I would recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t want to take any chances of my hands staining as has happened with other self tanners)</li>
            <li> You do not want to touch other parts of your body when applying this.</li>
            <li> has that typical odd smell when &amp;#34;developing,&amp;#34; but not as bad as many brands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure you can call this a \\&quot;deep dark tan\\&quot;, but that wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for anyway.</li>
            <li> Not too dark at all and not overly noticable.  </li>
            <li> I did put a dab of lotion on my knees, elbows, and ankles before gently wiping the towel in those areas which helped with the weird coloring you can sometimes get there with over saturation.</li>
            <li> For me, I used 4 towelettes in 4 days on my olive skin, and I&#x27;m dark now.  </li>
            <li> so you feel uncomfortable doing much.</li>
            <li> It tends to last for at least a week.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re thick enough so they don&#x27;t ball up in your hand like the cheaper ones do</li>
            <li> Start with face and work your way down, then put lotion on so no streaks develop.</li>
            <li> I had streaks all up and down my legs.</li>
            <li> Has a subtle smell that is inviting and short lived.  </li>
            <li> I like this form of self tanner because it&#x27;s easier to apply with less streaks, although you will still get some areas where the color goes on a bit darker.</li>
            <li> And the box says you will see results within \\&quot;less than an hour.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This is a big mess!!!</li>
            <li> I also wear self tanner daily since I look really pasty and sickly without a tan.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- easy-to-use without the goopy mess of lotions, creams, gels and foams</li>
            <li> Is about fourteen dollars on amazon and the bottle lasts me a few weeks, although I have to use it every or every other day!</li>
            <li> I am having a little issue with it though.  </li>
            <li> and it works wonders for me when I need a little pick me up.</li>
            <li> I usually wait every other week</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t lay in the sun or go to tanning beds, but I like a little color to my legs in the summer</li>
            <li> I wear gloves when applying self-tanning products to protect my artificial nails from being discolored - the towelettes work much easier with gloves that using lotion.  </li>
            <li> I apply for a few days in a row and then about once ever five days.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I already have uneven skin tone</li>
            <li> but the color still seemed uneven.</li>
            <li> but I air dried for 10 just in case).</li>
            <li> A Few Days Ago.</li>
            <li> I found this worked faster on parts of my body that had already had some sun exposure within a few months.</li>
            <li> I have been in sun a few times this year, have some color on my arms</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 45 and have a few on my arms.</li>
            <li> it also came within a few days just like it said</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the others.</li>
            <li> I use them year round for an even glow.  </li>
            <li> I usually go into these reviews with at least a partial sense that I am subject to committing user error.</li>
            <li> just plain me like the messy..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too orange on my pale, Northern Scandinavian skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally pale with a blue-gray undertone and freckly (think julianne Moore) and it works for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a naturally pale self tanning junkie and have used everything.</li>
            <li> I have pale skin</li>
            <li> it was very easy to see horrible streaks &amp; blotchy color all over the place.  </li>
            <li> The product streaks badly and the color is very intense....</li>
            <li> I tried rubbing in thoroughly the first time in circular motions with bad results..</li>
            <li> Well the packaging that it is mailed in, not a good idea, it crushed the box the item is packaged in, and the product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple lotions in the past, which never seemed to make a difference on my pale skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure why</li>
            <li> I usually put it on at bedtime and shower it off in the morning, putting my bed sheets at risk of discoloration.</li>
            <li> My tan came out with small streaks</li>
            <li> then the $10 I usually pay and for 6 weeks of tanning</li>
            <li> I like the towelettes because I can ensure that I hit all spots on my body as opposed to the spray, where sometimes I miss a small area.</li>
            <li> Then I decided to try it again and absolutely no more streaks on my legs.</li>
            <li> I usually apply it 3 or 4 days in a row to build to the color I want, then 2-3 times a week to maintain the color.</li>
            <li> My feet are orange, my legs are orange and streaky, and I still smell HORRIBLE from the \\&quot;citrus scent,\\&quot; which is actually only citrus when you are first putting it on.</li>
            <li> this the only fake tanning stuff I will use.  </li>
            <li> I recommend that you put a small sticker on the section you use as you go along to prevent mixing up which sides you have used and which ones you have not.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure).  </li>
            <li> I also use this on my face because Im too lazy to wear makeup.</li>
            <li> it it highly noticeable and almost impossible to eliminate with an additional application.  </li>
            <li> Been buying this item over the counter for past year, hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I too carefully applied the towel evenly over my entire body only to wake up to a horrible smell and orange blotchy streaky skin.</li>
            <li> The easiest least messy bronzer!</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of different self-tanner products in the past, this one is by far the worst!</li>
            <li> It is hard to judge if you got every area because there isn&#x27;t a tinting solution.</li>
            <li> hardly any color after using two towels and in two days the color is gone</li>
            <li> Hard to tell where it is with no color.</li>
            <li> Produces a hardly noticeable tan.</li>
            <li> For my belly and mid-back, I ended up cutting one towlette into 3 pieces and only applying to those sections for 2 days (3 applications).</li>
            <li> big disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Go slow.</li>
            <li> It wears off slowly and evenly throughout the week.  </li>
            <li> I really hate wasting money, but will be throwing the whole box in the trash.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive compared to other ways for self tanning</li>
            <li> You will understand what I mean</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I usually never recommend self tanner unless you have a base color,  </li>
            <li> I bought this product a little skeptical about how well it would work.</li>
            <li> They streaked really bad on my legs, even with the proper preparation before using.</li>
            <li> It does not have a bad, constant smell either.</li>
            <li> For example, I got a crazy bad sunburn in Mexico in April; the sunburned parts tanned with these, used in June, way faster (within one application) than other parts like my lily white belly, haha.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> If you go outside and look at it you will surely be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very convenient, but horrible smell.</li>
            <li> Was addicted to tanning and had five skin cancer spots removed.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any rub-off onto my clothes.</li>
            <li> When I woke up I seriously gasped!</li>
            <li> These wipes have a very unpleasant smell and makes your body stink until the next time you shower.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t look half bad.  </li>
            <li> I hated the way the color wiped off my skin on towels and washcloths and it was very hard to dry when I put it on.</li>
            <li> How could that be difficult?</li>
            <li> The tan also look really fake.</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> I used to use expensive Tan Towels</li>
            <li> how could you go wrong?</li>
            <li> needless to say that stuff ended up in the trash.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s an unfortunate by-product of the genre.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> You are basically putting it on blind because there is no color to indicate which spots you&#x27;ve missed or gotten.</li>
            <li> ahh what the  hell ill give it a shot.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, as my item was crushed.</li>
            <li> I hate saying anything negative about my \\&quot;tried and true\\&quot; brand, Loreal.</li>
            <li> am so afraid they will quit making it.</li>
            <li> Streaking on your body can and will occur unless you are very tedious and methodical when applying the product.</li>
            <li> worst part is that I am seriously orange.</li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t bad considering the convenience.</li>
            <li> It was orange and streaked so bad that it didn&#x27;t come off for two weeks.</li>
            <li> It smells bad.</li>
            <li> Still, I won&#x27;t continue with this product as the color is bad, steaks or no</li>
            <li> This stuff smells crazy too!</li>
            <li> Bad!</li>
            <li> Disgusting coloring!</li>
            <li> the results were awful.  </li>
            <li> having said that, once this starts to wear off, it makes you itch like crazy!!!  </li>
            <li> I smelled horrible the rest of the day and sitting at church</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED!!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Mixed feelings, depends on the package you get. Not sure why but sometimes this product does not even bronze . Others it works perfectly. I guess it has to do with the packaging date ( the towels are still moist but the procuct appears to have expired and no longer tans )</li>
            <li> I look so tan! Its fabulous and so easy to apply. It has a slight smell but not bad, compared to the older creams.</li>
            <li> I have found this to be the best product I have tried for self-tanning.  I use it mostly on my legs, twice a week keeps a light tan on my legs.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Use it 1 or 2 days a week.  Keeps me out of the tanning bed and it doesn&#x27;t streak.</li>
            <li> I too carefully applied the towel evenly over my entire body only to wake up to a horrible smell and orange blotchy streaky skin. Mortified is an understatement. I had to forego a pool party I had purchased the product for. One leg is darker orange than the other...I ve showered 8 times in 2 days and am still orange.  non streak my orange ass.</li>
            <li> Great item for quick tan. Does not smell and stays in place for 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen tanning sheets on the shopping channels but didn&#x27;t believe they worked as easily as they said - WITHOUT STREAKING - until I tried the L&#x27;Oreal Towelettes.  I&#x27;ve used the Sublime Bronze tinted self-tanning lotion for years, and these towellets are far superior since it&#x27;s so much easier to smooth the tint all over, evenly and quickly, rather than tube-to-hand then hand-to-body.  The color builds slowly over 2-3 applications but lasts about a week and fades fairly evenly, at least in my case.  One towelette does indeed cover face, upper body and legs.  Just clean your hands after application as with any tanner and even if a little too much color gets on elbows, knees, or something, it&#x27;s easy to even out the color by rubbing with a damp facecloth. The price isn&#x27;t bad considering the convenience.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and I thought the med would be dark enough for me. It was orange and streaked so bad that it didn&#x27;t come off for two weeks. It is hard to judge if you got every area because there isn&#x27;t a tinting solution. Would not buy again. Disgusting coloring!</li>
            <li> i have used these for years and always got good color...purchased from the drugstore.  this box from amazon is probably old or they have changed.  hardly any color after using two towels and in two days the color is gone</li>
            <li> I bought this product a little skeptical about how well it would work. I was pleasanly surprised. It didn&#x27;t work real well the first application, but I figured out what I was doing wrong. I&#x27;m fair skinned, but it gives me a good even tone. All I can say is this s--t works great!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Left my skin slightly orange. Color on feet and hands was sort of streaked.  Would not buy again. I might mention I have very light skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product many times, love the fact it travels with you, is not messy and gives a tan in a few hours.   Also doesn&#x27;t take long time to dry on your skin after applying and the smell is pretty good too.</li>
            <li> I feel like a narcissist admitting that I own a self-tanning product, but I have to say how good this stuff is. I&#x27;ve tried a couple lotions in the past, which never seemed to make a difference on my pale skin. These things though do a good job of actually making you noticeably tanner looking. For me, it takes about 12 hours before I will really notice the effects of an application and it lasts about a week. It&#x27;s not too orange on my pale, Northern Scandinavian skin. It&#x27;s close enough to natural looking for me to continue to subscribe to this product on a monthly basis so that I can avoid the sun&#x27;s harmful rays, but keep a healthy glow. To maintain a tan I would probably need to apply this every 3 days or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the downside, there&#x27;s the strong chemical smell that you have to live with until your next shower. I wouldn&#x27;t be comfortable wearing something with this strong of smell to a job or date. I usually put it on at bedtime and shower it off in the morning, putting my bed sheets at risk of discoloration. Streaking on your body can and will occur unless you are very tedious and methodical when applying the product. Every time when I rub it on myself I find that I miss a spot. I suggest having a loved one assist with putting it on.</li>
            <li> Love these! Start with face and work your way down, then put lotion on so no streaks develop.</li>
            <li> I just got these, tried it 2x, and loved the outcome so much that I already ordered my second box. It also works nicely on the face. The color is not orangey or fake-looking at all - seems like my natural tan color, and it gave me a pretty decent glow after only 2 tries (back to back).  No streaks (yet - I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be as careful and lucky with future applications).  My only complaint is that it has the same old tanning product smell that I can&#x27;t stand. The smell stays in your pores, still noticeable after your initial shower. I was hoping this would not smell as much since it&#x27;s not a lotion but it does. But I guess there is no getting around that. I still give it 5 stars. Buy it - it&#x27;s probably the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I stumbled on these one day at Target and absolutely love them. Simple to use, no mess, no staining, no smell.  Very nice, smooth, even tan.  Great price on Amazon - several $ less that at Target.</li>
            <li> These work great, no smudges, does not stain your hands at all.  The trick is to shower and shave beforehand and put a moisturizing lotion on immediately afterward.  Then about 15-20 minutes later simply apply the self tanning towel on legs (thigh and calf only) first then rub all over your legs, lightly running over ankles, toes and knees.  Repeat with other leg.  Then I use the rest of the towel on my face, neck... then I go over my stomach area.  Be sure to wash hands with bar soap and that&#x27;s it.  No smell - no smudges - looks good in sunlight, too.  I recommend using them twice a week - tan looks very natural and does not come off in spots at all like a spray tan.  It is also great to travel with as it is not a liquid (airline regulation issues).  I typically use one towel for the entire body, occasionally I&#x27;ll use 2 towels.</li>
            <li> Been buying this item over the counter for past year, hard to find.  Ordered extra to keep on hand.  Easy to use and I am a sun worshipper.  With the job, can&#x27;t get all the tan I want and this works.  Even my husband, who hates the sun, has a good \\&quot;tan\\&quot;.  Will continue buying more on line, even cheaper than in the stores.</li>
            <li> I have been using the much more expensive Tan Towels brand for several weeks, but I decided to give these ones a whirl.  The Tan Towels were just getting to be very pricey.  I found that these ones work just as well as the others! However, it seems like it takes a few more applications with the Loreal brand to get the same color as Tan Towels, but for this price that hardly matters.  Some may even think this is a positive, because it allows you more control over your tan.  I used these every night for 3 days and I have a wonderful natural looking glow.  Not too dark at all and not overly noticable.  These are great for us fair skinned folks that only need a bit of color.  I&#x27;m not sure you can call this a \\&quot;deep dark tan\\&quot;, but that wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for anyway. These take a bit of practice to use (since you can&#x27;t see where it is going on), but after becoming an expert with the Tan Towels, these were easy. Always use a circular motion! Also, I found that putting a little bit of lotion on my writs after application really helps with the steaking on my wrists (this was a problem area for me). AND, I wash my hands immediately afterward and use the MUCH lighter Jergens natural glow lotion on my hands instead, this also helps with the streaking factor.</li>
            <li> I have used these for a few yrs and found them easy, portable, dependable, generally effective and pleasant.  Now they have a &#x27;new scent&#x27; which is not any better than the original scent, AND the degree of darkness is lighter than I was used to.  Another \\&quot;If it&#x27;s not broke please don&#x27;t fix it\\&quot; moment.  I will try to find original packages in my local stores, not an easy task as it&#x27;s not widely carried.</li>
            <li> I am terrible at applying sunless tanner, but these work perfectly.  I apply for a few days in a row and then about once ever five days.  Love them!  I will tell you that when I apply, I go over the area several times with the wipe just like I would with lotion.  I am fair skinned and love the color that I get from these.</li>
            <li> Love this. Non-streaky. Good color. Recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff ! A bit expensive compared to other ways for self tanning but I think it works very well and is never streaky.</li>
            <li> Smooth, even color. Easy to apply. Sometimes I cut the wipe in half if I want to do a specific area. Other tanners do not seem natural in color, this one really looks good.</li>
            <li> These are fabulous.  They are easy to use, one towel can be used on your whole body, and the color is very natural.  I use them on my face with great results.</li>
            <li> Easiest way to get even tan. Be sure to wash off your palms!  Color is very natural.  I do think their effectiveness decreases over time.</li>
            <li> This is the best self-tanner that I have ever used, &amp; I&#x27;ve used self-tanners of every caliber &amp; price over the past 8 years. The application is extremely easy: just open one of the tanning towelettes &amp; wipe in a buffing motion onto your skin. Make sure your skin is exfoliated &amp; shaved prior to application. My advice would also be to avoid or very lightly brush over areas such as elbows, knees, ankles, wrists, etc as is the case with most self-tanners, but truth be told, this self-tanner is pretty much fool proof even if you cover those areas. It&#x27;s as simple as wiping a baby wipe all over your body... How could that be difficult? Also, the results are fantastic. Within a few hours, a deep, natural-looking tan develops. The color also LASTS- I only have to use one tanning wipe per week, so you really get your money&#x27;s worth with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this self-tanner for years &amp; I am constantly given compliments on how beautiful my skin tone is. The color isn&#x27;t too orangey or overwhelmingly tan, &amp; you are in complete control of how dark of a tan you&#x27;ll have depending upon the number of times you apply this product per week.&lt;br /&gt;Also, as a side note, this is great as a base color under other self-tanning products, in case you really want to amp up your overall tan with ease. When I am attending a special event &amp; want to look like I just got back from the Bahamas, I first apply this self-tanner, &amp; after it dries, I top it with a self-tanning lotion or a tinted spray-tan. The results are instant &amp; incredible.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone &amp; I hope &amp; pray that Loreal never stops making it! It&#x27;s incredible &amp; I have never found better.</li>
            <li> These are really easy to use and not messy. Just be careful to cover the area fully because you do get a nice dark at home tan with this product and if you miss a spot it will be noticeable!</li>
            <li> Great fake tanning product. 1 box will get you from that pale winter white skin to a luxurious tan - i usually use 1 towel a day for several days before the start of the summer season to give me a jump start on the summer tan. Especially when living in cloudy NW Ohio - and heading for a Southern spring vacation - you don&#x27;t want to be caught looking like a beached whale - or white enough that people need sunglasses to look at your legs when wearing shorts! The wipes/towels are large enough to cover most bodies. They solution on the wipes/towels does not stink and is pleasant - and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky (maybe just a touch). Just be sure to wash your hands off so your palms aren&#x27;t stained from using these. No streaking is evident from using them. Be careful around knees, ankles, and feet too - as the skin in those areas tends to color darker and more rapidly than other parts of the body! My wife has tried countless &amp;#34;tanning&amp;#34; creams - and none work as good as the L&#x27;Oreal tanning towels - and these are a lot less expensive too!</li>
            <li> This does have a smell after you put it on, which smells like a tanning bed to me.  I am going to try a lotion.  I have tried the loreal spray and am not crazy about that either because I worry about what else it is getting on besides me.</li>
            <li> I use this often and find it doesn&#x27;t streak and goes on well. I like using the individual cloths.</li>
            <li> I am a competitive ballroom dancer and most of my friends spend up to $40. for a professional spray-on tan. I got these towelettes and got better results!  In addition, it doesn&#x27;t stain or come off on the sheets.  You use several, over the course of a number of days, to get the darkness desired.  I tried Comodyne brand also, and the L&#x27;Oreal product is vastly superior.</li>
            <li> I have used these for special occasions and they give a nice smooth not - orange tan</li>
            <li> I tried these L’Oreal Towelettes last night and woke up looking like an albino tiger; super streaky and super orange! I have used a lot of different self-tanner products in the past, this one is by far the worst! I exfoliated before, made sure my skin was dry, followed all the directions/online tips and still didn’t turn out right. This stuff smells crazy too! I will never buy these again; I will stick to my Jergen’s lotion and professional airbrushes as these seem to yield the best/most natural results!</li>
            <li> These are the only self-tanner I will use. They don&#x27;t turn orange, and are easy to use (hard to get streaky lines with these). A single towelette does my entire body. A single application will make you a shade darker, perfect for a weekend trip or event, Wait to dry and apply another if you really really want to be bronze for the beach. The smell is fine, doesn&#x27;t get weird like other self tanners, though it will change on your body over time. Be sure to exfoliate in the shower before using.</li>
            <li> The color is decent, but I&#x27;ve tried and tried to apply it perfectly and it never comes out perfect. It smells bad. It&#x27;s IMPOSSIBLE to use on your hands and even though I&#x27;ve blended it perfectly smoothly its always blotchy in full spectrum light. I don&#x27;t know HOW THE HELL you could give this 5 stars unless your basing it off of your soft orange lighting in your bathroom. If you go outside and look at it you will surely be disappointed. I am not buying this ever again.</li>
            <li> Produces a naturally looking tan within several hours. Downside is that it has a tanning lotion smell but it produces great color and is super easy to use!</li>
            <li> Love these tanning towelettes. I don&#x27;t exfoliate very often and &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; every other day with great results. Great to use when traveling. No worry about messy liquids spilling as I&#x27;ve experienced with other products. Pretty tan color &amp; for me no noticeable smell.</li>
            <li> My tan came out with small streaks and I put it on my face and got tons of complements. The problem is though everyones like \\&quot;You got tan did you sprey\\&quot; and its iritating, I recomend doing it over summer or \\&quot;when you go on vaca\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have an automatice shipment order for the Loreal Self Tanning BODY towelettes, received correct shipment first time...this last time got the FACE towelettes....How do I make sure to get the BODY towelettes each time?  Is the a price difference and I&#x27;ll keep the face towelettes as I needed to use one box as BODY towelettes...PLEASE send me the BODY towelettes!!!!  I&#x27;ll pay for them.  The BODY towelettes are wonderful...I miss getting them....</li>
            <li> Love these towelettes!  They&#x27;re thick enough so they don&#x27;t ball up in your hand like the cheaper ones do and they give great color.  I&#x27;m subscribed to these so that I never run out!</li>
            <li> MUCH better than all the lotions, sprays and foams I&#x27;ve used!  Does not streak (unless you forget to apply to a section) or go on unevenly (even if you reapply to a certain area).  Dries incredibly quickly.  Very good color, but in the direct sunlight it stills looks a tiny bit orange.  Indoors, the color looks amazing and like a real tan.  Of course the hands are tricky to tan evenly, as with most product; I rub the towel all over the tops of my hands last and rub a cottonball soaked in rubbing alcohol on the fingers and palms of my hands to avoid orange palms.  This product still has that sunless tanner smell, but I&#x27;ve smelled much stronger odor in most other products.  For the price and how long they last, I&#x27;ll continue buying these!</li>
            <li> great product. no streeking or yellow tone.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin.  Used this last night following instruction, woke up this morning with streaks and big spots on my legs.  Okay, streaks I can understand because maybe I missed applying, but spots? How is it possible to miss such a big spot on my leg? OH,and my co-workers said they can smell the tanning lotion on me.  The tan also look really fake. I should&#x27;ve just used my neutrogena spray tan instead of this.  Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I am a white woman and I have had great success using sunless tanning lotions, so I figured I&#x27;d try this version. Big mistake- the results were awful.  The product streaks badly and the color is very intense....so if you miss a spot- it it highly noticeable and almost impossible to eliminate with an additional application.  Additionally, when the product starts to wear off, it leaves a &amp;#34;cheetah&amp;#34; pattern on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if you have an intense, golden tan already this product would be okay, but it&#x27;s terrible on white skin.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews while standing in the drugstore debating on products. These had the best reviews, and I&#x27;d used another self tanning wipe before, so I grabbed these. Seems about foolproof, right? Wrong. I used these after my spray tan had worn off on my legs and woke up horrified the next morning. I had streaks all up and down my legs. I&#x27;m having to use my airbrush legs to cover up the streaks. I&#x27;ve scrubbed and scrubbed, but I am still streaky. The rest of these went in the trash!! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> These are ok but nothing great. They streaked really bad on my legs, even with the proper preparation before using. I used three boxes of them. I hated the way the color wiped off my skin on towels and washcloths and it was very hard to dry when I put it on. I know most people seem to love them but I  don&#x27;t like them.</li>
            <li> It is pretty simple to use without needing much of preparation. It looks small but one towelette can give you a great color and without any marks and strong smells.</li>
            <li> All in all, this is a good product.  I am having a little issue with it though.  It seems that it doesn&#x27;t stay as well as it should.  I already have uneven skin tone and I thought that this would be good, but I end up having patches of color and patches of plain skin after a couple of days.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and easy to work with but needs to come in a deeper color and last for more than&lt;br /&gt;a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping to add some nice color to my pale complexion. I spent an hour prepping my skin (bathing, exfoliating, drying properly, adding moisturizer to knees elbows..etc) for my what(I thought)would be tan. I squeeze out a generous amount to apply to my skin.. and I see millions of tiny little sparkles in this \\&quot;lovely\\&quot; tanner. They are very very obvious, and honestly.. its not remotely attractive. Thousands of tiny little sparkles that don&#x27;t wash off in the shower are covering my body. I look like my 4 year old daughter that just spilled glitter all over herself. Next, I notice after applying that it is drying a dark orange color and that its flaking off! I had patches bigger than quarters flaking off.. and the areas that did not flake off were stained this creamsicle orange color. Great job L&#x27;Oreal! BUYERS BEWARE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned so I don&#x27;t tan at all. I have used self tanners before, these are ok. maybe it&#x27;s me but the color still seemed uneven. and didn&#x27;t last as long as other products I&#x27;ve used. the color does get dark fast and can be made darker by applying more.</li>
            <li> This product goes on easily and a only take a few applications to get to desired color!</li>
            <li> This was my first time ever using anything to fakebake. They were really simple to use and pretty forgiving if you missed a spot or put too much around the knees/hands/feet area. I would definitely suggest you shower, shave, and exfoliate before! I really like that the color doesn&#x27;t transfer onto my clothes.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this product through Amazon but like many of you I always look on Amazon first for reviews so I figured I&#x27;d leave my feedback here! A different name brand of the tanning towelettes was recommended to me but since I could not wait for shipping I decided to give the L&#x27;Oreal ones a try since I could grab them at my local store. These are very quick drying (probably dried totally within 2-3 min but I air dried for 10 just in case). I did get a streak on my leg the first time I applied but I was able to rectify it with the second application and truthfully it was probably user error, not the product. I did put a dab of lotion on my knees, elbows, and ankles before gently wiping the towel in those areas which helped with the weird coloring you can sometimes get there with over saturation. After 2 consecutive days of application (2 towels) I had reached a nice sun kissed look. No orange, no streaks. One towel truly covered my whole average sized body from neck to toe (did not use on face). My only negative is the smell, as with most tanners. It smells strongly and it lingers. I applied at times during the day when I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be leaving the house again before my morning shower because I felt the smell was a bit over powering, although my husband said he couldn&#x27;t smell it when I walked by or anything. But I think the smell is just something that comes with the territory with tanners! Overall definitely a wonderful product that I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I have tried several self tanners and I found this one to be the best.  It&#x27;s easy, streak free and does not have a &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; to it, which is great.  Also, as far as the color is concerned, there is no orange color.  It took two separate applications for me to get the color I wanted so this is a great value because I have 4 sheets left to apply other times.  Very happy I found this product.</li>
            <li> I know the tricks. Exfoliate. Go slow. Rub it on in circles. Don&#x27;t be stingy with the product, use plenty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It still streaked, and looked like hell. Giant swaths of white skin next to barely-orange &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; skin. I used them for one evening and threw the rest away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;0/10, would not buy ever again.</li>
            <li> These Tanning Towelettes Are Freakin Awesome. I&#x27;m Going To A Wedding Tomorrow And I Tried These Out A Few Days Ago. I Still Have A Great Tan Even After Showering. I Didn&#x27;t Buy These Here On Amazon But They Are About 9 Bucks At Target/Walmart. Go Get You Some Because You WILL Love It.</li>
            <li> Being fair skinned, I&#x27;ve tried many brands of self tanners for a number of years. I can say that these towelettes are the best that work for me!! They look really natural and I really can see the difference in color after just the first time!</li>
            <li> Works well, easy to apply and best of all it stays through showering.  It does not have a bad, constant smell either.</li>
            <li> I have used these tan towels for about three years now I just love them they are easy to put one and last really good.  I love them so much that I tell all my friends about them.  Will keep using them even in winter</li>
            <li> Very convenient, but horrible smell.</li>
            <li> Never buy it again get spots all over looks like s.... well not saying it out load what I think</li>
            <li> I just wanted to add a couple of observations here for the super-fair folk of the world:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I found this worked faster on parts of my body that had already had some sun exposure within a few months. For example, I got a crazy bad sunburn in Mexico in April; the sunburned parts tanned with these, used in June, way faster (within one application) than other parts like my lily white belly, haha.&lt;br /&gt;* For my belly and mid-back, I ended up cutting one towlette into 3 pieces and only applying to those sections for 2 days (3 applications). Now I&#x27;m about all the same color all over.&lt;br /&gt;* I followed someone else&#x27;s advice to use circular motions after exfoliating, and got zero streaks.&lt;br /&gt;* As for orange-yness: My skin naturally has very very pink undertones. This product creates, like many, more yellowish undertones of a tan. That can feel weird at first when you&#x27;re first looking at it, but it&#x27;s in no way orange.&lt;br /&gt;* Straight-up, I&#x27;m also not a daily shower-er, so I can&#x27;t vouch for how much fades that way yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One application and I&#x27;m pretty set for my little poolside adventure next weekend (in 4 days). Will update on fading, etc., when I return.</li>
            <li> This is a simple to use tanner with no mess.  Gives a sunny looking tan that looks completely natural.  Has a subtle smell that is inviting and short lived.  Absolutely the best tanner I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Great add in value saved 5 dollars from store price</li>
            <li> I saw a noticeable difference upon application, but it seemed to fade pretty quickly.  Perhaps if I reapplied daily or every other day I may see a huge difference.  Overall, for the price I think this did the job and I do like that you can see where you are applying as to avoid streaking.  This also did not seem to have an orange color as many self tanners do.  Pretty good product.</li>
            <li> I had a coupon and bought this for the first time at Target store.  I absolutely love this product.  It dries quickly and develops a bronze tan. You will notice color within an hour.  The gentle formula does not irritate or give me pimples on my oily and sensitive face. The towelletes are big enough so you can wipe your face and whole body.  I used to use expensive Tan Towels but these towelettes from Loreal are just as good if not better. I also quit using the spray tans at the tanning salons which are so expensive, and these days we&#x27;re all trying to save more money. Here&#x27;s how the towelettes work for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will use one towelette a day until you reach the level of bronze you want.  For me, I used 4 towelettes in 4 days on my olive skin, and I&#x27;m dark now.  So, to maintain that dark, deep tan, I use one towelette every 3 days.  This product does not have moisturizers so I highly recommend using a lotion that does not have any mineral oils in it.  Buy a lotion that is made specifically for people who use indoor tanning services (from salons) or self-tanners like this one.  I use Australian Gold&#x27;s After All Whipped Body Butter to maintain a beautiful tanned skin.  The towelletes do not have any strong smells and my bronzed body stays tanned for about 5 days.</li>
            <li> made my skin orange, and streaked, made parts of skin not tanned, had to wash off, and try again, not enough of product to use</li>
            <li> I have used self tanner for about 7 years and tried every brand carried by local superstores. I LOVE this one! I like the creams and gelee&#x27;s but the towelettes are easier, and perfectly cover your body in one use. I use one every Friday evening after I get home from work and then have a nice even tan for the weekend. It wears off slowly and evenly throughout the week.  This is cheaper then the $10 I usually pay and for 6 weeks of tanning... how could you go wrong? I wear disposable gloves for application and reuse them several times. FYI: If you notice the inside bend of your arms getting darker than the rest,  do your arms last so the tanner doesn&#x27;t build up in the crease from repeatedly bending your arms before the tanner is dry.</li>
            <li> I like the towelettes because I can ensure that I hit all spots on my body as opposed to the spray, where sometimes I miss a small area. The towelettes are easy to use and can be carried in your purse. No smell or residue on your skin left over. It&#x27;s infused with Alpha Hydroxy Acid which is a plus for your skin!</li>
            <li> This is the only tanning product that gives me a natural glow without streaks and smell. I&#x27;ve olive skin and it works wonders for me when I need a little pick me up.</li>
            <li> Best self tanner I have ever used. Easy to apply. Lasts for about a week.</li>
            <li> After skin cancer and lots of self tanners, I really like the wipes.  Odor is stronger than some of the other ones but for the money and once a week use, I would recommend this product.  Only suggestion is that you shower and dry at least 30 minutes before application.</li>
            <li> First, let me preface that I am a very pale woman with lots of self-tanning experience. I ordered this product after reading many of the reviews and wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect. I&#x27;m very pleased! I did two applications and the end result is a beautiful golden tan. It looks very natural, even though I&#x27;ve always had extremely pale, Polish skin. Don&#x27;t let the &amp;#34;new fresh scent&amp;#34; fool you. While the towelettes themselves smell lovely (a mild rain scent mixed with a little sandalwood), you will still have that maple syrup/nail file smell that all self-tanners posses. There is a learning curve here if you want to get a flawless look. Apply in a circular motion. Two applications will help eliminate any white splotches that you might have missed. Also, be sure to give a swipe to those tricky spots: elbows, hands, ankles, and feet. I avoided those areas and the difference is noticeable in sunlight. Next time, I will give those areas a quick and light swipe. I will certainly buy this again and use it weekly during the summer times.</li>
            <li> I love a tan &amp; usually start my summer with help from self-tanners, but always used the lotions.  After reading the reviews, I figured I&#x27;d give these towelettes a try.  Last night, I exfoliated, shaved and followed the instructions to the letter.  I then applied on my legs, chest &amp; arms. I immediately detected a very strong perfumy/self-tanner odor, but honestly if it worked, I would have been fine with it.  Next morning, I gave myself a once over and it didn&#x27;t look half bad.  Then I remembered a few reviews stating that what looked fine inside was a different story in true sunlight.  Well the same thing happened with me.  Not bad inside, but standing in the natural sun it was very easy to see horrible streaks &amp; blotchy color all over the place.  Like I said, I&#x27;ve successfully used self-tanners before but never a towelette.  And I never will again.  I really hate wasting money, but will be throwing the whole box in the trash.</li>
            <li> Love these!!!! I&#x27;ve been using them for years and highly recommend them. Much cheaper to buy through amazon than at your local drug store or big retail shop. I apply with latex gloves (otherwise my hands soak up the tanner while I&#x27;m applying elsewhere) and be sure to shower and exfoliate well before application (I recommend using a little lotion on dry spots like knees, elbows, hands, feet- to avoid uneven absorption of the tanning solution) let dry for a minute or two before putting clothes on. Works great!!</li>
            <li> I have tried two boxes of these things and no matter how I apply it or how long I let it dry, the next day I am a streaky mess! I can&#x27;t wear dresses as I look like I have impetigo! And good luck getting it off! After a week, it was still on and streaky, even after using body scrub!</li>
            <li> Love these towelettes.  Easy to use and good color.</li>
            <li> Have used self tanners for years, usually i get a nice base tan, they lay off real exposure and apply self tanner.  I like the towelettes they are easy to apply dry quick, and does not smell so bad.  I have been in sun a few times this year, have some color on my arms so I thought this would be a good time to start self tanning.  Applied towelettes on my upper arm waited till next day to see what looked like.  Not bad I have now applied on both complete arms, also put on my upper leggs, which are completely white,  Will see if color is good enough to be seen in public.  I usually never recommend self tanner unless you have a base color,  I am Blonde and Blue eyed pale face.  FYI if I do tan even  in the tanner I wear a 30 spf and never go more than 4 times i a year.  As when I am not applying self tanner with my routine I am spending all my energy &amp; money on creams to get rid of sun damaged skin.  Just want that clear, I don&#x27;t promote tanning beds and laying in the sun to bake wrinkle your skin.  If you don&#x27;t know to use it ytube does.</li>
            <li> did not like this, streaky, returned it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to stay away from the tanning beds.  So I use these once a week followed by some lightly tanned lotion daily.  These are great...no streaking and looks very natural.  And trust me...I&#x27;ve used my fair share of sunless tanning lotions and sprays.</li>
            <li> (read: I am not a jersey shore-esque self tanner junkie but rather a well informed sunkissed consumer. This type of information is important when reading tanner reviews)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These towelettes are a wonderful addition to my self tanning routine. I generally self tan on a Friday/Saturday night with a tinted product like St.Tropez and use these towels during the week to help maintain my coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Super easy application - don&#x27;t over think it, just make sure you wipe your entire body&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick drying - You can get dressed almost instantly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Convenient- I use them at the gym&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost- one of the best bangs for your buck at +/- 1.50 per tan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell- the product doesn&#x27;t smell much when you put it on but throughout the day you&#x27;ll notice the smell and if you workout before rinsing it off- whew&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drying- this really dries your skin out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application size- I wish it was 25% bigger because sometimes I feel like there&#x27;s just enough&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Note: Color: here&#x27;s the thing about self tanner color. It&#x27;s sort of like clothes some color work on some people abd some don&#x27;t. This color works for me. I&#x27;m naturally pale with a blue-gray undertone and freckly (think julianne Moore) and it works for me. As does St Tropez dark but not regular St tropez.</li>
            <li> I love these! Large cloth and easy to apply!  Great, natural tan!</li>
            <li> USED PROPERLY, I THINK THESE TOWELETTES ARE SUPERIOR TO OTHER MORE EXPENSIVE TANNING PRODUCTS. THEY DON&#x27;T LAST LONG BUT YOU GET TO CONTROL THE APPLICATION TO A FAR GREATER DEGREE THAN SPRAY TANS.</li>
            <li> Ok...at first when I was going to write my review, I was going to give it 1 star because it left a few very noticeable streaks on my legs. Then I decided to try it again and absolutely no more streaks on my legs. My legs are streak free and the tan is even all the way around and they look great. Just like a real suntan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now having said that, once this starts to wear off, it makes you itch like crazy!!!  When it&#x27;s starting to wear off it leaves like cracks from the tan and whoa do you begin to itch! Oh my god. I lhave scratch marks all over my legs. arms , and stomach from scratching so much. I must be allergic to it. So if you have sensitive skin, I would stay away from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I exfoliated to try to remove this faster but I had to wait until it faded on its own. Once the tan was completely gone, the itching stopped,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these.  In order for me to not get any streaks, I wipe it on and then rub it in circular motions with my hands.  It fades nicely as well.  Usually I use the Banana Boat one, but I have been loving these lately.  It takes me 2 to build it up to a nice medium tone.  If I want it even darker, I generally will put on the Banana Boat one on top of this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair &amp; this gives me a nice, golden, even tone. I generally have to use 2 towels each application but it dries pretty quickly &amp; doesn&#x27;t have the stench that some sunless tanners have. I prefer these to most of the more expensive boutique brands. Bought a fancy foam from Sephora &amp; turned orange...needless to say that stuff ended up in the trash. But the L&#x27;Oréal is cheap &amp; does the job.</li>
            <li> I like this form of self tanner because it&#x27;s easier to apply with less streaks, although you will still get some areas where the color goes on a bit darker.</li>
            <li> Better Self Tanning Solution</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried self sprays, gels, and hand tanning lotions, but this one is the best.  A bit on the high side, but if you want a tan overnight, just put it on before you go to bed.  If you know you&#x27;re not going out in morning, you can put it on then.  Takes only about 4-5 hours to show.  Repeat w/the same clothe (keep it in it&#x27;s pouch) and reuse until it dries out (I keep it in a plastic baggie which make each one last a week or so).  Recommend to those who don&#x27;t want to sit in the sun!</li>
            <li> This is a great item. I have used other expensive self tanning products and they rarely worked and if they did they gave my skin an orange tone, this one did not! Another positive about these towelettes is that they leave  hardly little to no odor which is a positive for me!</li>
            <li> These wipes work great!  I would recommend these to anyone.  They give a good glow and tan to your body.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful!  They take overnight (for me at least) to develop, but the color is very natural looking without the old &amp;#34;orangey&amp;#34; color found in some self tanners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After bathing and exfoliating my skin, I apply a generous amount of lotion to my elbows, knees, knuckles, etc... and area that tends to be extra dry.  I then wait about an hour for it to absorb, then, using rubber gloves (it doesn&#x27;t say you need to do this but I didn&#x27;t want to take any chances of my hands staining as has happened with other self tanners) I just rub the towelette all over.  You wouldn&#x27;t think there would be enough product to do your entire body but there is.  I start with the areas I want the most tan first (i.e. face, arms, legs) followed by the rest.  In the morning, I awake to a light tan.  I usually apply it 3 or 4 days in a row to build to the color I want, then 2-3 times a week to maintain the color.</li>
            <li> I am a fair skinned person and have been using self tanners for years. This product is so easy to use, leaves no streaks and is very portable to pack on trips! Does not have that typical smell most self tanners do..has a faint but pleasant scent. One towel does my legs and arms and by he next morning I have a nice glow! Love these!</li>
            <li> I am a tan-a-holic.  I can never be too tan.  This summer I have not been able to lay out.. at all.. And my friends know how much that bothers me.  So, I used these after my shower...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got SO many compliments about how tan I am and questions on how I have found time to lay out.  I can&#x27;t help but smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the directions--wash your hands afterwards and use sparingly on your elbows and knees.  I do use them on my face and have found no issues whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband used a wipe to get rid of his farmers tan, and he was amazed by how great they are.  Not even the slightest orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may need to by a lifetime supply of these...</li>
            <li> Tans you.  As expected.  Not messy like lotions but works at least as well.  Get this.</li>
            <li> These are the best self-tanning product. I have tried the gels, foams, and other towelettes from spas and department stores for several times the price.  These are so much better. One towelette will cover your whole body, including your face. If you really scrub the towel on your skin (like a wash cloth), there will be no streaks. Do your face last so that the color isn&#x27;t so intense. The tan will start to develop in about 2 hours. If you&#x27;re really in  a hurry, apply another one about 4 hours later. You will look like you&#x27;ve been at the beach all summer in about 4-6 hours. After applying, always wash hands, finger nails, and inner wrists well with soap. They make your skin a bit stinky, even after you&#x27;ve showered and when you start to sweat for the next 2-3 days. The color lasts for about 5 days.</li>
            <li> I ordered a more expensive &#x27;tan-towel&#x27; last month, but these seem to do a better job (a least for me).  After just 2 applications, people asked me how I got so tan so fast.  WILL purchase more!</li>
            <li> a nice color on. looks like a natural tan</li>
            <li> These appear to be old/past their date as they completely do not work AT ALL. Using them adds zero color. The same exact product I have bought at CVS makes a dramatic difference. I have now gotten TWO orders of these from Amazon that don&#x27;t work AT ALL.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a quick and easy tan. It isn&#x27;t sticky like some of the lotions.  You can get dressed within minutes and it lasts 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> I bought these for a girl I work with for Christmas. She can never find them. She has all of us looking in all of the stores for her. She will look gorgeous for New Years. Thanks.</li>
            <li> LOVE these - they are the best!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love them. Was addicted to tanning and had five skin cancer spots removed. So now can maintain a &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> really great product...have used for quite some time..it really covers well...no streaks..no freaky color  i love this product  will continue to use</li>
            <li> This is a big mess!!! LOL  I went by the directions and it left patches of white skin and places  i knew i had completely covered well. I smelled horrible the rest of the day and sitting at church i was embarressed!!! I do like their spray though!</li>
            <li> Great, been using them for years, and think they are one of the best.  When I want to use 1/2 of the towlette, and save the other half for another day soon they are easily cut into 2 pieces which make it alittle more economical too.</li>
            <li> All went well.  Nice item. It was what was recommended to me by a friend, and I&#x27;ve been satisfied with the way it works for a couple years now. No muss or fuss.  I will be glad to order it again when needed.</li>
            <li> I  like these toweletts for quick self tanning,The scent is fairly pleasant and not over whelming(a bit like you just spent the day in the sunshine).  They are helpful for travel use. But I do think one is not enough for full body use(I am a small person). So,I do feel they are over priced. But if you just want to do half your body for a quick touch up or use in tandem with the self tanning Gel.</li>
            <li> This is very easy to use. I take these along when I travel so I don&#x27;t have to carry a bottle.</li>
            <li> Love it wish the color was instant,however.</li>
            <li> I usually go into these reviews with at least a partial sense that I am subject to committing user error. In this case, I can&#x27;t lay fault completely to the product, but I will say that the biggest problems were not caused by me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the product does not anywhere say that someone with light skin couldn&#x27;t not use it. As it is the medium and not the dark, I thought I was safe. Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, it doesn&#x27;t have any suggestions for HOW to apply the color. That would be helpful. I read around that I should use circular motions, and when I got to it, I forgot and didn&#x27;t at all. That was definitely my fault. Straight up and down motions cause streaks. And boy did I get streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part is that I am seriously orange. And the box says you will see results within \\&quot;less than an hour.\\&quot; No way. When I went to bed (read: when I might have still had some time to correct things) it all looked good aside from one streak on my thigh. When I woke up I seriously gasped! My feet are orange, my legs are orange and streaky, and I still smell HORRIBLE from the \\&quot;citrus scent,\\&quot; which is actually only citrus when you are first putting it on. Now about 12 hours later I am still smelling like self tanner and I am lucky I don&#x27;t have to leave the house today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t purchase this from amazon, but felt that I&#x27;d like to share the review for those (like me) that come here first to check things out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually stupid at applying these things but this is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. Moisturizes the skin very nicely. I use two towels per application--one for my top half and one for the bottom half.  I need to do it about twice a week after I&#x27;ve built it up over like four days. The more regularly you use it the more even it gets and the fewer you need to use. It&#x27;s all about diligence, which is a drag, but hey, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not a spray tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, does anyone know how to make tanner not cling to my sun spots? I&#x27;m 45 and have a few on my arms.</li>
            <li> I love these towelettes! I am light skinned (but not pale) and have eczema on my arms that make them red. When I use this product it makes my skin tone look more even (as well as giving me a little color) and my eczema is not as noticeable. I followed another reviewers advice and made sure I shaved the day before using, and showered the day of, but let my skin dry for at least 15 minutes afterwards before applying the towelette to it. I also applied it in circular motions as not to cause a streaky look. Works great!</li>
            <li> these are the best wipes i think.  compare the cost to continuously going to the spray booth.  these will last you 1 or 2 months, just wipe down on friday&#x27;s for the weekend</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Thank you! A+</li>
            <li> these are the BEST tan towels! i&#x27;ve used much more expensive brands and always end up going back to these. sometimes two is needed to cover my whole body, but i really love the natural look they create.</li>
            <li> I love this product because: it doesn&#x27;t smell bad like the others, better, it doesn&#x27;t have any smell at all, it is easy to apply, you can use a rubber glove to apply it so your hands are clean when you finish, it&#x27;s great, I&#x27;m counting on it for the summer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a naturally pale self tanning junkie and have used everything. I love pricey salon sprays but can&#x27;t always find the time to get them. That said, these are the best things out there-they are easy to use, dry quickly, have a great tone and are portable. One packet tans my entire body (5&#x27;3) very well. SO much easier and less messy than sprays, they are easy to maintain (use 1 a day)and difficult to mess up. The only drawback I can find is that in the sun, the tan looks a tiny bit orange on me. Even my salon spray-tanner praised them for how well they maintained me between visits. They have a light spray tan smell-way lower on the spectrum than other products I&#x27;ve used-and even have a faint l&#x27;Oreal scented smell. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> When I first began using this self-tanner I was delighted with the product and bought a box or two wherever I saw it being sold.  I applied it every other day and was delighted with the increasing depth of my tan.  Then my skin began to look mottled and I spent a fortune buying every product mentioned in articles on removal of self-tanner  --  mostly abrasives such as baking powder and salt scrubs.  I went for two weeks without applying any self-tanner while it wore away on its own. I have resumed use of the product but only once/week.  I achieve a much lighter color but it does not \\&quot;curdle\\&quot; on me.  P.S.  This is by no means the only self-tanner that causes problems with repeated/frequent application.  I think it&#x27;s an unfortunate by-product of the genre.</li>
            <li> this the only fake tanning stuff I will use.  Everything else I&#x27;ve tried streaks or looks orange.  These are really great, I&#x27;ve used them for years!</li>
            <li> This is the very best self tanner I have used on my lily white legs.  I had given up on self tanners over the years because I had such poor success.  The toilettes are much easier than any lotion or spray I have ever used.  I used one toilette to cover both legs.  After a few hours I could see the color change and saw that I had left a small white streak on one leg.  It is important to make sure you cover every spot on your leg.  I waited a day and then used another toilette and covered that spot first and then finished my legs. You can&#x27;t expect miracles when you have very white skin, but these did give a nice color, especially after using the second one.  And my legs were not orange as with many others products.  I was pleased that the color lasted a week before all washing away. I did not &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; my legs when showering to try and keep the color longer.</li>
            <li> very streaky.. I tried rubbing in thoroughly the first time in circular motions with bad results.. then I tried lightly wiping the second time with bad results. I have pale skin and this left me with orangish streaks.</li>
            <li> This product actually works. Leaves a nice even tan that stays for a long time.  Only difficulty is remembering which sides of the towelettes that you used as you turn it often to expose another area.  I recommend that you put a small sticker on the section you use as you go along to prevent mixing up which sides you have used and which ones you have not.  You will understand what I mean once you open the towelettes and begin unfolding them to use another section.</li>
            <li> This tanning product works very well if you do exactly as directed.  I had a few packages left from last year and used them first before reordering; they were still good.  Enjoy!!!!</li>
            <li> easy to put on and stays on for some time</li>
            <li> REALLY WORKS WELL..........NO STREAKING!</li>
            <li> I am a user for life!  Seriously. This is an awesome product.  I am very fair skinned and this gives me a healthy, golden glow.  It&#x27;s really easy to use and if I happen to apply it unevenly, I can fix it with the next application.  It&#x27;s also not so drastic that you would realize I forgot to wipe it on certain body parts.  It blends very well.  Love love this stuff.</li>
            <li> They are awesome. Work great on your face for the sun tanned look, without the sun damage!!  Price perfect!!! Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I bought these towelettes at my local drug store, hoping to get some color before my vacation. Luckily, I only applied it on my legs and I have a couple weeks for it to wear off before I leave. As another reviewer said, it leaves streaks and it gives the skin an unnatural, orangish color. You don&#x27;t notice at first as it takes a couple hours for the color to start working.  When I first applied it, I noticed the streaks the next day. I applied more to see if I could blend it but, again, more streaks. Not only that but it has a chemical smell that they try to mask with citrus but it still smells bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, there are no instructions on how to apply the wipes. It doesn&#x27;t say to wipe in a circular motion and I had to search on YouTube to find out. Still, I won&#x27;t continue with this product as the color is bad, steaks or no streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you insist on trying these, here&#x27;s some advice: First, use gloves. You do not want to touch other parts of your body when applying this. Second, apply well in advance before your special event or vacation. If you don&#x27;t like it, then you&#x27;ll have some time for it to fade. Third, don&#x27;t put this on your face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying these wipes, I&#x27;m convinced there s no self-tanning product that is worth buying. I&#x27;ll just stick to getting my color the old-fashioned way (with sunscreen of course).</li>
            <li> Good tanning towel.  I used to buy the TanTowels Plus, but they changed the packaging and perhaps the formula.  It just isn&#x27;t the same.  So I tried these.  Better value than TanTowel.&lt;br /&gt;Update 7/10/2013: I have been using the Subscribe and Save, just love it!  Been looking very forward to my latest shipment for summer. It came yesterday!  Yeah! Well the packaging that it is mailed in, not a good idea, it crushed the box the item is packaged in, and the product.  I have always been pleased with the mailing package until this arrived, it must be a new way of mailing the items (to save on weight, etc. I am not sure).  Very disappointed, as my item was crushed.</li>
            <li> Being a mom of two kids I have no time to get that amazing tan I see all the ladies have.So this product works great its easy fast only thing is u may need two one for the upper body and the other for the lower.Also sometimes it streaks but to be honest I used so many kinds and they all do so I highly recommend this tanning for any busy moms who want to still have that nice healthy glow ..ya know moms still like to look good to &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Use this stuff all summer on my legs and feet. It looks more natural&lt;br /&gt;as a tan than anything I have ever used and I have used them all.&lt;br /&gt;I am so afraid they will quit making it. Was so happy to fine it on&lt;br /&gt;Amazon. Had it delivered to my door. Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> I bought these wipes because they were supposed to be easy to use and would not leave the tell-tale self-tanner odor.&lt;br /&gt;I exfoliated first and thought I carefully covered my legs and arms. The wipe was wetter than I expected and I couldn&#x27;t figure out whether to leave it folded or to open it out. The odor was minimal, but I was a streaky mess when the color developed. I think I will go back to a gradual tanning product and put up with the odor.</li>
            <li> This item really works!</li>
            <li> It tans well, but I wish there were some color initially when you wipe it on because it ended up a streaky mess, despite my trying to be really careful and consistent. Hard to tell where it is with no color.</li>
            <li> I like the towelette format versus the cream because I have more control over how much to apply. Very way to use with quick results.</li>
            <li> I do like the visual effects of this self-tanner.  However, the smell is overwhelming for me because I have a sensitive nose.  And the smell doesn&#x27;t go away at all until the next shower. Ended up throwing them out. Sorry. There is another product like this, more expensive but it works great and has virtually no smell once it dries.</li>
            <li> The easiest least messy bronzer! Nice even tanning.  I prefer the towlettes of this product to the messiness of creams.</li>
            <li> LOVE these  LOREAL BRONZE  TOWELETTES  - In fact, getting ready to order some more.  Easy to apply,,  no streaking... no bad smell.</li>
            <li> The sheets apply very easily with expected results. It has no nasty odor and dries on the skin quickly. I have even cut the sheets in half and find it has enough lotion to cover face, arms and legs, therefore doubling the product.</li>
            <li> These are amazing!!! Have become a staple in my beauty routine. I consider myself more olive skinned (tan very well in the summer), but the winter always leaves me feeling pale. Not anymore! I use one towelette and am able to do my whole upper body .. Face, neck, arms, chest, stomach. Since it is the winter and I am only wearing pants right now I do not feel the need to use another towel to do my legs, but will most certainly do so once Spring hits! I was hesitant about using the product on my face but I have had no issues with breakouts because of it. I apply this every Sunday and Wednesday nights after a shower. It dries quickly and I am able to put my clothes on almost immediately. I have not experienced any rub-off onto my clothes. The tan lasts a couple days. As with all self tanning products, use sparingly on your elbows, knees, ankles and wrists!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many brands of bronzer at high and low price ranges and gotten stripes, smears and every nightmare possible.  This is the answer for every sundamage concerned person who still wants a glow.  The wipes are large and loaded with plenty of product.  It does not smear or have a strong odor.  The price is much better than anything else I&#x27;ve seen as well.</li>
            <li> They cost more here than what I paid in Houston BUT I couldn&#x27;t find them in Houston in October...so I have no complaints.  And, for the ease of use, I think this brand is as good as any on the market.  I am sure my ancestors were nice people...but gosh, the must have ALL been super white.  I prefer a nice tan look year round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One just needs to use on clean skin, put lotion on any dry areas...and wait 10-15 or more minutes before putting on clothing.  I feel sure no brand is fool proof if excess amounts aren&#x27;t lightly rubbed off to prevent build-up in wrinkles...but I even use these on my face and use a Qtip to lightly run around my eyes where I have smile lines.  I also rub my dry elbows with extra oil before using...and rub around my toes and next to soles with a washcloth when finished.  Think of using these as a makeup application and there will be no flaws.</li>
            <li> I have used many self tanners in hopes of keeping myself out of the tanning bed in the winter.  This is by far my favorite.  As long as applied liberally it does not streak.  I REALLY like it because I can use it on my face without worrying about breaking out.  It also does not stain clothes or sheets like many other self tanners do.  The handwashing after you&#x27;re done is very important or your hands will have a funny color.  I have also found that after it dries, using lotion helps keep my skin from getting really dry.</li>
            <li> Like it as the color is natural and easy to use but not gave it 5 stars as the towelettes is a little thick so not easy to use and i also prefer the one that has some color to be able to see where we put. But in general i&#x27;ll buy again since the color is amazing.</li>
            <li> Work very well with no mess.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s a gradually growing &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; with minimal hand transfer (&amp;#34;orange palms&amp;#34;). Be sure to exfoliate and apply to dry skin and use even applications, going lightly over knees, elbows and ankles where the skin will take in more color. These wipes are great to travel with and produce a great color.</li>
            <li> Super easy to apply, great color, not orange, virtually no smell, and NO STREAKS!  Beats out the salon tans I&#x27;ve had too.  I used it for the first time last week (9 days ago) and still looks great.  It&#x27;s not greasy either.  Great job L&#x27;Oreal.  One wipe covered my whole body. LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  RECOMMEND 100%</li>
            <li> This is the first self tanner I&#x27;d ever tried. The directions are missing some very important steps. You must wear gloves! You also have to rub in circles or you will probably end up with stripes. And in most cases, you will have to use two wipes to cover your body. And that&#x27;s just me, I&#x27;m only 100lbs! Soo, when I spend about ten dollars for something I will only get a few uses out of, it&#x27;s not cool! But on the bright side, the color is very long lasting. It is sooo hard for me to do a good job and I would never trust this product to get me beach ready. You are basically putting it on blind because there is no color to indicate which spots you&#x27;ve missed or gotten. There is no way I could apply it evenly to my whole body. Luckily, my face always ended up looking nice! And this product SMELLS! Bad! I put it on before going out one night and I was so embarrassed by the odor. The color is not as believable as other self tanners I&#x27;ve tried. After using this I switched to fake bake flawless. The color of that is so much more realistic and it&#x27;s so much easier to apply. Is about fourteen dollars on amazon and the bottle lasts me a few weeks, although I have to use it every or every other day! Now THAT is a product that I could use and go out in my bikini! The only good thing about these wipes is that the color lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Love love love this!!! I have used different types of self tanners, including spray tans, and this by far is the best!!</li>
            <li> I used these as directed and discovered that they don&#x27;t work nearly as well as the L&#x27;Oreal cream self-tanning product that I have used in the past...big disappointment.  I won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
            <li> These wipes have a very unpleasant smell and makes your body stink until the next time you shower. They also leave a sticky residue for a while afterwards so you feel uncomfortable doing much. I bought a box and tried them 2 different times now, both times being very careful to go over every area and blend well. It looks good on the upper body/arms, but always streaky on my legs no matter what I do, and the color definitely looks orange in certain lights. I have found that the [[ASIN:B0017JDUFA TanTowel Self-Tan Towelette Classic 10 PACK]] is MUCH better! Very light smell that fades quickly, dries almost immediately, and very forgiving - no streaks or orange color, but instead a subtle difference that just looks like you were in the sun for the afternoon.</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED!!  I have been ordering these for years but the ones I just got must be old or something--they are not working!!</li>
            <li> The only suntan I get and the only product I ever use.</li>
            <li> so easy to use and even reuse if you dampen it.  spreads nicely and your hands don&#x27;t get all colored.&lt;br /&gt;love it!</li>
            <li> this seems like a great product only used it once and I already see a difference in my color.  it also came within a few days just like it said</li>
            <li> Good for instant color.</li>
            <li> I hate saying anything negative about my \\&quot;tried and true\\&quot; brand, Loreal. I have used their lotion self tanner for years with people asking how I am always so brown. When not using more expensive make up  and hair color lines, Loreal is all that I will use. However, their towelettes did not measure up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I loved was a product with finally NO smell! I loved the quick dry! I love the fact that you can travel with these. But...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tan does not stay long. It peels off if you rub your skin. I did not get much color at all. And most importantly, even though I exfoliated first and kept my skin moisturized, for the first time ever, I looked at my arms and could see my skin kind of flaking off, as if I hadn&#x27;t exfoliated. It looked incredibly dry and it was only a day later that the color was peeling off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems it just needs some improving and it will be a great product.</li>
            <li> Steve&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great tanning sheets....use them all the time!! I usually wait every other week touse another tanning towelettes, goes on smooth and tan looks great!!</li>
            <li> This product is easy to apply, but you need to put it on the day before you want the tan.  Natural looking.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd year in getting it and trying it out.- so far so good.  It takes a bit to apply it correctly. Wish it had SPF in it and then it would be doing double duty.</li>
            <li> I exfoliate daily so i dont think these these last for me.  I also wear self tanner daily since I look really pasty and sickly without a tan.  I do like that they are convenient and one towel is enough for my entire body.  I also use this on my face because Im too lazy to wear makeup.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and great results</li>
            <li> These are the best tanning sheets ever. I have tried so many. I don&#x27;t lay in the sun or go to tanning beds, but I like a little color to my legs in the summer so I can wear capris ... and sandals and not look like a snow woman.... These give you a nice even looking natural tan, no blotchy looking weird orangy color. I have tried some pretty expensive ones too and these are the best by far.. Don&#x27;t waste your money on the others. And the more often you use them the darker the tan. There is also lotion that goes with it to use in between. Nice</li>
            <li> I like this tanning product. Iv&#x27;e used it many times before, and still do. It provides a nice, deep streak-free tan. It tends to last for at least a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried SOOO many different self tanning products over the years, and this one is definitely a winner.  What I like about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- easy-to-use without the goopy mess of lotions, creams, gels and foams&lt;br /&gt;- nice, lightweight feel - doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling gooey or slimy&lt;br /&gt;- works well for body AND for face&lt;br /&gt;- develops into a fairly deep, natural-looking tan&lt;br /&gt;- has that typical odd smell when &amp;#34;developing,&amp;#34; but not as bad as many brands&lt;br /&gt;- reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;- non streaking (just be sure to exfoliate then use a bit of moisturizer on dry areas - like elbows, knees &amp; ankles - before applying the self tanner)</li>
            <li> This provides a good color and is streak free.  I have fair skin in the winter and after I use about 3 days in a row of these I get to a color I like and then use about twice a week to keep it up.  This works as well as more expensive brands I have tried and looks very natural.  1 towelette is enough for the whole body.  Just be sure to wash your hands carefully and not splash water on your arms afterwards or wear gloves.</li>
            <li> I wear gloves when applying self-tanning products to protect my artificial nails from being discolored - the towelettes work much easier with gloves that using lotion.  I still find it tricky to get even application but I think that&#x27;s more user error that a defect of the product :o)</li>
            <li> Produces a hardly noticeable tan. Use L&#x27;Oreal Serum instead</li>
            <li> terrific product works great.....get tan in a couple days</li>
            <li> i have been through so many self bronzer..its like a never ending battle. i tan in beds and outside but i used to not be able to afford tanning beds. when i saw this i thought..ahh what the  hell ill give it a shot. i didnt have high hopes for this but it accually looks good and and it is very cheap. i love how there towelets and ur more in controle then sprays or lotions..just plain me like the messy..i just think its so much easier.there is alot of self tanner on each towel so i can do my whole body in one shot plus u only need to do this about 1 or 2 times depending on ur egsisting color. but its easy to use,u dont have to worry about getting messy, makes a nice even tan. however the smeel sucks lol and it can make u not quit orange, but not brown eighter..so much more conveniant !! 4 outta five</li>
            <li> Love it.  Have used if before.  Amazon prices are better</li>
            <li> So easy to use and the color is quite natural. I&#x27;ve been using this for years and will continue to in the years to come.</li>
            <li> my wife orders these she swears by them and its the only brand she purchases and trust. from my point of view the tan looks real not orange at all and its worth the money especially if it keeps her happy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but my skin looks orange and streaked  it really didn&#x27;t do hole lot for me. I wouldn&#x27;t order it again my daughter likes myself not so much.</li>
            <li> It turned me brown, but did have somewhat of a yellow tone to it.</li>
            <li> I use these all of the time. The price is super and they work just as well as the ones that cost twice as much and cover half the area. Not the greatest odor but it dissipates.</li>
            <li> Good product...it works.</li>
            <li> If you need a quick tan these are the way to go. Be careful in application, as with any tanning product, it is possible to get streaks.</li>
            <li> These tanning wipes are a great product.  I have tried many tanning products in the past and this one is the best.  I use them year round for an even glow.  Very easy to apply, portable, and highly recommended!!  Enjoy:)</li>
            <li> Work great on my face and one of the few things that doesn&#x27;t break me out. I cut each towel into three and use one third at a time for my face and neck. That one third will last me about three times. I keep everything in ziplock bag after opening the pack</li>
            <li> I am very picky when it comes to my skin but this is one of the few products that leaves you looking sun kissed and bronzed naturally without skin irritation !  Awesome product</li>
