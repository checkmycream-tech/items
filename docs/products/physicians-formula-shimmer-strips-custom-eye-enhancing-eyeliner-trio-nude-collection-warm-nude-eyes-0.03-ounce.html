            <li>so far so good!</li>
            <li>Love the colors, goes on with ease and has pretty good staying power.......</li>
            <li>They go on very smoothly and easily.</li>
            <li>After about 6 hours they still looked pretty good, although I would probably would have touched it up some if I was heading out.</li>
            <li>color is perfect, just as pictured and last all day without smudging or running and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>pretty impressed with these eye liners and as long as they continue to work this nicely, I will be buying them again.</li>
            <li>applies easily and stays on all day</li>
            <li>Smooth and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap looking packaging.</li>
            <li>With that being said, these liners go on smooth and evenly.  </li>
            <li>When I saw these liner colors, I was excited to try them out.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and very pigmented.  </li>
            <li>I love that they are shimmery, but not 12 year old glittery like some are.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A set well worth your money.</li>
            <li>The colors are bold and exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>They are not to hard or soft and the copper/ nude color is beautiful!</li>
            <li>quality is amazing and is money well spent.</li>
            <li>It was my first try of the brand</li>
            <li>Nice effect with the various colors; no allergic effect although eye skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I really the bronze</li>
            <li>i have only used them twice and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>The lighter one doesn&#x27;t do much for eyeliner, but I have used it on my brows to add a little more definition.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product!&lt;br /&gt;Stays on well.</li>
            <li>These are the most creamy, pigmented, long lasting, smudge proof eyeliners I have ever owned!</li>
            <li>The copper color is a slightly lighter dupe for the Charlotte Tilbury Color Chameleon in Amber Haze - that&#x27;s the one for hazel eyes, but it also looks nice on blue.</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW.</li>
            <li>My eyes are so sensitive I don&#x27;t think anything I buy isn&#x27;t going to irritate them.</li>
            <li>I compared the pencils, they are exactly identical and definitely BLACK.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love these. Work as expected, colors were as described. Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW. I always thought the Physician&#x27;s Formula would be garbage because of it&#x27;s cheap looking packaging. Boy am I kicking myself now. These are the most creamy, pigmented, long lasting, smudge proof eyeliners I have ever owned! My Mac and Urban Decay pencils don&#x27;t hold a candle to these. I can put them on the back of my hand and wipe them a few seconds later, and they stay put! I am super impressed. Wore these for 12-hours and they looked THE SAME as when I put them on. Didn&#x27;t even use a primer. There&#x27;s a little sharpener on the bottom of the pencils that you would never know was there unless you read the packaging. The copper color is a slightly lighter dupe for the Charlotte Tilbury Color Chameleon in Amber Haze - that&#x27;s the one for hazel eyes, but it also looks nice on blue. Will be buying more colors in this line and repurchasing these.</li>
            <li> applies easily and stays on all day</li>
            <li> Nice effect with the various colors; no allergic effect although eye skin is very sensitive. I highly recommend the product!&lt;br /&gt;Stays on well.</li>
            <li> Love!  Smooth and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Love these colors - perfect for any mood.  Easy to apply and very pigmented.  The lighter one doesn&#x27;t do much for eyeliner, but I have used it on my brows to add a little more definition.  Would recommend!</li>

This is a waste of money, don&#x27;t buy this product here if you want the trio.</li>
            <li> When I saw these liner colors, I was excited to try them out. They go on very smoothly and easily. They also lasted a long time. After about 6 hours they still looked pretty good, although I would probably would have touched it up some if I was heading out. The colors look amazing on.There are tiny sharpeners on the bottoms of these, which I would have never noticed if I wasn&#x27;t looking for them and knew they were there.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty impressed with these eye liners and as long as they continue to work this nicely, I will be buying them again.</li>
            <li> this is the best eyeliner ever. It stays on does not smuge at all. My local store stopped selling it so hurray for Amazon!!</li>
            <li> The best set of eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely beautiful.

            <li> I love this. easy to apply, looks nice, easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product.  It was my first try of the brand and I&#x27;ve since bought more products.  Each pen has a sharpener on the opposite end.  It&#x27;s just a great product, excellent colors in this combination, easy application, and non-allergenic.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> A little frustrated this has to be purchased in a three pack as I only needed one color. That color then only lasted a very short amount of time. The eyeliner kept falling out of the pencil and before I knew it, there was none left. Loved the color and would purchase again if I had the option to purchase one color at a lower price.</li>
            <li> Love the colors, goes on with ease and has pretty good staying power.......so far so good!</li>
            <li> I really the bronze but they are all great colors for every mood!!</li>
            <li> My eyes are so sensitive I don&#x27;t think anything I buy isn&#x27;t going to irritate them. With that being said, these liners go on smooth and evenly.  They are retractable so that is a plus for me. I hate using a sharpener.  The colors are bold and exactly as described.  The color lasts about 6 hours and then need to be refreshed.</li>
            <li> These are now my go to eyeliner. They are not to hard or soft and the copper/ nude color is beautiful!</li>
            <li> These seem to work as expected. i have only used them twice and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> A set well worth your money.</li>
