            <li> Way Too Sweet!! Wish it wasn&#x27;t so sweet..&lt;br /&gt;I called to ask them why is this product so sweet they did not really have an answer for that. Mouthwash should not be sweet like that that&#x27;s a no no!&lt;br /&gt;I use the toothpaste though, I love it.. It is a really good product not the mouthwash..</li>
            <li> Problem with dry mouth syndrom? We have tried special washes to no avail.  It still burned. This is cooling and keeps the mouth moist with a very pleasant flavor.  I also use the same brands toothpastes and love them.</li>
            <li> Aurom&amp;egrave;re&#x27;s Mouthwash Rinse is an amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aryuvedic healthy components with neem and peelu are fluoride-free, gluten-free, paraben-free, without artificial coloring or bleaches nor any animal cruelty.</li>
            <li> Love it. Just what i needed.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is not very astringent, but it is \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; tasting.  It is very pleasant to me.  The peppermint flavor is predominant, but not too excessive like some others.  Keeps my mouth healthy.</li>
            <li> Leaves my mouth feeling clean. I can&#x27;t think of words to describe the flavor/smell but I like both for sure. I been using this, their liquorice toothpaste and weleda salt toothpaste and recieved a clean bill of health for my once troubled gums. The dentist had been threatening me with the invasive gum wash if their health didnt improve so bullet dodged.</li>
            <li> Auromere mouthwash is a delight to use and I really mean that, plus you know you are using ingredients that are helpful and healing for your teeth, gums and breath.</li>
            <li> not great tasting but part of my oil pulling routine?</li>
            <li> This a good alternative to other mouth washes that contain fluoride and alcohol. With its ingredient it will not burn.</li>
            <li> Make my mouth feel so fresh</li>
            <li> This is one of my all-time favorite personal care products. It&#x27;s chock full of amazing herbs, tastes good, makes my mouth feel clean, and even holds at bay toothaches (I don&#x27;t have great teeth). No alcohol, no ingredients that react with fillings, no sting ....it&#x27;s absolutely fantastic. When I feel a toothache coming on I swish with this a couple of extra times, making sure it soaks the area and has time to absorb. Bye-bye incipient toothache! The herbal ingredient list in this is amazing, and the taste is pleasant.</li>
            <li> This is a good product if you have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it. It doesn&#x27;t work for me. Too sweet, which probably helps with more bacteria and fungus growth. Price is not reasonable.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this mouthwash and it does seem to freshen up my mouth and gums.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an ayurvedic mouthwash that wouldn&#x27;t burn my mouth from alcohol like some commercial brands but still leave my mouth feeling clean. This definitely fit the bill. It has a very pleasant taste and my mouth feels great after using it. The only thing I am not fond of is the cap design. It&#x27;s a bit awkward to pour this out without a provided measuring cup. But that&#x27;s a minor complaint in terms of how the product works.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Much more tasty than Listerine.</li>
            <li> Totally love it&lt;br /&gt;I have receding gums and it totally made me feel better after using it.</li>
            <li> Great Product works nicely no burning or aftertaste.</li>
            <li> Second time buying this on Amazon and will buy again here.&lt;br /&gt;Almost like an herbal licorice flavor. I use it sometimes in the morning instead of toothpaste - just swish as usual, then brush.&lt;br /&gt;I only ever use a half a cap at a time. It seems to be concentrated.&lt;br /&gt;It bubbles a bit too much for my liking when gargling with it, and I though about docking a star for it, but then again if anything was changed about the product I may not like it anymore!  So ~ a Five Star product it is. :-)</li>
            <li> great product works well smells good easy to use will be reordering sooner than u think thanks for getting it to us</li>
            <li> Glycerine is glycerine regardless of vegetable source or not. I just don&#x27;t get it. Why is there a need to put glycerine in ayurvedic mouthwash? I personally would prefer product without glycerin. Will take one star out for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TASTE/BENEFITS:&lt;br /&gt; I like the taste of this product and whether I use this mouthwash or not, my mouth stays fresh since I switched to ayurvedic tooth paste . So I could not really quantify or prove if using auromere is doing me any extra good.&lt;br /&gt;I will however monitor this benefits of with and without auromere and update my review in future for reader&#x27;s benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Future updates: (pending)</li>
            <li> Good for gum health, amazing results when combined with a water pick and toothpaste. Cronic bad breath eliminated, bleeding gone, teeth rooted stronger, guns are thickening weekly, receding gums reversed,  teeth are even whitening for me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been only using the toothpaste, water pick and then mouthwash twice a day. It&#x27;s really a review of all three. Brushing is fun now because it leaves me feeling clean all day due to the water pick. And I can tell when I forget to use the mouthwash as my mouth feels &#x27;happy&#x27; afterwords, idk how to describe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you uses this get a water pick, they work amazing together for a synthetic free treatment plan.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy mine on Amazon but wanted to say how great this product is. Mouthwash is filled with so much crap. Finding an all natural alternative is excellent. Plus it is very beneficial to your mouth health. I definitely recommend people try it, I recommend the toothpaste too.</li>
            <li> love this product, good service</li>
            <li> I bought this for an elderly relative with dementia, who we discovered, to our horror, was drinking regular mouthwash.  That resulted in blindness and may even be responsible for the dementia (it doesn&#x27;t run in the family).  Long story, but she became agoraphobic, and no-one would bring her alcohol, but no-one thought twice about buying her mouthwash, until we realized she was asking everyone to buy it and was going through prodigious amounts of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She needs mouthwash, it&#x27;s a battle to get her to brush her teeth.  She loves it, surreptitiously sips it.  I looked high and low for a mouthwash that was alcohol-free, non-toxic and might even have beneficial effects if ingested.  Not only has it appeared to have had no ill effects but her cognitive functioning and physical health have improved (e.g., healthy gums, lower blood pressure).  Tasty and refreshing (I use it too- gargle first with peroxide, then with this).  Great!</li>
            <li> I have been using Auromere Mouth wash for 30 days.  My dentist says the tissue around the gums looks healthier and is doing a better job of sealing the base of the teeth where they enter the jaw bone.  I will continue to comment as I learn more from my Hygenist and Dentist</li>
            <li> the pleasant taste, and the combination of ingredients do the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is nice to  dilute with a bit of water and make a purse size and carry with you for the day away from home!</li>
