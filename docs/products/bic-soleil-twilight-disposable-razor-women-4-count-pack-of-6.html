            <li>, now that&#x27;s a great razor!  </li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t perfect, but they are the best for the money I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>If you have anything more than a day or two of stubble, the blade will clog!!!</li>
            <li>These are the best razors for a great price.</li>
            <li>hence my purchasing them online with good ole Amazon!</li>
            <li>to the wise, do NOT buy these!</li>
            <li>If they do this, I would be happy to give it another try.</li>
            <li>and I was a happy camper.  </li>
            <li>I was delighted by the lavender scent.  </li>
            <li>and I knew worked, just because I had a good experience with this brand before.</li>
            <li>I have loved these shavers ever since I started using them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I liked the contoured handle.  </li>
            <li>The grip is nice, it has 3 blades...</li>
            <li>My favorite.  </li>
            <li>It has a pretty good conditioning strip...but  4.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unless you have superfine hair, you can buy a better razor for the price.</li>
            <li>If they were exposed, they could be shed of hair rather easily.   </li>
            <li>But thats what u get when its you buy something cheap</li>
            <li>feel so smooth after shaving.</li>
            <li>It is always a clean, smooth leg.</li>
            <li>I thought they would be great as I&#x27;ve used other Bic Soleil razors before and they worked wonders!</li>
            <li>I decided to try a new razor from the four-pack, thinking maybe it would be better.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin with allergic reactions to most razors.</li>
            <li>I agree with the other reviewers when they say these razors cut up your skin pretty good.</li>
            <li>The sad thing is that this razor could be great!</li>
            <li>I implore the Soleil people to reform this razor with better blades and exposure in the back, so the hair can be washed out.</li>
            <li>Would rather have pretty legs than a pretty razor.</li>
            <li>With the first use, everything was going pretty well.</li>
            <li>Since these razors are given the title \\&quot;Twilight\\&quot;, I guess it&#x27;s only appropriate</li>
            <li>Oddly enough they also dull quickly - which makes shaving hazardous even more.</li>
            <li>I bought them on sale and did a little dance since I didn&#x27;t have to use razors from the Dollar Tree, but Holy Mary Mother of Shaving even theirs are better than these!</li>
            <li>There are no lubricating strips at all, so the extra price versus an original bic is for a pretty smelling handle.</li>
            <li>I will never purchase these particular razors again!</li>
            <li>And doesn&#x27;t shave very well.</li>
            <li>I think that explains why a lot of people report problems with them, but after that initial learning curve these are great, no more cuts, and I find that the angle for these is a a bit more ergonomic than I&#x27;ve found in other razors.</li>
            <li>The razor filled up with hairs very fast and it&#x27;s hard to clean out of the blades.</li>
            <li>But tonight I tried another brand new one out of the package and tore up my armpit, too!</li>
            <li>I could care less about the scents, but I will gladly go to another store if they don&#x27;t have my brand -</li>
            <li>I think I sacrified more blood to the Soleil razor than I did to the Red Cross!</li>
            <li>I am a normal American gal with stardard shaving issues - no heavy duty hair, just dark with a fair texture.  </li>
            <li>I bought them again a few weeks ago thinking \\&quot;surely they have improved these.</li>
            <li>I decided to give a new razor out of the pack a try.  </li>
            <li>Which doesn&#x27;t do much because without a pivoting head, you&#x27;re gripping a bad blade firmer which leads to more cuts around ankles and knees.</li>
            <li>There is nothing that sets this apart from the flimsy original bic disposables other than the fancy handle.</li>
            <li>This brand works fantastically for my 12 year old daughter and me, without any nicks or cuts!</li>
            <li>Yes, they are sharp and nicks are the result of a slight sideways motion, but I love the shave!</li>
            <li>With legs and pits full of hairy stubble, I eagerly shaved, very carefully.</li>
            <li>My pits developed a razor burn / abrasion.  </li>
            <li>Soft.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I really wish I could of gotten my money back, but it&#x27;s just $6.00.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a big difference, other than weight and heavier plastic, between the actual razor part on this and the cheap razors.</li>

            <li> I am so passionate about my hatred of these razors that I came to write a review on them even though I technically did not buy them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> (Full disclosure, I have thick, dark</li>
            <li> I think this was because the blades are closed off in the back of the razor.</li>
            <li> .. will NEVER buy there or any other french product again!!!!</li>
            <li> The design of the razor is such that the blades barely get past the design to shave the hair.  </li>
            <li> Leaves me cuts and rashes even when i try and shave slow and steady..</li>
            <li> The blade moved a little on the handle, which made me pretty afraid, so I used another one more time, no better, so I decided to never use these blades again, ever!</li>
            <li> that using one create&#x27;s a vampire&#x27;s wet dream.</li>
            <li> I take my time when i shave, I&#x27;m always careful.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> Instead, I felt trapped in the shower with a pretty little razor that had no intentions of getting rid of hair, but instead, wanted to chew off the skin of my legs by nicking and scratching no matter how slowly or delicately I handled</li>
            <li> Bic should stick to pens; I&#x27;ll stick to Venus or any other razor I can find.</li>
            <li> I have tried plenty other shavers not even the costly ones do what this shaver does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got down to my ankle and it literally cut a one-and-a-half inch strip of my skin like a potato peeler.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like I was in a hurry; I shaved very carefully, used soap and then shaving cream, but nothing stopped this razor from butchering every inch of skin that I attempted to shave!  </li>
            <li> If you want your legs to look like you&#x27;re a meth addict, like you enjoy being morse-coded with scabs, or just in general like a trashy nasty mess, then by all means, get them.</li>
            <li> Not a clean shave at all.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have this issue with the four-bladed razors by the same company, but on the same note, I&#x27;ve never even cut myself up this bad when I was 13 using a man&#x27;s single blade</li>
            <li> There have been a few times</li>
            <li> The hair was still there, my legs were not smooth, my underarms, well, still there ladies.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve randomly tried other razors, and I keep coming back to these.  </li>
            <li> I naively thought the fact that they each had triple blades would cut down my shaving time to 1/3 the time.</li>
            <li> Definitely not safe to use and will cut your legs to shreds.  </li>
            <li> Shaving for me is usually a breeze.  </li>
            <li> The blades also seem to dull</li>
            <li> No matter what I do these shavers cut at least 3 times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been forced to use an inferior brand in a pinch</li>
            <li> I am a very cautious shaver - I really go slowly and take care since I hate cuts.</li>
            <li> It is still fleshy a few days later :(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I do differently than the reviews above, but I do know I&#x27;ve had a lifetime of miserable shaving results until I found these.</li>
            <li> I used one of the razors for the first time and it was horrible!</li>
            <li> These razors are awful, really tore up my legs with them.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is the worse one yet for me to try on my legs..</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with these razors that I am on here reviewing these to warn other women.</li>
            <li> --Sorry</li>
            <li> about the grotesque imagery, but understand that I just don&#x27;t want this to happen to you.</li>
            <li> This is a very, very mediocre razor.</li>
            <li> I bought these razors years ago and they gave me bad razor burn.</li>
            <li> The razors are just about as bad as the series they share a name with, but that&#x27;s another story.&lt;br</li>
            <li> thought maybe I&#x27;d just gotten one bad one when I cut my legs to bloody bits, so I tossed it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Soleil razor and it cut my underarm BADLY!  </li>
            <li> The worst razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> WORST.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give a close shave, and it leaves horrible cuts and scratches.  </li>

            <li> I was fooled into purchasing these by the slick packaging design, the pretty colors and the promise of lavender scented handles. I naively thought the fact that they each had triple blades would cut down my shaving time to 1/3 the time. Instead, I felt trapped in the shower with a pretty little razor that had no intentions of getting rid of hair, but instead, wanted to chew off the skin of my legs by nicking and scratching no matter how slowly or delicately I handled it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and purchase another razor.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this razor because of the name, Soleil, which is French for \\&quot;sun.\\&quot; I finally bought a four-pack of the lavender scented razors. With legs and pits full of hairy stubble, I eagerly shaved, very carefully. The following events occurred:  1. I was delighted by the lavender scent.  2. I liked the contoured handle.  3. It has a pretty good conditioning strip...but  4. I nicked and cut myself multiple times.  5. My pits developed a razor burn / abrasion.  6. Blood proceeded to gush out of my vulneralbe leg and pit flesh.  7. It&#x27;s not like I was in a hurry; I shaved very carefully, used soap and then shaving cream, but nothing stopped this razor from butchering every inch of skin that I attempted to shave!  8. The razor filled up with hairs very fast and it&#x27;s hard to clean out of the blades. I tried putting it in the steam of my shower water and even swished it vigorously in standing water--to no avail. I think this was because the blades are closed off in the back of the razor. If they were exposed, they could be shed of hair rather easily.   9. I decided to try a new razor from the four-pack, thinking maybe it would be better. The blade moved a little on the handle, which made me pretty afraid, so I used another one more time, no better, so I decided to never use these blades again, ever! NEVER EVER!  I think I sacrified more blood to the Soleil razor than I did to the Red Cross! I have gone back to my husband&#x27;s Gilletee Fusion, now that&#x27;s a great razor!  The sad thing is that this razor could be great! I implore the Soleil people to reform this razor with better blades and exposure in the back, so the hair can be washed out. If they do this, I would be happy to give it another try. Until that time, I will either become a female bigfoot or just use another razor!

            <li> There is nothing that sets this apart from the flimsy original bic disposables other than the fancy handle. Which doesn&#x27;t do much because without a pivoting head, you&#x27;re gripping a bad blade firmer which leads to more cuts around ankles and knees. There are no lubricating strips at all, so the extra price versus an original bic is for a pretty smelling handle. Would rather have pretty legs than a pretty razor.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers when they say these razors cut up your skin pretty good. With the first use, everything was going pretty well. I got down to my ankle and it literally cut a one-and-a-half inch strip of my skin like a potato peeler. Blood was everywhere! It is still fleshy a few days later :( --Sorry about the grotesque imagery, but understand that I just don&#x27;t want this to happen to you. Bic should stick to pens; I&#x27;ll stick to Venus or any other razor I can find.</li>
            <li> I have been a LONG-TIME user of the BIC Soleil twilight triple razor. I could care less about the scents, but I will gladly go to another store if they don&#x27;t have my brand - hence my purchasing them online with good ole Amazon! I have extremely sensitive skin with allergic reactions to most razors. I found these razors a couple of years ago. There have been a few times I&#x27;ve been forced to use an inferior brand in a pinch and I end up with legs on fire. I don&#x27;t know what I do differently than the reviews above, but I do know I&#x27;ve had a lifetime of miserable shaving results until I found these. I think it is the aloe lube strip that might make the difference. Yes, they are sharp and nicks are the result of a slight sideways motion, but I love the shave! It is always a clean, smooth leg. Soft.</li>
            <li> If you want to bleed out in the shower, these are the razors for you</li>
            <li> This is a very, very mediocre razor. The grip is nice, it has 3 blades... And doesn&#x27;t shave very well. (Full disclosure, I have thick, dark hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something about the design makes this razor susceptible to &amp;#34;clogging.&amp;#34; Once the blades are clogged with hair, it doesn&#x27;t shave anymore. If you have anything more than a day or two of stubble, the blade will clog!!! The blades also seem to dull fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you have superfine hair, you can buy a better razor for the price. I&#x27;d recommend the men&#x27;s Hybrid 3 over this.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Soleil razor and it cut my underarm BADLY!  Contacted Bic and they blew me off!  thats the French for you.. will NEVER buy there or any other french product again!!!!</li>
            <li> I am a very cautious shaver - I really go slowly and take care since I hate cuts. No matter what I do these shavers cut at least 3 times. Oddly enough they also dull quickly - which makes shaving hazardous even more. I don&#x27;t see a big difference, other than weight and heavier plastic, between the actual razor part on this and the cheap razors. Given that I won&#x27;t purchase these again. I recommend you look elsewhere as well given the cost.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t perfect, but they are the best for the money I&#x27;ve found.  I&#x27;ve randomly tried other razors, and I keep coming back to these.  I have really sensitive skin and these don&#x27;t seem to cause irritation.  They don&#x27;t pivot (which I actually prefer) and you do have to hold them at a slightly different angle than a 2 blade razor if you don&#x27;t want to cut yourself.  I think that explains why a lot of people report problems with them, but after that initial learning curve these are great, no more cuts, and I find that the angle for these is a a bit more ergonomic than I&#x27;ve found in other razors.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the reviews on here prior to purchasing these at a local store.  I have scars all over both legs from using these.  Definitely not safe to use and will cut your legs to shreds.  Not only that, within one day, legs were already stubby.  Not a clean shave at all.  They don&#x27;t even deserve one star.</li>
            <li> These razors are awful, really tore up my legs with them.  I didn&#x27;t get a close shave at all and they gave me razor burn.  The worst razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> These razor gave me razor burn....did not like</li>
            <li> These are the best razors for a great price. They dont irritate.</li>
            <li> I am a normal American gal with stardard shaving issues - no heavy duty hair, just dark with a fair texture.  Shaving for me is usually a breeze.  I am so disappointed with these razors that I am on here reviewing these to warn other women. These razors do not work.  The design of the razor is such that the blades barely get past the design to shave the hair.  I went through my entire shaving ritual in the shower as I always do - and was just flabbergasted when I took a closer look in the mirror.  The hair was still there, my legs were not smooth, my underarms, well, still there ladies.  JUST DON&#x27;T BUY THESE.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THEM AT ALL.  Five minutes with a Gillette and I was a happy camper.  I will never by these Bic Soleil Razors again.  Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did.  Bye for now.  T</li>
            <li> It gets the hair off in all the places you do not want it!!!</li>
            <li> I bought these razors years ago and they gave me bad razor burn. I bought them again a few weeks ago thinking \\&quot;surely they have improved these. There&#x27;s no way they would still be on the market if they were still that bad.\\&quot; Well they are. The only reason I got them was because I needed something and had a coupon. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> This shaver is the worse one yet for me to try on my legs.. Leaves me cuts and rashes even when i try and shave slow and steady.. But thats what u get when its you buy something cheap</li>
            <li> My favorite.  Cheaper than Wal M.</li>
            <li> Since these razors are given the title \\&quot;Twilight\\&quot;, I guess it&#x27;s only appropriate that using one create&#x27;s a vampire&#x27;s wet dream. The razors are just about as bad as the series they share a name with, but that&#x27;s another story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought maybe I&#x27;d just gotten one bad one when I cut my legs to bloody bits, so I tossed it. But tonight I tried another brand new one out of the package and tore up my armpit, too! The &#x27;lubricant&#x27; is non-existent, which doesn&#x27;t pair well at all with the booby trap triple blades. I don&#x27;t have this issue with the four-bladed razors by the same company, but on the same note, I&#x27;ve never even cut myself up this bad when I was 13 using a man&#x27;s single blade disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word to the wise, do NOT buy these!</li>
            <li> This brand works fantastically for my 12 year old daughter and me, without any nicks or cuts!</li>
            <li> These razors are THE. WORST. RAZORS. I. HAVE. EVER. USED. IN. MY. LIFE.&lt;br /&gt;I literally have SCARS from them. I take my time when i shave, I&#x27;m always careful. That doesn&#x27;t matter with these. They will tear you up! BEWARE!</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it. My daughter is picky but likes these</li>
            <li> I purchased these razors at dollar general for about $6.00. I thought they would be great as I&#x27;ve used other Bic Soleil razors before and they worked wonders! I chose these over the off brand razors that were cheaper and I knew worked, just because I had a good experience with this brand before. I used one of the razors for the first time and it was horrible! It doesn&#x27;t give a close shave, and it leaves horrible cuts and scratches.  I decided to give a new razor out of the pack a try.  I shaved my legs and it looked as though a lion attacked my legs in the shower.  I will never purchase these particular razors again! I really wish I could of gotten my money back, but it&#x27;s just $6.00. However, these need to be taken off the market!</li>
            <li> I am so passionate about my hatred of these razors that I came to write a review on them even though I technically did not buy them on Amazon. I bought them on sale and did a little dance since I didn&#x27;t have to use razors from the Dollar Tree, but Holy Mary Mother of Shaving even theirs are better than these! If you want your legs to look like you&#x27;re a meth addict, like you enjoy being morse-coded with scabs, or just in general like a trashy nasty mess, then by all means, get them. I don&#x27;t know what metal the razors are made from, but I can only guess they are forged by demons from hell meant to collect blood for their master.</li>
            <li> I have loved these shavers ever since I started using them.&lt;br /&gt;I feel so smooth after shaving. I have tried plenty other shavers not even the costly ones do what this shaver does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUENO!!</li>
