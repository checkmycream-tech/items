            <li>This shampoo and conditioner are one of the better products I&#x27;ve ever used for dandruff.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t have to use it more then once or twice a week to still see the effects.</li>
            <li>but the flakes were still there after many washes.</li>
            <li>This is a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be glad.</li>
            <li>I love the way it leaves my hair feeling and smelling.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in love with this product.</li>
            <li>it was very think and did not smell very nice.  </li>
            <li>The smell of the product is not desired, however, it works pretty good.  </li>
            <li>The glossifier was good for first application but after one wear became quite greasy, not suggested for someone who wears 2-day-hair.</li>

            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel that it helped very much.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference from the first time I used it</li>
            <li>nothing brought scalp relief for more than a very short time.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend this product definitely, can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>I have not seen much dandruff in my scalp.</li>

            <li>This stuff really works</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get rid of my dandruff completely, but pretty dang close.</li>
            <li>The paste is new to him but he loves it.  </li>
            <li>Almost complete eradication of the enemy upon one wash!</li>
            <li>I even started to use on my 7yr old son.</li>
            <li>Through the years we have tried every natural and chemical option out there to soothe my husband&#x27;s itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li>Is exactly what I needed for my dry scalp.</li>
            <li>Worked really well on my dry scalp.</li>
            <li>His hair is short, straight, very thick and coarse but the paste keeps it feeling conditioned and more manageable without looking greasy.  </li>
            <li>so he switched to some different brands and was back to the old problems.  </li>
            <li>I have dry scalp and so far it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that works to help keep the dryness to a minimum.</li>

            <li> Helps dry scalp immensely. Expensive but worth it!</li>
            <li> Love it.....love it.... love it...since using Keracare I have not seen much dandruff in my scalp. I will continue using this product from here on out!!!!</li>
            <li> it was very think and did not smell very nice.  I didn&#x27;t feel that it helped very much.</li>
            <li> Staple product! I am a product junkie and this is the only shampoo that keeps my dandruff at bay. I even started to use on my 7yr old son. The conditioner has great slip and makes detangling my natural hair a breeze.</li>
            <li> Worked really well on my dry scalp.</li>

            <li> The glossifier has sulfur in it and am allergic to sulfur so it was a disaster to use it. Shampoo and conditioner are fine but the dandruff situation on my scalp didn&#x27;t go away. :-(</li>
            <li> Works great and not an overwhelming medicine smell on scalp. Conditioner works good leaves hair soft an easy to comb through</li>
            <li> very nice for itchy scalp</li>

            <li> This is a favorite of mine. I have dry scalp and so far it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that works to help keep the dryness to a minimum. If you have dandruff buy this. You&#x27;ll be glad.</li>

            <li> I had a bad problem with dry itchy scalp, i went through a lot of products that didn&#x27;t tamed it well until I did some more research and decided to try this product. I can honestly say that after using this for about a couple weeks my hair feels healthier I don&#x27;t scratch alot and my flakes are dissappearing. I would recommend this and I&#x27;m in love with this product.</li>
            <li> Love it! Is exactly what I needed for my dry scalp.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  The smell of the product is not desired, however, it works pretty good.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> liked the shampoo and conditioner... The glossifier makes your hair feel like you just put grease in it, makes your hair look like that as well</li>
            <li> A must have for anyone with dandruff. Almost complete eradication of the enemy upon one wash! Bottles are smaller than perceived but a little goes a long way. Left hair clean and shiny, healthy looking and not parched, but without the flakes.The glossifier was good for first application but after one wear became quite greasy, not suggested for someone who wears 2-day-hair. Next on to the 5-in-1 reconstructor....</li>
            <li> Was recommended by my stylist; does the job well!</li>
