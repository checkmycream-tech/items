            <li>I love the product but after shipping it wasn&#x27;t a good deal</li>

            <li>I love his stuff</li>
            <li>Great for edges for all my natural ladies</li>
            <li>Gives my hair easy, quick volume that doesn&#x27;t fall flat all day - that impressed me.      </li>
            <li>It washed out fairly easy in the shower or bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you need a strong hold this is the one to get and washes out easy with no residue... non-greasy</li>
            <li>Hold strong, no flakes</li>
            <li>This is the best hair gel on the market, hands down.</li>
            <li>and you get a huge amount in this bottle.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell, isn&#x27;t sticky, and doesn&#x27;t leave white flakes when it dries.  </li>
            <li>Came very fast  !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried $25 hair products on down and this by far is the best I have used.  </li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s useful for my needs</li>
            <li>First I did not believe it and tried to use more and more of the gel, then I tried to dry it with a hair blower, but there is no way that it will stand up.</li>
            <li>If you put the edge control on first and</li>
            <li>Beware it does have an icky texture but it smells great and holds my edges in place all day..#Laid</li>
            <li>Many of the people around me would ask what was all the white stuff in my head throughout the day.</li>
            <li>This gel is super-sticky &amp; holds my lazy waves into nice cute curls &amp; shape but the finish is very soft &amp; pliable, so I&#x27;m at a loss as to how this gel can hold spikes.</li>
            <li>It leaves a little residue the next day but just add a bit of water &amp; reapply its great</li>
            <li>I lasts all day through wind and some rain, and no matter how much I sweat.</li>
            <li>There is no way to keep the hair standing straight with the product.</li>
            <li>Good in both damp &amp; dry hair, though mostly I add it to dry hair in the morning - scrunch in the shape, fluff it up &amp;</li>
            <li>This product did not hold my edges down for more than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Freshly washed hair, applied and left to set up.</li>
            <li>This stuff doesn&#x27;t work well by itself on natural hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this stuff for my 9 year old son to &amp;#34;spike&amp;#34; his hair.  </li>
            <li>it holds well but still leaves my hair looking natural AND feeling soft &amp; touchable (but not combable of course, as strands are stuck together in pieces).</li>
            <li>This product really does provide extreme hold, however it does leave a residue when it dries completely.</li>
            <li>I have natural 4c textured hair and it really works to preserve my curls and hold them down.</li>
            <li>It really, really holds the hair down</li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re natural and want your edges to lay down this is for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black women with natural hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is too long to experiment that way</li>
            <li> 5 cm long.</li>
            <li> His hair styles with the cutest curls and stays all day long.</li>
            <li> there is simple stays up for more then 12 hours and stays up even in bad weather or sweat</li>
            <li> air dry.</li>
            <li> A few years back this was only sold in Mexico and I would stock up when I visited the border towns.  </li>
            <li> This is not a very stiff gel, &amp; it feels a tad heavy while still wet.       </li>
            <li> This is the stuff you want for mohawks and other sculpted hair-dos for boys.</li>
            <li> Never lets me down</li>
            <li> /&gt;We have tried a few of the &amp;#34;extreme&amp;#34; hold gels from other brands, and NONE of them work as well as this stuff.</li>
            <li> I put a small amount of it on his hair while wet....</li>
            <li> I am a naturalista and I purchased the gorilla snot on order to slick down my edges.</li>
            <li> I use it to tame the curly edges of my hairline for a smoother look.</li>

            <li> This product is a rip-off.</li>

            <li> It works well. My son loves it.It reactivates with water after it is already dry.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves no flakes.&lt;br /&gt;Looks just like the name indicates but it smells good.</li>
            <li> This product really does provide extreme hold, however it does leave a residue when it dries completely.</li>
            <li> Best hair gel there is simple stays up for more then 12 hours and stays up even in bad weather or sweat</li>
            <li> My son loves this product!  He won&#x27;t use anything else to spike his hair.  It has a good scent too.  We Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Muy  bueno,    Anteriormente, utilizaba Xtreme una de la supuestamente mejores despues de la Shine aqui en mi pais! luego probe esta y es 20veces mejor porque no me produce cazpa y dura mucho mas tiempo!! sin problemas!</li>
            <li> Great for edges for all my natural ladies</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews.  This product was awesome - I have natural 4c textured hair and it really works to preserve my curls and hold them down. I&#x27;ve never come across such an awesome gel and I buy and try everything I hear about. My bathroom has at least 25 bottles of gel.</li>
            <li> Hold strong, no flakes</li>
            <li> Just what I need it!!</li>
            <li> If you want year hair not to move an inch in a 125 mile an hour wind, this is the gel for your. No only will it make your hair unmovable, your hair will feel it can withstand a hit from a baseball. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I am a naturalista and I purchased the gorilla snot on order to slick down my edges. This stuff doesn&#x27;t work well by itself on natural hair. You will have to mix it with olive oil edge control. If you put the edge control on first and then the gorilla snot it works like magic. Will definitely order again</li>
            <li> Great Hold..Does what it says..I&#x27;ve tried  a lot of products but this i&#x27;m in love with. Beware it does have an icky texture but it smells great and holds my edges in place all day..#Laid</li>
            <li> This is the best hair gel on the market, hands down. Finally they sell it in my neighborhood but I was grateful to find it online here.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff for my 9 year old son to &amp;#34;spike&amp;#34; his hair.  It works great, holds all day and night!  It washed out fairly easy in the shower or bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have tried a few of the &amp;#34;extreme&amp;#34; hold gels from other brands, and NONE of them work as well as this stuff.</li>
            <li> I use this to texture up my hair into a tousled, piecey, beachy-waves look. Good in both damp &amp; dry hair, though mostly I add it to dry hair in the morning - scrunch in the shape, fluff it up &amp; air dry. Keeps my hair in shape &amp; eliminates flyaways. Gives my hair easy, quick volume that doesn&#x27;t fall flat all day - that impressed me.      This gel is super-sticky &amp; holds my lazy waves into nice cute curls &amp; shape but the finish is very soft &amp; pliable, so I&#x27;m at a loss as to how this gel can hold spikes. My hair is too long to experiment that way (chin-length bob) but probably on short hair it&#x27;s possible to create spikes - I would still imagine that additional hairspray would be needed to hold them up...? This is not a very stiff gel, &amp; it feels a tad heavy while still wet.       Anyway I like that it holds well but still leaves my hair looking natural AND feeling soft &amp; touchable (but not combable of course, as strands are stuck together in pieces). Smells nice &amp; washes out easily.    It&#x27;s not the best hair gel I&#x27;ve ever used (I prefer Redken Elastic Gel which is stronger) but it&#x27;s useful for my needs &amp; I do like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black women with natural hair. This product did not hold my edges down for more than 10 minutes. It may work for you, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Our son saw some of his friends at school using this and immediately wanted some of his own.  It has a pleasant smell, isn&#x27;t sticky, and doesn&#x27;t leave white flakes when it dries.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works great. I love his stuff</li>
            <li> This stuff ROCKS!!!! Holds my Mohawk  with  ease. Never lets me down</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re natural and want your edges to lay down this is for you. I tried everything for my unruly edges. It leaves a little residue the next day but just add a bit of water &amp; reapply its great</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It really, really holds the hair down and you get a huge amount in this bottle.  I use it to tame the curly edges of my hairline for a smoother look.</li>
            <li> I love the product but after shipping it wasn&#x27;t a good deal</li>
            <li> Horrible white film. Freshly washed hair, applied and left to set up. It holds well but the white film was so bad I had to eyewash my hair. I&#x27;ve tried it four times, with the same result. I cannot use the product.</li>
            <li> HOLDS MY NATRUAL CURLY  EDGES DOWN!!!! Came very fast  !</li>
            <li> This is the stuff you want for mohawks and other sculpted hair-dos for boys. It will keep a mohawk up through an entire soccer tournament.</li>
            <li> This is the only hair gel I will use since having discovered it. I lasts all day through wind and some rain, and no matter how much I sweat. It does have to be washed out to restyle, or you could dampen your hair the next day and then restyle it, and it still holds up well. It is quite a bit cheaper at the big brick and mortar store though...</li>
            <li> Wish I could send back ... nasty residue in hair.</li>
            <li> My 8 year-old son had asked me for some time to try out a punk hair style. The longest strains of his hair in the centre are only approx. 5 cm long. There is no way to keep the hair standing straight with the product. First I did not believe it and tried to use more and more of the gel, then I tried to dry it with a hair blower, but there is no way that it will stand up. It read estilo punk on the bottle but it simply does not do it! You cannot use it for a punk!&lt;br /&gt;Mi hijo de 8 años de edad, me había pedido por mucho tiempo para probar un peinado punk. Las cepas más largos de su pelo en el centro son sólo aprox. 5 cm de largo. No hay manera de mantener el pelo de pie derecho con el producto. En primer lugar yo no lo creía y traté de usar más y más del gel, entonces traté de secarlo con un secador de cabello, pero no hay manera que functiona. Decía Estilo punk en la botella pero simplemente no lo hace! No se puede utilizar para un punk!</li>
            <li> My son has wavy hair that is very difficult to manage....With any humidity/sweat, his hair turns into \\&quot;Ronald McDonald\\&quot; styled hair. I tried NUMEROUS hair gels with much disappointment. Someone recommended this gel to me so I figured I had nothing to lose. That was 2 years ago! It works great. I put a small amount of it on his hair while wet....His hair styles with the cutest curls and stays all day long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried $25 hair products on down and this by far is the best I have used.  A few years back this was only sold in Mexico and I would stock up when I visited the border towns.  Thank god this is now sold in the states!  This can be found for under $3 in local stores so its a total rip off online. If you need a strong hold this is the one to get and washes out easy with no residue... non-greasy</li>
            <li> This product holds great but the buildup is horrific and when it dries it flakes up so bad. I am African American and I used this on my hair.... Many of the people around me would ask what was all the white stuff in my head throughout the day. I was pissed. This product is a rip-off.</li>
            <li> This product did not do what it said it would for my hair. I will try it again but I don&#x27;t think I like it</li>
