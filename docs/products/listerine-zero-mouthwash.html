    <ol>
            <li>Great stuff, does the job without stressing out the body.</li>
            <li>Johnson &amp; Johnson used to produce Listermint, a GREAT non alcholic mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t experienced any of the skin pealing that some reviewers note....</li>
            <li>Thankfully I can find it here for a really good price, and with my Prime, it&#x27;s free shipping :D</li>
            <li>His gums are much better and he is happy.</li>
            <li>Love this, no burn at all!</li>
            <li>but will continue looking for something more in line with my &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; taste!</li>
            <li>I love this brand.</li>
            <li>they are definitely the best mouth wash ever.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I just love how fresh it leaves my mouth feeling.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended that I try an alcohol free mouthwash to rinse my mouth with after flossing each day, and he recommended this one in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really gross and doesn&#x27;t leave me the impression that this stuff is safe to use or good for my mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another suggestion is to try a trial-size before buying the large size to be sure you are comfortable with using this.</li>
            <li>This tastes much better than normal listerine and doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth.</li>
            <li>We still use the old stuff and love that</li>
            <li>they mouth wash gives you a minty fresh smelling breath</li>
            <li>Very gentle n works well</li>
            <li>I have always used the regular alcohol-based listerine mouthwash before I went to bed for more than 5 years, but then I decided to try this when it was on sale.</li>
            <li>And my bi-annual trips to the dentist are usually pretty painless.  </li>
            <li>I returned six months later, my gums were in much better shape.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommendation: Do not buy this if you are comfortable with the regular alcohol-based listerine already, there is no additional benefit to switching to this type.</li>
            <li>[Read below for advice]&lt;br /&gt;2) I personally do not get a clean, minty aftertaste I used to get with the alcohol-based listerine.</li>
            <li>The bone measurements had not gotten any worse, and the cleaning went much more smooth.  </li>
            <li>Like most people who have purchased this product, I have finally found a solution to the burning inherent in conventional mouthwash formulas.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sting my mouth like the old alcohol-based product, and lacks all the unwelcome chemicals in the newer versions of the mouthwash (more is NOT better).</li>
            <li>I saw many negative comments about it, that it caused sloughing of the interior of the mouth.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this, no burn at all!</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s dentist noticed that his gums were irritated and she explained it was not from plaque but from the alcohol based Listerine. We switched him to this and he loves it. He had hated the burn from the standard Listerine. We still use the old stuff and love that but he will stick to the Zero. His gums are much better and he is happy. He reports that this has a \\&quot;way nicer flavor\\&quot; than the regular Listerine and the dentist told me it will do the job just as well,</li>
            <li> Like most people who have purchased this product, I have finally found a solution to the burning inherent in conventional mouthwash formulas. I always used to skip mouthwash because of the unpleasant burning, but now I can use this morning and night to kill germs and freshen my breath. The minty/clean feeling doesn&#x27;t last as long as alcohol-based ones, but at least I can tolerate this without immediately spitting it out.</li>
            <li> I have always used the regular alcohol-based listerine mouthwash before I went to bed for more than 5 years, but then I decided to try this when it was on sale. It was probably a poor decision when I bought the large size because I started to get inner mouth peeling when I woke up every morning. I ignored it the first few days, but it just got progressively worse as I continued to use it throughout the weeks. I finally reached the point when I need to alternate days I&#x27;m using this now because I feel like the mouthwash is weakening my inner mouth skin and gums. Here is an overall summary of pros/cons I have found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) As advertised, zero alcohol means no burning whatsoever&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Inner mouth peeling! A thin film develops over your gums and teeth, and the skin of your inner mouth becomes loose. [Read below for advice]&lt;br /&gt;2) I personally do not get a clean, minty aftertaste I used to get with the alcohol-based listerine. It feels like I rinsed my mouth with water and it still feels dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation: Do not buy this if you are comfortable with the regular alcohol-based listerine already, there is no additional benefit to switching to this type. If you do have problems with the irritation from the alcohol-based listerine, I would recommend this. HOWEVER, I would suggest that you rinse your mouth with a couple cups of water after using this to wash off residual mouthwash that will cause inner mouth peeling later. This will not completely remove the side effect, but it will reduce it. Another suggestion is to try a trial-size before buying the large size to be sure you are comfortable with using this.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this zero alcohol mouthwash.  He said to squirt it around your mouth for 30 seconds.  When waking in the morning, breath feels fresher.  Like the mint flavor.</li>
            <li> This tastes much better than normal listerine and doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth. But looking at the list of ingredients.. none of the active ingredients are present. So when you read a study that shows listerine kills 99% of some type of bacteria, it doesn&#x27;t apply to this product! What&#x27;s the point of using something that has no studies backing it up?</li>
            <li> I love this brand. No bite or after taste and yet does the job, but it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find in this area thus I have to order it online which is more expensive than buying it locally, which is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5-stars.</li>
            <li> they mouth wash gives you a minty fresh smelling breath they are some times when i wake up and my breath doesnt have that morning breath smell that i almost forget to brush my teeth they are definitely the best mouth wash ever.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sting my mouth like the old alcohol-based product, and lacks all the unwelcome chemicals in the newer versions of the mouthwash (more is NOT better). Great stuff, does the job without stressing out the body.</li>
            <li> I like it - what is with this required number of words non sense - if I did not like it I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it</li>
            <li> I chose Listerine Zero because the regular listerine covers gingevitis but has doesn&#x27;t prevent cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the Listerine Zero is causing the skin inside of my mouth to die. I use the Listerine Zero and then I can feel the skin in my mouth peeling. If I run my fingers along the inside of my cheek, a film of skin comes off. It&#x27;s really gross and doesn&#x27;t leave me the impression that this stuff is safe to use or good for my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to check the bottle to see if I can get a refund. Too bad I didn&#x27;t save the receipt.</li>
            <li> Love it. Very gentle n works well</li>
            <li> Johnson &amp; Johnson used to produce Listermint, a GREAT non alcholic mouthwash.  They discontinued Listermint and replaced it with Listerine Zero........I suspect they are hoping to take advantage of the Listerine name. I found Listerine Zero to be &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;...but not in the same league as Listermint!  Haven&#x27;t experienced any of the skin pealing that some reviewers note....but I do delute it with a bit of water.  I&#x27;ll continue using it for now.....but will continue looking for something more in line with my &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; taste!</li>
            <li> I like this mouthwash. I saw many negative comments about it, that it caused sloughing of the interior of the mouth. I was using it because it was recommended by my oncology nurse. It has no alcohol in it so is less likely to be irritating to the mouth.</li>
            <li> I like listerine zero, as it doesnt have the alcohol burn.  I would reccomend this, but shop around, you can probably get it cheaper on sale.</li>
            <li> product arrived on time and as advertised</li>
            <li> I started using this stuff a few years ago and I just love how fresh it leaves my mouth feeling. Sadly, it&#x27;s near impossible to find the Zero anywhere locally to me. Thankfully I can find it here for a really good price, and with my Prime, it&#x27;s free shipping :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve never had an issue like some of the other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I had use listerine because my dentist was saying that i was bleeding so i switched from listerine to listerine zero the bumps on my tongue still are popping up. So I facebook my dentist and she said try clysos. I got it today. I will never use listerine again in my life</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like mouthwash.  I never have.  And this stuff tastes a bit funky.  But it helps do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I regularly brush and floss.  And my bi-annual trips to the dentist are usually pretty painless.  But then I had one about six months ago that didn&#x27;t go well at all.  Somehow, the bone measurements had spiraled not quite out of control but way beyond where they had ever been before.  My dentist recommended that I try an alcohol free mouthwash to rinse my mouth with after flossing each day, and he recommended this one in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I returned six months later, my gums were in much better shape.  The bone measurements had not gotten any worse, and the cleaning went much more smooth.  I guess I&#x27;ll suck it up and continue rinsing with this stuff after I floss.</li>
