            <li>It is really nice</li>
            <li>and I am loving it.</li>
            <li>my hair is nice and silky.</li>
            <li>One of the best features of this iron is how fast it heats up.</li>
            <li>Looks nice.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the design of it</li>
            <li>I am amazed to be honest.  </li>
            <li>I liked the size and price and the fact that it has ceramic plates.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and straightens my hair perfectly!</li>
            <li>Thank you order arrive very well in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>Give my hair a nice shine.</li>
            <li>Honestly I wasn&#x27;t happy with it because of the results I would get when I would straighten my mildly curly hair at 380 degrees.</li>
            <li>Was very easy to do my hair.</li>
            <li>Is a great flat iron and the best of everything is the heat and thr comfortable of the handle amazing</li>
            <li>This is by far the best one I have ever had.</li>
            <li>surprised at how great it does my hair!!!!</li>
            <li>but it it breaks on me or anything I will update this review but for the price its the best straightener I have used so far.</li>
            <li>Direct replacement for the one my wife had that quit working and works perfectly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for all hair types and leaves it smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>So far, my daughter describes this flat-iron as perfect.</li>
            <li>I am impressed with the ceramic plates, I have noticed that my hair is so smooth and pretty after spending time styling it.</li>
            <li>Nice and hot and the thermostat is great</li>
            <li>so I do not fry my very fine hair.</li>
            <li>Honestly I have only used this twice, but I have to say it is the best one ever.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product was exactly as described and I am extremely happy wiyh the results it provides.</li>
            <li>My hair is very smooth &amp; slippery, and breaks</li>
            <li>It glides over very smooth.</li>
            <li>Its very light for its size.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is VERY cheaply made, and flimsy.</li>
            <li>I opened this Remington and while it has some good qualities (heats up quickly, allows you to get close to the scalp)</li>
            <li>So far works very good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to use it any more.</li>
            <li>I happen to own an infrared thermometer which measures surface temperatures with a light beam.</li>
            <li>I waited about 30 minutes to see if it would heat up more as it stayed on longer</li>
            <li>Already had one and love it with temperature control.</li>
            <li>I have bought and used MANY straighteners over the years</li>
            <li>Received many compliments.  </li>
            <li>I have been straightening my hair for over 11 years now and have used so many straighteners I lost count.</li>
            <li>I bought this straightener last night and I have to say this is the BEST straightener I have ever bought before</li>
            <li>She also turns it when she gets to the ends of her hair and it looks like she has curled the tips. :)</li>
            <li>I love love love love this straightener.</li>
            <li>They love it.</li>
            <li>Love how it just glides through my hair.</li>
            <li>Love,love, love it.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely LOVE</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alright, way better than what I had to deal with before.</li>
            <li>Much better than my daughter&#x27;s, though, in that regard.</li>
            <li>i love this product.</li>
            <li>you will love the results.</li>
            <li>Well, I love it....</li>
            <li>Hopefully will get better at avoiding those buttons as I use it more.</li>
            <li>I love this one.</li>
            <li>I love this straightener.</li>
            <li>I also wasn&#x27;t completely  satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>So glad I got it.</li>
            <li>My wife love the hair straightener she have a better brand</li>
            <li>more an A++++.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I love mine.</li>
            <li>Safe shopping.</li>
            <li>Love love love this.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Much better than Chi I think,</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this straightener.</li>
            <li>I also love that it gets to 455°F (the iron does gethot to the touch).</li>
            <li>but I wish it had a better grip</li>
            <li>: The button placement could be better.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this</li>
            <li>is tap the power button to see what the temperature is it&#x27;s not a big deal over all I give this an excellent star rating because it works</li>
            <li>so glad the amazon let me do the refund.</li>
            <li>but I love how it feels as I&#x27;m straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>Just ok.</li>
            <li>Truly, it is great quality for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping, Great Product</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Absolutely recommended!!!!</li>
            <li>exactly as described, very nice box it came in (easy to wrap), was a Christmas gift and it was a hit.  </li>
            <li>one of the best flat irons there is</li>
            <li>It took me years to find a flat iron that works the best for me.</li>
            <li>I have flat irons of all sizes and brands, and this remington s9620 does a great job for the price!  </li>
            <li>Best flat iron I owned.  </li>
            <li>the best, I think one of the biggest reasons I like their flat irons is because of the size of the plates, Im not talking about the width,</li>
            <li>This flat iron that she chose is perfect and she loves it and uses it a lot!</li>
            <li>Heats up very fast and straightens really good.</li>
            <li>Good consistent heat.</li>
            <li>The best flat iron I ever used or owned!!!!</li>
            <li>I buy this item after having my haircut, it works pretty good and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It arrived in good condition 2 weeks later; it appears to be brand new and works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Before you could always tell that I had it straightened because of the way it wasn&#x27;t so smooth, but this flat iron makes it look wonderful</li>
            <li>lightweight and works beautifully -- easy to handle and maneuver; very packable so good for travel -- better than the minis for that purpose</li>
            <li>The best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Was curious to see if the cheaper models had caught up with all the fancier ones and looked on here for reviews as I stood in walmart looking at the choices and selected this one based off the glowing reviews, took it home, plugged it in and within about 4 swipes, I was already in love!!!!!</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t get tangled as I straighten each layer because it is so smooth and has fewer seams.</li>
            <li>purchase for my daughter and she wasn&#x27;t very happy with it said it didn&#x27;t work like she expected it to.</li>
            <li>a nice 2-inch iron was really exciting.</li>
            <li>loved, let me straight hair and is faster than me under the hair</li>
            <li>This is a very good flat iron.</li>
            <li>More like worth $100!</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>it heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>The heat controls are used easily without being changed accidentally.</li>
            <li>also said easy to use....</li>
            <li>I have strong, non-chemically treated hair (ginger here), so I use the highest setting (455 degrees).  </li>
            <li>This is the first flat iron I have ever had, and it worked excellent, I was able to get my hair to look how it looks when I leave salon.  </li>
            <li>warm up very fast</li>
            <li>Its a great iron and doesn&#x27;t leave a burning smell on your hair like most flat irons tend to do.</li>
            <li>quick and easy :)</li>
            <li>She loves the width and the ability to finely adjust temperature.</li>
            <li>I used mine on 300 and it worked just fine for my hair.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>I think it takes more than 20 seconds to fully heat to this temperature, but it does it fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>got here quick!</li>
            <li>Super satisfied that it didn&#x27;t cost me a ton of money either.</li>
            <li>it arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>I should have been loyal to the brand!</li>
            <li>It heats up super fast and it&#x27;s a fair quality for the price.</li>
            <li>it feels very cheap, does not glide over my hair smoothly like my Chi, and makes a dingy &amp; cheap sounding noise when the plates come together when straightening.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be returning this item tomorrow and searching for a better iron very soon.</li>
            <li>Works fast and effective.</li>
            <li>Durable, tangle free</li>
            <li>She said it was silky smooth going through her hair.</li>
            <li>Overall I like it and happy with the product.</li>
            <li>no tugging , glides easily on just woken up hair or clean hair.</li>
            <li>but I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>but when I saw the reviews and how it says silk ceramic and how every one loves their silky smooth hair</li>
            <li>Glides smoothly across hair, doesn&#x27;t catch.</li>
            <li>It is a comfortable grip....</li>
            <li>Fantastic smoothing results and shine.</li>
            <li>this product is cheap</li>
            <li>interestingly enough that is about destroyed after a lot of usage, and it still works great with the clamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m like most ladies, I want my hair to look as good as it can on a regular basis!</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>This Flatiron works really good, I love the swivel handle and the digital settings.</li>
            <li>The temperature display is easy to read and the heat settings go higher than most.</li>
            <li>This straightener looks very nice, the pink plates are a cute accent.</li>
            <li>It was VERY powerful.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves this flat iron, the temperature settings are great, heats up immediately.</li>
            <li>Great flat iron.</li>
            <li>I received my package pretty early, which is great, in</li>
            <li>It heats super fats and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Overall, a nice product!</li>
            <li>get real hot and works well</li>
            <li>I have never been able to find one that straightens cometely, fast, and makes my hair shiny!</li>
            <li>100% original product</li>
            <li>My daughter loves this very happy with it works great on long thick hair.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best flat iron I have used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never owned one of the higher end flat iron brands, but Remington straighteners have always done a great job and lasted a long time for a great price.</li>
            <li>Normally, I purchase a 3&amp;#34; iron, but this baby is so efficient, that the 2&amp;#34; iron quickly and easily does a fabulous job!</li>
            <li>We didn&#x27;t even put it to the full amount of 450 (like it says not to), and kept it around 350.  </li>
            <li>is my old one had a &#x27;comb&#x27; on the edge of it, I really liked that feature</li>
            <li>It was always a hassle to iron my hair that I would do it just every 6 months even though I love my hair straight.</li>
            <li>People have said on the reviews that it doesn&#x27;t grip their hair good enough.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t had any issues with burning my fingers and the handle stays cool), and it makes hair dry/frizzy</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and makes my hair shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li>I always had 1 inch plates only because I could never find a good 2 inch plate one.</li>
            <li>I love remington products since I use the wet2 straight</li>
            <li>Does the job, heats up fast and love</li>
            <li>I found this to be a great purchase, my hair is straighter, softer, and more shiny than when using my old Conair flat iron.</li>
            <li>Excellent flat iron, my hair looks very shine, and really silk.  </li>
            <li>Heats up very quickly and works very well!</li>
            <li>Good flat iron.  </li>
            <li>works well, heats quickly.  </li>
            <li>With just one pass over some spiral curls, it makes it so that they are just waves, another quick pass</li>
            <li>It heats and cools quickly and feels like a quality, sturdy product.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight, heats up quickly and does not snag my hair.</li>
            <li>durable, holds up to quite a bit of pressure from a medium quick release clamp before cracking the lower bezel,</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to hold and maneuver around, I was happily surprised to not get sore arms from straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>and it is very hot.</li>
            <li>First it makes my hair so silky smooth</li>
            <li>Gets very hot but does the work.  </li>
            <li>gets very hot .</li>
            <li>Also, their prices are very reasonable!  </li>
            <li>then head to work as it&#x27;s still very hot even after sitting for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>kept my hair silky smooth and straight!</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, and the floating plates glide right over your hair, quickly straightening it.  </li>
            <li>This flat is the best in all of the flat irons I have ever bought.  </li>
            <li>Strangely it didn&#x27;t leave my hair as \\&quot;hot\\&quot; to touch as the Paul Mitchell, but it sure worked 3x better than the PM.</li>
            <li>This iron exceeded my expectations with the way it looks, how easy it is to use and how straight it got my hair and my sisters hair in just 1 pass.</li>
            <li>My beloved iron of 10+ years just died and wanted one similar to it and not expensive.</li>
            <li>So this heats ups very quick and gets very hot for being 2 inch flat iron very light weight</li>
            <li>I like this one better than my old one!  </li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, her older sister begs her to do her hair for special occasions!</li>
            <li>This is not my first Remington flat iron, and like the last one, this one is great!  </li>
            <li>It takes a couple extra minutes to heat up - give it about 10 mins to get nice and hot!  </li>
            <li>love this flat iron - easy to use and convenient, even for travel.</li>
            <li>But this is an amazing product especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and leaves ur hair feeling so silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Works fantastic, and seems really durable.</li>
            <li>I also have the Remington curling wand &amp; it is nice to have the same controls on both.</li>
            <li>Worth the money and purchase.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I bought a second one.</li>
            <li>I actually have the older model of this same straightener and have had it for 10 years and it still works awesome, so</li>
            <li>wait about five seconds before it gets super hot.</li>
            <li>It gets super hot.  </li>
            <li>The iron gets super hot, and I have burned my bangs with it.</li>
            <li>Replaced a really nice flat iron that I broke and got this one instead..</li>
            <li>Someone help me I can&#x27;t find the right adaptor/universal plug for this straightener, anyone else have used it and know what to do ?</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>The broad plates help expedite the straightening :)</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t pull hair, smooth, high heat...</li>
            <li>Need less to say I am very happy with the product overall.</li>
            <li>This iron, will help normally crispy ends feel a bit smooth, but I still go and cut them off for healthier hair.</li>
            <li>Nice item for my daugthers long hair</li>
            <li>It was smooth, easy to slide through, and even I noticed that their hair came out better than usual.  </li>
            <li>Actually, it helps me since I usually trim my own hair, this flat iron gets my hair so straight, so quickly, that I can easily trim it and have it look great.</li>
            <li>Shipping was also very fast.</li>
            <li>Very very embarrassing</li>
            <li>Very much recommended.</li>
            <li>The larger width flat iron is great.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and does a great fast job on my thick, somewhat wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>I have long fine blonde hair (true blondes have very fine texture).</li>
            <li>When we first turned it on, I think it fully heated up in about 15 seconds (like it said).</li>
            <li>Speechless when I first used it.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>It came in more than enough time for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Love the digital display.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know exactly how hot they got.</li>
            <li>Works great and straightens my daughter&#x27;s thick hair fast!</li>
            <li>LOVE the digital feature,  the swirling cord is genius.</li>
            <li>and it is hot</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased that the plates are so big.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely buy this again!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also gotten better with twirling it around chunks of hair for larger curls.</li>
            <li>it eventually arrived, I plugged it in and turned it on for the first time</li>
            <li>The top red part gets hot.</li>
            <li>Works great, even on my thick hair.</li>
            <li>lol, I have thick wavy/course hair and this iron</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any issues with frying or damaging, although my hair is naturally pretty resilient</li>
            <li>but this product isnt too hot for me</li>
            <li>But for sure I will go back to remington...</li>
            <li>thanks to amazon!</li>
            <li>I will probably get a better one later.</li>
            <li>It works very well!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m saying first that this review is coming from a Remington user already.</li>
            <li>Used it this morning for the first time, and I coukd hear it shorting out/sparking inside as i was trying to use it.</li>
            <li>it warms realy high so quickly</li>
            <li>but it clearly was refurbished or something it did not even have the original packaging</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the T/Studio Silk Ceramic 2&amp;#34; flat iron I received from Remington to review on my blog.</li>
            <li>; flat iron is quicker and straightens better than my 1&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>Love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>Surely there must be a version of this flat iron where the controls are NOT on the handle where you have to hold it??!?</li>
            <li>The only thing I really love is that I can grasp my hair really close to the scalp.</li>
            <li>I love the way it heats up fast a lot of people seem to have a problem with the digital thermometer all you have to do</li>
            <li>, so I&#x27;ll say that it&#x27;s good enough for what I paid and much better than the old metal-plate flat iron I had in the old days.</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair straight on the first try.</li>
            <li>My hair looked straight and healthy-looking after using it, even in some hot humid weather, my hair didn&#x27;t frizz.</li>
            <li>I have pretty straight hair</li>
            <li>good basic flat iron.</li>
            <li>Besides sometimes the lock slides back and gets it stuck for a bit, this is a good flat iron.</li>
            <li>but this flat iron is so big and straightens so good that I don&#x27;t miss any hairs.</li>
            <li>The iron is high quality and works great on my course hair and my daughter&#x27;s thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Straightens my thick hair quickly and love the auto shut off!</li>
            <li>it stayed semi-curly (not really at the ends, mostly higher up) and took me more time.</li>
            <li>, she needed a certain temperature etc...</li>
            <li>You have to be sure to turn it down right away or you will burn your hair.</li>
            <li>My Chi works fine but only heats up to 410.</li>
            <li>The 60 second heat up time is definitely a plus, and the 455 degree max heat is even better!</li>
            <li>The buttons to change the heat is super useful as well; I don&#x27;t like to damage my hair with excessive heat so having the option to turn the temperature down was great.</li>
            <li>The flat iorn heated up very quickly ❗</li>
            <li>Heats up fast.  </li>
            <li>In 5 minutes, my hair was sleeker, shinier and looked so well groomed and just awesomely straight.</li>
            <li>, works really well.</li>
            <li>Was better than expected.</li>
            <li>but I can say it heats fast</li>
            <li>I will be buying this straightener from now on, HIGHLY recommended!</li>
            <li>so I can read what its really coming out to</li>
            <li>You would never know my hair wasn&#x27;t naturally straight after using it.</li>
            <li>I know these are very well made.</li>
            <li>as I felt like it helped hold my hair in there &amp; keep it straight instead of just ironing over a tangle.</li>
            <li>Life is so much easier now.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave a burning scent on my hair and pre-heats fast.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Heats up fast.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Great for largers curls too and thin hair takes minutes to do.</li>
            <li>The package was very protected.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this straightener.</li>
            <li>I tried getting used to it because I really like it, but each time I tried to straighten my hair</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t take much to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>I still have to take my time to get my hair straight though.</li>
            <li>(I found it very snugly fits hair)</li>
            <li>i absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and I really like it despite the chips in the paint.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>/&gt;After much fustration and tape to try and keep the cord still</li>
            <li>Heats up fast.</li>
            <li>my bathroom lights flicker when this is plugged in even if I only have one light on</li>
            <li>This iron works very well.</li>
            <li>It keeps your hair straight all day.</li>
            <li>Amazingly fast.</li>
            <li>Design, temperature settings, ergonomics the whole nine.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for the price!</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast.  </li>
            <li>I only go over it once maybe twice near my roots where its more curly.</li>
            <li>The plastic on top of the plates also gets too hot to touch, so I can&#x27;t hold it down to flatten a thicker section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hair texture of fine, medium, course and even weaves will all be tamed with this flat iron.</li>
            <li>This flat iron not only gets your hair bone straight, it will leave your hair silky smooth and frizz free.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair but a lot of it, causing it to get thick and frizzy, and I have the Brazilian blowout, and this iron does not have a strong enough grip to really smooth my hair--it takes a couple of passes.</li>
            <li>I have always had long, straight, fine hair -- and a lot of it.</li>
            <li>Well, since my hair has gotten as long as it&#x27;s been since I discovered flattening irons, I decided that perhaps a 2 inch paddle would get the job done faster and possibly better as I was laboring over my hair using a Paul Mitchell iron for 10 minutes and still not really getting a sleek, smooth, well contoured look.</li>
            <li>highly recommended for really curly hair</li>
            <li>it stays straight with just some very gentle waves starting in the following days, and my hair is so soft and smooth afterwards!</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, and very long and this iron has no problem giving me a sleek, shiny look that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I had been happy with my old flat iron, but dropped it multiple times before it finally bit the dust.</li>
            <li>love the floating plates, I can really feel the difference when moving the iron down my hair, compared to normal plates.</li>
            <li>Both girls, one with thick wavy, the other with fine curly, loved it.</li>
            <li>I love the lock feature, you just hold down the &amp;#34;-&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Looking forever for a new 2-inch replacement, and this fits the bill!</li>
            <li>It takes so much less time and my hair looks so much better.</li>
            <li>This is so much better then way more expensive straighteners.</li>
            <li>The complaints are mainly the placement of the control buttons (they are on the handle</li>
            <li>I replaced an older Remington with this one.</li>
            <li>I have gone through about 5 different flat iron straighteners in the past year and this one is the best one I have used so far.</li>
            <li>Love this flat iron...doesn&#x27;t grab hair or pull....gets hot fast and works great...doesn&#x27;t get too hot near the scalp like my other does...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommended</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Also it has a high temperature which helps</li>
            <li>I wanted to get my next flat iron online for more options to chose from.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and the plates are AMAZING, It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair out and the plates closes on my hair tight enough to flatten my hair</li>
            <li>To start I have shoulder length hair that is extremely thick and very damaged from coloring..my hair is hard to manage even on my best days..</li>
            <li>As you can clearly see in the photo below, my hair is very curly.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair smooth and sleek with minimal work and fuss.</li>
            <li>It made my hair really shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>Great heat up and works well on my long, thick hair.</li>
            <li>Normally I had to go over a piece of hair over like 3 or 4 times, not with this one.</li>
            <li>I really needed a 2 inch flat iron, this was the only available</li>
            <li>I have tried many flat irons/styling tools and they had taken me way too long (over an hour) to do.</li>
            <li>The value of this flat iron made by Remington is $37.99 and is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update - I contacted Remington using their customer service website - they promptly sent me return information with a promise of a new iron.  </li>
            <li>Live in Australia so just needed to buy adapter for usa to australia.</li>
            <li>I thought this item was brand new</li>
            <li>I have really thick curly hair and was able to get it so straight, like never before, in about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>I like that the plates are nice and thin; I can get really close to the hairline to get unruly baby hairs without burning myself.</li>
            <li>My daughter-n-laws flat iron died right before Christmas and is lost without it...</li>
            <li>I turned down the temp a bit and straightened all of my naturally curly hair very quickly.</li>
            <li>I ordered a 2 inch wide plate flat iron and although it works, it&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron I have found, those little ones don&#x27;t cut it for thick hair.  </li>
            <li>I recently moved to a much more humid climate and this flatiron has worked really well to tame my frizzy hair after blow drying.</li>
            <li>the other remington wet to straight is much better</li>
            <li>Just used this flat iron for the first time today.</li>
            <li>I have never owned a flat iron that gets so hot before.</li>
            <li>GREAT for extra thick hair!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok iron not hot enough...takes a long time to straighten</li>
            <li>It heats up very fast (less than 20 seconds), cools down quickly, and gives consistent, even heat.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this flat iron, and after reading the previous reviews I expected it to be a good</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t damage my hair over time (I get bad damaged ends when I keep my hair curly and in ponytails actually), and I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for something that works great and will do something for the toughest to straighten hair around!</li>
            <li>I am natural with a kinky-curly hair type.</li>
            <li>Purchased for 19 year old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li>It definitely reduces getting ready time.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>Just wow ❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗</li>
            <li>It makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and I like the digital numbers.</li>
            <li>Was very embarrassing when I received this product I immediately gave my coworker as this was a present to her.</li>
            <li>I miss the old style from a couple of years ago</li>
            <li>I do not use straighteners to straighten but to smooth and style in place of a round brush.</li>
            <li>I recommend washing the day before and naturally drying.</li>
            <li>Ironed my natural hair with one pass.</li>
            <li>my 16 yr old asked for.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to repeat the same area to make it straight.</li>
            <li>The only problem is when using the iron you have to repeatedly have to straight your hair 4 or 5 times maybe that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li>I was concerned that they would be too small for my long hair, but they are a nice size.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for me, and it pulls my hair if I am not careful to hold it</li>
            <li>It is fantastic and cuts my styling time in half!</li>
            <li>The handle has a nice grip and it doesn&#x27;t seem too bulky or hard to hold like my old Remington flat iron did.</li>
            <li>So far, these flat irons leaves my hair silky and straight.</li>
            <li>The bottom plate outer housing is the matte black and that part stays cool (nature of the type of plastic).</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to spend over $150 on a Chi or other big name when you can buy this for under $30 and works just as great... if not better!</li>
            <li>I have long hair that is very fine, very thick and very straight.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting perfection for a $20 flat iron (and I can&#x27;t really compare it to my Sedu)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t keep it long enough to test it much, but I ended up getting the Conair Infinity 2&amp;#34; and am much happier with it.</li>
            <li>I have extremely long and coarse hair and this flat iron only took an hour to get my hair soft, shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li>I really like this flat iron.</li>
            <li>This flat iron really does heat to any temp set in 20 seconds.</li>
            <li>works amazing than any other straighten irons I&#x27;ve used in my entire life and makes my hair looks silky, shiny and tamed, I love the color, and usually I have to put the temperature over 420 and up on other straighteners but on this one I only put it on 380!</li>
            <li>I mean the length, Remington&#x27;s flat irons are longer than most all other flat irons allowing me to put more hair in at a time.  </li>
            <li>I only hope it has some decent longevity and durability.</li>
            <li>My hair has never been so soft before, and I only have to run it through my hair once or twice, normally I would do it 3 or 4 times.</li>
            <li>For the OCD set, the iron shuts itself off so no more driving back home from work to make sure it is off.</li>
            <li>I did use it once and my hair looked better than when using my other flat iron but am returning it as I couldn&#x27;t use it easily with the broken part.</li>
            <li>and my hair doesn&#x27;t stay straight for as long as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>and I like it better than the lower temp flat irons I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>I used this thing twice before giving in and spending just a little more money on my second Andis Brand ceramic flat iron, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li>Apparently the high heat only applies to one plate</li>
            <li>2 straight as long as this it out!</li>
            <li>My hair is really curly and with my old flat iron my hair would culr back up once I walked out of the house.</li>
            <li>even better than her much more expensive ones in the past.</li>
            <li>I saw that the reviews were pretty good for this one and it wasn&#x27;t that expensive compared to my other flat irons.</li>
            <li>love this flat iron, and I find myself straightening my hair with it at least once a week now, if not twice a week.</li>
            <li>An amazing flat iron that&#x27;s greats for thick and long hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for long - medium length hair</li>
            <li>It only straightens completely.</li>
            <li>It used to take me close to an hour to straighten my hair with my old (traditional, non-ceramic) iron.  </li>
            <li>I will review the Heatmaster as well since it only has one review so far (which is 5 stars).</li>
            <li>Love it for thin hair curls.</li>
            <li>I have had many Remington flat irons and this is by far the worse.</li>
            <li>so I do not have to take small strands and can get done with the process quite quickly.</li>
            <li>Her 8 year old flat iron was just yanking hair out.</li>
            <li>and I thought due to the god reviews that it would work really well.</li>
            <li>As a natural, I was looking for a replacement flat iron that did not fry my hair, snag my hair, or leave it brittle.</li>
            <li>, I gave up and had to then purchase a new flat iron from the local store.  </li>
            <li>My daughter begged for one of these, and while I was dead-set against it, I caved in to social stress.</li>
            <li>I have a 4+yr old wet-straight remington, and I just bought another remington blow dryer (my 2nd or 3rd</li>
            <li>It works very well for straightening my THICK, VERY CURLY hair.  </li>
            <li>I am willing to spend a little money to make this happen, within reason.</li>
            <li>I bought this straightener for the wide plates and high temps.</li>
            <li>My nearly 10-year-old Sedu flat iron recently kicked the bucket, so I had to find an aletrnative.  </li>
            <li>Unlike my old iron, there&#x27;s no burning smell in the air (or in my hair) afterwards, and the long swivel cord gives you plenty of range.  </li>
            <li>I took a shower and blow dried it first, but I don&#x27;t recommend blow drying it.</li>
            <li>To start, when you plug it in, you can press the button to turn it on and if you want the highest temp, instead of having to keep pushing the temp up button, you can press and hold it down and it will go straight to 455F.</li>
            <li>The one I&#x27;ve used the last 4 years or so and that seemed to work well was the Remington Wet to Straight, after going through only 2 in 4 years I decided I wanted a different straightener.</li>
            <li>I have long, very coarse and curly hair (natural redhead).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Heats quickly &amp; straightens thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>I can get my hair (down to the middle of my back when straight, or like 5 inches shorter when curled up)</li>
            <li>but you really have to hold the straightener tightly for it to work</li>
            <li>I have a LOT of very thick curly hair and for the first time everrrr in 14 years I can straighten my hair &amp; it&#x27;s shiny!!</li>

            <li> Works amazing</li>
            <li> Really nice.</li>
            <li> It is really nice</li>
            <li> and I am loving it.</li>
            <li> my hair is nice and silky.</li>
            <li> One of the best features of this iron is how fast it heats up.</li>
            <li> Looks nice.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the design of it</li>
            <li> I am amazed to be honest.  </li>
            <li> I liked the size and price and the fact that it has ceramic plates.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and straightens my hair perfectly!</li>
            <li> Thank you order arrive very well in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> Give my hair a nice shine.</li>
            <li> Honestly I wasn&#x27;t happy with it because of the results I would get when I would straighten my mildly curly hair at 380 degrees.</li>
            <li> Was very easy to do my hair.</li>
            <li> Is a great flat iron and the best of everything is the heat and thr comfortable of the handle amazing</li>
            <li> This is by far the best one I have ever had.</li>
            <li> surprised at how great it does my hair!!!!</li>
            <li> but it it breaks on me or anything I will update this review but for the price its the best straightener I have used so far.</li>
            <li> Direct replacement for the one my wife had that quit working and works perfectly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for all hair types and leaves it smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> So far, my daughter describes this flat-iron as perfect.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with the ceramic plates, I have noticed that my hair is so smooth and pretty after spending time styling it.</li>
            <li> Nice and hot and the thermostat is great</li>
            <li> so I do not fry my very fine hair.</li>
            <li> Honestly I have only used this twice, but I have to say it is the best one ever.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product was exactly as described and I am extremely happy wiyh the results it provides.</li>
            <li> My hair is very smooth &amp; slippery, and breaks</li>
            <li> It glides over very smooth.</li>
            <li> Its very light for its size.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is VERY cheaply made, and flimsy.</li>
            <li> I opened this Remington and while it has some good qualities (heats up quickly, allows you to get close to the scalp)</li>
            <li> So far works very good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to use it any more.</li>
            <li> I happen to own an infrared thermometer which measures surface temperatures with a light beam.</li>
            <li> I waited about 30 minutes to see if it would heat up more as it stayed on longer</li>
            <li> Already had one and love it with temperature control.</li>
            <li> I have bought and used MANY straighteners over the years</li>
            <li> Received many compliments.  </li>
            <li> I have been straightening my hair for over 11 years now and have used so many straighteners I lost count.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener last night and I have to say this is the BEST straightener I have ever bought before</li>
            <li> She also turns it when she gets to the ends of her hair and it looks like she has curled the tips. :)</li>
            <li> I love love love love this straightener.</li>
            <li> They love it.</li>
            <li> Love how it just glides through my hair.</li>
            <li> Love,love, love it.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely LOVE</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright, way better than what I had to deal with before.</li>
            <li> Much better than my daughter&#x27;s, though, in that regard.</li>
            <li> i love this product.</li>
            <li> you will love the results.</li>
            <li> Well, I love it....</li>
            <li> Hopefully will get better at avoiding those buttons as I use it more.</li>
            <li> I love this one.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener.</li>
            <li> I also wasn&#x27;t completely  satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> So glad I got it.</li>
            <li> My wife love the hair straightener she have a better brand</li>
            <li> more an A++++.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I love mine.</li>
            <li> Safe shopping.</li>
            <li> Love love love this.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Much better than Chi I think,</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener.</li>
            <li> I also love that it gets to 455°F (the iron does gethot to the touch).</li>
            <li> but I wish it had a better grip</li>
            <li> : The button placement could be better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this</li>
            <li> is tap the power button to see what the temperature is it&#x27;s not a big deal over all I give this an excellent star rating because it works</li>
            <li> so glad the amazon let me do the refund.</li>
            <li> but I love how it feels as I&#x27;m straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> Just ok.</li>
            <li> Truly, it is great quality for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping, Great Product</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Absolutely recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> exactly as described, very nice box it came in (easy to wrap), was a Christmas gift and it was a hit.  </li>
            <li> one of the best flat irons there is</li>
            <li> It took me years to find a flat iron that works the best for me.</li>
            <li> I have flat irons of all sizes and brands, and this remington s9620 does a great job for the price!  </li>
            <li> Best flat iron I owned.  </li>
            <li> the best, I think one of the biggest reasons I like their flat irons is because of the size of the plates, Im not talking about the width,</li>
            <li> This flat iron that she chose is perfect and she loves it and uses it a lot!</li>
            <li> Heats up very fast and straightens really good.</li>
            <li> Good consistent heat.</li>
            <li> The best flat iron I ever used or owned!!!!</li>
            <li> I buy this item after having my haircut, it works pretty good and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It arrived in good condition 2 weeks later; it appears to be brand new and works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Before you could always tell that I had it straightened because of the way it wasn&#x27;t so smooth, but this flat iron makes it look wonderful</li>
            <li> lightweight and works beautifully -- easy to handle and maneuver; very packable so good for travel -- better than the minis for that purpose</li>
            <li> The best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Was curious to see if the cheaper models had caught up with all the fancier ones and looked on here for reviews as I stood in walmart looking at the choices and selected this one based off the glowing reviews, took it home, plugged it in and within about 4 swipes, I was already in love!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t get tangled as I straighten each layer because it is so smooth and has fewer seams.</li>
            <li> purchase for my daughter and she wasn&#x27;t very happy with it said it didn&#x27;t work like she expected it to.</li>
            <li> a nice 2-inch iron was really exciting.</li>
            <li> loved, let me straight hair and is faster than me under the hair</li>
            <li> This is a very good flat iron.</li>
            <li> More like worth $100!</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> it heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li> The heat controls are used easily without being changed accidentally.</li>
            <li> also said easy to use....</li>
            <li> I have strong, non-chemically treated hair (ginger here), so I use the highest setting (455 degrees).  </li>
            <li> This is the first flat iron I have ever had, and it worked excellent, I was able to get my hair to look how it looks when I leave salon.  </li>
            <li> warm up very fast</li>
            <li> Its a great iron and doesn&#x27;t leave a burning smell on your hair like most flat irons tend to do.</li>
            <li> quick and easy :)</li>
            <li> She loves the width and the ability to finely adjust temperature.</li>
            <li> I used mine on 300 and it worked just fine for my hair.</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> I think it takes more than 20 seconds to fully heat to this temperature, but it does it fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> got here quick!</li>
            <li> Super satisfied that it didn&#x27;t cost me a ton of money either.</li>
            <li> it arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> I should have been loyal to the brand!</li>
            <li> It heats up super fast and it&#x27;s a fair quality for the price.</li>
            <li> it feels very cheap, does not glide over my hair smoothly like my Chi, and makes a dingy &amp; cheap sounding noise when the plates come together when straightening.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be returning this item tomorrow and searching for a better iron very soon.</li>
            <li> Works fast and effective.</li>
            <li> Durable, tangle free</li>
            <li> She said it was silky smooth going through her hair.</li>
            <li> Overall I like it and happy with the product.</li>
            <li> no tugging , glides easily on just woken up hair or clean hair.</li>
            <li> but I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> but when I saw the reviews and how it says silk ceramic and how every one loves their silky smooth hair</li>
            <li> Glides smoothly across hair, doesn&#x27;t catch.</li>
            <li> It is a comfortable grip....</li>
            <li> Fantastic smoothing results and shine.</li>
            <li> this product is cheap</li>
            <li> interestingly enough that is about destroyed after a lot of usage, and it still works great with the clamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m like most ladies, I want my hair to look as good as it can on a regular basis!</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> This Flatiron works really good, I love the swivel handle and the digital settings.</li>
            <li> The temperature display is easy to read and the heat settings go higher than most.</li>
            <li> This straightener looks very nice, the pink plates are a cute accent.</li>
            <li> It was VERY powerful.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this flat iron, the temperature settings are great, heats up immediately.</li>
            <li> Great flat iron.</li>
            <li> I received my package pretty early, which is great, in</li>
            <li> It heats super fats and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Overall, a nice product!</li>
            <li> get real hot and works well</li>
            <li> I have never been able to find one that straightens cometely, fast, and makes my hair shiny!</li>
            <li> 100% original product</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this very happy with it works great on long thick hair.</li>
            <li> It is by far the best flat iron I have used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned one of the higher end flat iron brands, but Remington straighteners have always done a great job and lasted a long time for a great price.</li>
            <li> Normally, I purchase a 3&amp;#34; iron, but this baby is so efficient, that the 2&amp;#34; iron quickly and easily does a fabulous job!</li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t even put it to the full amount of 450 (like it says not to), and kept it around 350.  </li>
            <li> is my old one had a &#x27;comb&#x27; on the edge of it, I really liked that feature</li>
            <li> It was always a hassle to iron my hair that I would do it just every 6 months even though I love my hair straight.</li>
            <li> People have said on the reviews that it doesn&#x27;t grip their hair good enough.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t had any issues with burning my fingers and the handle stays cool), and it makes hair dry/frizzy</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and makes my hair shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li> I always had 1 inch plates only because I could never find a good 2 inch plate one.</li>
            <li> I love remington products since I use the wet2 straight</li>
            <li> Does the job, heats up fast and love</li>
            <li> I found this to be a great purchase, my hair is straighter, softer, and more shiny than when using my old Conair flat iron.</li>
            <li> Excellent flat iron, my hair looks very shine, and really silk.  </li>
            <li> Heats up very quickly and works very well!</li>
            <li> Good flat iron.  </li>
            <li> works well, heats quickly.  </li>
            <li> With just one pass over some spiral curls, it makes it so that they are just waves, another quick pass</li>
            <li> It heats and cools quickly and feels like a quality, sturdy product.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight, heats up quickly and does not snag my hair.</li>
            <li> durable, holds up to quite a bit of pressure from a medium quick release clamp before cracking the lower bezel,</li>
            <li> It is also very easy to hold and maneuver around, I was happily surprised to not get sore arms from straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> and it is very hot.</li>
            <li> First it makes my hair so silky smooth</li>
            <li> Gets very hot but does the work.  </li>
            <li> gets very hot .</li>
            <li> Also, their prices are very reasonable!  </li>
            <li> then head to work as it&#x27;s still very hot even after sitting for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> kept my hair silky smooth and straight!</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly, and the floating plates glide right over your hair, quickly straightening it.  </li>
            <li> This flat is the best in all of the flat irons I have ever bought.  </li>
            <li> Strangely it didn&#x27;t leave my hair as \\&quot;hot\\&quot; to touch as the Paul Mitchell, but it sure worked 3x better than the PM.</li>
            <li> This iron exceeded my expectations with the way it looks, how easy it is to use and how straight it got my hair and my sisters hair in just 1 pass.</li>
            <li> My beloved iron of 10+ years just died and wanted one similar to it and not expensive.</li>
            <li> So this heats ups very quick and gets very hot for being 2 inch flat iron very light weight</li>
            <li> I like this one better than my old one!  </li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, her older sister begs her to do her hair for special occasions!</li>
            <li> This is not my first Remington flat iron, and like the last one, this one is great!  </li>
            <li> It takes a couple extra minutes to heat up - give it about 10 mins to get nice and hot!  </li>
            <li> love this flat iron - easy to use and convenient, even for travel.</li>
            <li> But this is an amazing product especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and leaves ur hair feeling so silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic, and seems really durable.</li>
            <li> I also have the Remington curling wand &amp; it is nice to have the same controls on both.</li>
            <li> Worth the money and purchase.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much I bought a second one.</li>
            <li> I actually have the older model of this same straightener and have had it for 10 years and it still works awesome, so</li>
            <li> wait about five seconds before it gets super hot.</li>
            <li> It gets super hot.  </li>
            <li> The iron gets super hot, and I have burned my bangs with it.</li>
            <li> Replaced a really nice flat iron that I broke and got this one instead..</li>
            <li> Someone help me I can&#x27;t find the right adaptor/universal plug for this straightener, anyone else have used it and know what to do ?</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> The broad plates help expedite the straightening :)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull hair, smooth, high heat...</li>
            <li> Need less to say I am very happy with the product overall.</li>
            <li> This iron, will help normally crispy ends feel a bit smooth, but I still go and cut them off for healthier hair.</li>
            <li> Nice item for my daugthers long hair</li>
            <li> It was smooth, easy to slide through, and even I noticed that their hair came out better than usual.  </li>
            <li> Actually, it helps me since I usually trim my own hair, this flat iron gets my hair so straight, so quickly, that I can easily trim it and have it look great.</li>
            <li> Shipping was also very fast.</li>
            <li> Very very embarrassing</li>
            <li> Very much recommended.</li>
            <li> The larger width flat iron is great.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and does a great fast job on my thick, somewhat wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long fine blonde hair (true blondes have very fine texture).</li>
            <li> When we first turned it on, I think it fully heated up in about 15 seconds (like it said).</li>
            <li> Speechless when I first used it.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> It came in more than enough time for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love the digital display.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know exactly how hot they got.</li>
            <li> Works great and straightens my daughter&#x27;s thick hair fast!</li>
            <li> LOVE the digital feature,  the swirling cord is genius.</li>
            <li> and it is hot</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased that the plates are so big.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely buy this again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also gotten better with twirling it around chunks of hair for larger curls.</li>
            <li> it eventually arrived, I plugged it in and turned it on for the first time</li>
            <li> The top red part gets hot.</li>
            <li> Works great, even on my thick hair.</li>
            <li> lol, I have thick wavy/course hair and this iron</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues with frying or damaging, although my hair is naturally pretty resilient</li>
            <li> but this product isnt too hot for me</li>
            <li> But for sure I will go back to remington...</li>
            <li> thanks to amazon!</li>
            <li> I will probably get a better one later.</li>
            <li> It works very well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m saying first that this review is coming from a Remington user already.</li>
            <li> Used it this morning for the first time, and I coukd hear it shorting out/sparking inside as i was trying to use it.</li>
            <li> it warms realy high so quickly</li>
            <li> but it clearly was refurbished or something it did not even have the original packaging</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the T/Studio Silk Ceramic 2&amp;#34; flat iron I received from Remington to review on my blog.</li>
            <li> ; flat iron is quicker and straightens better than my 1&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Surely there must be a version of this flat iron where the controls are NOT on the handle where you have to hold it??!?</li>
            <li> The only thing I really love is that I can grasp my hair really close to the scalp.</li>
            <li> I love the way it heats up fast a lot of people seem to have a problem with the digital thermometer all you have to do</li>
            <li> , so I&#x27;ll say that it&#x27;s good enough for what I paid and much better than the old metal-plate flat iron I had in the old days.</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair straight on the first try.</li>
            <li> My hair looked straight and healthy-looking after using it, even in some hot humid weather, my hair didn&#x27;t frizz.</li>
            <li> I have pretty straight hair</li>
            <li> good basic flat iron.</li>
            <li> Besides sometimes the lock slides back and gets it stuck for a bit, this is a good flat iron.</li>
            <li> but this flat iron is so big and straightens so good that I don&#x27;t miss any hairs.</li>
            <li> The iron is high quality and works great on my course hair and my daughter&#x27;s thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Straightens my thick hair quickly and love the auto shut off!</li>
            <li> it stayed semi-curly (not really at the ends, mostly higher up) and took me more time.</li>
            <li> , she needed a certain temperature etc...</li>
            <li> You have to be sure to turn it down right away or you will burn your hair.</li>
            <li> My Chi works fine but only heats up to 410.</li>
            <li> The 60 second heat up time is definitely a plus, and the 455 degree max heat is even better!</li>
            <li> The buttons to change the heat is super useful as well; I don&#x27;t like to damage my hair with excessive heat so having the option to turn the temperature down was great.</li>
            <li> The flat iorn heated up very quickly ❗</li>
            <li> Heats up fast.  </li>
            <li> In 5 minutes, my hair was sleeker, shinier and looked so well groomed and just awesomely straight.</li>
            <li> , works really well.</li>
            <li> Was better than expected.</li>
            <li> but I can say it heats fast</li>
            <li> I will be buying this straightener from now on, HIGHLY recommended!</li>
            <li> so I can read what its really coming out to</li>
            <li> You would never know my hair wasn&#x27;t naturally straight after using it.</li>
            <li> I know these are very well made.</li>
            <li> as I felt like it helped hold my hair in there &amp; keep it straight instead of just ironing over a tangle.</li>
            <li> Life is so much easier now.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a burning scent on my hair and pre-heats fast.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Heats up fast.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Great for largers curls too and thin hair takes minutes to do.</li>
            <li> The package was very protected.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this straightener.</li>
            <li> I tried getting used to it because I really like it, but each time I tried to straighten my hair</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t take much to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> I still have to take my time to get my hair straight though.</li>
            <li> (I found it very snugly fits hair)</li>
            <li> i absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and I really like it despite the chips in the paint.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> /&gt;After much fustration and tape to try and keep the cord still</li>
            <li> Heats up fast.</li>
            <li> my bathroom lights flicker when this is plugged in even if I only have one light on</li>
            <li> This iron works very well.</li>
            <li> It keeps your hair straight all day.</li>
            <li> Amazingly fast.</li>
            <li> Design, temperature settings, ergonomics the whole nine.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for the price!</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast.  </li>
            <li> I only go over it once maybe twice near my roots where its more curly.</li>
            <li> The plastic on top of the plates also gets too hot to touch, so I can&#x27;t hold it down to flatten a thicker section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hair texture of fine, medium, course and even weaves will all be tamed with this flat iron.</li>
            <li> This flat iron not only gets your hair bone straight, it will leave your hair silky smooth and frizz free.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair but a lot of it, causing it to get thick and frizzy, and I have the Brazilian blowout, and this iron does not have a strong enough grip to really smooth my hair--it takes a couple of passes.</li>
            <li> I have always had long, straight, fine hair -- and a lot of it.</li>
            <li> Well, since my hair has gotten as long as it&#x27;s been since I discovered flattening irons, I decided that perhaps a 2 inch paddle would get the job done faster and possibly better as I was laboring over my hair using a Paul Mitchell iron for 10 minutes and still not really getting a sleek, smooth, well contoured look.</li>
            <li> highly recommended for really curly hair</li>
            <li> it stays straight with just some very gentle waves starting in the following days, and my hair is so soft and smooth afterwards!</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, and very long and this iron has no problem giving me a sleek, shiny look that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I had been happy with my old flat iron, but dropped it multiple times before it finally bit the dust.</li>
            <li> love the floating plates, I can really feel the difference when moving the iron down my hair, compared to normal plates.</li>
            <li> Both girls, one with thick wavy, the other with fine curly, loved it.</li>
            <li> I love the lock feature, you just hold down the &amp;#34;-&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Looking forever for a new 2-inch replacement, and this fits the bill!</li>
            <li> It takes so much less time and my hair looks so much better.</li>
            <li> This is so much better then way more expensive straighteners.</li>
            <li> The complaints are mainly the placement of the control buttons (they are on the handle</li>
            <li> I replaced an older Remington with this one.</li>
            <li> I have gone through about 5 different flat iron straighteners in the past year and this one is the best one I have used so far.</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron...doesn&#x27;t grab hair or pull....gets hot fast and works great...doesn&#x27;t get too hot near the scalp like my other does...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommended</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Also it has a high temperature which helps</li>
            <li> I wanted to get my next flat iron online for more options to chose from.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and the plates are AMAZING, It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair out and the plates closes on my hair tight enough to flatten my hair</li>
            <li> To start I have shoulder length hair that is extremely thick and very damaged from coloring..my hair is hard to manage even on my best days..</li>
            <li> As you can clearly see in the photo below, my hair is very curly.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair smooth and sleek with minimal work and fuss.</li>
            <li> It made my hair really shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Great heat up and works well on my long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> Normally I had to go over a piece of hair over like 3 or 4 times, not with this one.</li>
            <li> I really needed a 2 inch flat iron, this was the only available</li>
            <li> I have tried many flat irons/styling tools and they had taken me way too long (over an hour) to do.</li>
            <li> The value of this flat iron made by Remington is $37.99 and is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update - I contacted Remington using their customer service website - they promptly sent me return information with a promise of a new iron.  </li>
            <li> Live in Australia so just needed to buy adapter for usa to australia.</li>
            <li> I thought this item was brand new</li>
            <li> I have really thick curly hair and was able to get it so straight, like never before, in about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I like that the plates are nice and thin; I can get really close to the hairline to get unruly baby hairs without burning myself.</li>
            <li> My daughter-n-laws flat iron died right before Christmas and is lost without it...</li>
            <li> I turned down the temp a bit and straightened all of my naturally curly hair very quickly.</li>
            <li> I ordered a 2 inch wide plate flat iron and although it works, it&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have found, those little ones don&#x27;t cut it for thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I recently moved to a much more humid climate and this flatiron has worked really well to tame my frizzy hair after blow drying.</li>
            <li> the other remington wet to straight is much better</li>
            <li> Just used this flat iron for the first time today.</li>
            <li> I have never owned a flat iron that gets so hot before.</li>
            <li> GREAT for extra thick hair!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok iron not hot enough...takes a long time to straighten</li>
            <li> It heats up very fast (less than 20 seconds), cools down quickly, and gives consistent, even heat.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this flat iron, and after reading the previous reviews I expected it to be a good</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t damage my hair over time (I get bad damaged ends when I keep my hair curly and in ponytails actually), and I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for something that works great and will do something for the toughest to straighten hair around!</li>
            <li> I am natural with a kinky-curly hair type.</li>
            <li> Purchased for 19 year old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li> It definitely reduces getting ready time.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> Just wow ❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗</li>
            <li> It makes my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and I like the digital numbers.</li>
            <li> Was very embarrassing when I received this product I immediately gave my coworker as this was a present to her.</li>
            <li> I miss the old style from a couple of years ago</li>
            <li> I do not use straighteners to straighten but to smooth and style in place of a round brush.</li>
            <li> I recommend washing the day before and naturally drying.</li>
            <li> Ironed my natural hair with one pass.</li>
            <li> my 16 yr old asked for.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to repeat the same area to make it straight.</li>
            <li> The only problem is when using the iron you have to repeatedly have to straight your hair 4 or 5 times maybe that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that they would be too small for my long hair, but they are a nice size.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for me, and it pulls my hair if I am not careful to hold it</li>
            <li> It is fantastic and cuts my styling time in half!</li>
            <li> The handle has a nice grip and it doesn&#x27;t seem too bulky or hard to hold like my old Remington flat iron did.</li>
            <li> So far, these flat irons leaves my hair silky and straight.</li>
            <li> The bottom plate outer housing is the matte black and that part stays cool (nature of the type of plastic).</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to spend over $150 on a Chi or other big name when you can buy this for under $30 and works just as great... if not better!</li>
            <li> I have long hair that is very fine, very thick and very straight.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting perfection for a $20 flat iron (and I can&#x27;t really compare it to my Sedu)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t keep it long enough to test it much, but I ended up getting the Conair Infinity 2&amp;#34; and am much happier with it.</li>
            <li> I have extremely long and coarse hair and this flat iron only took an hour to get my hair soft, shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li> I really like this flat iron.</li>
            <li> This flat iron really does heat to any temp set in 20 seconds.</li>
            <li> works amazing than any other straighten irons I&#x27;ve used in my entire life and makes my hair looks silky, shiny and tamed, I love the color, and usually I have to put the temperature over 420 and up on other straighteners but on this one I only put it on 380!</li>
            <li> I mean the length, Remington&#x27;s flat irons are longer than most all other flat irons allowing me to put more hair in at a time.  </li>
            <li> I only hope it has some decent longevity and durability.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been so soft before, and I only have to run it through my hair once or twice, normally I would do it 3 or 4 times.</li>
            <li> For the OCD set, the iron shuts itself off so no more driving back home from work to make sure it is off.</li>
            <li> I did use it once and my hair looked better than when using my other flat iron but am returning it as I couldn&#x27;t use it easily with the broken part.</li>
            <li> and my hair doesn&#x27;t stay straight for as long as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> and I like it better than the lower temp flat irons I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I used this thing twice before giving in and spending just a little more money on my second Andis Brand ceramic flat iron, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> Apparently the high heat only applies to one plate</li>
            <li> 2 straight as long as this it out!</li>
            <li> My hair is really curly and with my old flat iron my hair would culr back up once I walked out of the house.</li>
            <li> even better than her much more expensive ones in the past.</li>
            <li> I saw that the reviews were pretty good for this one and it wasn&#x27;t that expensive compared to my other flat irons.</li>
            <li> love this flat iron, and I find myself straightening my hair with it at least once a week now, if not twice a week.</li>
            <li> An amazing flat iron that&#x27;s greats for thick and long hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for long - medium length hair</li>
            <li> It only straightens completely.</li>
            <li> It used to take me close to an hour to straighten my hair with my old (traditional, non-ceramic) iron.  </li>
            <li> I will review the Heatmaster as well since it only has one review so far (which is 5 stars).</li>
            <li> Love it for thin hair curls.</li>
            <li> I have had many Remington flat irons and this is by far the worse.</li>
            <li> so I do not have to take small strands and can get done with the process quite quickly.</li>
            <li> Her 8 year old flat iron was just yanking hair out.</li>
            <li> and I thought due to the god reviews that it would work really well.</li>
            <li> As a natural, I was looking for a replacement flat iron that did not fry my hair, snag my hair, or leave it brittle.</li>
            <li> , I gave up and had to then purchase a new flat iron from the local store.  </li>
            <li> My daughter begged for one of these, and while I was dead-set against it, I caved in to social stress.</li>
            <li> I have a 4+yr old wet-straight remington, and I just bought another remington blow dryer (my 2nd or 3rd</li>
            <li> It works very well for straightening my THICK, VERY CURLY hair.  </li>
            <li> I am willing to spend a little money to make this happen, within reason.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener for the wide plates and high temps.</li>
            <li> My nearly 10-year-old Sedu flat iron recently kicked the bucket, so I had to find an aletrnative.  </li>
            <li> Unlike my old iron, there&#x27;s no burning smell in the air (or in my hair) afterwards, and the long swivel cord gives you plenty of range.  </li>
            <li> I took a shower and blow dried it first, but I don&#x27;t recommend blow drying it.</li>
            <li> To start, when you plug it in, you can press the button to turn it on and if you want the highest temp, instead of having to keep pushing the temp up button, you can press and hold it down and it will go straight to 455F.</li>
            <li> The one I&#x27;ve used the last 4 years or so and that seemed to work well was the Remington Wet to Straight, after going through only 2 in 4 years I decided I wanted a different straightener.</li>
            <li> I have long, very coarse and curly hair (natural redhead).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Heats quickly &amp; straightens thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> I can get my hair (down to the middle of my back when straight, or like 5 inches shorter when curled up)</li>
            <li> but you really have to hold the straightener tightly for it to work</li>
            <li> I have a LOT of very thick curly hair and for the first time everrrr in 14 years I can straighten my hair &amp; it&#x27;s shiny!!</li>
            <li> My last ceramic flat iron pulled and snagged my hair out.</li>
            <li> No need to look further for a 2&amp;#34; flat iron.</li>
            <li> always accidentally push the off button or the heat setting buttons, but I can live with it since I only use this one a few times a week.</li>
            <li> I am caucasian, and have long slightly wavy hair that is normal or medium thickness.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a flat iron ..</li>
            <li> ; long cord, multiple heat settings...</li>
            <li> Being Christmastime, I didn&#x27;t want to spend another $100+ on a flat iron, so I poked around for an economy-priced one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Previously it would take me anywhere from 50-60 minutes to flat iron my hair.</li>
            <li> I received this flat iron today and to my surprise</li>
            <li> It was raining when I used the flat iron, so it could have effected the way my hair looks in some ways as it&#x27;s still poofy as the weather does that to a lot of people&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I have never had that happen with my flat irons.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this flat iron</li>
            <li> I would recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li> flat iron is an easy-to-use tool for hairstyling-impaired me.</li>
            <li> It does wonders on long hair and short cuts.!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that there was a flat iron out there</li>
            <li> I have had 6 flat irons in my life time but none of them come even close to this.</li>
            <li> and it does not need to be reapplied before flat ironing.</li>
            <li> But Long pressing the - (temp decrease button) makes a digital lock appear.</li>
            <li> Flat iron heats up to 455 degrees.</li>
            <li> Quality Flat Iron.</li>
            <li> This flat iron was not what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Well, I tried this flat iron by Remington</li>
            <li> I do not need to chase the comb while flat iron nor add any oil to my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of flat irons and this is a quality product.</li>
            <li> After doing lots of research I decided to get this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have owned two Andis brand ceramic flat irons in my life because they last so  long.</li>
            <li> , it gets too hot (you control the temp, for my thick hair</li>
            <li> No major complaints.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s purpose is to straighten your hair using heat, it&#x27;s not going to change your hair type and obviously heat will dry out hair).</li>
            <li> The iron has a slide at the bottom by the swivel cord to slide and hold flat iron closed for storage only.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the Wet 2 Straight one, so I reluctant to try this one.</li>
            <li> But this one, I can straighten my hair and it would be straight for at least 2 days with a like help here and there.</li>
            <li> Should have bought this long ago.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to wet</li>
            <li> Ghd takes too long on think hair long hair.</li>
            <li> To our surprise when she opened it there was this long scrape like appearance on the iron.</li>
            <li> Long press it again to remove the lock.</li>
            <li> it straightened my very curly, thick hair in around 25 minutes (including blow drying time).</li>
            <li> &amp; honestly I&#x27;m not sure if any new straightener has this-</li>
            <li> With my other flat iron, I would have to use a mini flat iron to accomplish that.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long this one lasts!  </li>
            <li> So I checked the other plate and it was only 370-400 degrees!!</li>
            <li> Next time I straighten my hair, everything looks even still, which was not always the case with other irons (meaning I must have missed some spots</li>
            <li> Has all the bells and whistles you need in a flat iron-- personalized heat setting and a toggle to keep it closed.  </li>
            <li> The only downside, is that due to the placement of the buttons, my hand often changes the temp setting on accident while using it.</li>
            <li> My last flatiron broke due to the thickness of my hair as I was trying to use it, and this one seems to handle the volume with ease.</li>
            <li> She loves not having to blow dry her hair before straightening it.</li>
            <li> This would have been bothersome with other flat irons since it would take me so long to do my hair, but</li>
            <li> I have been spending way too much money on expensive professional straighteners.</li>
            <li> can not live without.</li>
            <li> looks so pretty, and you don&#x27;t normally tough that part.</li>
            <li> I also found this flat iron cheaper on other websites so it was overpriced.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now just below my bra band length-wise down my back.</li>
            <li> They last about a year to a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> Only small tiny thing I&#x27;d like would be if it cooled a bit faster.</li>
            <li> It does straighten my wavy slight coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I actually LOOK FORWARD to using this every day -- You will not be disappointed :)</li>
            <li> This sounds crazy, but it&#x27;s like I have NEW HAIR thanks to this captain.</li>
            <li> There were deep scratches on the plates and handle and minor scratches all over the screen, handle and black bottom where it had be sat down.</li>
            <li> A little big</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, this heats up fast and does straighten my hair in no time at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the heavy side, but not annoyingly so and my arm doesn&#x27;t get tired.  </li>
            <li> My hair has been crazy soft and of course straight.</li>
            <li> but you need to hold it firmly pressed to work properly.</li>
            <li> Loves the wide plates.</li>
            <li> Automatic shut off for those of us who are forgetful.</li>
            <li> total waste of my money</li>
            <li> Granted I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times</li>
            <li> I have thick strawberry blonde hair, been told the individual hairs</li>
            <li> Then long press the power button to power down.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly and wavy (Puerto Rican) and I don&#x27;t feel as if the flat iron clamps down on my hair hard enough.</li>
            <li> Temp is not exactly on point, need a working infared thermometer</li>
            <li> Neither of my other irons had a temp gauge on them, just numbers (like 1-20)</li>
            <li> Compared to my other hair straightener, this gets an A++++++++++.</li>
            <li> It worked extremely well on my hair</li>
            <li> it can only straighten small amounts of hair at a time&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise</li>
            <li> Only thing is cord is too small.</li>
            <li> Well, she has NOT burned her hair off her head, nor her ears, neck, or any other body part.</li>
            <li> But, really, even if it bonks on me in a few months, for $35 and these results, I&#x27;m game for replacement.</li>
            <li> I wanted the wide plates like the previous one that I ordered and it&#x27;s nothing like it.  </li>
            <li> I put mine at 400° an had my very long hair (a little below my hips) straightened in 20 minutes!  </li>
            <li> I had read reviews prior to buying it and figured I would try it out even with all the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Doesnt create the same gloss and shine my wonderland ghd $300 but can say it works faster for thick hair clients</li>
            <li> just cause my old one was too thin and would take forever to straighten!!!Anyway</li>
            <li> I hated to spend that kind of money again</li>
            <li> It even squeaked running down my hair.</li>
            <li> The one problem I found with it is that because the controls are on the handle, I kept accidentally turning the temperature up and down</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve already got it down to about twenty minutes.  </li>
            <li> This takes so much less time than my other irons used to!</li>
            <li> I have medium thick hair and this flat iron just doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> disappointing, and now I have a new flat iron sitting in the cupboard that doesn&#x27;t even work!.</li>
            <li> less than 3 days!&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> it cut my hair straightning time in half or to less.</li>
            <li> and I wanted a 2 inch one so that it would take me less time.</li>
            <li> I am terrible at working with my hair, which is the main reason I have always worn it long &amp; straight.</li>
            <li> So I was greatly disappointed in how cheap this one felt.</li>
            <li> To start with, I have owned a Conair basic flat iron, an expensive ($100)</li>
            <li> , it does not clamp hair tightly</li>
            <li> My expensive flat iron went missing on our last trip.</li>
            <li> I just bought this because it was a little cheaper..</li>
            <li> but I was a little thrown off by the fact</li>
            <li> I have really thick, long, layered hair with just a bit of wave (Caucasian) and I flat iron to thin it out and reduce frizz.</li>
            <li> I have very thick coarse hair</li>
            <li> It is very loose, which makes it hard to straighten.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Takes just a few sweeps and my hair is done.</li>
            <li> Been using the flatiron for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> My oldest daughter has been using one for a few years now, so she is the resident &amp;#34;expert&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Did pull hair slightly once while straighting while head very thick long hair client.</li>
            <li> Now I can straighten my hair in half the time!</li>
            <li> and I just plain have a ton of hair on my head.</li>
            <li> I finally had to replace my 11 year old straightener :(.</li>
            <li> By the way I have thick  slightly wavy hair</li>
            <li> Very little damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> Smooths out hair with shine and, very little effort.  </li>
            <li> , I was shocked at how fast I straightened my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about two months, and it gives my hair awful static cling,</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy medium hair, I straighten it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday!</li>
            <li> I have thick and heavy</li>
            <li> The flat iron still has a weird smell when I use it.</li>
            <li> It was in a plain plastic bag with instructions NOT a retail package!</li>
            <li> I hate when flat irons catch your hair in tiny nooks and crannies of the product!</li>
            <li> hardly straightened...</li>
            <li> Will update if anything negative happens.</li>
            <li> This Remington thing just sucks.</li>
            <li> Can lock the temp in by holding the negative button for 3 seconds.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that takes a while to straighten so finding</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, shoulder-length hair and this iron works like a charm.  </li>
            <li> It does NOT yank random hairs like my other one did.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it I was shocked!</li>
            <li> Only had it for few months and it doesn&#x27;t work anymore :(</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed because I could have pick this up at a local store but used my prime to get a few dollars off.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers stated that their hair didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;skid&amp;#34; through the plates, but unfortunately mine does (which is strange since I have thin hair).  </li>
            <li> The plastic part covering the heat and power buttons was broken off so the buttons were hard to work.  </li>
            <li> But I like the broad base</li>
            <li> I bought this based on reviews to replace the one my daughters used, which they said was way too weak and took forever.  </li>
            <li> Takes a while, but at least it works!</li>
            <li> it was so thick!)</li>
            <li> It still gives indication of being on with the LED working and the heating progress bars running up and down, but remains cold.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and like that the cord swivels so it doesn&#x27;t get twisted.</li>
            <li> something is wrong with the voltage...</li>

            <li> One of the best i&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> es bastante buena comple las espectativas</li>
            <li> warm up very fast and that is good, but my hair hurts sometimes</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product.  It heats up very fast (less than 20 seconds), cools down quickly, and gives consistent, even heat.  However, it has stopped heating up after about 2 month&#x27;s use.  It still gives indication of being on with the LED working and the heating progress bars running up and down, but remains cold.  I&#x27;ll be contacting Remington to see what they can do for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - I contacted Remington using their customer service website - they promptly sent me return information with a promise of a new iron.  It arrived in good condition 2 weeks later; it appears to be brand new and works perfectly.  We&#x27;ll see how long this one lasts!  All I&#x27;m out is the return shipping on the defective iron.  No offer to pay that....</li>
            <li> Performs as advertised.</li>
            <li> I am natural with a kinky-curly hair type. This flat is the best in all of the flat irons I have ever bought.  I did not have to worry about heat damage and it straightened my hair with one or two passes.  I finally found one that did just what I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li> Wife is happy and it is not ever Christmas. Works fast and effective.</li>
            <li> exactly as described, very nice box it came in (easy to wrap), was a Christmas gift and it was a hit.  Bought one for myself and works great.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about two months, and it gives my hair awful static cling, like you rubbed my head with a balloon. I don&#x27;t like to use it any more.</li>
            <li> One of the best straighteners I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Heats quickly &amp; straightens thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this iron when I was doing a keratin treatment on my hair and needed something that would heat up to 450 degrees. My Chi works fine but only heats up to 410. I bought this at Target since I needed it immediately. I happen to own an infrared thermometer which measures surface temperatures with a light beam. I have used it in my oven, freezer, fridge, dinner, you name it. Well I turned the straightener on 455 degrees and waited for it to heat up and once it did, I measured the temp on one plate and it was only 200 degrees!! So I checked the other plate and it was only 370-400 degrees!! I waited about 30 minutes to see if it would heat up more as it stayed on longer but nope. Same temperatures. Apparently the high heat only applies to one plate but even that one doesn&#x27;t get to 455.&lt;br /&gt;Also it feels very cheap, does not glide over my hair smoothly like my Chi, and makes a dingy &amp; cheap sounding noise when the plates come together when straightening.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be returning this item tomorrow and searching for a better iron very soon.</li>
            <li> took some time to dial in what temp was best for my hair, but now that i have it dialed in i love it. Heats up fast.  This thing must draw a lot of power the lights flicker when I use it, I used it in the upstairs and downstairs bathroom as to try a different circut, the lights still flicker.&lt;br /&gt;I dont reccomend leaving this plugged in without supervision..</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife---she loves it.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on reviews to replace the one my daughters used, which they said was way too weak and took forever.  When we first turned it on, I think it fully heated up in about 15 seconds (like it said). It was VERY powerful. We didn&#x27;t even put it to the full amount of 450 (like it says not to), and kept it around 350.  Both girls, one with thick wavy, the other with fine curly, loved it. It was smooth, easy to slide through, and even I noticed that their hair came out better than usual.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Already had one and love it with temperature control.</li>
            <li> excellent 100 % insurance</li>
            <li> I was use iron . But smell like burn</li>
            <li> I have thick strawberry blonde hair, been told the individual hairs themselves are almost course and I just plain have a ton of hair on my head. It&#x27;s now just below my bra band length-wise down my back. I&#x27;m like most ladies, I want my hair to look as good as it can on a regular basis! I am willing to spend a little money to make this happen, within reason. I have bought and used MANY straighteners over the years (Chi, FHI, Paul Mitchell, and a variety of walmart bought brands like Revlon, etc). Well, since my hair has gotten as long as it&#x27;s been since I discovered flattening irons, I decided that perhaps a 2 inch paddle would get the job done faster and possibly better as I was laboring over my hair using a Paul Mitchell iron for 10 minutes and still not really getting a sleek, smooth, well contoured look. Was curious to see if the cheaper models had caught up with all the fancier ones and looked on here for reviews as I stood in walmart looking at the choices and selected this one based off the glowing reviews, took it home, plugged it in and within about 4 swipes, I was already in love!!!!! In 5 minutes, my hair was sleeker, shinier and looked so well groomed and just awesomely straight. Strangely it didn&#x27;t leave my hair as \\&quot;hot\\&quot; to touch as the Paul Mitchell, but it sure worked 3x better than the PM. This sounds crazy, but it&#x27;s like I have NEW HAIR thanks to this captain. I only hope it has some decent longevity and durability. But, really, even if it bonks on me in a few months, for $35 and these results, I&#x27;m game for replacement. GET THIS.</li>
            <li> Good flat iron.  Easy to use, works really well.</li>
            <li> Used this product on my lace front unit.  Received many compliments.  Everyone thought I did my hair.  Truly a flat-iron!</li>
            <li> Was better than expected. This iron exceeded my expectations with the way it looks, how easy it is to use and how straight it got my hair and my sisters hair in just 1 pass.</li>
            <li> Speechless when I first used it. This flat iron not only gets your hair bone straight, it will leave your hair silky smooth and frizz free. Your hair is left with a silky shine as if you wash, set and blow-dry your hair. Hair texture of fine, medium, course and even weaves will all be tamed with this flat iron. Girrrrrlllll, you need to get you one. 💁👍👌💖</li>
            <li> Really nice. I am still trying it out still but I can say it heats fast and it is very hot. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Was very easy to do my hair. Works real good.</li>
            <li> I have been straightening my hair for over 11 years now and have used so many straighteners I lost count. The one I&#x27;ve used the last 4 years or so and that seemed to work well was the Remington Wet to Straight, after going through only 2 in 4 years I decided I wanted a different straightener. I bought this straightener last night and I have to say this is the BEST straightener I have ever bought before and I didn&#x27;t have to spend a lot of money for it either. My hair has never been so soft before, and I only have to run it through my hair once or twice, normally I would do it 3 or 4 times. The 60 second heat up time is definitely a plus, and the 455 degree max heat is even better! I will be buying this straightener from now on, HIGHLY recommended! 5 stars!!!</li>
            <li> one of the best flat irons there is</li>
            <li> Great price&lt;br /&gt;Works good</li>
            <li> does the job and has the auto shut off</li>
            <li> Its excellent experience using it. It is really good and My friends asked me if I have done Hair Rebonding. It is really nice and I am loving it.</li>
            <li> Good price with good delivery.. I bought this device it&#x27;s wonderful</li>
            <li> Bought this for wife. So far so good.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a flat iron .. this is the one to get. simple as that.&lt;br /&gt;on off button, digital display of the temperature and curved edges which are key!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Very nice straightener... Durable, tangle free; long cord, multiple heat settings... My daughter&#x27;s hair looks beautiful when she uses it! She also turns it when she gets to the ends of her hair and it looks like she has curled the tips. :)</li>
            <li> My nearly 10-year-old Sedu flat iron recently kicked the bucket, so I had to find an aletrnative.  Being Christmastime, I didn&#x27;t want to spend another $100+ on a flat iron, so I poked around for an economy-priced one.  I like the size of the plates and the adjustable heat settings.  Some reviewers stated that their hair didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;skid&amp;#34; through the plates, but unfortunately mine does (which is strange since I have thin hair).  I wasn&#x27;t expecting perfection for a $20 flat iron (and I can&#x27;t really compare it to my Sedu), so I&#x27;ll say that it&#x27;s good enough for what I paid and much better than the old metal-plate flat iron I had in the old days.</li>
            <li> Only had it for few months and it doesn&#x27;t work anymore :(</li>
            <li> Love this! It works great! I even bought a second one for my daughter</li>
            <li> Temp is not exactly on point, need a working infared thermometer so I can read what its really coming out to</li>
            <li> I have very thick and wavy hair. It took me years to find a flat iron that works the best for me. This is by far the best one I have ever had. It heats up in seconds and the over all time it takes to do my hair has shortened drastically. You would never know my hair wasn&#x27;t naturally straight after using it. I love it!</li>
            <li> Great iron on my curly hair</li>
            <li> I love love love love this straightener. For the price, the value can&#x27;t be beat. I have thick hair that takes a while to straighten so finding a nice 2-inch iron was really exciting. With this straightener, I only have to do a couple passes and my hair is nice and silky. I always get compliments on my hair whenever I use this straightener on it. One of the best features of this iron is how fast it heats up. I only have to plug it in, wait about five seconds before it gets super hot. The buttons to change the heat is super useful as well; I don&#x27;t like to damage my hair with excessive heat so having the option to turn the temperature down was great.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, this heats up fast and does straighten my hair in no time at all. Very good value for the price!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron. Good product for the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for mother&#x27;s day. Her 8 year old flat iron was just yanking hair out. This has proven to be a great replacement. She loves the width and the ability to finely adjust temperature. She said it was silky smooth going through her hair. No problems with pulling or yanking hair out. Will update if anything negative happens.</li>
            <li> They love it. Works well.</li>
            <li> Purchased for 19 year old granddaughter.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> works well, heats quickly.  good basic flat iron.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister for Christmas. She absolutely loves it! She loves not having to blow dry her hair before straightening it. It definitely reduces getting ready time. I actually have the older model of this same straightener and have had it for 10 years and it still works awesome, so I know these are very well made. I recommend these to anyone who will listen! Shipping was also very fast. It came in more than enough time for Christmas.</li>
            <li> This item is just what I needed and hoped for!  It works very well for straightening my THICK, VERY CURLY hair.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> My hair is curly and wavy (Puerto Rican) and I don&#x27;t feel as if the flat iron clamps down on my hair hard enough. I use it on the highest setting, and I have to go over the same patch of hair two to three times. The only thing I really love is that I can grasp my hair really close to the scalp. With my other flat iron, I would have to use a mini flat iron to accomplish that. The flat iron still has a weird smell when I use it.</li>
            <li> I finally had to replace my 11 year old straightener :(. This straightener looks very nice, the pink plates are a cute accent. Love the digital display. I also have the Remington curling wand &amp; it is nice to have the same controls on both. I love the lock feature, you just hold down the &amp;#34;-&amp;#34; button &amp; it will lock the temperature so you don&#x27;t accidentally adjust it or turn it off while using it. The only thing I dislike- &amp; honestly I&#x27;m not sure if any new straightener has this- is my old one had a &#x27;comb&#x27; on the edge of it, I really liked that feature as I felt like it helped hold my hair in there &amp; keep it straight instead of just ironing over a tangle. Overall, a nice product!</li>
            <li> Excellent flat iron, my hair looks very shine, and really silk.  The turbo option is a great option, handle and easy to use.</li>
            <li> All Perfect, 100% recommended</li>
            <li> I buy this item after having my haircut, it works pretty good and easy to use. it heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li> This is so much better then way more expensive straighteners. I never straightened my hair because nothing worked. But this is an amazing product especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I have a 1 inch Remington straightener that I&#x27;ve had for 3 years and has been amazing. So I was greatly disappointed in how cheap this one felt. It even squeaked running down my hair. I didn&#x27;t keep it long enough to test it much, but I ended up getting the Conair Infinity 2&amp;#34; and am much happier with it.</li>
            <li> To start with, I have owned a Conair basic flat iron, an expensive ($100) Maxius MaxiGlide and now this Remington one. I have long, very coarse and curly hair (natural redhead).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously it would take me anywhere from 50-60 minutes to flat iron my hair. I always had to set it to the highest setting and felt that it was never enough. Neither of my other irons had a temp gauge on them, just numbers (like 1-20) so I don&#x27;t know exactly how hot they got. It was always a hassle to iron my hair that I would do it just every 6 months even though I love my hair straight. I also found that with my Maxis, my hair would start to get waves or curls in it again so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This iron is so much different! To start, when you plug it in, you can press the button to turn it on and if you want the highest temp, instead of having to keep pushing the temp up button, you can press and hold it down and it will go straight to 455F. I think it takes more than 20 seconds to fully heat to this temperature, but it does it fairly quickly. With just one pass over some spiral curls, it makes it so that they are just waves, another quick pass and it might have the tiniest bit of wave left in it. This takes so much less time than my other irons used to! I can get my hair (down to the middle of my back when straight, or like 5 inches shorter when curled up) that is some of the coarsest hair you will find (people used to say that it was like fishing line it was so thick!) done in 15 minutes. What a time saver! There is an auto power off feature that turns it off after an hour, but I don&#x27;t even get close to that time limit. This would have been bothersome with other flat irons since it would take me so long to do my hair, but no longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the floating plates, I can really feel the difference when moving the iron down my hair, compared to normal plates. It is also very easy to hold and maneuver around, I was happily surprised to not get sore arms from straightening my hair. I used to have to hold my others in weird ways and pull my hair out away from my head to get it all done, and this is just so much more simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my hair does not get all frizzy like it used to, it stays straight with just some very gentle waves starting in the following days, and my hair is so soft and smooth afterwards! Before you could always tell that I had it straightened because of the way it wasn&#x27;t so smooth, but this flat iron makes it look wonderful afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could always tell when I needed to cut my ends, the flattened ends would be crispy after using an iron on them. This iron, will help normally crispy ends feel a bit smooth, but I still go and cut them off for healthier hair. Actually, it helps me since I usually trim my own hair, this flat iron gets my hair so straight, so quickly, that I can easily trim it and have it look great. Next time I straighten my hair, everything looks even still, which was not always the case with other irons (meaning I must have missed some spots before).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this flat iron, and I find myself straightening my hair with it at least once a week now, if not twice a week. It doesn&#x27;t damage my hair over time (I get bad damaged ends when I keep my hair curly and in ponytails actually), and I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for something that works great and will do something for the toughest to straighten hair around!</li>
            <li> I received this flat iron today and to my surprise it came in an Amazon box with bubble wrap. It didn&#x27;t come in the manufacturer&#x27;s box and appeared to be used. The irons had an oily residue on them and the handle was scratched. I was very disappointed to say the least. Back in the box it went and back to Amazon it goes.</li>
            <li> I have flat irons of all sizes and brands, and this remington s9620 does a great job for the price!  It takes a couple extra minutes to heat up - give it about 10 mins to get nice and hot!  I dislike where the buttons are placed - always accidentally push the off button or the heat setting buttons, but I can live with it since I only use this one a few times a week.</li>
            <li> Has all the bells and whistles you need in a flat iron-- personalized heat setting and a toggle to keep it closed.  For the OCD set, the iron shuts itself off so no more driving back home from work to make sure it is off.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t burnt my hair yet!  And it looks great!</li>
            <li> Looking forever for a new 2-inch replacement, and this fits the bill! Great heat up and works well on my long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> Is a great flat iron and the best of everything is the heat and thr comfortable of the handle amazing</li>
            <li> This item was USED on arrival! It was in a plain plastic bag with instructions NOT a retail package! There were deep scratches on the plates and handle and minor scratches all over the screen, handle and black bottom where it had be sat down. It sizzled when i turned it on because there were hair oils/products all over the plates! I was really disappointed because I could have pick this up at a local store but used my prime to get a few dollars off.</li>
            <li> Love it! Love how it just glides through my hair.Now I can straighten my hair in half the time!</li>
            <li> Works great and straightens my daughter&#x27;s thick hair fast!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the T/Studio Silk Ceramic 2&amp;#34; flat iron I received from Remington to review on my blog. It is the perfect size for what I need for my hair. I have gone through about 5 different flat iron straighteners in the past year and this one is the best one I have used so far. As you can clearly see in the photo below, my hair is very curly. This product is a great one for all hair types. Its heat can get to 495 which is a salon heat. I used mine on 300 and it worked just fine for my hair. It was raining when I used the flat iron, so it could have effected the way my hair looks in some ways as it&#x27;s still poofy as the weather does that to a lot of people&#x27;s hair. The value of this flat iron made by Remington is $37.99 and is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this very happy with it works great on long thick hair.</li>
            <li> Love,love, love it. Heats up in 15 seconds. Very little damage to my hair. I use it everyday. Takes just a few sweeps and my hair is done. Should have bought this long ago. Life is so much easier now.</li>
            <li> The best iron that I&#x27;ve ever used. Doesn&#x27;t leave a burning scent on my hair and pre-heats fast.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the Wet 2 Straight one, so I reluctant to try this one. First it makes my hair so silky smooth and it makes my hair straight on the first try. Normally I had to go over a piece of hair over like 3 or 4 times, not with this one. I only go over it once maybe twice near my roots where its more curly. Would suggest anyone to try it! I will never go back to wet 2 straight as long as this it out!</li>
            <li> I have extremely long and coarse hair and this flat iron only took an hour to get my hair soft, shiny and smooth! I highly recommend it! I love that it doesn&#x27;t get tangled as I straighten each layer because it is so smooth and has fewer seams.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast. Good value for money. Fast delivery. Looks nice.  Live in Australia so just needed to buy adapter for usa to australia. Doesnt create the same gloss and shine my wonderland ghd $300 but can say it works faster for thick hair clients and I use ghd to finish off. Ghd takes too long on think hair long hair. So I used this and was faster. Good consistent heat. Did pull hair slightly once while straighting while head very thick long hair client. They also saw difference in shine finish. Overall I like it and happy with the product. Great for largers curls too and thin hair takes minutes to do. Love it for thin hair curls. Worth the money and purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 16 and I absolutely LOVE this 2 inch straighten iron!&lt;br /&gt;It works amazing than any other straighten irons I&#x27;ve used in my entire life and makes my hair looks silky, shiny and tamed, I love the color, and usually I have to put the temperature over 420 and up on other straighteners but on this one I only put it on 380! It heats up fast and the plates are AMAZING, It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair out and the plates closes on my hair tight enough to flatten my hair (:&lt;br /&gt;P.S&lt;br /&gt;1. I received my package pretty early, which is great, in less than 3 days!&lt;br /&gt;2. The package was very protected.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!</li>
            <li> Gets very hot but does the work.  Excellent.</li>
            <li> To start I have shoulder length hair that is extremely thick and very damaged from coloring..my hair is hard to manage even on my best days..this product is absolutely fabulous!! It heated up in seconds and allowed me to straighten my entire head in a matter of minutes!! Great product at a great price..can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this straightener. I really liked the design of it and I thought due to the god reviews that it would work really well. However, it seems to not hold my hair well at all. It is very loose, which makes it hard to straighten. I tried getting used to it because I really like it, but each time I tried to straighten my hair it stayed semi-curly (not really at the ends, mostly higher up) and took me more time.</li>
            <li> I just received this product in the mail, and had to use it immediately ❗ LOVE the digital feature,  the swirling cord is genius. The flat iorn heated up very quickly ❗ it didn&#x27;t take much to straighten my hair. It looks like I just got my hair done at the salon. I am amazed to be honest.  Best flat iron I owned.  Wow.  Just wow ❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗</li>
            <li> It gets super hot.  You have to be sure to turn it down right away or you will burn your hair. I have never had that happen with my flat irons.  It does not curl hair under either.  It only straightens completely. I would not recommend it for the price.</li>
            <li> I liked the size and price and the fact that it has ceramic plates. I still have to take my time to get my hair straight though. It&#x27;s alright, way better than what I had to deal with before. By the way I have thick  slightly wavy hair</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and does a great fast job on my thick, somewhat wavy hair.  I use the setting that comes on when I turn it on (380).  It&#x27;s a little on the heavy side, but not annoyingly so and my arm doesn&#x27;t get tired.  My thumb sometimes bumps up the heat by accident, so I just have to watch how I hold it.  Much better than my daughter&#x27;s, though, in that regard.</li>
            <li> This is good. A little big</li>
            <li> surprised at how great it does my hair!!!!</li>
            <li> get real hot and works well</li>
            <li> Its a great iron and doesn&#x27;t leave a burning smell on your hair like most flat irons tend to do. I would recommend this flat iron</li>
            <li> lightweight and works beautifully -- easy to handle and maneuver; very packable so good for travel -- better than the minis for that purpose</li>
            <li> I really like this flat iron. It makes my hair really soft. It heats up fast and I like the digital numbers. People have said on the reviews that it doesn&#x27;t grip their hair good enough. I have not had that problem. I would recommend this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have always had long, straight, fine hair -- and a lot of it. I am terrible at working with my hair, which is the main reason I have always worn it long &amp; straight. My hair is very smooth &amp; slippery, and breaks/frizzies drive me nuts because they ruin the sleek look that I&#x27;m trying to go for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flat iron is an easy-to-use tool for hairstyling-impaired me. It makes my hair smooth and sleek with minimal work and fuss. I am seriously a Hair Idiot, and I can get this product to work satisfactorily. That makes it #1 in my book!</li>
            <li> This product does what it should- it straightened my very curly, thick hair in around 25 minutes (including blow drying time). I had read reviews prior to buying it and figured I would try it out even with all the negative reviews. If you are on the fence, definitely try it! The complaints are mainly the placement of the control buttons (they are on the handle but I had no issues with hitting them by accident and there is a lock function to ensure you don&#x27;t accidentally change the setting), it does not clamp hair tightly (I found it very snugly fits hair), it gets too hot (you control the temp, for my thick hair I use 400 degrees and it is hot but I haven&#x27;t had any issues with burning my fingers and the handle stays cool), and it makes hair dry/frizzy (it&#x27;s purpose is to straighten your hair using heat, it&#x27;s not going to change your hair type and obviously heat will dry out hair). I found this to be a great purchase, my hair is straighter, softer, and more shiny than when using my old Conair flat iron. It&#x27;s a great buy and works as advertised, I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> love it! product works great.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for! Heats up fast and makes my hair shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok iron not hot enough...takes a long time to straighten</li>
            <li> can not live without. oh my goodness. i love this product. gets very hot . i use on 400 and also use a comb, so i dont burn my fingers. it cut my hair straightning time in half or to less. no tugging , glides easily on just woken up hair or clean hair. i absolutely recommend this product. the red color rocks. you will love the results.</li>
            <li> The best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had!!!!!! I Luv the automatic cutoff and the quick heat up time!!! I recommend this item 4 everyone!</li>
            <li> Love it! My beloved iron of 10+ years just died and wanted one similar to it and not expensive. I like this one better than my old one!  It does NOT yank random hairs like my other one did. It glides over very smooth. Its very light for its size.</li>
            <li> I saw this online and wondered if it would be the same using it. Well, I love it....It does wonders on long hair and short cuts.! Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Was very embarrassing when I received this product I immediately gave my coworker as this was a present to her. To our surprise when she opened it there was this long scrape like appearance on the iron. It looked like the paint was raising. Very very embarrassing</li>
            <li> Works well but you need to hold it firmly pressed to work properly. Didn&#x27;t have that issue with a Conair one I used for 15 years. It&#x27;s lightweight and like that the cord swivels so it doesn&#x27;t get twisted.</li>
            <li> Excellent, I turned out better than I expected&lt;br /&gt;I loved, let me straight hair and is faster than me under the hair</li>
            <li> Good. Works very well.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this flat iron, the temperature settings are great, heats up immediately. Loves the wide plates. Quicker finish and lesser passes.</li>
            <li> Someone help me I can&#x27;t find the right adaptor/universal plug for this straightener, anyone else have used it and know what to do ? It&#x27;s also scratched a bit when I didn&#x27;t even use it</li>
            <li> Just used this flat iron for the first time today. I&#x27;m so pleased that the plates are so big. I was concerned that they would be too small for my long hair, but they are a nice size. My hair looked straight and healthy-looking after using it, even in some hot humid weather, my hair didn&#x27;t frizz. The handle has a nice grip and it doesn&#x27;t seem too bulky or hard to hold like my old Remington flat iron did. The one problem I found with it is that because the controls are on the handle, I kept accidentally turning the temperature up and down and once even turned it off accidentally before I could finish doing my hair. Hopefully will get better at avoiding those buttons as I use it more. Surely there must be a version of this flat iron where the controls are NOT on the handle where you have to hold it??!?</li>
            <li> purchase for my daughter and she wasn&#x27;t very happy with it said it didn&#x27;t work like she expected it to.</li>
            <li> I♡it!...works so well, I was shocked at how fast I straightened my hair. I have really thick curly hair and was able to get it so straight, like never before, in about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have found, those little ones don&#x27;t cut it for thick hair.  I miss the old style from a couple of years ago but I&#x27;ve kept up with this brand.  They last about a year to a year and a half.  I have thick wavy medium hair, I straighten it everyday.  I have never had problems with the plates burning my hair or me.  I love this one.</li>
            <li> Good from todo Venezuela</li>
            <li> Piece of crap. Don&#x27;t buy this. I would buy Andis Brand. I have owned two Andis brand ceramic flat irons in my life because they last so  long. I just bought this because it was a little cheaper.. big mistake I used this thing twice before giving in and spending just a little more money on my second Andis Brand ceramic flat iron, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. This Remington thing just sucks.</li>
            <li> This is an AWESOME straightener! I have never been able to find one that straightens cometely, fast, and makes my hair shiny! This straightener does all three. I have a LOT of very thick curly hair and for the first time everrrr in 14 years I can straighten my hair &amp; it&#x27;s shiny!! In the past I had a very expensive straightener that didn&#x27;t do the trick and this was WAYY cheaper. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I have long hair that is very fine, very thick and very straight. I do not use straighteners to straighten but to smooth and style in place of a round brush. I love this straightener. I like the wider plates since I do not need precision straightening. The heat controls are used easily without being changed accidentally. The temperature display is easy to read and the heat settings go higher than most. I would absolutely buy this again!</li>
            <li> Best straightener I have EVER used! Heats up fast and straightens my hair perfectly!</li>
            <li> Great straightner for the price!</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walmart for $41. But I recommend getting it here as you&#x27;ll save $10. No matter $41 or $32 it&#x27;s worth it!!!!! More like worth $100! I have never owned a flat iron that gets so hot before. I put mine at 400° an had my very long hair (a little below my hips) straightened in 20 minutes!  I took a shower and blow dried it first, but I don&#x27;t recommend blow drying it. I had to use a lot of oil to keep it from drying out. I recommend washing the day before and naturally drying. My hair is silky and beautiful!!!! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is not my first Remington flat iron, and like the last one, this one is great!  I have very thick coarse hair and this works great on my hair.  I have tried Chi&#x27;s, Rusk, you name it, and I like the Remington the best, I think one of the biggest reasons I like their flat irons is because of the size of the plates, Im not talking about the width, I mean the length, Remington&#x27;s flat irons are longer than most all other flat irons allowing me to put more hair in at a time.  Also, their prices are very reasonable!  The only downside, is that due to the placement of the buttons, my hand often changes the temp setting on accident while using it.</li>
            <li> I baught this straightner about 3 months ago and im inlove with it, my hair alwaysnlooks amazing. Best buy everrr.</li>
            <li> I have tried many flat irons/styling tools and they had taken me way too long (over an hour) to do. I also wasn&#x27;t completely  satisfied with the results. So I decided to look again and I wanted a 2 inch one so that it would take me less time. I saw that the reviews were pretty good for this one and it wasn&#x27;t that expensive compared to my other flat irons. The first time I tried it I was shocked! It takes so much less time and my hair looks so much better. I didn&#x27;t think that there was a flat iron out there give these results.</li>
            <li> This is the first flat iron I have ever had, and it worked excellent, I was able to get my hair to look how it looks when I leave salon.  So glad I got it.</li>
            <li> Been using the flatiron for a few weeks. So far, so good. It&#x27;s my first, so no basis of comparison (hence the 4 stars) but I really enjoy it. I recently moved to a much more humid climate and this flatiron has worked really well to tame my frizzy hair after blow drying. I&#x27;ve also gotten better with twirling it around chunks of hair for larger curls. No major complaints. Only small tiny thing I&#x27;d like would be if it cooled a bit faster. I tend to have to turn it off and leave it out in the morning then head to work as it&#x27;s still very hot even after sitting for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> It was beautifully packaged and deliver well within expectation set.  The iron is high quality and works great on my course hair and my daughter&#x27;s thick curly hair.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I gave this four stars because when I opened the plastic it was in and pulled the straightener out the straighteners paint had chipped off some. It looked like it had been dropped or scraped on something. It works amazing though and I really like it despite the chips in the paint.</li>
            <li> Nice item for my daugthers long hair</li>
            <li> omg! I have had 6 flat irons in my life time but none of them come even close to this. I always had 1 inch plates only because I could never find a good 2 inch plate one. I wanted to get my next flat iron online for more options to chose from. I came accost this! I have used Remington before with no issues but when I saw the reviews and how it says silk ceramic and how every one loves their silky smooth hair I just had to have it! I believe  you will too</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter for Christmas this year.  She&#x27;s very happy with it!</li>
            <li> bought it for my sister and she loves it. i dont know what else to write since it&#x27;s not for me . highly recommended</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener for the wide plates and high temps. The iron gets super hot, and I have burned my bangs with it. I turned down the temp a bit and straightened all of my naturally curly hair very quickly. It made my hair really shiny and soft. I talked one of my friends into buying one too.</li>
            <li> Got it for my girlfriend Christmas 2013 and she loves it! It heats up super fast and it&#x27;s a fair quality for the price. Very much recommended.</li>
            <li> perfect great product!</li>
            <li> Everything went well with this order.</li>
            <li> My wife love the hair straightener she have a better brand but she loves this one more an A++++. Thanks</li>
            <li> Besides sometimes the lock slides back and gets it stuck for a bit, this is a good flat iron. My hair is really curly and with my old flat iron my hair would culr back up once I walked out of the house. But this one, I can straighten my hair and it would be straight for at least 2 days with a like help here and there.</li>
            <li> love this flat iron - easy to use and convenient, even for travel.</li>
            <li> So this heats ups very quick and gets very hot for being 2 inch flat iron very light weight I gave this a 4 star because when its on it smells like burning plastic but it does straighten my hair great I have very thick, frizzy, wavy/curly hair but I was a little thrown off by the fact I thought this item was brand new but it clearly was refurbished or something it did not even have the original packaging but it it breaks on me or anything I will update this review but for the price its the best straightener I have used so far.</li>
            <li> Thank you order arrive very well in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> I ordered this flat iron, and after reading the previous reviews I expected it to be a good iron.&lt;br /&gt;After it eventually arrived, I plugged it in and turned it on for the first time and it made terrible &#x27;sizzling/electrical&#x27; shorting noises and would not stay on it kept turning it&#x27;s self off.&lt;br /&gt;After much fustration and tape to try and keep the cord still, I gave up and had to then purchase a new flat iron from the local store.  I should have done this from the start!!.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing, and now I have a new flat iron sitting in the cupboard that doesn&#x27;t even work!.</li>
            <li> It was good but you really have to hold the straightener tightly for it to work and my hair doesn&#x27;t stay straight for as long as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> works great! got here quick! I use it almost everyday!</li>
            <li> Love this. Heats up fast. Can lock the temp in by holding the negative button for 3 seconds. Automatic shut off for those of us who are forgetful. Glides smoothly across hair, doesn&#x27;t catch. My hair has been crazy soft and of course straight.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.....something is wrong with the voltage...my bathroom lights flicker when this is plugged in even if I only have one light on...would have returned it but tossed out the box it came in.....total waste of my money</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron...doesn&#x27;t grab hair or pull....gets hot fast and works great...doesn&#x27;t get too hot near the scalp like my other does...It is a comfortable grip....</li>
            <li> I bought this 2 inch model. I have long fine blonde hair (true blondes have very fine texture). I set mine to 340 degrees so I do not fry my very fine hair. I also use Tresseme heat protectant spray rated 450 degrees, before blow drying and it does not need to be reapplied before flat ironing.The floating plates do not ever snag or grab / bite at my hair. My last ceramic flat iron pulled and snagged my hair out. This flat iron really does heat to any temp set in 20 seconds. The digital lines stop moving when it is to temp. There is no rebound wait time on heat while using. The buttons are where your hand is. But Long pressing the - (temp decrease button) makes a digital lock appear. Long press it again to remove the lock. Then long press the power button to power down. The iron has a slide at the bottom by the swivel cord to slide and hold flat iron closed for storage only. This iron works very well. I love mine. I bought mine in a Target store at launch day. The top red part gets hot. I don&#x27;t mind, I have no kids and the red part looks so pretty, and you don&#x27;t normally tough that part. The bottom plate outer housing is the matte black and that part stays cool (nature of the type of plastic). Fantastic smoothing results and shine. Winner. This coming from a former Cosmetologist.</li>
            <li> Safe shopping. Perfect product! I recommend for women and stylists. has no case or brushes. i like it. this product is cheap</li>
            <li> I have been spending way too much money on expensive professional straighteners. This is perfect, straightens my hair like no one&#x27;s business and the price is right!</li>
            <li> An amazing flat iron that&#x27;s greats for thick and long hair.I have very thick hair but this flat iron is so big and straightens so good that I don&#x27;t miss any hairs.I am telling you..I was so relieved after buying it just cause my old one was too thin and would take forever to straighten!!!Anyway I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Flat iron heats up to 455 degrees. Ironed my natural hair with one pass. Did not but burn or damage my hair.</li>
            <li> Nice item and good voltages</li>
            <li> Excellent, very good.</li>
            <li> I like  the hair straightener, but the only problem I have with this is that it heats up where  I hold the iron (the handle). It does straighten my wavy slight coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Quality Flat Iron. Heats up very quickly and works very well! I like the locking feature too.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and leaves ur hair feeling so silky smooth. I would sooo recommend this product</li>
            <li> Works great. Compared to my other hair straightener, this gets an A++++++++++. Straightens my horrible unmanageable hair. Takes a while, but at least it works!</li>
            <li> bought for present.  This is product my 16 yr old asked for.  Has not been used yet.  Looks good in box.</li>
            <li> Works great! I highly recommend it. It keeps your hair straight all day. Also it has a high temperature which helps</li>
            <li> Great Product. Excellent service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was exactly as described and I am extremely happy wiyh the results it provides.</li>
            <li> We love it! Works great on longer thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to handle&lt;br /&gt;salon quality hair after use. Highly recommend for long - medium length hair</li>
            <li> Honestly I wasn&#x27;t happy with it because of the results I would get when I would straighten my mildly curly hair at 380 degrees. But when i straighten my hair at 455 degrees it leaves my hair with my desired results but i still wish it would straighten my hair at a lower temperature.</li>
            <li> Amazing price. Amazing heat. Amazingly fast. Love love love this. You don&#x27;t need to spend over $150 on a Chi or other big name when you can buy this for under $30 and works just as great... if not better!</li>
            <li> Works great, even on my thick hair. Very happy with this product!!</li>
            <li> hardly straightened... the other remington wet to straight is much better</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and it is a great product for the price.  I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I really needed a 2 inch flat iron, this was the only available so I took a chance and purchased the product and I&#x27;m glad I did. It worked extremely well on my hair and I am racially mixed up lol, I have thick wavy/course hair and this iron did the trick! Super satisfied that it didn&#x27;t cost me a ton of money either. I have irons that are triple the price and this one works just as good! Much better than Chi I think, but this is only my experience. Need less to say I am very happy with the product overall. Design, temperature settings, ergonomics the whole nine.</li>
            <li> Works perfect! quick and easy :)</li>
            <li> This item works great.</li>
            <li> My daughter-n-laws flat iron died right before Christmas and is lost without it... so perfect for a Christmas gift... well she has used a Chi for years and I thought I would get the same, she needed a certain temperature etc... well reading the revenues of this one I decided to take a chance... she told me she loved it...  she had on complaints and loves that it gets even hotter... also said easy to use.... and the outside you can touch without getting burned...</li>
            <li> Would never spend anymore on a straightener after my experience with this one. Straightens my thick hair quickly and love the auto shut off!</li>
            <li> After buying another hair straightener for my wife which stopped working after 2 times, I got this one. This time my wife was happy as it is working fine.</li>
            <li> I ordered a 2 inch wide plate flat iron and although it works, it&#x27;s just ok.  This flat iron was not what I wanted.  I wanted the wide plates like the previous one that I ordered and it&#x27;s nothing like it.  I also found this flat iron cheaper on other websites so it was overpriced.</li>
            <li> As a natural, I was looking for a replacement flat iron that did not fry my hair, snag my hair, or leave it brittle. Well, I tried this flat iron by Remington and I love it. So far, these flat irons leaves my hair silky and straight. I do not need to chase the comb while flat iron nor add any oil to my hair. I hope these last me for a while!</li>
            <li> I love this straightener. I have used about 3 or 4 but this one is perfect! I have frizzy hair and I have no problems getting all of the frizz out with this straightener! I deffinatly recommend this!!</li>
            <li> What a good shopper my granddaughter is!!!  This flat iron that she chose is perfect and she loves it and uses it a lot!</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair but a lot of it, causing it to get thick and frizzy, and I have the Brazilian blowout, and this iron does not have a strong enough grip to really smooth my hair--it takes a couple of passes.I can&#x27;t use this iron if I am in a hurry because:&lt;br /&gt;1) you can&#x27;t turn it off by hitting the power button&lt;br /&gt;2) it can only straighten small amounts of hair at a time&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise I am impressed with the ceramic plates, I have noticed that my hair is so smooth and pretty after spending time styling it. I also love that it gets to 455°F (the iron does gethot to the touch). Overall it&#x27;s okay but I wish it had a better grip</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of flat irons and this is a quality product. I loved it so much I bought a second one.</li>
            <li> Nice and hot and the thermostat is great</li>
            <li> I have really thick, long, layered hair with just a bit of wave (Caucasian) and I flat iron to thin it out and reduce frizz. This 2&amp;#34; flat iron is quicker and straightens better than my 1&amp;#34;. The max temp is probably the highest I would use on my hair type and I like it better than the lower temp flat irons I&#x27;ve used in the past. It heats and cools quickly and feels like a quality, sturdy product. I like that the plates are nice and thin; I can get really close to the hairline to get unruly baby hairs without burning myself. I&#x27;ve never owned one of the higher end flat iron brands, but Remington straighteners have always done a great job and lasted a long time for a great price. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with frying or damaging, although my hair is naturally pretty resilient and I don&#x27;t get any color or treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The button placement could be better. I keep accidentally pressing them and changing temp or turning it off. The plastic on top of the plates also gets too hot to touch, so I can&#x27;t hold it down to flatten a thicker section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this I just got it yesterday curl my hair this morning I love the way it heats up fast a lot of people seem to have a problem with the digital thermometer all you have to do is tap the power button to see what the temperature is it&#x27;s not a big deal over all I give this an excellent star rating because it works</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife, she loves it. Works fine. Good buy.</li>
            <li> Made a good gift for her</li>
            <li> So far works very good. Only thing is cord is too small.</li>
            <li> Excellent, good to deal with</li>
            <li> I love remington products since I use the wet2 straight it has 420 degrees but feel like 455... but this product isnt too hot for me so glad the amazon let me do the refund. But for sure I will go back to remington... thanks to amazon!</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron.  I replaced an older Remington with this one.</li>
            <li> My expensive flat iron went missing on our last trip. I hated to spend that kind of money again so I opted for this inexpensive one. It is fantastic and cuts my styling time in half! The larger width flat iron is great.</li>
            <li> Great hair straightener. Heats up very fast and straightens really good.</li>
            <li> Direct replacement for the one my wife had that quit working and works perfectly</li>
            <li> This Flatiron works really good, I love the swivel handle and the digital settings. It&#x27;s good for all hair types and leaves it smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> This is a very good flat iron. It heats super fats and it is easy to use. Absolutely recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> 100% original product</li>
            <li> Best hair straightener I&#x27;ve purchased in a while. Granted I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks but I love how it feels as I&#x27;m straightening my hair. It doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s frying it and I don&#x27;t have to repeat the same area to make it straight. Give my hair a nice shine. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> This item was delivered in a box way too big with 2 air packs that had no air in them.  The plastic part covering the heat and power buttons was broken off so the buttons were hard to work.  I did use it once and my hair looked better than when using my other flat iron but am returning it as I couldn&#x27;t use it easily with the broken part. Too bad.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, shoulder-length hair and this iron works like a charm.  It used to take me close to an hour to straighten my hair with my old (traditional, non-ceramic) iron.  I&#x27;ve only used this a few times and I&#x27;ve already got it down to about twenty minutes.  It heats up quickly, and the floating plates glide right over your hair, quickly straightening it.  I have strong, non-chemically treated hair (ginger here), so I use the highest setting (455 degrees).  Unlike my old iron, there&#x27;s no burning smell in the air (or in my hair) afterwards, and the long swivel cord gives you plenty of range.  Great product, and it arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> Great buy! Plug in and set the required temperature. And you are good to go! The broad plates help expedite the straightening :)</li>
            <li> Just ok. Replaced a really nice flat iron that I broke and got this one instead..nothing great, but it works. I will probably get a better one later.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do it for me. I have medium thick hair and this flat iron just doesn&#x27;t cut it. I have had many Remington flat irons and this is by far the worse.</li>
            <li> I absolutely, positively LOVE this iron!!! It is by far the best flat iron I have used. My hair is fine, and very long and this iron has no problem giving me a sleek, shiny look that lasts all day. It is lightweight, heats up quickly and does not snag my hair. Truly, it is great quality for a reasonable price. Normally, I purchase a 3&amp;#34; iron, but this baby is so efficient, that the 2&amp;#34; iron quickly and easily does a fabulous job! I actually LOOK FORWARD to using this every day -- You will not be disappointed :)</li>
            <li> So far, my daughter describes this flat-iron as perfect.</li>
            <li> Great!!!! I love remington!!!</li>
            <li> It working well for now</li>
            <li> It was a great deal. The wife loves it.</li>
            <li> This iron works great for my hair. I have thick and heavy so I don&#x27;t find a lot of irons that work for my hair. The only problem is when using the iron you have to repeatedly have to straight your hair 4 or 5 times maybe that&#x27;s just me. Overall I recommend this iron</li>
            <li> Bought this for my teen daughter. She says she loves it! even better than her much more expensive ones in the past.</li>
            <li> very good. it warms realy high so quickly</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping, Great Product</li>
            <li> After doing lots of research I decided to get this flat iron. I had been happy with my old flat iron, but dropped it multiple times before it finally bit the dust. I should have been loyal to the brand! I opened this Remington and while it has some good qualities (heats up quickly, allows you to get close to the scalp) it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for me, and it pulls my hair if I am not careful to hold it just right. I am caucasian, and have long slightly wavy hair that is normal or medium thickness. I hate when flat irons catch your hair in tiny nooks and crannies of the product! I don&#x27;t want to feel like I&#x27;m breaking my hair every time I straighten it. I am going back to my 1-1/2&amp;#34; Heatmaster!!! It even seemed to make my hair shinier than this Remington. I will review the Heatmaster as well since it only has one review so far (which is 5 stars).</li>
            <li> Honestly I have only used this twice, but I have to say it is the best one ever. Operates flawlessly. Great price too. Very happy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best that I bought</li>
            <li> love it! kept my hair silky smooth and straight!</li>
            <li> durable, holds up to quite a bit of pressure from a medium quick release clamp before cracking the lower bezel, interestingly enough that is about destroyed after a lot of usage, and it still works great with the clamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if only it worked at lower temperatures...</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it!! It works very well! And at a great price!</li>
            <li> My daughter begged for one of these, and while I was dead-set against it, I caved in to social stress. Well, she has NOT burned her hair off her head, nor her ears, neck, or any other body part. She LOVES THIS APPLIANCE! As a matter of fact, her older sister begs her to do her hair for special occasions! :)  My oldest daughter has been using one for a few years now, so she is the resident &amp;#34;expert&amp;#34;... She is impressed by this machine though, and gave her sister a thumbs-up! I give it a thumbs-up as well!</li>
            <li> My daughter has ethnic hair and she uses this all the time to straighten her hair. She loves it and especially the fact she only Has to go over a section one time. Very nice product.</li>
            <li> Great flat iron. Does the job, heats up fast and love it has a shut off after 1 hour for that just in case you wonder if you left them on as you have just arrived at work.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t use anything else</li>
            <li> very good, the product is 100% original, arrival time estimated.. 100% Recommend.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Doesn&#x27;t pull hair, smooth, high heat...highly recommended for really curly hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m saying first that this review is coming from a Remington user already. I have a 4+yr old wet-straight remington, and I just bought another remington blow dryer (my 2nd or 3rd one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is VERY cheaply made, and flimsy. I was worried the moment I opened it when I received it yesterday 31 March. Used it this morning for the first time, and I coukd hear it shorting out/sparking inside as i was trying to use it. It would not even stay on! Returning it later today. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> A very good quality item.</li>
            <li> On time shipment, excellent product.</li>
            <li> Great product, thank you.</li>
            <li> Came in time and as described</li>
            <li> The best flat iron I ever used or owned!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron.  Turns horrible,dry coarse hair into sleek, shiny hair.  Highly recommend for the price!</li>
            <li> I really like this. I have pretty straight hair so I can not talk about the capacity. But I like the broad base so I do not have to take small strands and can get done with the process quite quickly.</li>
            <li> GREAT for extra thick hair!! Works fantastic, and seems really durable. My last flatiron broke due to the thickness of my hair as I was trying to use it, and this one seems to handle the volume with ease.</li>
            <li> I suggest you buy this.  Works amazing</li>
            <li> Heats up fast.  Smooths out hair with shine and, very little effort.  No need to look further for a 2&amp;#34; flat iron.</li>
