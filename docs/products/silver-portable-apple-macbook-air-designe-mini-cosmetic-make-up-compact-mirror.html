            <li>I love how detailed it is down to the USB cut outs and writing on the underside.</li>
            <li>Its pretty much what they said it was.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this is such a great gift to anyone at any age.</li>
            <li>I was super happy I actually received the silver one since other sellers send the white one instead.</li>

            <li>Unlike some other reviewers, I got the exact thing I was expecting.</li>
            <li>got mine in around 11 days(shipped to texas)the cons are that the bubbles on the bubble wrap were popped and that probably explains why the front of the mirror was had several scratches,and also the mirror does stand by itself BUT only on a flat surface at a precise 90Â° angle,but it other than that it lays flat 180Â°</li>
            <li>very unhappy.wanted to give as little stocking stuffer gift</li>

            <li> Got this as a gift for my friend&#x27;s cockatiel, who has picky taste in laptops. The bird was very satisfied. He spends a lot of time looking at himself in the reflection in between doing his taxes and wasting time on facebook.</li>

            <li> I loved this mini apple macbook mirror,but when it arrived inside of the mirror had scratches..other than the scratches everything was fine . i absolutely loved the inside part. the keyboard was Very detailed.  :-)</li>
            <li> I love this with a passion. I ended up buying two!</li>
            <li> got mine in around 11 days(shipped to texas)the cons are that the bubbles on the bubble wrap were popped and that probably explains why the front of the mirror was had several scratches,and also the mirror does stand by itself BUT only on a flat surface at a precise 90Â° angle,but it other than that it lays flat 180Â°,the pros are it ships surprisingly faster than i imagined and it is well designed and the inside is not scratched ,very cute and unique for a compact mirrorðŸ‘Œ</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than predicted. Perfect size &amp; the details on the keys are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Lid is a bit loose, though, &amp; can&#x27;t stand up on its own.&lt;br /&gt;I know the first time I drop it, it&#x27;s going to be history, but for now it&#x27;s worth the cheap price.</li>

            <li> I was super happy I actually received the silver one since other sellers send the white one instead. Absolutely adorable and a conversation starter. I love how detailed it is down to the USB cut outs and writing on the underside. It&#x27;s just like my real one. The only thing is it came a bit scratched.</li>
            <li> It took a month to arrive, and after using it a few times, the mirror fell out and shattered. It says high quality in the description, and this is the opposite of that.

            <li> this is pretty well made. looks a lot like the real thing, took forever to get it but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Thank you  this will make a good Easter basket gift for my granddaughter  just as described in ad  Thank you</li>
            <li> Its pretty much what they said it was. I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so detailed to the smallest keyboard. It&#x27;s just as it is advertised. Perfect unique gift for literally anyone. I gave this as a gift to my friend and the whole party wanted to get one too. I bought 5 of these already. The only concern I have about this is that when it was shipped, many of them have minor scratches on the lid of the computer and some minor paint scratches. Other than that, this is such a great gift to anyone at any age.</li>
            <li> sucks, the product is of poor quality, with scrapes and scratches, paint sucks.</li>
