            <li>You owe it to him to be as superficially perfect as you can!</li>
            <li>results were BEAUTIFUL!</li>
            <li>Best gift idea ever!</li>

            <li>My bush is beautiful.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been a great ride.</li>
            <li>LOL @</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t worry betches, this story has a happy ending...</li>
            <li>just one of the happy, lightly-minded girls of the Barbie Doll Army.</li>
            <li>good advice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t find out until I ruined what could have been a perfectly good peanut butter sandwich.  </li>
            <li>&quot;, she beemed, her face a wonderful, excited colour, unlike the monochromatic monstrosity between her legs.</li>
            <li>The best time to do this, I have found, it right after waking up or in the shower.  </li>
            <li>We also know that the fat, balding, underachieving, middle-aged shlub we married will ditch us in a moment for that man-stealing ho Miss Universe if we aren&#x27;t superficially perfect at all times.</li>
            <li>, my labia shines more brightly than a glow worm, day and night.</li>
            <li>That really, honestly happened.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve found this product.</li>
            <li>Just watch Nan&#x27;s face light up at Christmas time!</li>
            <li>We both enjoyed ourselves as I waxed her squack and</li>
            <li>Just think ... if it weren&#x27;t for your product, many women might not even consider the color of their labia to be a problem at all.</li>
            <li>Women walking around with gray, discolored vaginas in their pants and feeling totally OKAY about it?</li>
            <li>Sure, she still went to the hairdressers once a fortnight, and sure, she always took care of her clothes and makeup.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;It&#x27;s jewelery, isn&#x27;t it darling, you know I love jewelery\\</li>
            <li>We really did have a great two months.</li>
            <li>, I do all of this and more with gusto.</li>
            <li>will never find the words to truly articulate just how transformational, life-changing and liberating this outstanding product is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the ease of application of this product.  </li>
            <li>but I was hoping for more.</li>
            <li>This one seems to work more on the skin than the pubes.</li>
            <li>So much for a surprisingly attractive nether region.</li>
            <li>But with the first application, I experienced the cautionary burning sensation...which then advanced to rash, hives...and bleeding when I couldn&#x27;t stop itching.</li>
            <li>She just points her crotch in the direction she wants to go.&lt;br /&gt;After introducing your amazing product to some of her girl friends, they have decided to start their own rock band.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking of manufacturing a competitor for this product with a far more imaginative name:  MINGE TINGE!</li>
            <li>Speaking of the color, the Day-Glo pink hue that this product imparts on my potato is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Our unions payed billions of dollars to perfect the day glow pink hue</li>
            <li>The MD I had to visit probably got more excited treating the symptoms than hubby will.  </li>

            <li>I would hope that most intelligent human beings would follow suit.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>MNPB is an industry leading special effect makeup created by our top labia color and design experts.</li>
            <li>Looks great, but I could not say the same for the taste.</li>
            <li>That was the most fun 9-months of my life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic brazillian (the bikini waxing method</li>
            <li>I look fresh as a daisy, youthful and energetic, like a 10-year-old captain of the swim team hanging out with his pals in the locker room playing snap-the-towel.  </li>
            <li>My life has become a little more awesome thanks to you.</li>
            <li>Originally posted by &#x27;Me&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, for the first time, I am able to articulate my issue aloud.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this overwhelms all the natural hints of artesian springwater and any nascent floral undertones, drowning it out in something that can best be described as a mixture of cherry sports drink and stale lipstick.</li>
            <li>However, we now make sure to keep a stock of latex gloves available for those \\&quot;intimate times\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>God forbid if I should ever fall victim to the normal aging process and also be cursed with a husband, who would be unconcerned with how perfect my body is for him.</li>
            <li>i have the most amazing fuschia lips , i regularly get them out when im dancing because im now so proud of them , a friend offered me a disco ball and a smoke machine for my arse just because they are so purdy to look at :) thanks for my pink button betty</li>
            <li>LIGHT your home with the radiant glow from your freshly polished labia majora.  </li>
            <li>Had my wife been afforded this opportunity to remain good enough, there&#x27;s the possibility we would still be together today.</li>
            <li>If you get to a point in your life that you feel it&#x27;s necessary to change the color of your labia in order to feel good about yourself, you should perhaps re-examine your priorities.</li>
            <li>And then, oh, sweet Jesus, what&#x27;s this?</li>
            <li>She was over the moon, it was as easy to apply as a new coat of creosote to the shed, and all most as much fun too.</li>
            <li>getting to the root of the problem is exactly what this product does!</li>
            <li>I be the first to say this is an outrage!</li>
            <li>Just walking around with this fluorescent tool in my pants is enough to give me a great new outlook on life.  </li>
            <li>This does result in my having a pink hand for the rest of the day, but I figure people will be impressed by the vibrant, lively color of my palms.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really quite important that the world knows that.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>Satin texture, notes of nori, and a light, gently musky finish.</li>
            <li>palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For crying out loud, if this is to truly benefit the femmes, how better to bring joy than to invite the gentleman caller to linger awhile at the dessert table?</li>
            <li>And all this with a minimum of permanent scarring and complete loss of sexual response - but who needs that anyway, sex is for men!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I to have known that I could still have found worth in my wife via the illusory restorative properties of this product</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, came with an extra sampler pack, which was nice.</li>
            <li>the dye really brought out the original finish.</li>
            <li>Nice, flat toned stomach.</li>
            <li>Because remember ladies, no man wants you to look natural, if everything about yourself isn&#x27;t a lie, you will never find true love.</li>
            <li>me tell all you peasants out there that just because this is publicly available now does not mean we wont always be pioneers in labia special effects, just now we are working on a new secret formula that is the perfect shade of tangerine which we are sure will make your husbands and boyfriends reject your blinding pink beef curtains and come calling for stage lighting on lovely tangerine flesh.</li>
            <li>I could never tell if I was on my period or not, and turns out I was pregnant the whole time.</li>
            <li>This product&#x27;s use of the words \\&quot;restore\\&quot; and \\&quot;youthful hue\\&quot; to describe the bubblegum-pink of the idealized white woman&#x27;s vulva is damaging to the sexual confidence of all non-white women.</li>
            <li>(Truly, I believe he isn&#x27;t interested in me at all, just my checkbook.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks MNPB!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t even aware of my embarrassing genital discoloration before I stumbled across this product.</li>
            <li>My psychiatrist recommended that I take proactive steps to ease my passage into my twilight years, and this product was my first idea.  </li>
            <li>If it gets on your skin, peanut butter actually works better than soap to remove it.</li>
            <li>I nearly peed my colorless panties!!!!</li>
            <li>I wish they sold bigger sizes or maybe bulk packs like at Costco, because I think my girlfriend needed a few more applications to really start looking good</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it came in some other colors.</li>
            <li>Oh good gracious, if only there were a way I could have known such a product exists a month ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although I am considered by many to be an attractive individual, I have harboured a shameful secret for years which has severely hampered my self-esteem and overall ability to socialise, enter in to meaningful dialogue with others, or indeed interact with people on any level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(The most natural of natural ingredients!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li>It comes in Pink so is suitable for women of all ages.</li>
            <li>I, quite reasonably, was becoming increasingly upset by the dulling of her petals, and was finding it increasingly difficult not to find my penile solace between the folds of younger, more brightly coloured vaginae.</li>
            <li>cream goes on smooth but its pretty hard to get off fingers or most clothes.</li>
            <li>and it caused an acute scene on Christmas morning when little Jackson opened what he thought was lip balm in front of grandma- just before she opened</li>
            <li>/&gt;While my online searches didn&#x27;t really bring up the results</li>
            <li>You know that stuff isn&#x27;t really jelly at all?  </li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>you so much for this product, I owe the function of my body to the men who came up with this life saving</li>
            <li>but they were very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And the color of her crotch hadn&#x27;t really changed that much.</li>
            <li>I ordered this with visions of surprising hubby on our anniversary with the &amp;#34;new me&amp;#34;...or at least sprucing up that part of me.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend hasn&#x27;t noticed the difference yet (he prefers to do it with the lights off, eyes closed), but one of these days I&#x27;m going to \\&quot;accidentally\\&quot; show him my sexy new vagina and prepare to get skewered!  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had somewhat better luck with other types of dye.</li>
            <li>What was once reserved for the elite echelons of adult film is now available for the general public?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>New Pink Button has never been tested on animals (so if it burns your skin off or causes cancer that&#x27;s your problem) and contains twenty disposable applicators (so you&#x27;ll be able to fool him twenty times!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The most glaring issue with My New Pink Button is its poor-quality flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They usually have a good deal on rush shipping, just remember to ask first, same with re-orders, you get 10% off</li>
            <li>Now having intercourse doesn&#x27;t feel as much like necrophilia anymore, but rather brings back sweet memories of having sex with 16 year old Croatian prostitutes, much like I used to do during the war!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>after 6 kids my foofoo was less \\&quot; rosy hue\\&quot; more \\&quot; the scream\\&quot; by Edvard Munch</li>
            <li>Not serious, eh?.</li>
            <li>I got the ole misses some of this cooter cream cause although she is a classic let</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t want a man who&#x27;s not shallow,</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve come to anticipate that level of quality and character from this particular vintner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Her freshly painted poonani now looks less like a badly packed kebab and more like a more a newly budding rose.  </li>
            <li>While the rest of my bloated lush body got sweaty and lackluster throwing back drinks and grinding up against a cloud of Axe body sprayed men to the latest MyCy jam, my vajay stayed as pink and fresh (from a distance) as ever.</li>
            <li>For a long time I have felt my sex lust decreasing, much due to the fact that my wife is getting older and lesser attractive for each year.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>, she most likely would still be alive, saving enormous costs.</li>
            <li>AMAZE your friends with your new look.  </li>
            <li>One of the side-effects is possible burning and pain -- make you vulva all pink and irritated, so sexy and not-serious.</li>
            <li>It comes with 20 disposable applicators, which I image are for female use, but I discovered that it is much quicker to simply dip the tip of my dirigible into the dye and spread it along the shift with a quick up-and-down motion of the hand.  </li>
            <li>that this fine medical professional obviously did (he&#x27;s probably using the googles)</li>
            <li>I had to purchase a handheld mirror large enough to steady with my thighs.</li>
            <li>I gotta say, after years of winning the game of aneorexia, hair dye, a great pancake make-up tone that hides my acne, botox,  designer clothes and shoes, implants, skin bleaching for my freckles, and other \\&quot;little</li>
            <li>so my labia is still lovely and pink, but I had no idea it went grey.</li>
            <li>And this brings its own problems as you only have 12 minutes before the ambulance arrives in which to make up a plausible excuse for just how you ended up trapped down the side of your loo with 2 hand mirrors and a glass topped vanity case..............</li>
            <li>Traditionally, I would uncork a new bottle alongside an appropriate pairing to experience it in its intended context, but I never went so far with this brazen cocktail, as it was clear it would destroy an naturally-occurring subtlety in its intended location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>ever* see clearly again.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will clear up in time for hubby&#x27;s birthday in another month.</li>
            <li>completely offensive.</li>
            <li>It has revitalized our sex life completely.</li>
            <li>Does any woman over the age of ten really need to be told not to go merrily daubing her cooter with mystery substances? \\&quot;Natural\\</li>
            <li>I am 21 years old and have not had a child nor am I on hormonal birth control.</li>
            <li>, I went ahead and used some old make-up brushes I had lying</li>
            <li>anyone really wants a home remedy to make their labia smaller and redder, then poultry shears are the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After considering the use of this product, I smile to myself as I know that I will walk around town with the confidence that everyone will somehow automatically know that I have pink, prim and youthful looking labia.</li>
            <li>&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean safe (see: hemlock, stonefish, sulfuric acid).</li>
            <li>As a 27-year-old, I recognize that I have begun the long decline into old age, senility, and most importantly, pale and gray old-man genitalia.  </li>
            <li>Each night I&#x27;d take at least one new guy home with me, and dude, the free drinks did.</li>
            <li>ENTICE your gentleman friend with just how pink your cooch really can be!  </li>
            <li>little Baby Gaga was delivered in the club&#x27;s bathroom by a super muscular bouncer (and, yes,</li>
            <li>No longer am I housebound, bemoaning the fact that I cannot enjoy the simple things in life like other women, such as cooking for my husband, doing laundry or painting my nails - now</li>
            <li>My only question comment is that I wish it had that new car smell, or maybe leather.</li>
            <li>Clearly some scab has gone and leaked the secret formula and supplied this precious gem to all you prudish peasants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>wife of four years had been showing significant signs of decreased labian tone, and it had been the cause of much consternation between us.</li>
            <li>I will post a second review as soon as I get a woman&#x27;s response to seeing this product in action.  </li>
            <li>Someday the company needs to start making a travel size or a cleaner scrub, because she was always spilling it, which really gets on your nerves when its such an expensive item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to most people</li>
            <li>Instead of a pairing as gauche as salmon and wild thimbleberry pate with a can of 4-Loko, the makers of My New Pink Button should investigate ways to complement the native fauna.</li>
            <li>Her labia, once vibrant, had lost their rosy pink hue.</li>
            <li>Bought Mrs Seal a tin of My New Pink Button for her birthday.</li>
            <li>All my friends seem to be handling the aging process with style and class; I&#x27;ve been having more trouble coping than usual.  </li>
            <li>A single application was sufficient to demonstrate a complete rework of the flavor profile is in order.</li>
            <li>New Pink Button is the answer!</li>
            <li>Buy My New Pink Button today!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you My New Pink Button!</li>

            <li> That was the most fun 9-months of my life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fantastic brazillian (the bikini waxing method</li>
            <li> I look fresh as a daisy, youthful and energetic, like a 10-year-old captain of the swim team hanging out with his pals in the locker room playing snap-the-towel.  </li>
            <li> My life has become a little more awesome thanks to you.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Now, for the first time, I am able to articulate my issue aloud.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> this overwhelms all the natural hints of artesian springwater and any nascent floral undertones, drowning it out in something that can best be described as a mixture of cherry sports drink and stale lipstick.</li>
            <li> However, we now make sure to keep a stock of latex gloves available for those \\&quot;intimate times\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> God forbid if I should ever fall victim to the normal aging process and also be cursed with a husband, who would be unconcerned with how perfect my body is for him.</li>
            <li> i have the most amazing fuschia lips , i regularly get them out when im dancing because im now so proud of them , a friend offered me a disco ball and a smoke machine for my arse just because they are so purdy to look at :) thanks for my pink button betty</li>
            <li> LIGHT your home with the radiant glow from your freshly polished labia majora.  </li>
            <li> Had my wife been afforded this opportunity to remain good enough, there&#x27;s the possibility we would still be together today.</li>
            <li> If you get to a point in your life that you feel it&#x27;s necessary to change the color of your labia in order to feel good about yourself, you should perhaps re-examine your priorities.</li>
            <li> And then, oh, sweet Jesus, what&#x27;s this?</li>
            <li> She was over the moon, it was as easy to apply as a new coat of creosote to the shed, and all most as much fun too.</li>
            <li> getting to the root of the problem is exactly what this product does!</li>
            <li> I be the first to say this is an outrage!</li>
            <li> Just walking around with this fluorescent tool in my pants is enough to give me a great new outlook on life.  </li>
            <li> This does result in my having a pink hand for the rest of the day, but I figure people will be impressed by the vibrant, lively color of my palms.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really quite important that the world knows that.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> Satin texture, notes of nori, and a light, gently musky finish.</li>
            <li> palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For crying out loud, if this is to truly benefit the femmes, how better to bring joy than to invite the gentleman caller to linger awhile at the dessert table?</li>
            <li> And all this with a minimum of permanent scarring and complete loss of sexual response - but who needs that anyway, sex is for men!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I to have known that I could still have found worth in my wife via the illusory restorative properties of this product</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, came with an extra sampler pack, which was nice.</li>
            <li> the dye really brought out the original finish.</li>
            <li> Nice, flat toned stomach.</li>
            <li> Because remember ladies, no man wants you to look natural, if everything about yourself isn&#x27;t a lie, you will never find true love.</li>
            <li> me tell all you peasants out there that just because this is publicly available now does not mean we wont always be pioneers in labia special effects, just now we are working on a new secret formula that is the perfect shade of tangerine which we are sure will make your husbands and boyfriends reject your blinding pink beef curtains and come calling for stage lighting on lovely tangerine flesh.</li>
            <li> I could never tell if I was on my period or not, and turns out I was pregnant the whole time.</li>
            <li> This product&#x27;s use of the words \\&quot;restore\\&quot; and \\&quot;youthful hue\\&quot; to describe the bubblegum-pink of the idealized white woman&#x27;s vulva is damaging to the sexual confidence of all non-white women.</li>
            <li> (Truly, I believe he isn&#x27;t interested in me at all, just my checkbook.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks MNPB!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t even aware of my embarrassing genital discoloration before I stumbled across this product.</li>
            <li> My psychiatrist recommended that I take proactive steps to ease my passage into my twilight years, and this product was my first idea.  </li>
            <li> If it gets on your skin, peanut butter actually works better than soap to remove it.</li>
            <li> I nearly peed my colorless panties!!!!</li>
            <li> I wish they sold bigger sizes or maybe bulk packs like at Costco, because I think my girlfriend needed a few more applications to really start looking good</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it came in some other colors.</li>
            <li> Oh good gracious, if only there were a way I could have known such a product exists a month ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although I am considered by many to be an attractive individual, I have harboured a shameful secret for years which has severely hampered my self-esteem and overall ability to socialise, enter in to meaningful dialogue with others, or indeed interact with people on any level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (The most natural of natural ingredients!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li> It comes in Pink so is suitable for women of all ages.</li>
            <li> I, quite reasonably, was becoming increasingly upset by the dulling of her petals, and was finding it increasingly difficult not to find my penile solace between the folds of younger, more brightly coloured vaginae.</li>
            <li> cream goes on smooth but its pretty hard to get off fingers or most clothes.</li>
            <li> and it caused an acute scene on Christmas morning when little Jackson opened what he thought was lip balm in front of grandma- just before she opened</li>
            <li> /&gt;While my online searches didn&#x27;t really bring up the results</li>
            <li> You know that stuff isn&#x27;t really jelly at all?  </li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> you so much for this product, I owe the function of my body to the men who came up with this life saving</li>
            <li> but they were very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the color of her crotch hadn&#x27;t really changed that much.</li>
            <li> I ordered this with visions of surprising hubby on our anniversary with the &amp;#34;new me&amp;#34;...or at least sprucing up that part of me.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend hasn&#x27;t noticed the difference yet (he prefers to do it with the lights off, eyes closed), but one of these days I&#x27;m going to \\&quot;accidentally\\&quot; show him my sexy new vagina and prepare to get skewered!  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had somewhat better luck with other types of dye.</li>
            <li> What was once reserved for the elite echelons of adult film is now available for the general public?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> New Pink Button has never been tested on animals (so if it burns your skin off or causes cancer that&#x27;s your problem) and contains twenty disposable applicators (so you&#x27;ll be able to fool him twenty times!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The most glaring issue with My New Pink Button is its poor-quality flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They usually have a good deal on rush shipping, just remember to ask first, same with re-orders, you get 10% off</li>
            <li> Now having intercourse doesn&#x27;t feel as much like necrophilia anymore, but rather brings back sweet memories of having sex with 16 year old Croatian prostitutes, much like I used to do during the war!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> after 6 kids my foofoo was less \\&quot; rosy hue\\&quot; more \\&quot; the scream\\&quot; by Edvard Munch</li>
            <li> Not serious, eh?.</li>
            <li> I got the ole misses some of this cooter cream cause although she is a classic let</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t want a man who&#x27;s not shallow,</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve come to anticipate that level of quality and character from this particular vintner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Her freshly painted poonani now looks less like a badly packed kebab and more like a more a newly budding rose.  </li>
            <li> While the rest of my bloated lush body got sweaty and lackluster throwing back drinks and grinding up against a cloud of Axe body sprayed men to the latest MyCy jam, my vajay stayed as pink and fresh (from a distance) as ever.</li>
            <li> For a long time I have felt my sex lust decreasing, much due to the fact that my wife is getting older and lesser attractive for each year.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> , she most likely would still be alive, saving enormous costs.</li>
            <li> AMAZE your friends with your new look.  </li>
            <li> One of the side-effects is possible burning and pain -- make you vulva all pink and irritated, so sexy and not-serious.</li>
            <li> It comes with 20 disposable applicators, which I image are for female use, but I discovered that it is much quicker to simply dip the tip of my dirigible into the dye and spread it along the shift with a quick up-and-down motion of the hand.  </li>
            <li> that this fine medical professional obviously did (he&#x27;s probably using the googles)</li>
            <li> I had to purchase a handheld mirror large enough to steady with my thighs.</li>
            <li> I gotta say, after years of winning the game of aneorexia, hair dye, a great pancake make-up tone that hides my acne, botox,  designer clothes and shoes, implants, skin bleaching for my freckles, and other \\&quot;little</li>
            <li> so my labia is still lovely and pink, but I had no idea it went grey.</li>
            <li> And this brings its own problems as you only have 12 minutes before the ambulance arrives in which to make up a plausible excuse for just how you ended up trapped down the side of your loo with 2 hand mirrors and a glass topped vanity case..............</li>
            <li> Traditionally, I would uncork a new bottle alongside an appropriate pairing to experience it in its intended context, but I never went so far with this brazen cocktail, as it was clear it would destroy an naturally-occurring subtlety in its intended location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ever* see clearly again.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will clear up in time for hubby&#x27;s birthday in another month.</li>
            <li> completely offensive.</li>
            <li> It has revitalized our sex life completely.</li>
            <li> Does any woman over the age of ten really need to be told not to go merrily daubing her cooter with mystery substances? \\&quot;Natural\\</li>
            <li> I am 21 years old and have not had a child nor am I on hormonal birth control.</li>
            <li> , I went ahead and used some old make-up brushes I had lying</li>
            <li> anyone really wants a home remedy to make their labia smaller and redder, then poultry shears are the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After considering the use of this product, I smile to myself as I know that I will walk around town with the confidence that everyone will somehow automatically know that I have pink, prim and youthful looking labia.</li>
            <li> &quot; doesn&#x27;t mean safe (see: hemlock, stonefish, sulfuric acid).</li>
            <li> As a 27-year-old, I recognize that I have begun the long decline into old age, senility, and most importantly, pale and gray old-man genitalia.  </li>
            <li> Each night I&#x27;d take at least one new guy home with me, and dude, the free drinks did.</li>
            <li> ENTICE your gentleman friend with just how pink your cooch really can be!  </li>
            <li> little Baby Gaga was delivered in the club&#x27;s bathroom by a super muscular bouncer (and, yes,</li>
            <li> No longer am I housebound, bemoaning the fact that I cannot enjoy the simple things in life like other women, such as cooking for my husband, doing laundry or painting my nails - now</li>
            <li> My only question comment is that I wish it had that new car smell, or maybe leather.</li>
            <li> Clearly some scab has gone and leaked the secret formula and supplied this precious gem to all you prudish peasants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wife of four years had been showing significant signs of decreased labian tone, and it had been the cause of much consternation between us.</li>
            <li> I will post a second review as soon as I get a woman&#x27;s response to seeing this product in action.  </li>
            <li> Someday the company needs to start making a travel size or a cleaner scrub, because she was always spilling it, which really gets on your nerves when its such an expensive item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to most people</li>
            <li> Instead of a pairing as gauche as salmon and wild thimbleberry pate with a can of 4-Loko, the makers of My New Pink Button should investigate ways to complement the native fauna.</li>
            <li> Her labia, once vibrant, had lost their rosy pink hue.</li>
            <li> Bought Mrs Seal a tin of My New Pink Button for her birthday.</li>
            <li> All my friends seem to be handling the aging process with style and class; I&#x27;ve been having more trouble coping than usual.  </li>
            <li> A single application was sufficient to demonstrate a complete rework of the flavor profile is in order.</li>
            <li> New Pink Button is the answer!</li>
            <li> Buy My New Pink Button today!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you My New Pink Button!</li>
            <li> ...... its bad enough that we are supposed to wax off every single hair that dares to raise its little follicle, - just how are we expected to check what colour our bits are seeing as by the time they lose their \\&quot; rosy hue\\&quot; many of us acquire a rounder tum that means any investigation of the nether regions requires a system of mirrors to rival the ballroom at Versailles and a flexibility of the lower limbs that is no longer easily achievable..and is majorly reliant on the juxtaposition of the loo and bathroom sink...</li>
            <li> If a fruity flavor is truly necessary, for example to mask an ambergris base, a lighter wilder flavor may work better, such as Pacific wild strawberry, or even a modest infusion of kiwi,</li>
            <li> Its patented \\&quot;natural\\&quot; \\&quot;formula\\&quot; (wink wink) is guaranteed to remove what other, lesser women call \\&quot;normal vaginal coloration\\&quot; and replace it with pink perfection!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now started checking my vagina in the mirror every day to make sure it&#x27;s still pink, and I&#x27;ve ordered a couple of tubs of this stuff in preparation for the day it all goes wrong.  </li>
            <li> I encourage others with disappointing frontal flowers to embrace the wonder that is now available via My New Pink Button, as this could save lives, as well as marriages.</li>
            <li> Can you imagine having a grey labia AND pubes.</li>
            <li> all this means nothing if you have grey labia.</li>
            <li> Why settle for plain old chocolate, flowers or books.</li>
            <li> are celebrating the holidays in a foreign country next year.</li>
            <li> my new common law husband)</li>
            <li> While I know there are others worse off than me in life (for example, women with freckles, naturally kinky hair or sagging breasts), this physical deformity undermined my confidence to the extent that I could never transcend the sheer horror and self disgust which weighed down my existence.</li>
            <li> , there wasn&#x27;t actually a Brazillian down there!)</li>
            <li> Without any of the pain, expense, or hassle of using an industrial irritant to turn your lips pink and swollen.  </li>
            <li> I like to imagine women having to shield their eyes in wonder and pain as the neon pink glow dazzles them.  </li>
            <li> I would write more, but this entire concept is so stunningly retarded</li>
            <li> /&gt;Remember, girls: when your man comes home after a long, hard day of standing around the water cooler telling dirty jokes and ogling the secretaries, he deserves the hottest, most ultra-conformist woman he can find.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been this \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; and (temporarily) pink for 25 years!</li>
            <li> Anyone have any other tastey treat ideas they would like to give me?</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why 20 applicators are necessary.</li>
            <li> Days and nights melded in to a long, pointless and insignificant drudge of self-loathing and despair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought this was supposed to make it easier for him to find it in the dark?</li>
            <li> Please make a glow in the dark version.</li>
            <li> Move down.</li>
            <li> Move down.</li>
            <li> I can now walk down the street in crotchless panties, flushed with pride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Over the past seven years, I have been housebound, afraid to venture outdoors because of an absolute lack of confidence in myself, and  my physical appearance.</li>
            <li> buy our product and watch a little piece of your soul DIE.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, and speaking of horrible messes, be more careful than I was-</li>
            <li> secrets\\&quot; that my cosmetic surgeon is under waiver not to tell, I&#x27;ve always felt sad that, while I could have my lady parts tightened so I&#x27;m not waiving a flag, there was nothing to do about the natural brownish color that truly reveals a woman&#x27;s age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Formulated by a quack manicurist - sorry, I mean a \\&quot;paramedical esthetician\\&quot; - My New Pink Button will take off the years, take off the children, and take off the reality!</li>
            <li> On top of Brazilian waxes, we now have another useless and probably painful (and probably unsafe) step to take in order to get us closer to our pre-pubescent forms.</li>
            <li> After seeing this product, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> I just want to say that some of these reviews have me laughing so hard</li>
            <li> complaint:</li>
            <li> The directions were sort of confusing</li>
            <li> I mean, who wouldn&#x27;t be?</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed to find this item out of stock, given that I have a party to go to on Friday night and was hoping to add that little extra pizzazz to my ensemble.</li>
            <li> I did not get to try it myself however, as the dog stole mine and later there was a horrible mess to deal with.&lt;br</li>
            <li> thus putting one in a position so precarious that any weakness in the towel rail is liable to result in an extremely painful and embarrassing trip to</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t hate yourself enough yet?</li>
            <li> When she opened the package, she looked confused, so I explained the purpose of the product.</li>
            <li> Is there something wrong with me?</li>
            <li> Of course, I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realise I was at risk of such a horrible fate.</li>
            <li> WITHOUT YOU, I WOULD NEVER HAVE KNOWN THERE WAS ANYTHING WRONG WITH ME.</li>
            <li> How totally offensive, absurd, and disgusting.</li>
            <li> &quot; I yelled, angrily.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I snapped it up.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it is squandered.</li>
            <li> This product was as misleading as that other nasty jam, KY Jelly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was awkward to apply.</li>
            <li> Men, don&#x27;t be afraid of this product just because it is marketed towards women.  </li>
            <li> The texture is waxy and uninspired, and all nuance is lost in a flood of sickening sweetness and tangy faux-flavor.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m appalled to write that it has caused some not insignificant staining to the cream leather upholstery of our settee.</li>
            <li> My husband was so very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Khakis were the worst probably, couldn&#x27;t get the drips out until we tried some selzer water.</li>

            <li> \\&quot;We don&#x27;t know when or if this item will be back in stock.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;well, GOOD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;who even thought of this? it is dismal. completely offensive. it actually epitomizes the self hatred we are encouraged to feel. don&#x27;t hate yourself enough yet? buy our product and watch a little piece of your soul DIE.</li>
            <li> Ladies, we all know that we are nothing unless we can catch a man and keep him. We also know that the fat, balding, underachieving, middle-aged shlub we married will ditch us in a moment for that man-stealing ho Miss Universe if we aren&#x27;t superficially perfect at all times. But what to do when we start to look like one of those \\&quot;normal\\&quot; women instead of an always-perfect supermodel?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My New Pink Button is the answer! Formulated by a quack manicurist - sorry, I mean a \\&quot;paramedical esthetician\\&quot; - My New Pink Button will take off the years, take off the children, and take off the reality!

            <li> For a long time I have felt my sex lust decreasing, much due to the fact that my wife is getting older and lesser attractive for each year.&lt;br /&gt;One of my biggest concerns has been the unattractive gray colour which her labia has attained during recent years. It simply isn&#x27;t pleasing to the eye anymore.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve tried all sorts of things to spice it up, from car batteries  and buttplugs, to whips and strap-ons, all to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;In hindsight most of these things were just silly, since they didn&#x27;t get to the root of the problem, which of course was her labia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And getting to the root of the problem is exactly what this product does! It has revitalized our sex life completely. Now having intercourse doesn&#x27;t feel as much like necrophilia anymore, but rather brings back sweet memories of having sex with 16 year old Croatian prostitutes, much like I used to do during the war!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you My New Pink Button!</li>
            <li> So, a female esthetician (read: not a doctor) noticed her lady-bits were fading, and invented vagina dye.   That really, honestly happened.   I would write more, but this entire concept is so stunningly retarded, I am at a loss for words.     Does any woman over the age of ten really need to be told not to go merrily daubing her cooter with mystery substances? \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean safe (see: hemlock, stonefish, sulfuric acid).</li>
            <li> I am 21 years old and have not had a child nor am I on hormonal birth control. I do not match any of the youthful/pinkish tones on the packages of any of the dyes. Is there something wrong with me? No, I&#x27;m just not white! This product&#x27;s use of the words \\&quot;restore\\&quot; and \\&quot;youthful hue\\&quot; to describe the bubblegum-pink of the idealized white woman&#x27;s vulva is damaging to the sexual confidence of all non-white women. When I emailed the company about their wording, they said \\&quot;you shouldn&#x27;t take this so seriously.\\&quot; Not serious, eh?. One of the side-effects is possible burning and pain -- make you vulva all pink and irritated, so sexy and not-serious.</li>
            <li> I gotta say, after years of winning the game of aneorexia, hair dye, a great pancake make-up tone that hides my acne, botox,  designer clothes and shoes, implants, skin bleaching for my freckles, and other \\&quot;little secrets\\&quot; that my cosmetic surgeon is under waiver not to tell, I&#x27;ve always felt sad that, while I could have my lady parts tightened so I&#x27;m not waiving a flag, there was nothing to do about the natural brownish color that truly reveals a woman&#x27;s age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my online searches didn&#x27;t really bring up the results that this fine medical professional obviously did (he&#x27;s probably using the googles), I was so thankful that I stumbled across this gem of a product. Of course, I was skeptical. I mean, who wouldn&#x27;t be? Obviously if there was a need for this service, wouldn&#x27;t my cosmetic surgeon have heard something about it by now? (Truly, I believe he isn&#x27;t interested in me at all, just my checkbook.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was awkward to apply. I had to purchase a handheld mirror large enough to steady with my thighs. Because I didn&#x27;t want to get anything on me and I found the length of the applicators too short, I went ahead and used some old make-up brushes I had lying around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results were BEAUTIFUL! My silver fox couldn&#x27;t keep his hands off of me.. until the dye wore off onto his hands. However, we now make sure to keep a stock of latex gloves available for those \\&quot;intimate times\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, do yourself a favor, and don&#x27;t let this final imperfection go unchallenged!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve found this product. I didn&#x27;t realise I was at risk of such a horrible fate. I am only 21 so my labia is still lovely and pink, but I had no idea it went grey. How foul. I&#x27;ve now started checking my vagina in the mirror every day to make sure it&#x27;s still pink, and I&#x27;ve ordered a couple of tubs of this stuff in preparation for the day it all goes wrong.  I am eternally in debt to the genius who invented this stuff. WITHOUT YOU, I WOULD NEVER HAVE KNOWN THERE WAS ANYTHING WRONG WITH ME. IMAGINE THAT.  Just off to wax all my hair off. Wouldn&#x27;t want to be a FREAK. Can you imagine having a grey labia AND pubes. Christ.</li>
            <li> Turn your vagina into a clown-nose, today!  Without any of the pain, expense, or hassle of using an industrial irritant to turn your lips pink and swollen.  AMAZE your friends with your new look.  ENTICE your gentleman friend with just how pink your cooch really can be!  LIGHT your home with the radiant glow from your freshly polished labia majora.  My girlfriend used this product hoping to surprise me and boy, did it ever! The sheer brightness of her lady-garden was so luminous it blinded me. I&#x27;m currently dictating this review to her whilst I lie on my hospital bed. The doctors say I should regain my sight by the end of next week. After seeing this product, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll *ever* see clearly again.</li>
            <li> Bought Mrs Seal a tin of My New Pink Button for her birthday. She was over the moon, it was as easy to apply as a new coat of creosote to the shed, and all most as much fun too. Her freshly painted poonani now looks less like a badly packed kebab and more like a more a newly budding rose.  Thanks MNPB!</li>
            <li> Oh good gracious, if only there were a way I could have known such a product exists a month ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife of four years had been showing significant signs of decreased labian tone, and it had been the cause of much consternation between us. I, quite reasonably, was becoming increasingly upset by the dulling of her petals, and was finding it increasingly difficult not to find my penile solace between the folds of younger, more brightly coloured vaginae. Eventually her opening was so muted that I told her I simply couldn&#x27;t stand to be with her a moment longer, initiating a series of events that would lead to her grisly suicide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Were I to have known that I could still have found worth in my wife via the illusory restorative properties of this product, she most likely would still be alive, saving enormous costs. I encourage others with disappointing frontal flowers to embrace the wonder that is now available via My New Pink Button, as this could save lives, as well as marriages. Had my wife been afforded this opportunity to remain good enough, there&#x27;s the possibility we would still be together today.</li>
            <li> Struggling for gift ideas. Why settle for plain old chocolate, flowers or books. This could be the ideal solution. It comes in Pink so is suitable for women of all ages. Just watch Nan&#x27;s face light up at Christmas time!</li>
            <li> I got the ole misses some of this cooter cream cause although she is a classic let&#x27;s just say she wasn&#x27;t garage kept. We both enjoyed ourselves as I waxed her squack and the dye really brought out the original finish. My only question comment is that I wish it had that new car smell, or maybe leather. But anyway, I&#x27;ve been inside my wife all week and it&#x27;s been a great ride.</li>
            <li> I tell my children not to rub mystery substances on their genitals. I would hope that most intelligent human beings would follow suit.    If you get to a point in your life that you feel it&#x27;s necessary to change the color of your labia in order to feel good about yourself, you should perhaps re-examine your priorities.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking of manufacturing a competitor for this product with a far more imaginative name:  MINGE TINGE! or BLIFF LIFT!</li>

I would hope that most intelligent human beings would follow suit.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good advice.&lt;br /&gt;If anyone really wants a home remedy to make their labia smaller and redder, then poultry shears are the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And why&#x27;s there no video review ?</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t even aware of my embarrassing genital discoloration before I stumbled across this product. I haven&#x27;t been this \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; and (temporarily) pink for 25 years! (I&#x27;m 32, you do the math ...).   My boyfriend hasn&#x27;t noticed the difference yet (he prefers to do it with the lights off, eyes closed), but one of these days I&#x27;m going to \\&quot;accidentally\\&quot; show him my sexy new vagina and prepare to get skewered!  Just think ... if it weren&#x27;t for your product, many women might not even consider the color of their labia to be a problem at all. Can you imagine? Women walking around with gray, discolored vaginas in their pants and feeling totally OKAY about it? Gross!</li>
            <li> I have no review...I just want to say that some of these reviews have me laughing so hard I nearly peed my colorless panties!!!! OMG What has the world come to?! LOL @ Charlene and Tina</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed to find this item out of stock, given that I have a party to go to on Friday night and was hoping to add that little extra pizzazz to my ensemble. I have had to try a substitute instead and I&#x27;m appalled to write that it has caused some not insignificant staining to the cream leather upholstery of our settee. [[ASIN:B00C2D5W5G Queen Cake Colouring Cochineal 50ml]]</li>
            <li> Since my girl friend has started using your product  we no longer need night lights or even flash lights. She just points her crotch in the direction she wants to go.&lt;br /&gt;After introducing your amazing product to some of her girl friends, they have decided to start their own rock band. They are calling it &amp;#34;Insane clown pussy&amp;#34;. My life has become a little more awesome thanks to you.</li>
            <li> Best gift idea ever! I got some for all my girlfriends and they raved about it! I did not get to try it myself however, as the dog stole mine and later there was a horrible mess to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and speaking of horrible messes, be more careful than I was- I got the stocking stuffers mixed up and it caused an acute scene on Christmas morning when little Jackson opened what he thought was lip balm in front of grandma- just before she opened hers.&lt;br /&gt;We are celebrating the holidays in a foreign country next year.</li>
            <li> i was suffering from an embarassing tinge until i met aunt betty .Now i have the most amazing fuschia lips , i regularly get them out when im dancing because im now so proud of them , a friend offered me a disco ball and a smoke machine for my arse just because they are so purdy to look at :) thanks for my pink button betty you are a star</li>
            <li> Looks great, but I could not say the same for the taste. My husband was so very disappointed. It&#x27;s back to the drawing board.</li>
            <li> ...... its bad enough that we are supposed to wax off every single hair that dares to raise its little follicle, - just how are we expected to check what colour our bits are seeing as by the time they lose their \\&quot; rosy hue\\&quot; many of us acquire a rounder tum that means any investigation of the nether regions requires a system of mirrors to rival the ballroom at Versailles and a flexibility of the lower limbs that is no longer easily achievable..and is majorly reliant on the juxtaposition of the loo and bathroom sink...thus putting one in a position so precarious that any weakness in the towel rail is liable to result in an extremely painful and embarrassing trip to A&amp;E. And this brings its own problems as you only have 12 minutes before the ambulance arrives in which to make up a plausible excuse for just how you ended up trapped down the side of your loo with 2 hand mirrors and a glass topped vanity case..............&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; any way last time i looked...after 6 kids my foofoo was less \\&quot; rosy hue\\&quot; more \\&quot; the scream\\&quot; by Edvard Munch</li>
            <li> They said bubble gum? A friend of mine told me about this stuff and I just ordered it without reading the description. Yuck taste like wax. This product was as misleading as that other nasty jam, KY Jelly.  You know that stuff isn&#x27;t really jelly at all?  It&#x27;s something to grease your ball bearings with or something.  But I didn&#x27;t find out until I ruined what could have been a perfectly good peanut butter sandwich.  Anyone have any other tastey treat ideas they would like to give me?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using MNPB for months and let me tell ya, my sex life was NEVER better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each night I would slap some of this snatch staining salve on and hit the club. While the rest of my bloated lush body got sweaty and lackluster throwing back drinks and grinding up against a cloud of Axe body sprayed men to the latest MyCy jam, my vajay stayed as pink and fresh (from a distance) as ever. Each night I&#x27;d take at least one new guy home with me, and dude, the free drinks did. not. stop. That was the most fun 9-months of my life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint: I could never tell if I was on my period or not, and turns out I was pregnant the whole time. Bummer. But don&#x27;t worry betches, this story has a happy ending... little Baby Gaga was delivered in the club&#x27;s bathroom by a super muscular bouncer (and, yes, my new common law husband) Brad-the-Dad. Can you believe that was already his nickname?!? Kinda perfect....</li>
            <li> Really? Now we&#x27;re supposed to be dying our coochies in chemicals to be sexier? On top of Brazilian waxes, we now have another useless and probably painful (and probably unsafe) step to take in order to get us closer to our pre-pubescent forms. How totally offensive, absurd, and disgusting.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness I heard about and found this product! God forbid if I should ever fall victim to the normal aging process and also be cursed with a husband, who would be unconcerned with how perfect my body is for him. Wouldn&#x27;t want a man who&#x27;s not shallow, oh no! After considering the use of this product, I smile to myself as I know that I will walk around town with the confidence that everyone will somehow automatically know that I have pink, prim and youthful looking labia. It&#x27;s really quite important that the world knows that.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for this product, I owe the function of my body to the men who came up with this life saving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From just one of the happy, lightly-minded girls of the Barbie Doll Army.</li>
            <li> My wife had let herself go. Sure, she still went to the hairdressers once a fortnight, and sure, she always took care of her clothes and makeup. But (and I told her this), all this means nothing if you have grey labia. It took a massive toll on our sex life. Beautiful face, check. Move down. What a pair! Move down. Nice, flat toned stomach. Check. Fantastic brazillian (the bikini waxing method, there wasn&#x27;t actually a Brazillian down there!) Check. And then, oh, sweet Jesus, what&#x27;s this? Her labia, once vibrant, had lost their rosy pink hue. I&#x27;m being polite when I say I was repulsed. \\&quot;Put your damn knickers back on\\&quot; I yelled, angrily. Did this woman even care about her man&#x27;s needs?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward a month to her birthday, and I was perusing the internet for a gift. It was then that I found this wonderful product. Needless to say, I snapped it up. On the morning of her birthday, she eagerly unwrapped her gift. \\&quot;It&#x27;s jewelery, isn&#x27;t it darling, you know I love jewelery\\&quot;, she beemed, her face a wonderful, excited colour, unlike the monochromatic monstrosity between her legs. When she opened the package, she looked confused, so I explained the purpose of the product. Her face said it all. No diamonds or pearls could even compare to the prospect of having glossy red labia!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since buying this product, our sex life improved tenfold. We really did have a great two months. However, my wife later caught me in bed with the babysitter, and we have since separated.</li>
            <li> Over the past seven years, I have been housebound, afraid to venture outdoors because of an absolute lack of confidence in myself, and  my physical appearance. Although I am considered by many to be an attractive individual, I have harboured a shameful secret for years which has severely hampered my self-esteem and overall ability to socialise, enter in to meaningful dialogue with others, or indeed interact with people on any level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the first time, I am able to articulate my issue aloud.&lt;br /&gt;I had a discoloured labia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than sporting a lush, baby pink rosebud, I instead had skin-coloured genitals. While I know there are others worse off than me in life (for example, women with freckles, naturally kinky hair or sagging breasts), this physical deformity undermined my confidence to the extent that I could never transcend the sheer horror and self disgust which weighed down my existence. Days and nights melded in to a long, pointless and insignificant drudge of self-loathing and despair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I discovered this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank God, someone out there has not just identified with my personal issue, this millstone around my neck, but actually had the courage and foresight to provide a remedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, my labia shines more brightly than a glow worm, day and night. I feel transformed. No longer am I housebound, bemoaning the fact that I cannot enjoy the simple things in life like other women, such as cooking for my husband, doing laundry or painting my nails - now, I do all of this and more with gusto. My labia is luminous. My vaginal vulgarity is vanquished. My bush is beautiful. I can now walk down the street in crotchless panties, flushed with pride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never find the words to truly articulate just how transformational, life-changing and liberating this outstanding product is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, thank you.</li>
            <li> As a 27-year-old, I recognize that I have begun the long decline into old age, senility, and most importantly, pale and gray old-man genitalia.  All my friends seem to be handling the aging process with style and class; I&#x27;ve been having more trouble coping than usual.  My psychiatrist recommended that I take proactive steps to ease my passage into my twilight years, and this product was my first idea.  I swore to myself that while my hair may fall out and my skin may wrinkle, I will NOT go to the grave with a monochromatic baton.  I was pleased with the ease of application of this product.  It comes with 20 disposable applicators, which I image are for female use, but I discovered that it is much quicker to simply dip the tip of my dirigible into the dye and spread it along the shift with a quick up-and-down motion of the hand.  The best time to do this, I have found, it right after waking up or in the shower.  This does result in my having a pink hand for the rest of the day, but I figure people will be impressed by the vibrant, lively color of my palms.  Speaking of the color, the Day-Glo pink hue that this product imparts on my potato is wonderful.  I look fresh as a daisy, youthful and energetic, like a 10-year-old captain of the swim team hanging out with his pals in the locker room playing snap-the-towel.  I like to imagine women having to shield their eyes in wonder and pain as the neon pink glow dazzles them.  I will post a second review as soon as I get a woman&#x27;s response to seeing this product in action.  Men, don&#x27;t be afraid of this product just because it is marketed towards women.  If women can smoke, vote, and run for president, then a man can dye his oboe to bring the snap back to his life, in the sack and out of it.  Just walking around with this fluorescent tool in my pants is enough to give me a great new outlook on life.  As my idol Zyzz would say, \\&quot;Get aesthetic, guys.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I put this on my button and turned the lights off, and my boyfriend still couldn&#x27;t see it. I thought this was supposed to make it easier for him to find it in the dark? It would be nice if it came in some other colors. Please make a glow in the dark version. The Techno-Glow body paint gives me a UTI.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, came with an extra sampler pack, which was nice. I had to call customer service to change the shipping address but they were very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue was the size of the portion. Valentine&#x27;s day was on friday, and by the next week&#x27;s tuesday my girlfriend had already run out. And the color of her crotch hadn&#x27;t really changed that much. I tried some myself and noticed some change but I was hoping for more. I wish they sold bigger sizes or maybe bulk packs like at Costco, because I think my girlfriend needed a few more applications to really start looking good again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream goes on smooth but its pretty hard to get off fingers or most clothes. Khakis were the worst probably, couldn&#x27;t get the drips out until we tried some selzer water. However no problem with cotton socks! If it gets on your skin, peanut butter actually works better than soap to remove it. Someday the company needs to start making a travel size or a cleaner scrub, because she was always spilling it, which really gets on your nerves when its such an expensive item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to most people but I&#x27;ve had somewhat better luck with other types of dye. This one seems to work more on the skin than the pubes. The directions were sort of confusing but if you contact CS they can pdf you a clearer version. They usually have a good deal on rush shipping, just remember to ask first, same with re-orders, you get 10% off but you need to request the discount code.</li>
            <li> I ordered this with visions of surprising hubby on our anniversary with the &amp;#34;new me&amp;#34;...or at least sprucing up that part of me.  I never realized it was beginning to match the gray hairs on both the &amp;#34;carpet and the drapes&amp;#34;.  But with the first application, I experienced the cautionary burning sensation...which then advanced to rash, hives...and bleeding when I couldn&#x27;t stop itching. So much for a surprisingly attractive nether region. The MD I had to visit probably got more excited treating the symptoms than hubby will.  Hopefully it will clear up in time for hubby&#x27;s birthday in another month.</li>
            <li> What was once reserved for the elite echelons of adult film is now available for the general public?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May I be the first to say this is an outrage! MNPB is an industry leading special effect makeup created by our top labia color and design experts. Our unions payed billions of dollars to perfect the day glow pink hue you see here. Clearly some scab has gone and leaked the secret formula and supplied this precious gem to all you prudish peasants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where this traitor found a reliable supply of blue-ringed octopi venom is beyond me. (The most natural of natural ingredients!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell all you peasants out there that just because this is publicly available now does not mean we wont always be pioneers in labia special effects, just now we are working on a new secret formula that is the perfect shade of tangerine which we are sure will make your husbands and boyfriends reject your blinding pink beef curtains and come calling for stage lighting on lovely tangerine flesh. Because remember ladies, no man wants you to look natural, if everything about yourself isn&#x27;t a lie, you will never find true love.</li>
            <li> The most glaring issue with My New Pink Button is its poor-quality flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last trip downtown, I was rewarded with a bouquet that evoked summer in the Riviera. The French one, not the Italian one. Satin texture, notes of nori, and a light, gently musky finish. Suggestions of darjeeling mingled with jasmine. And I&#x27;ve come to anticipate that level of quality and character from this particular vintner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this overwhelms all the natural hints of artesian springwater and any nascent floral undertones, drowning it out in something that can best be described as a mixture of cherry sports drink and stale lipstick. The texture is waxy and uninspired, and all nuance is lost in a flood of sickening sweetness and tangy faux-flavor. Traditionally, I would uncork a new bottle alongside an appropriate pairing to experience it in its intended context, but I never went so far with this brazen cocktail, as it was clear it would destroy an naturally-occurring subtlety in its intended location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why 20 applicators are necessary. A single application was sufficient to demonstrate a complete rework of the flavor profile is in order. Instead of a pairing as gauche as salmon and wild thimbleberry pate with a can of 4-Loko, the makers of My New Pink Button should investigate ways to complement the native fauna. Instead of playing to the whims of daytime television watchers, consider bringing in a connoisseur with some experience. If a fruity flavor is truly necessary, for example to mask an ambergris base, a lighter wilder flavor may work better, such as Pacific wild strawberry, or even a modest infusion of kiwi, whose tingly after-bite might befit a wearer sporting a stronger flavor palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For crying out loud, if this is to truly benefit the femmes, how better to bring joy than to invite the gentleman caller to linger awhile at the dessert table? I see potential. Sadly, it is squandered.</li>
