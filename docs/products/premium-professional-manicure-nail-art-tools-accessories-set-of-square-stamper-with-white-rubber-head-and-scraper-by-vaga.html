            <li>Nice stamping.</li>
            <li>Spend more to get a better one!</li>
            <li>Brilliant stamp for large images for my nails .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect and marshmellowy like really soft.</li>
            <li>Awesome, soft, squishy</li>
            <li>When I called to ask about the product the people told me it worked fine and HUNG UP!</li>
            <li>It is now my favorite..</li>
            <li>Even after priming, the rubber is still sticky and  i still wasn&#x27;t able to pick up anything from the plate.</li>
            <li>So, disappointed...and glad I did not spend a lot on this item..</li>
            <li>I gave it two stars instead of one because it might have worked with better plates.  </li>
            <li>When using the Konad stamper with the same plate/image/polish it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>and it works soo much better</li>
            <li>then the scraper did, but it was okay,</li>
            <li>And a credit card worked better than the scraper.</li>
            <li>Much better than using metal ones that scratch the nail plates.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>But I  won&#x27;t take away a star because of that same material they use to make the stamper is the reason why my design came out perfect.</li>
            <li>better than konad</li>
            <li>Since it was so sticky, I found that using double sided scotch tape worked best for cleaning it in between stamps.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not for sure how to use it yet</li>
            <li>and it was able to pick up the polish just fine.</li>
            <li>This is a good stamper and is very comparable to the Moyou London stampers...</li>
            <li>She finds it easy to use.</li>
            <li>I had really high hopes for this product because of all the good reviews.</li>
            <li>The scraper works fine, but the Stamper won&#x27;t pick up any of the designs on the plate I used.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it to stamp with.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m very happy that it was cheap but not cheaply made!</li>
            <li>When the plates came I was so excited to use them after I painted my nails and was about to put on the design the stamper wouldn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>( we were so excited to receive this, but now it just sits on a shelf.</li>
            <li>I still use my old supermarket rewards card to scrape, but hey, as long as I get a good clean stamp, I&#x27;m GOOD.</li>
            <li>I was so excited for it to arrive, and it arrived fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good but when using white nail polish</li>
            <li>But the stamper is the true star of this pair.</li>
            <li>The rubber comes off easily, which makes cleaning up much easier.</li>
            <li>The old credit cards I have been using do a much better job.</li>
            <li>but it is in good shape and arrived faster than expected.</li>
            <li>12 year old daughter uses to make some really creative nails.</li>
            <li>This soft stamp is awesome to transfer on your nails without missing a spot!</li>
            <li>The white part comes out very easy.</li>
            <li>First, it took quite a while to receive the stamper/scraper - came from China.</li>
            <li>This came first.</li>
            <li>have much better stampers at home from different brands.</li>
            <li>I had just tested it about three times and it&#x27;s consistent.</li>
            <li>Im definitely buyin more of this thingys.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS, squishy enough ðŸ˜‰</li>
            <li>If I would have used this stamper the first time I tried nail stamps.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a white stamper that would show certain color polish designs better for nail stamping.</li>
            <li>I own two other nail art stampers and scrapers.</li>
            <li>On a positive note, this stamper works well with gel polish.</li>
            <li>It was easy to put back it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft and I seem to always smear my stamp.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend purely based off of health concerns.</li>
            <li>I found that it picked up the paint easily and since the surface area is flat, did not warp the image.</li>
            <li>Its cheap and definitely works like it is.</li>
            <li>Also, the fact that it falls out of the stamper handle is a real hassle to deal with every time I want to stamp a nail.</li>
            <li>I used a Cheeky plate which wads fantastic but the Stamper would only pick up the 2 of the 30 designs.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t transfer the design very well:</li>
            <li>, those plates work better with a harder stamp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very displeased with this.</li>
            <li>I like this stamp tool because it covers my whole nail.</li>
            <li>I did take a white buffer block and lightly roughed up the rubber.</li>
            <li>The scraper worked well, but I didn&#x27;t really need another scraper.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really upset at the quality of this stamper.</li>
            <li>There is other words that I would love to use for this review</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t pick up the image, just bits and pieces of it, even after &amp;#34;roughing up&amp;#34; the surface, it goes back to being gummy every time I clean it, after every stamp.</li>
            <li>Images transfer great and its wide enough for my big toe.</li>
            <li>This is a true marshmallow stamper and like a marshmallow it is squishy, sticky, and white.</li>
            <li>I am an experienced user of stampers, and was excited to add this one to my collection, unfortunately the only thing I will be doing with this is throwing it away.</li>
            <li>When I open them up and used them the white prt where you stamp fell out, I wasn&#x27;t sure if that was supposed to happen or not.</li>
            <li>It took three weeks to arrive; but after a quick email to the sender it showed up at my doorstep three days later.</li>
            <li>I did find that the image did warp if too much pressure was applied so only a light to moderate touch was needed.</li>
            <li>The second day I used the scraper, it was all bumpy and already warn out, so I had to use a regular old gift card, and the gift card worked A LOT better</li>
            <li>I only needed to prime it slightly with a magic eraser.</li>
            <li>this is a soft stamper, after it is primed (by using a nail file)</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 12 year old.</li>
            <li>but I will choose to keep it professional.</li>
            <li>Every penny spent was worth it</li>

            <li> Every penny spent was worth it</li>
            <li> Not sure if this stamper only works with certain polish</li>
            <li> Second, it arrived in pieces and the soft white rubbery part of the stamper will not stay in the black part that you hold in your hand.</li>
            <li> It is a bit small for large thumb nails.  </li>
            <li> The stamping surface on this is much softer than on the round pink Konad stamper.</li>
            <li> Very soft and slick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no problems with the other two different brands of nail stampers that I have.</li>
            <li> I have two other nail stamps and would definitely recommend sticking with konad.  </li>
            <li> Just skip the hassle and pay a little extra for a Konad scraper and Stamper kit.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> When I opened the individually wrapped stamper, there was a dead bug stuck the slime it was COVERED in.</li>
            <li> Some plates like Pueen and Cheeky brands need a harder stamper</li>
            <li> Stamping surface is wide and marshmellowy.  </li>
            <li> I had my doubts slightly since Konad&#x27;s nail art stampers are not soft but like rubber/ eraser like.</li>
            <li> It bummed me out, had to order another stamper from some other site.</li>
            <li> You have to rough it up a little and use tape to get the sticky off ....</li>
            <li> I have a Konad Double stamper, which is a hard stamper vs. the marshmallow stamper like this one.  </li>
            <li> because returning it is not worth the effort.</li>
            <li> The most annoying issue is the rubber piece falls out.</li>
            <li> , I wish the shipping took less time, though.</li>
            <li> Peice of crap, buffed it and still doesn&#x27;t pickup full image!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very hard to detect on the white stamper.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it&#x27;s a waste of time and money</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t waste any time tossing it in the trash.</li>
            <li> I would think nail stamps were a sham.</li>
            <li> Waste of Money</li>
            <li> This is the most useless thing I&#x27;ve ever bought on Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that it weirdly attracts dust.</li>
            <li> So i can&#x27;t leave it out and have to return it to it to a small plastic zip lock bag.</li>
            <li> It is no wonder there is no return available, just crap!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not sure what this is a photo of, but the scraper is a thin plastic scraper..</li>
            <li> But I decided to open it anyways, bad choice.</li>
            <li> First off this is a peice of crap!</li>
            <li> This one is useless.</li>
            <li> One word: useless.</li>
            <li> I.guess I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the polish is too difficult to pick up with this stamper.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Went to use this and thought i was going crazy since it wasn&#x27;t picking up any of the polish from the image plates, thought maybe it&#x27;s the plate</li>
            <li> Horrible, the rubber part comes off like nothing and hard to use, i didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> hence all the bad reviews I am guessing</li>
            <li> The rubber part keeps coming off and the scraper is really bad.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this purchase..tried everything I could to get this to work with no luck...went and got the konad one</li>
            <li> I hate this thing.</li>
            <li> It was FILTHY.</li>
            <li> Worst product I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t terrible</li>
            <li> Terrible!!  </li>

            <li> I hate this thing. I have been stamping for a couple of years now and wanted a larger one for the larger prints. This think won&#x27;t pick up anything and is so squishy, it just smooshes into the grip. Its cheap and definitely works like it is. Spend more to get a better one! Also, it took me two months to get it in the mail!!!</li>
            <li> I own two other nail art stampers and scrapers. This stamper does not pick of the nail polish at all.  Not the tiniest bit of the design shows on the stamper. I&#x27;ve had no problems with the other two different brands of nail stampers that I have. This one is useless.</li>
            <li> The images appear sharper with this stamper. .</li>
            <li> this is a soft stamper, after it is primed (by using a nail file) it works great... It is now my favorite.. The scraper works well, I&#x27;m not sure what this is a photo of, but the scraper is a thin plastic scraper..</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this product because of all the good reviews. Even after priming, the rubber is still sticky and  i still wasn&#x27;t able to pick up anything from the plate. (I use the Moyou salon pro plate) One word: useless.</li>
            <li> The white part that stamps won&#x27;t stay in. It&#x27;s sticky/gummy for some reason.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a white stamper that would show certain color polish designs better for nail stamping. First, it took quite a while to receive the stamper/scraper - came from China. Second, it arrived in pieces and the soft white rubbery part of the stamper will not stay in the black part that you hold in your hand. Third, it does not pick up designs from nail plates: Konad, Bundle Monster, etc. I did &#x27;roughen&#x27; the rubber stamp pad - no change. Last, the plastic scraper; I hoped this would work and not scratch my plates, but it does not work well either. The old credit cards I have been using do a much better job. So, disappointed...and glad I did not spend a lot on this item..because returning it is not worth the effort.</li>
            <li> Polish and/or paint won&#x27;t stick to stamp.</li>
            <li> I ordered this with one of the stamping plates.  I was so excited for it to arrive, and it arrived fairly quickly.  Because the plate didn&#x27;t have deep enough grooves for the polish to sit in, I have no idea if this stamper actually works.  I gave it two stars instead of one because it might have worked with better plates.  I guess I&#x27;ll never know.</li>
            <li> the stamper didn&#x27;t do to good. the pad will not stay in the holder. I ended up throwing this away.. It bummed me out, had to order another stamper from some other site.</li>
            <li> the scrapper works but the stamper doesnt the image doesn&#x27;t  stick.. the stamper isnt like the reg stamper</li>
            <li> Peice of crap, buffed it and still doesn&#x27;t pickup full image! Don&#x27;t waist your money! Plus shipping was slowwwww!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it&#x27;s a waste of time and money</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Worst product I have ever bought. DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> First off this is a peice of crap! I order this at the same time I ordered the plates. This came first. When the plates came I was so excited to use them after I painted my nails and was about to put on the design the stamper wouldn&#x27;t work and the paint wasn&#x27;t even sticking to it I am definitely not buying anything from this company again</li>
            <li> I have a Konad Double stamper, which is a hard stamper vs. the marshmallow stamper like this one.  This stamper is tiny.  The stamper pad falls out and does not always pick up the image on the plate.  When using the Konad stamper with the same plate/image/polish it works perfectly.  Maybe it will work for someone else, but not for me.  I prefer the Konad stamper, but I do use the scraper from this set because it&#x27;s plastic and does not scratch my plates.  Also, the fact that it falls out of the stamper handle is a real hassle to deal with every time I want to stamp a nail.</li>
            <li> the white part always comes off. quality is low.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my teenager who loves doing her nails</li>
            <li> MY STAMP WAS NOT IN THE PACKAGE. I ONLY GOT THE SCRAPPER THING. Idk what happened but it was not there</li>
            <li> I love this stamper! You have to rough it up a little and use tape to get the sticky off ....its amazing !</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this purchase..tried everything I could to get this to work with no luck...went and got the konad one and it works soo much better</li>
            <li> Very soft and slick. I had to scuff them with a nail file in order to transfer image. But otherwise they worked well</li>
            <li> It takes a lot of getting used to but I got in the hang of it after about 2 days of trying to get used to it. When I open them up and used them the white prt where you stamp fell out, I wasn&#x27;t sure if that was supposed to happen or not. It was easy to put back it but it sometimes fell out when I was stamping. The second day I used the scraper, it was all bumpy and already warn out, so I had to use a regular old gift card, and the gift card worked A LOT better then the scraper did, but it was okay, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again but it wasn&#x27;t terrible</li>
            <li> Terrible!!  Doesn&#x27;t work. Doesn&#x27;t pick up the image at all.</li>
            <li> This is the most useless thing I&#x27;ve ever bought on Amazon!!! The scraper works fine, but the Stamper won&#x27;t pick up any of the designs on the plate I used. I used a Cheeky plate which wads fantastic but the Stamper would only pick up the 2 of the 30 designs. And a credit card worked better than the scraper. I&#x27;ve lost all my trust in VAGA! When I called to ask about the product the people told me it worked fine and HUNG UP! Just skip the hassle and pay a little extra for a Konad scraper and Stamper kit.</li>
            <li> did NOT like the stamper. have much better stampers at home from different brands. LOVED the plastic scraper- use it all the time. Much better than using metal ones that scratch the nail plates.</li>
            <li> It takes getting use to. I like it. Arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> Brilliant stamp for large images for my nails . no problem&lt;br /&gt;for picking up images.</li>
            <li> I love it and I will be ordering another. It&#x27;s perfect and marshmellowy like really soft. I had my doubts slightly since Konad&#x27;s nail art stampers are not soft but like rubber/ eraser like. I had just tested it about three times and it&#x27;s consistent. The scraper is also perfect as it doesn&#x27;t scratch my plate. The only downfall is that it weirdly attracts dust. So i can&#x27;t leave it out and have to return it to it to a small plastic zip lock bag. But the dust on it doesn&#x27;t interfere with my design in anyway. But I  won&#x27;t take away a star because of that same material they use to make the stamper is the reason why my design came out perfect. I&#x27;m order extras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Went to use this and thought i was going crazy since it wasn&#x27;t picking up any of the polish from the image plates, thought maybe it&#x27;s the plate but I tried a different stamper on the same plate and it was able to pick up the polish just fine. Not sure if this stamper only works with certain polish and I don&#x27;t have that kind or if its just a crappy stamper. Either way it didnt work for me.</li>
            <li> awesome. better than konad</li>
            <li> Im definitely buyin more of this thingys. Every penny spent was worth it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but when using white nail polish it&#x27;s very hard to detect on the white stamper. And is the white rubber part of the stamper supposed to come out of the handle?</li>
            <li> This is a true marshmallow stamper and like a marshmallow it is squishy, sticky, and white. I found that it picked up the paint easily and since the surface area is flat, did not warp the image. I did find that the image did warp if too much pressure was applied so only a light to moderate touch was needed. Since it was so sticky, I found that using double sided scotch tape worked best for cleaning it in between stamps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not for sure how to use it yet but it is in good shape and arrived faster than expected. My only reason for it being four stars is because I think it should come with instructions. But I&#x27;m very happy that it was cheap but not cheaply made!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about anyone else&#x27;s, but mine was from Singapore, and immediately was sketchy. It was FILTHY. But I decided to open it anyways, bad choice. When I opened the individually wrapped stamper, there was a dead bug stuck the slime it was COVERED in. I didn&#x27;t waste any time tossing it in the trash. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend purely based off of health concerns.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 12 year old. It doesn&#x27;t transfer the design very well:( we were so excited to receive this, but now it just sits on a shelf. Is there a trick to it that we aren&#x27;t getting??</li>
            <li> This is a good stamper and is very comparable to the Moyou London stampers...Some plates like Pueen and Cheeky brands need a harder stamper hence all the bad reviews I am guessing, those plates work better with a harder stamp. This soft stamp is awesome to transfer on your nails without missing a spot! You need to buff all stamps before using with a nail file.</li>
            <li> The stamping surface on this is much softer than on the round pink Konad stamper. It seems to like a different consistency of polish and does take a bit of getting used to, but I like the shape for some of my larger rectangular plates.</li>
            <li> I chose this stamper because of the reviews. I&#x27;m very displeased with this. It does not work. I washed it before use &amp; all it does is stick to my finger.</li>
            <li> I like this stamp tool because it covers my whole nail. I just haven&#x27;t mastered it yet. It&#x27;s super soft and I seem to always smear my stamp.</li>
            <li> Does not work won&#x27;t stamp</li>
            <li> Stamping surface is wide and marshmellowy.  Images transfer great and its wide enough for my big toe.</li>
            <li> Horrible, the rubber part comes off like nothing and hard to use, i didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Great price for this great item! Nice marshmallow pad for stamping.</li>
            <li> Awesome, soft, squishy</li>
            <li> White gel part falls out all the time.</li>
            <li> I like how this stamper is squishy so it works well hugging different curves of nails.  It is a bit small for large thumb nails.  I tested the stamper as is and it did not pick up the image, so I did take a white buffer block and lightly roughed up the rubber. Roughing up the rubber was key. The most annoying issue is the rubber piece falls out. I was generous on the rating of 3 stars because it does work but I do not like how the rubber piece falls out. On a positive note, this stamper works well with gel polish.</li>
            <li> The stamper is EVERYTHING! The scraper is alright. But the stamper is the true star of this pair. One of the best stampers I had and an awesome price. I still use my old supermarket rewards card to scrape, but hey, as long as I get a good clean stamp, I&#x27;m GOOD.</li>
            <li> The sponge keep coming out of the base ..not that great</li>
            <li> Received this product in a timely manner. Works well and I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I was expecting good quality .but I.guess I was wrong. I didn&#x27;t like it at all</li>
            <li> The stamper keeps falling out of the plastic holding it and it doesn&#x27;t pick up any nail polish off of my nail plates.</li>
            <li> Would NOT recommend. I am an experienced user of stampers, and was excited to add this one to my collection, unfortunately the only thing I will be doing with this is throwing it away. It won&#x27;t pick up the image, just bits and pieces of it, even after &amp;#34;roughing up&amp;#34; the surface, it goes back to being gummy every time I clean it, after every stamp. The scraper worked well, but I didn&#x27;t really need another scraper.....</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS, squishy enough ðŸ˜‰</li>
            <li> I love it! It&#x27;s a sticky/squishy perfect stamper. I only needed to prime it slightly with a magic eraser. I&#x27;ve had to reprime once but have had no issues. Will purchase again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried and tried but no matter what i do it won&#x27;t pick up the polish.</li>
            <li> Nice stamping. I enjoy using it to stamp with.</li>
            <li> This did not work.  It fell a part and was way too squishy to even pick up the polish. I have two other nail stamps and would definitely recommend sticking with konad.  If I would have used this stamper the first time I tried nail stamps. I would think nail stamps were a sham.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the polish is too difficult to pick up with this stamper.</li>
            <li> 12 year old daughter uses to make some really creative nails. She finds it easy to use.</li>
            <li> Does not pick up any polish at all from the stencil!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy!  Waste of Money</li>
            <li> The white part comes out very easy. Still have yet to try it out. Seems like it will work well though.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect stamper for nail art</li>
            <li> Stamper works well, but the scraper doesn&#x27;t. The rubber comes off easily, which makes cleaning up much easier. It took three weeks to arrive; but after a quick email to the sender it showed up at my doorstep three days later. Good buy for the price, I wish the shipping took less time, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really upset at the quality of this stamper. I couldn&#x27;t even use it once. The rubber part keeps coming off and the scraper is really bad. There is other words that I would love to use for this review but I will choose to keep it professional. I wish there was a 0 starreview but unfortunately I can&#x27;t. Will never be buying this or recommending. It is no wonder there is no return available, just crap!</li>
