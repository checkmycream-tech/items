            <li>I get soo many compliments on my nails !   </li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this color!</li>
            <li>I think she&#x27;ll love it, too!</li>
            <li>but by day 3 I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li>I love OPI polish and this was a steal!  </li>
            <li>One coat is gorge, 2 is amazing.</li>
            <li>I saw a girl with a shade I liked , we were indoors  </li>
            <li>It always dries so nice too.</li>
            <li>(My own fault)</li>
            <li>In the bottle, it looks like it has a bronze-y kind of duo chrome</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s not like anything else I own</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I own</li>
            <li>Great brand, great quality nail polish and a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Beautiful dark brown with shimmer color, perfect for fall!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as strong as some of the Layla or Color Club holos, but it&#x27;s still gorgeous nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Beautiful color, dark and chic, perfect for winter!</li>
            <li>it was a great price and quick shipping</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that with one coat I could have the soft milk-chocolatey look shown in this photo, but with 3 coats my best friend could get the deeper darker color that she likes in a polish.</li>
            <li>the good thing is that the more coats you put on, the more glittery sparkle appears.</li>
            <li>The color is exactly like what i see in the picture and is in good condition!</li>
            <li>Im not quite sure which version I own (there are 3 or 4 versions if you can believe it)</li>
            <li>and I liked it better with 4 coats.  </li>
            <li>, the original was gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>I liked the easy application of the formula.</li>
            <li>So, get this one, get some strong holographic like the two I used and franken your own \\&quot;original\\&quot; version.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this color.</li>
            <li>but when i got it it looked more pewter than gray dissapointed</li>
            <li>I love O.P.I.</li>
            <li>By the way, I do this with most of my products and go about 3-4 days before I begin to chip</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use this polish and probably won&#x27;t be able to give it to any of my friends, as they probably won&#x27;t like it either.    </li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on this color.  </li>
            <li>The thing that makes me the most upset is that it does even look like it has glitter in it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite OPI shade.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I always have a bottle. :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stunning.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s not the linear holo that it once was, but I appreciate the polish for what it is, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I say love it for what it is, not what it should be.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually the best for work.  </li>
            <li>I had no idea that there was more than one version.</li>
            <li>To see a better depiction of this color go to opi&#x27;s site.</li>
            <li>, i simply love it, thank you</li>
            <li>love this color.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t like to do my nails more than once in 1 or 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>And when the sunlight hits it the sparkles almost burst off your fingertips like magic.</li>
            <li>For woman (or men...?) who LOVE metal tones, this is the one you want to get for that shimmering iron look.</li>
            <li>The holo in this one is definitely more scattered.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s more opaque than what I&#x27;m understanding</li>
            <li>I absolutly love this color.</li>
            <li>so you can see. :)</li>
            <li>favorite from OPI</li>
            <li>I love the color.....</li>
            <li>but I love what I received.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this on my toes.</li>
            <li>I like this color but since it has sparkles in it, it can be challenging to remove.</li>
            <li>On top of all this, I couldn&#x27;t wear it if I wanted to bc</li>
            <li>I love mail polishes.</li>
            <li>I love this color.</li>
            <li>and I love the muted glittery feel.</li>
            <li>i absolutely love this color, i got so many compliments on it.  </li>
            <li>I love this color</li>
            <li>It had a halo affect that most nail polishes don&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li>tint(the colors you see depends on you and number of coats, the more the darker)</li>
            <li>Buying another bottle asap:)</li>
            <li>but I wish one coat of if looked more like the picture advertised.</li>
            <li>I love this color and would not be happier.  </li>
            <li>This polish to me looked better online.  </li>
            <li>and I am not disappointed at all!</li>
            <li>it looks rich!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The newest and most widely available version is a milk-chocolate, or purpleish color with some rainbow holographic glitter in it but not a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does look more brown in the snow light, though.  </li>
            <li>but even, streak free layer you will get a lighter outcome and the sparkles will show off better.</li>
            <li>it is a gorgeous and very flattering color.</li>
            <li>The price was great as well and delivery super fast.</li>
            <li>I generaly love OPI and mostly use their nail polishes, My Private Jet is one of my favorite shades particularly good during winter season....</li>
            <li>Falls off easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a dark polish but beautiful!</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>And shipping was quick too!  </li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly and packaged safely so that the nail polish would not break.</li>
            <li>Huge difference sometimes.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing this on my fingers and its a nice upbeat color thanks to the shimmer on it</li>
            <li>Recieved the item before the estimated time, great color, and of coarse, she loves it...</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s discontinuted because I haven&#x27;t seen it anywhere else, but it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>If you committ to doing just one light</li>
            <li>Not only is it a beautiful shade, it dries really quickly and for some reason just lasts and lasts.</li>
            <li>quake rider is correct, the original was much darker, kind of a graphite.  </li>
            <li>and it really goes well with my skin tone!!!</li>
            <li>you take the original bottle into the sunlight it dazzles you with the rainbow effect.  </li>
            <li>This is NOT the original formula.</li>
            <li>it has a great dark brown shade inside and a beautiful shimmery brown outside.</li>
            <li>If you are so inclined, the true linear holo of this color is available on eBay for $65.00 a bottle....</li>
            <li>However this is not the original shade</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect this to be the original MPJ.  </li>
            <li>the original MPJ was.  </li>
            <li>its pretty with two coats and even more with three.</li>
            <li>I know this isn&#x27;t the original formula</li>
            <li>This is a unique color.  </li>
            <li>Two coats gave a very pretty color, the iridescent sparkles were a nice surprise and reflect every so slightly in the sun or bright light.  </li>
            <li>If you really want the linear holographic orginal version then you best bet is to go to your local nail salons and see if they have it on their shelves and are willing to sell it to you.  </li>
            <li>even the first coat is bold. :)</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s such a beloved color, it&#x27;s a shame they&#x27;ve done this.  </li>
            <li>It really is a beautiful dark gray.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t speak to what it looks like in full sun.  </li>
            <li>What a gorgeous and different color!</li>
            <li>but it comes off quickly.</li>
            <li>The glitter in it is more like a shimmer, and the shimmer makes the color look more like a very deep gray.</li>
            <li>And I have several holos that I can top it with to make it look even more</li>
            <li>wait to try it on, Thank you for quick delivery</li>
            <li>I think OPI is the best nail polish I tried so far, it dries fast and last longer, and doesnt peel</li>
            <li>This color looks great, but it&#x27;s not as dark as I had believed.  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>Knowing this wasnt the true holo formula, I had reservations about this, but the price was right</li>
            <li>it has been reformulated and isn&#x27;t as pretty as the original.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update:  In an attempt to \\&quot;franken\\&quot; a copy of the original MPJ, I added some Color Club Harp on It and Cherubic and the result was pretty darn close</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really great dark gray color with just the right amount of sparkle.  </li>
            <li>Well, maybe a little darker with one coat, but it looks amazing none the less :D</li>
            <li>a very nice sparkly black</li>
            <li>I purchased the MY PRIVATE JET nail polish and its a nice color</li>
            <li>but it can still be made to work and be pretty cool nonetheless.  </li>
            <li>(smile).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a really fun color</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fun when the sun shines on it, too.</li>
            <li>Private Jet\\&quot;, based on a picture of the original version, which looked to be more of a purple holographic.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re overcast and snowy here right now</li>
            <li>I had the 3 coat darker color right off the bat.</li>
            <li>I think this is a perfect transition color for one who is going into darker colors such as myself but not yet ready to commit to a full black polish</li>
            <li>The color is a mixture of grey, iridescent, and has a nice metallic shimmer to it.</li>
            <li>This is a gorgeous, dark polish with bronze and brown overtones.</li>
            <li>I purchased this color for my wife, who has fair skin and enjoys dark color polishes.  </li>
            <li>The color looks good, but to get 5/5 stars it would have to be as dark as it looks in the bottle and picture.  </li>
            <li>its a good alternative to just black.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to have receive my new nail polish.</li>
            <li>It removed easily as well, even with top and basecoat, and lasted 3 days before I got slight chipping</li>
            <li>I guess its like my scrubs from work, I wear a different size top and bottom</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s not the first polish they&#x27;ve messed with</li>
            <li>However when the nail polish first arrived, it was a shimmery brown.</li>
            <li>I rated this as &amp;#34;love it&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I thought I was going to get a pretty holographic color with multi-dimensional sparkles, buuuut</li>
            <li>Manicures were the first to go with this economy and the birth of my first child.</li>
            <li>This color is more of a bronze-ish color almost, with tiny flecks of glitter.</li>
            <li>While this newer version is a pretty color, it is nothing like what I thought I was getting.</li>
            <li>I received looks EXACTLY like the bottle in the picture.  </li>
            <li>first thought was that it was close to Color Club Revvvolution but upon comparing the swatches, it&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li>Next time, I will be doing one layer because I like it better; but both are gorgous.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty brown</li>
            <li>The product was exactly as pictured and described.</li>
            <li>It does NOT look like glitter polish and is NOT difficult to remove like the glitter polish (</li>
            <li>think this color would be pretty and tasteful on fingernails as well.</li>
            <li>Its a nice polish, just not what I expected.</li>
            <li>my private jet is a lovely charcoal brownish scattered holo polish.</li>
            <li>The polish I received was exactly what was shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>Although I thought this color was going to be different than it is, I still love and every time I wear it I get tons of compliments.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to be stuck with the same old red nail polish - try something new and you will be so happy you did!</li>
            <li>i love the shade, it last the whole week</li>
            <li>At first, when I put it on my toes, I wasn&#x27;t thrilled because it was too dark.</li>
            <li>Opi nail polish is my favorite because it lasts for so long.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very work place friendly, and because it&#x27;s not black</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lil more expensive, but it always outlasts any other brands, plus the names are just great!</li>
            <li>The original is a dark, almost black color with many, many fine-textured holographic particles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m hard on my nails, so this is a good thing that it lasted 3 days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful color otherwise, but I wish the original version wasn&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit sheer, so I use 2 coats (I heard the true holo take at LEAST 4 coats to get it dazzling).  </li>
            <li>In the sun, the rainbow sparkles really come out to play.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>so it takes two coats to really show the effect.</li>
            <li>Hahaha.</li>
            <li>i really didnt see the effet in the nail polish..</li>
            <li>what I saw once I got a look at the bottle in real life</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really, really close.</li>
            <li>Depending on the light I&#x27;m viewing it in (sunlight vs office or standard indoor lighting).</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t see it from the picture very well, but it has a lot of gold tone sparkles in it.</li>
            <li>It actually takes a brownish hue in the light.  </li>
            <li>I finished soo fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Very flaky.</li>
            <li>I am very please with the quality and delivered as promised.</li>
            <li>Looks very chic and fun without looking too young.</li>
            <li>If you want a trendy color this season, especially for your toes, you can&#x27;t beat &amp;#34;My Private Jet&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>so far!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The color is so different, beautiful and just not your everyday color!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more black than brown; however, I still really like it.</li>
            <li>This helps it to get a more opaque finish, but it&#x27;s still not the dark steel graphite.  </li>
            <li>This color is my favorite every day choice, dark but not distracting</li>
            <li>this is my favorite color polish hands down.</li>
            <li>I believe this colour goes with any skin tone, but probably works best with yellow undertones, or browns to dark brown to black.</li>
            <li>Not to mention it takes more then 2 coats to get it to look black and not gray.</li>
            <li>I love black polish and the bottle I have is almost a blackish-brown.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply with minimal to no</li>
            <li>I am a fan of OPI polish and don&#x27;t mind paying a little more for it.  </li>
            <li>but this is a creamy dark, a different kind of chocolate grey color(very build-able) with a subtle yet beautiful holographic</li>
            <li>Once it was on my nail, I was quite surprised at how much it grew on me.  </li>
            <li>I know there is a lot out there about 2 batches of this polish out there, the first one being a true black.</li>
            <li>MPJ will have a special spot in my collection, due to my love of black polish as well as sparkly holo particles.  </li>
            <li>I recommend trying one thin, even layer first and letting it dry.&lt;br /&gt;I topped my my two layers off with a very durable top coat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of big chunks of silver and then really really small glitters of blue/green and gold</li>
            <li>I was BEYOND impressed!its a little more toned down in regular light</li>
            <li>It is not holographic, but more of a smokey black with tiny gold shimmer.  </li>
            <li>I thought with proper top coats to protect it, it lasted just less than a week.</li>
            <li>This is a very dark brown polish with fine, silver glitter.</li>
            <li>its brown, the original was a black holo.</li>
            <li>It also has flecks of green visible in direct light.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned if I like a color that much, immediately buy another bottle from the same place.</li>
            <li>Gray is a much nicer color if you are as white as I am.</li>
            <li>I am giving two stars because the shipping time was fast and the price was low.</li>
            <li>Two coats and two episodes of Phineas &amp; Ferb and I am set for the classy yet edginess that is this nail polish.</li>
            <li>the brush was completely detached from the lid..</li>
            <li>but this one was completely defective...</li>
            <li>did however get a complete refund.</li>
            <li>The shimmer is what I like to call a \\&quot;mature shimmer\\&quot;not kid like obnoxious shimmer</li>
            <li>so it looks more like a sparkly dark grey.  </li>
            <li>Due to my olive skin-tone, it is hard to find colours that look good.</li>
            <li>It was the right color and it worked as expected</li>
            <li>This is definitely dark but very very pretty.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not black.</li>
            <li>When I put it on it really looked like grey polish with sand in it.</li>
            <li>Shipped faster than expected pretty color matches the picture, yea I kinda purchased this because of the name</li>
            <li>Like any other nailpolish, it stays on well with a good base and top coat.</li>
            <li>That tells me this one is going to have several different personalities, which is something I really like.  </li>
            <li>I love it and would encourage anyone wanting a black that isn&#x27;t so so dark to try it.</li>
            <li>All of the flecks are rainbow holographic and change color at different angles in direct sunlight.  </li>
            <li>Since then, I&#x27;ve looked everywhere for this color without success until I found it on Amazon a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>What I see most on the nail wheel is silver, blue and pink glitter flashes, which gives it a very slight lavender cast under my daylight desk lamp.  </li>
            <li>While the nail polish is pretty it is really black with sparkles.</li>
            <li>it gives it much more depth and just seems edgier than plain black polish.</li>
            <li>You could jazz it up if you feel the need with a sparkly top coat like like China Glaze&#x27;s \\&quot;Fairy dust\\&quot; or a single thin coat of Nicole by OPI&#x27;s \\&quot;Make</li>
            <li>so I usually get pieces from different dye lots that are similar in color but not quite right.</li>
            <li>I know of three different versions; this brown version, the original black version with the holographic glitter and a black version with blue shimmer.  </li>

            <li> I love it !</li>
            <li> I get soo many compliments on my nails !   </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this OPI color!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite color EVER!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this color!</li>
            <li> I think she&#x27;ll love it, too!</li>
            <li> but by day 3 I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> I love OPI polish and this was a steal!  </li>
            <li> One coat is gorge, 2 is amazing.</li>
            <li> I saw a girl with a shade I liked , we were indoors  </li>
            <li> It always dries so nice too.</li>
            <li> (My own fault)</li>
            <li> In the bottle, it looks like it has a bronze-y kind of duo chrome</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s not like anything else I own</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I own</li>
            <li> Great brand, great quality nail polish and a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Beautiful dark brown with shimmer color, perfect for fall!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as strong as some of the Layla or Color Club holos, but it&#x27;s still gorgeous nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, dark and chic, perfect for winter!</li>
            <li> it was a great price and quick shipping</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that with one coat I could have the soft milk-chocolatey look shown in this photo, but with 3 coats my best friend could get the deeper darker color that she likes in a polish.</li>
            <li> the good thing is that the more coats you put on, the more glittery sparkle appears.</li>
            <li> The color is exactly like what i see in the picture and is in good condition!</li>
            <li> Im not quite sure which version I own (there are 3 or 4 versions if you can believe it)</li>
            <li> and I liked it better with 4 coats.  </li>
            <li> , the original was gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> I liked the easy application of the formula.</li>
            <li> So, get this one, get some strong holographic like the two I used and franken your own \\&quot;original\\&quot; version.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this color.</li>
            <li> but when i got it it looked more pewter than gray dissapointed</li>
            <li> I love O.P.I.</li>
            <li> By the way, I do this with most of my products and go about 3-4 days before I begin to chip</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use this polish and probably won&#x27;t be able to give it to any of my friends, as they probably won&#x27;t like it either.    </li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on this color.  </li>
            <li> The thing that makes me the most upset is that it does even look like it has glitter in it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite OPI shade.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I always have a bottle. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stunning.  </li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s not the linear holo that it once was, but I appreciate the polish for what it is, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I say love it for what it is, not what it should be.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually the best for work.  </li>
            <li> I had no idea that there was more than one version.</li>
            <li> To see a better depiction of this color go to opi&#x27;s site.</li>
            <li> , i simply love it, thank you</li>
            <li> love this color.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t like to do my nails more than once in 1 or 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> And when the sunlight hits it the sparkles almost burst off your fingertips like magic.</li>
            <li> For woman (or men...?) who LOVE metal tones, this is the one you want to get for that shimmering iron look.</li>
            <li> The holo in this one is definitely more scattered.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s more opaque than what I&#x27;m understanding</li>
            <li> I absolutly love this color.</li>
            <li> so you can see. :)</li>
            <li> favorite from OPI</li>
            <li> I love the color.....</li>
            <li> but I love what I received.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this on my toes.</li>
            <li> I like this color but since it has sparkles in it, it can be challenging to remove.</li>
            <li> On top of all this, I couldn&#x27;t wear it if I wanted to bc</li>
            <li> I love mail polishes.</li>
            <li> I love this color.</li>
            <li> and I love the muted glittery feel.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this color, i got so many compliments on it.  </li>
            <li> I love this color</li>
            <li> It had a halo affect that most nail polishes don&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> tint(the colors you see depends on you and number of coats, the more the darker)</li>
            <li> Buying another bottle asap:)</li>
            <li> but I wish one coat of if looked more like the picture advertised.</li>
            <li> I love this color and would not be happier.  </li>
            <li> This polish to me looked better online.  </li>
            <li> and I am not disappointed at all!</li>
            <li> it looks rich!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The newest and most widely available version is a milk-chocolate, or purpleish color with some rainbow holographic glitter in it but not a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does look more brown in the snow light, though.  </li>
            <li> but even, streak free layer you will get a lighter outcome and the sparkles will show off better.</li>
            <li> it is a gorgeous and very flattering color.</li>
            <li> The price was great as well and delivery super fast.</li>
            <li> I generaly love OPI and mostly use their nail polishes, My Private Jet is one of my favorite shades particularly good during winter season....</li>
            <li> Falls off easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dark polish but beautiful!</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> And shipping was quick too!  </li>
            <li> It was shipped quickly and packaged safely so that the nail polish would not break.</li>
            <li> Huge difference sometimes.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this on my fingers and its a nice upbeat color thanks to the shimmer on it</li>
            <li> Recieved the item before the estimated time, great color, and of coarse, she loves it...</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s discontinuted because I haven&#x27;t seen it anywhere else, but it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> If you committ to doing just one light</li>
            <li> Not only is it a beautiful shade, it dries really quickly and for some reason just lasts and lasts.</li>
            <li> quake rider is correct, the original was much darker, kind of a graphite.  </li>
            <li> and it really goes well with my skin tone!!!</li>
            <li> you take the original bottle into the sunlight it dazzles you with the rainbow effect.  </li>
            <li> This is NOT the original formula.</li>
            <li> it has a great dark brown shade inside and a beautiful shimmery brown outside.</li>
            <li> If you are so inclined, the true linear holo of this color is available on eBay for $65.00 a bottle....</li>
            <li> However this is not the original shade</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this to be the original MPJ.  </li>
            <li> the original MPJ was.  </li>
            <li> its pretty with two coats and even more with three.</li>
            <li> I know this isn&#x27;t the original formula</li>
            <li> This is a unique color.  </li>
            <li> Two coats gave a very pretty color, the iridescent sparkles were a nice surprise and reflect every so slightly in the sun or bright light.  </li>
            <li> If you really want the linear holographic orginal version then you best bet is to go to your local nail salons and see if they have it on their shelves and are willing to sell it to you.  </li>
            <li> even the first coat is bold. :)</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s such a beloved color, it&#x27;s a shame they&#x27;ve done this.  </li>
            <li> It really is a beautiful dark gray.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t speak to what it looks like in full sun.  </li>
            <li> What a gorgeous and different color!</li>
            <li> but it comes off quickly.</li>
            <li> The glitter in it is more like a shimmer, and the shimmer makes the color look more like a very deep gray.</li>
            <li> And I have several holos that I can top it with to make it look even more</li>
            <li> wait to try it on, Thank you for quick delivery</li>
            <li> I think OPI is the best nail polish I tried so far, it dries fast and last longer, and doesnt peel</li>
            <li> This color looks great, but it&#x27;s not as dark as I had believed.  </li>
            <li> This is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> Knowing this wasnt the true holo formula, I had reservations about this, but the price was right</li>
            <li> it has been reformulated and isn&#x27;t as pretty as the original.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update:  In an attempt to \\&quot;franken\\&quot; a copy of the original MPJ, I added some Color Club Harp on It and Cherubic and the result was pretty darn close</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really great dark gray color with just the right amount of sparkle.  </li>
            <li> Well, maybe a little darker with one coat, but it looks amazing none the less :D</li>
            <li> a very nice sparkly black</li>
            <li> I purchased the MY PRIVATE JET nail polish and its a nice color</li>
            <li> but it can still be made to work and be pretty cool nonetheless.  </li>
            <li> (smile).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a really fun color</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so fun when the sun shines on it, too.</li>
            <li> Private Jet\\&quot;, based on a picture of the original version, which looked to be more of a purple holographic.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re overcast and snowy here right now</li>
            <li> I had the 3 coat darker color right off the bat.</li>
            <li> I think this is a perfect transition color for one who is going into darker colors such as myself but not yet ready to commit to a full black polish</li>
            <li> The color is a mixture of grey, iridescent, and has a nice metallic shimmer to it.</li>
            <li> This is a gorgeous, dark polish with bronze and brown overtones.</li>
            <li> I purchased this color for my wife, who has fair skin and enjoys dark color polishes.  </li>
            <li> The color looks good, but to get 5/5 stars it would have to be as dark as it looks in the bottle and picture.  </li>
            <li> its a good alternative to just black.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to have receive my new nail polish.</li>
            <li> It removed easily as well, even with top and basecoat, and lasted 3 days before I got slight chipping</li>
            <li> I guess its like my scrubs from work, I wear a different size top and bottom</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s not the first polish they&#x27;ve messed with</li>
            <li> However when the nail polish first arrived, it was a shimmery brown.</li>
            <li> I rated this as &amp;#34;love it&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to get a pretty holographic color with multi-dimensional sparkles, buuuut</li>
            <li> Manicures were the first to go with this economy and the birth of my first child.</li>
            <li> This color is more of a bronze-ish color almost, with tiny flecks of glitter.</li>
            <li> While this newer version is a pretty color, it is nothing like what I thought I was getting.</li>
            <li> I received looks EXACTLY like the bottle in the picture.  </li>
            <li> first thought was that it was close to Color Club Revvvolution but upon comparing the swatches, it&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li> Next time, I will be doing one layer because I like it better; but both are gorgous.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty brown</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as pictured and described.</li>
            <li> It does NOT look like glitter polish and is NOT difficult to remove like the glitter polish (</li>
            <li> think this color would be pretty and tasteful on fingernails as well.</li>
            <li> Its a nice polish, just not what I expected.</li>
            <li> my private jet is a lovely charcoal brownish scattered holo polish.</li>
            <li> The polish I received was exactly what was shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> Although I thought this color was going to be different than it is, I still love and every time I wear it I get tons of compliments.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to be stuck with the same old red nail polish - try something new and you will be so happy you did!</li>
            <li> i love the shade, it last the whole week</li>
            <li> At first, when I put it on my toes, I wasn&#x27;t thrilled because it was too dark.</li>
            <li> Opi nail polish is my favorite because it lasts for so long.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very work place friendly, and because it&#x27;s not black</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lil more expensive, but it always outlasts any other brands, plus the names are just great!</li>
            <li> The original is a dark, almost black color with many, many fine-textured holographic particles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m hard on my nails, so this is a good thing that it lasted 3 days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful color otherwise, but I wish the original version wasn&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit sheer, so I use 2 coats (I heard the true holo take at LEAST 4 coats to get it dazzling).  </li>
            <li> In the sun, the rainbow sparkles really come out to play.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> so it takes two coats to really show the effect.</li>
            <li> Hahaha.</li>
            <li> i really didnt see the effet in the nail polish..</li>
            <li> what I saw once I got a look at the bottle in real life</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really, really close.</li>
            <li> Depending on the light I&#x27;m viewing it in (sunlight vs office or standard indoor lighting).</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t see it from the picture very well, but it has a lot of gold tone sparkles in it.</li>
            <li> It actually takes a brownish hue in the light.  </li>
            <li> I finished soo fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Very flaky.</li>
            <li> I am very please with the quality and delivered as promised.</li>
            <li> Looks very chic and fun without looking too young.</li>
            <li> If you want a trendy color this season, especially for your toes, you can&#x27;t beat &amp;#34;My Private Jet&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> so far!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The color is so different, beautiful and just not your everyday color!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more black than brown; however, I still really like it.</li>
            <li> This helps it to get a more opaque finish, but it&#x27;s still not the dark steel graphite.  </li>
            <li> This color is my favorite every day choice, dark but not distracting</li>
            <li> this is my favorite color polish hands down.</li>
            <li> I believe this colour goes with any skin tone, but probably works best with yellow undertones, or browns to dark brown to black.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it takes more then 2 coats to get it to look black and not gray.</li>
            <li> I love black polish and the bottle I have is almost a blackish-brown.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply with minimal to no</li>
            <li> I am a fan of OPI polish and don&#x27;t mind paying a little more for it.  </li>
            <li> but this is a creamy dark, a different kind of chocolate grey color(very build-able) with a subtle yet beautiful holographic</li>
            <li> Once it was on my nail, I was quite surprised at how much it grew on me.  </li>
            <li> I know there is a lot out there about 2 batches of this polish out there, the first one being a true black.</li>
            <li> MPJ will have a special spot in my collection, due to my love of black polish as well as sparkly holo particles.  </li>
            <li> I recommend trying one thin, even layer first and letting it dry.&lt;br /&gt;I topped my my two layers off with a very durable top coat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of big chunks of silver and then really really small glitters of blue/green and gold</li>
            <li> I was BEYOND impressed!its a little more toned down in regular light</li>
            <li> It is not holographic, but more of a smokey black with tiny gold shimmer.  </li>
            <li> I thought with proper top coats to protect it, it lasted just less than a week.</li>
            <li> This is a very dark brown polish with fine, silver glitter.</li>
            <li> its brown, the original was a black holo.</li>
            <li> It also has flecks of green visible in direct light.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned if I like a color that much, immediately buy another bottle from the same place.</li>
            <li> Gray is a much nicer color if you are as white as I am.</li>
            <li> I am giving two stars because the shipping time was fast and the price was low.</li>
            <li> Two coats and two episodes of Phineas &amp; Ferb and I am set for the classy yet edginess that is this nail polish.</li>
            <li> the brush was completely detached from the lid..</li>
            <li> but this one was completely defective...</li>
            <li> did however get a complete refund.</li>
            <li> The shimmer is what I like to call a \\&quot;mature shimmer\\&quot;not kid like obnoxious shimmer</li>
            <li> so it looks more like a sparkly dark grey.  </li>
            <li> Due to my olive skin-tone, it is hard to find colours that look good.</li>
            <li> It was the right color and it worked as expected</li>
            <li> This is definitely dark but very very pretty.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not black.</li>
            <li> When I put it on it really looked like grey polish with sand in it.</li>
            <li> Shipped faster than expected pretty color matches the picture, yea I kinda purchased this because of the name</li>
            <li> Like any other nailpolish, it stays on well with a good base and top coat.</li>
            <li> That tells me this one is going to have several different personalities, which is something I really like.  </li>
            <li> I love it and would encourage anyone wanting a black that isn&#x27;t so so dark to try it.</li>
            <li> All of the flecks are rainbow holographic and change color at different angles in direct sunlight.  </li>
            <li> Since then, I&#x27;ve looked everywhere for this color without success until I found it on Amazon a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> What I see most on the nail wheel is silver, blue and pink glitter flashes, which gives it a very slight lavender cast under my daylight desk lamp.  </li>
            <li> While the nail polish is pretty it is really black with sparkles.</li>
            <li> it gives it much more depth and just seems edgier than plain black polish.</li>
            <li> You could jazz it up if you feel the need with a sparkly top coat like like China Glaze&#x27;s \\&quot;Fairy dust\\&quot; or a single thin coat of Nicole by OPI&#x27;s \\&quot;Make</li>
            <li> so I usually get pieces from different dye lots that are similar in color but not quite right.</li>
            <li> I know of three different versions; this brown version, the original black version with the holographic glitter and a black version with blue shimmer.  </li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s definitely black, but just looks a litle more toned than some of the flat blacks I have seen.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this because it is very hard to find.</li>
            <li> I really like that it&#x27;s dark but not a typical black.</li>
            <li> Private Jet is actually a graphite grey color with iridescent colored glittery flecks in it.  </li>
            <li> Loved the color of course but for whatever reason the colored flakes aren&#x27;t the same: (.</li>
            <li> Usually when this happens I just twist it back closed tight and when I unscrew it its fine</li>
            <li> OPI made an unfortunate mistake in discontinuing the original formula, but made an even bigger mistake by changing the formula and actually keeping the same name.</li>
            <li> My Private Jet, this version at least, is really somewhat drab and not a color I would pick out for myself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a brownish grey color with glitter.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m interested now to see if they&#x27;re both the same or if the other one is brown or thin.</li>
            <li> Obviously if you are even looking at this review you probably like dark polish.  </li>
            <li> so while my initial reaction was &amp;#34;OMG...way to dark for me!&amp;#34;, after 2 coats the sparkly glitters of gold, silver, etc...lightened up the coffee brown polish color.</li>
            <li> The one I received Is black with tiny speckles of silver.</li>
            <li> initially I was a little on the fence</li>
            <li> was looking for different shade of black, black-blue, black-purple, black-grey and grey for my toes (due to &amp;#34;runner&#x27;s toes&amp;#34;, I need a dark color to cover the uglies).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great seller and service, horrible color.</li>
            <li> I have quite a few OPI colors, and any time I buy a bottle of one again the color is never the same.</li>
            <li> it is a brown based and not what I expected.</li>
            <li> but mine looks a very deep dark brown, almost black (black-brown</li>
            <li> The shimmer makes it so that minor smudges are much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> dark grey almost black with the teeny</li>
            <li> It seems thinner than other OPI nail polishes I have.</li>
            <li> Took it with me for Ped and 2 other women were requesting.  </li>
            <li> and well, it&#x27;s not exactly as brown as it appeared.  </li>
            <li> Other than that you can pay $79 for it on ebay.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have mentioned the formula being changed, I implore OPI to make it black again.</li>
            <li> I think that looks a bit tacky with dark colors.</li>
            <li> its the dark brown mix with dark purple as well.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m really picky about visible nail lines, and mine are always difficult to cover up).</li>
            <li> I use the Opi base and top coats and 2 coats of polish.  </li>
            <li> Some pics show it as a dark jet black, but it has a dark brown tone with a hint of glitter.</li>
            <li> The pics led me to believe it would be a shimmering black or charcoal (plus the word jet implying black) but this newer formula is definitely brown, and rather dull and lifeless at that.  </li>
            <li> It is black, but not so dark or gothic looking.</li>
            <li> My color is what I received at the spa-a dark, slightly glittery graphite.  </li>
            <li> This color is black, but the previous reviewer was correct in stating that you need two coats to get it dark.</li>
            <li> I buff my nails a bit, apply a thin base, apply 2 thin coats allowing to dry a bit between each, apply seche vite topcoat as thin as possible then apply 1 more thin coat of the polish and top coat.  </li>
            <li> On the nail it looks black.  </li>
            <li> It took me forever to decide that I would wear a black polish.</li>
            <li> So I scanned all of the black colors at OPI on my computer and found \\&quot;My</li>
            <li> Black Jet\\&quot;, ordered it, it came promptly</li>
            <li> I describe it as black with just a hint of shimmer.</li>
            <li> basically black, with sparkles in them.</li>
            <li> I bought this nail polish because it appeared to be a sparkly grayish black.  </li>
            <li> The product description and pictures lead me to believe this would be a black toned color however when I received it</li>
            <li> Not an inky black.</li>
            <li> And completely black..</li>
            <li> And quite unpredictable.</li>
            <li> I put 2 coats on and it is dark but has little sparkles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to opi and far from disappointed</li>
            <li> I saw it at Trade Secrets but passed on it the first time, because in the bottle it looked like &#x27;dirty tarmac&#x27;    </li>
            <li> When I got home I looked it up and found it was a very dark shade of purple, looked black in the building.  </li>
            <li> It looks chocolate in the bottle but 2 coats on the nail gives a very dark, espresso like brown/almost black with shimmer.</li>
            <li> the picture is a little deceiving looks like gunmetal</li>
            <li> Not even a little bit.</li>
            <li> Not even dark brown!</li>
            <li> you get a very dark color-</li>
            <li> The one thing that I don&#x27;t like about it is that with one coat it is still thin enough that I can see my nail.</li>
            <li> Dried</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unless you&#x27;re dead set on the holo version of this polish, don&#x27;t hesitate to get this one.  </li>
            <li> This OPI color is dark with small sparkles.</li>
            <li> It is not appealing.</li>
            <li> If one coat worked, it could make the nailpolish thick and clumpy.</li>
            <li> after pinning for this forever a few years ago, I finaly found it here about a year ago, bought 2 bottles and got the brownish/pupleish thin consistency.</li>
            <li> The subtle sparkles and holographic effect</li>
            <li> - Matt, subtle glitter through a mocha colour.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to go dark!</li>
            <li> , some formulations are thin to the point of being runny and others are thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one is a charcoal black base with scattered holographic glitter.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to describe...</li>
            <li> I understand there&#x27;s several versions of this color, but I must have got the worst one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a weird color to describe.</li>
            <li> sooo mad that i didnt get the effect</li>
            <li> Mad as a Hatter - very difficult to remove!!)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Definitely disappointed by the color of this polish.</li>
            <li> Almost as if they added sparkle to the brown shade from the Texas collection...very disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really hate that OPI changed this</li>
            <li> I pair it with the OPI nail envy base coat and it lasts for a couple weeks without chipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this polish.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed, (in OPI, not the seller!)</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is not holographic, but more of a smokey black with tiny gold shimmer.  I liked the easy application of the formula.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the \\&quot;original\\&quot; color of this was, but the one I received is awesome. Absolutely LOVE this color. I have quite a few OPI colors, and any time I buy a bottle of one again the color is never the same. Huge difference sometimes. I guess its like my scrubs from work, I wear a different size top and bottom so I usually get pieces from different dye lots that are similar in color but not quite right. I&#x27;ve learned if I like a color that much, immediately buy another bottle from the same place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not kidding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very, very different polishes being sold with the same name.  The original is a dark, almost black color with many, many fine-textured holographic particles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The newest and most widely available version is a milk-chocolate, or purpleish color with some rainbow holographic glitter in it but not a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you take the original bottle into the sunlight it dazzles you with the rainbow effect.  The newer bottle does have some rainbow but not a lot and it looks like it&#x27;s floating in milk chocolate.  When on your nails it looks chocolatey with silver glitter.  Nothing like the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, some formulations are thin to the point of being runny and others are thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why OPI did this - it&#x27;s such a beloved color, it&#x27;s a shame they&#x27;ve done this.  But, it&#x27;s not the first polish they&#x27;ve messed with and I suspect it won&#x27;t be the last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea which version Amazon is selling but my guess would be that it&#x27;s the newer version.</li>
            <li> I think OPI is the best nail polish I tried so far, it dries fast and last longer, and doesnt peel, the color is great and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I purchased the MY PRIVATE JET nail polish and its a nice color but it comes off quickly. Not to mention it takes more then 2 coats to get it to look black and not gray.</li>
            <li> This color is black, but the previous reviewer was correct in stating that you need two coats to get it dark. The one thing that I don&#x27;t like about it is that with one coat it is still thin enough that I can see my nail. I think that looks a bit tacky with dark colors. I don&#x27;t mind putting on the extra layer though. If one coat worked, it could make the nailpolish thick and clumpy. Like any other nailpolish, it stays on well with a good base and top coat. The glitter in it is more like a shimmer, and the shimmer makes the color look more like a very deep gray. Gray is a much nicer color if you are as white as I am. The shimmer makes it so that minor smudges are much less noticeable. I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I just adore sparkly things--from shirts to gloves to belts. However, sparkly nail polish? I was unsure of how it would look on my hands. Due to my olive skin-tone, it is hard to find colours that look good. In the picture, the nail polish is represented as a grey-black sparkle. However when the nail polish first arrived, it was a shimmery brown. I went ahead with the application and it looked great on my hands! However, I&#x27;m unsure whether this product is actual OPI or just a changed formula. It seems thinner than other OPI nail polishes I have. But because of the price, and how it looked on my hands, I would definitely use this product again.</li>
            <li> the picture is a little deceiving looks like gunmetal but when i got it it looked more pewter than gray dissapointed</li>
            <li> I love O.P.I. It&#x27;s a lil more expensive, but it always outlasts any other brands, plus the names are just great! This color is awesome and shimmers in the light!</li>
            <li> quake rider is correct, the original was much darker, kind of a graphite.  after pinning for this forever a few years ago, I finaly found it here about a year ago, bought 2 bottles and got the brownish/pupleish thin consistency. Very disappointed, (in OPI, not the seller!) but it can still be made to work and be pretty cool nonetheless.  I buff my nails a bit, apply a thin base, apply 2 thin coats allowing to dry a bit between each, apply seche vite topcoat as thin as possible then apply 1 more thin coat of the polish and top coat.  This helps it to get a more opaque finish, but it&#x27;s still not the dark steel graphite.  I really hate that OPI changed this, the original was gorgeous.  By the way, I do this with most of my products and go about 3-4 days before I begin to chip</li>
            <li> This is NOT the original formula. I wish this information was disclosed before I made the mistake of buying it. This is a very dark brown polish with fine, silver glitter. It is NOT a holographic polish! OPI made an unfortunate mistake in discontinuing the original formula, but made an even bigger mistake by changing the formula and actually keeping the same name. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use this polish and probably won&#x27;t be able to give it to any of my friends, as they probably won&#x27;t like it either.    I am giving two stars because the shipping time was fast and the price was low.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this polish.  The pics led me to believe it would be a shimmering black or charcoal (plus the word jet implying black) but this newer formula is definitely brown, and rather dull and lifeless at that.  Other reviewers have mentioned the formula being changed, I implore OPI to make it black again.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on this color.  I love it!!</li>
            <li> i was expecting the sparkled MPJ, but its not. its the dark brown mix with dark purple as well. I thought it was going to be like the one in the picture. The thing that makes me the most upset is that it does even look like it has glitter in it. It&#x27;s kind of big chunks of silver and then really really small glitters of blue/green and gold it looks like.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite OPI shade. One coat is gorge, 2 is amazing. I love it. I always have a bottle. :)</li>
            <li> Loved the color of course but for whatever reason the colored flakes aren&#x27;t the same: (. In store was colored and this was silver, still love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dark polish but beautiful! Just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> this is my favorite color polish hands down. it has a great dark brown shade inside and a beautiful shimmery brown outside. i need to buy stock in this color!</li>
            <li> Knowing this wasnt the true holo formula, I had reservations about this, but the price was right and I went ahead with it.  Once it was on my nail, I was quite surprised at how much it grew on me.  I saw it at Trade Secrets but passed on it the first time, because in the bottle it looked like &#x27;dirty tarmac&#x27;    Im not quite sure which version I own (there are 3 or 4 versions if you can believe it) but mine looks a very deep dark brown, almost black (black-brown I guess), with rainbow flecks in it of varying sizes.  All of the flecks are rainbow holographic and change color at different angles in direct sunlight.  On the nail it looks black.  It&#x27;s a bit sheer, so I use 2 coats (I heard the true holo take at LEAST 4 coats to get it dazzling).  In the sun, the rainbow sparkles really come out to play.  It&#x27;s stunning.  Sure, it&#x27;s not the linear holo that it once was, but I appreciate the polish for what it is, and I love it.  MPJ will have a special spot in my collection, due to my love of black polish as well as sparkly holo particles.  You could jazz it up if you feel the need with a sparkly top coat like like China Glaze&#x27;s \\&quot;Fairy dust\\&quot; or a single thin coat of Nicole by OPI&#x27;s \\&quot;Make a Comet-ment\\&quot; for extra pizzazz.    I say love it for what it is, not what it should be.  If you are so inclined, the true linear holo of this color is available on eBay for $65.00 a bottle....</li>
            <li> I rated this as &amp;#34;love it&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. The color is a mixture of grey, iridescent, and has a nice metallic shimmer to it.</li>
            <li> It took me forever to decide that I would wear a black polish. I saw a girl with a shade I liked , we were indoors  ans she said it was an OPI brand title \\&quot;Lincoln In The Park After Dark\\&quot;.  When I got home I looked it up and found it was a very dark shade of purple, looked black in the building.  So I scanned all of the black colors at OPI on my computer and found \\&quot;My Black Jet\\&quot;, ordered it, it came promptly and I am very pleased with it. It is black, but not so dark or gothic looking. It&#x27;s actually the best for work.  I love it and would encourage anyone wanting a black that isn&#x27;t so so dark to try it. I mean it&#x27;s definitely black, but just looks a litle more toned than some of the flat blacks I have seen. You must try it !</li>
            <li> My daughter bought me a spa day for Christmas 2010 and My Private Jet was my choice for nail color.  The manicurist applied one coat and it lasted forever and was beautiful.  I purchased a bottle at the spa which my daughter later lost!  Since then, I&#x27;ve looked everywhere for this color without success until I found it on Amazon a few weeks ago.  My color is what I received at the spa-a dark, slightly glittery graphite.  I bought two bottles and I&#x27;m interested now to see if they&#x27;re both the same or if the other one is brown or thin. I had no idea that there was more than one version.</li>
            <li> I really loved this color when i saw it on Pinterest. I had to have it, but when i got it, its just wasn&#x27;t the same. it has been reformulated and isn&#x27;t as pretty as the original.</li>
            <li> Definitely disappointed by the color of this polish. I thought I was going to get a pretty holographic color with multi-dimensional sparkles, buuuut I didn&#x27;t.  My Private Jet, this version at least, is really somewhat drab and not a color I would pick out for myself. Great seller and service, horrible color.</li>
            <li> its brown, the original was a black holo. I was so excited to get this because it is very hard to find. I&#x27;ll have ro keep looking</li>
            <li> The color is exactly like what i see in the picture and is in good condition! Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Manicures were the first to go with this economy and the birth of my first child. So I decided to buy nail polish. This is the neatest color. It&#x27;s a medium brown color with hints of glitter. Though it has glitter it is conservative enough for the office. To see a better depiction of this color go to opi&#x27;s site.</li>
            <li> Beautiful dark brown with shimmer color, perfect for fall! I have been wearing this on my fingers and its a nice upbeat color thanks to the shimmer on it</li>
            <li> My favorite OPI color! I love black polish and the bottle I have is almost a blackish-brown. The subtle sparkles and holographic effect it gives it much more depth and just seems edgier than plain black polish. Love it! Will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> Speedy - love this color! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like color on me.</li>
            <li> The product is great. However this is not the original shade so it takes two coats to really show the effect.</li>
            <li> i would totally recomend it. i love the shade, it last the whole week, i simply love it, thank you</li>
            <li> - Matt, subtle glitter through a mocha colour.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to apply with minimal to no streaks.&lt;br /&gt;- Dried quick.&lt;br /&gt;- Noticeable chipping after about 2 days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of my most favorite colors, along with the hologram colors &amp; your service was great! Have a Blessed Day, Rita Norton</li>
            <li> This color goes with anything! I describe it as black with just a hint of shimmer. It&#x27;s a great fall color, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll wear it in the summer too!</li>
            <li> love this color. its a good alternative to just black.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let this color scare you.  Obviously if you are even looking at this review you probably like dark polish.  This is definitely dark but very very pretty.  I put 2 coats on and it is dark but has little sparkles so it looks more like a sparkly dark grey.  I have gotten several comments on it.  Opi nail polish is my favorite because it lasts for so long.  My husband HATES the smell of nail polish so I don&#x27;t like to do my nails more than once in 1 or 2 weeks.  I use the Opi base and top coats and 2 coats of polish.  It always dries so nice too.</li>
            <li> I know there is a lot out there about 2 batches of this polish out there, the first one being a true black. I received what I believe is the second version. It looks chocolate in the bottle but 2 coats on the nail gives a very dark, espresso like brown/almost black with shimmer. I think it&#x27;s beautiful on the nail and I am not disappointed at all!</li>
            <li> a very nice sparkly black</li>
            <li> Funny how the husband is given reviews on nail polish, but I must say, this company did a wonderful job...Recieved the item before the estimated time, great color, and of coarse, she loves it...Well done...</li>
            <li> Two coats and two episodes of Phineas &amp; Ferb and I am set for the classy yet edginess that is this nail polish. At first, when I put it on my toes, I wasn&#x27;t thrilled because it was too dark. But a week ago I tried the colour on my hands (since I am no longer in the government--I do what I want!!!) and it really goes well with my skin tone!!! And when the sunlight hits it the sparkles almost burst off your fingertips like magic. It really is a beautiful dark gray. For woman (or men...?) who LOVE metal tones, this is the one you want to get for that shimmering iron look. I believe this colour goes with any skin tone, but probably works best with yellow undertones, or browns to dark brown to black. Goth people stay away. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s meant for transluscent skin. Hahaha.</li>
            <li> I bought this polish, \\&quot;My Private Jet\\&quot;, based on a picture of the original version, which looked to be more of a purple holographic. At the time, I did not know that 2 versions of \\&quot;My Private Jet\\&quot; even existed- the polish that I got was the newer version. This color is more of a bronze-ish color almost, with tiny flecks of glitter. Under a lamp, it seems that there is a greenish tint to the glitter. Today is not a sunny day, so I can&#x27;t say how it looks under sunlight. While this newer version is a pretty color, it is nothing like what I thought I was getting. (My own fault)</li>
            <li> The bottle in the picture looks like the brown formula to me.  I know of three different versions; this brown version, the original black version with the holographic glitter and a black version with blue shimmer.  It&#x27;s a beautiful color otherwise, but I wish the original version wasn&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
            <li> Took it with me for Ped and 2 other women were requesting.  Luxy Nail is now ordering to have on hand (smile).</li>
            <li> I generaly love OPI and mostly use their nail polishes, My Private Jet is one of my favorite shades particularly good during winter season....</li>
            <li> i really didnt see the effet in the nail polish.. maybe i need another one? sooo mad that i didnt get the effect</li>
            <li> The bottle of MY Private Jet I received looks EXACTLY like the bottle in the picture.  dark grey almost black with the teeny, tiny holographic glitter flakes in it.  I love it ! Perfect polish for the fall! I get soo many compliments on my nails !   Looks very chic and fun without looking too young.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this to be the original MPJ.  I did expect this to be the brown version based on the picture and what I saw once I got a look at the bottle in real life and well, it&#x27;s not exactly as brown as it appeared.  This one is a charcoal black base with scattered holographic glitter.  In the bottle, it looks like it has a bronze-y kind of duo chrome but that becomes lost when swatched on the nail wheel.  What I see most on the nail wheel is silver, blue and pink glitter flashes, which gives it a very slight lavender cast under my daylight desk lamp.  We&#x27;re overcast and snowy here right now so I can&#x27;t speak to what it looks like in full sun.  It does look more brown in the snow light, though.  That tells me this one is going to have several different personalities, which is something I really like.  And I have several holos that I can top it with to make it look even more different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first thought was that it was close to Color Club Revvvolution but upon comparing the swatches, it&#x27;s not.  The holo in this one is definitely more scattered.  Still, it&#x27;s not like anything else I own and I&#x27;m looking forward to wearing it....soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you&#x27;re dead set on the holo version of this polish, don&#x27;t hesitate to get this one.  It truly is a beautiful polish in it&#x27;s own right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  In an attempt to \\&quot;franken\\&quot; a copy of the original MPJ, I added some Color Club Harp on It and Cherubic and the result was pretty darn close and it&#x27;s more opaque than what I&#x27;m understanding the original MPJ was.  So, get this one, get some strong holographic like the two I used and franken your own \\&quot;original\\&quot; version.  Mine came out charcoal gray with a bit of holographic goodness.  It&#x27;s not linear by any stretch of the imagination but it&#x27;s really, really close.</li>
            <li> If you want a trendy color this season, especially for your toes, you can&#x27;t beat &amp;#34;My Private Jet&amp;#34;.  I learned about it at the Mirage&#x27;s Nail Spa in Las Vegas, and I&#x27;ve been using it for my pedicures ever since.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutly love this color. I think it&#x27;s discontinuted because I haven&#x27;t seen it anywhere else, but it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> You are making me write a review on freaking nail polish. It was the right color and it worked as expected</li>
            <li> While the nail polish is pretty it is really black with sparkles. But it is OPI so of course it is good quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this color. I noticed that you can get two different effects from it. If you committ to doing just one light but even, streak free layer you will get a lighter outcome and the sparkles will show off better. If you do two layers then  you get a very dark color- basically black, with sparkles in them. I recommend trying one thin, even layer first and letting it dry.&lt;br /&gt;I topped my my two layers off with a very durable top coat. Next time, I will be doing one layer because I like it better; but both are gorgous.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll see if I can figure out how to add a pic of my nails so you can see. :)</li>
            <li> This is a gorgeous, dark polish with bronze and brown overtones. Depending on the light I&#x27;m viewing it in (sunlight vs office or standard indoor lighting). In sunlight, it has an almost linear holographic appearance. It&#x27;s not as strong as some of the Layla or Color Club holos, but it&#x27;s still gorgeous nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used three coats to get the polish to my desired opacity (I&#x27;m really picky about visible nail lines, and mine are always difficult to cover up). It removed easily as well, even with top and basecoat, and lasted 3 days before I got slight chipping (I&#x27;m hard on my nails, so this is a good thing that it lasted 3 days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s now a staple in my fall colors, and it even goes well with my pasty white skin. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone for their collection.</li>
            <li> I love this OPI color! You can&#x27;t see it from the picture very well, but it has a lot of gold tone sparkles in it. The price was great as well and delivery super fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this nail polish because it appeared to be a sparkly grayish black.  It is in fact a sparkly bronzy brown.  Almost as if they added sparkle to the brown shade from the Texas collection...very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Looooove the color!!&lt;br /&gt;My favorite from OPI so far!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The color is so different, beautiful and just not your everyday color!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite color EVER! I own I think 5 bottles only because I know they my discontinue at any moment it&#x27;s a really fun color</li>
            <li> I love the color.....it&#x27;s just what was displayed. I&#x27;m happy with this product.  I would reccomend it to my friends</li>
            <li> This OPI color is dark with small sparkles. Love it! Not only is it a beautiful shade, it dries really quickly and for some reason just lasts and lasts. It went DAYS before chipping and I couldn&#x27;t believe it! Don&#x27;t be afraid to go dark! This is really a great winter and fall color so give it a go. You don&#x27;t have to be stuck with the same old red nail polish - try something new and you will be so happy you did!</li>
            <li> I know some people mentioned this is not the same color they ordered but I love what I received.  It&#x27;s a pretty brown and I have worn it several times.</li>
            <li> Some pics show it as a dark jet black, but it has a dark brown tone with a hint of glitter. I love it.</li>
            <li> The product description and pictures lead me to believe this would be a black toned color however when I received it it is a brown based and not what I expected. It is not appealing.</li>
            <li> It might look brown as you look at the bottle, but it&#x27;s not.  It&#x27;s a really great dark gray color with just the right amount of sparkle.  Love this on my toes.</li>
            <li> Great color. One coat provided sufficient coverage. Does not chip. I really like that it&#x27;s dark but not a typical black.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, dark and chic, perfect for winter!</li>
            <li> What a gorgeous and different color! Not an inky black. It&#x27;s difficult to describe...it looks rich! different! and goes with everything! I thought with proper top coats to protect it, it lasted just less than a week.</li>
            <li> I like this color but since it has sparkles in it, it can be challenging to remove. Color is a darker gray.</li>
            <li> I purchased this color for my wife, who has fair skin and enjoys dark color polishes.  This color looks great, but it&#x27;s not as dark as I had believed.  It actually takes a brownish hue in the light.  It also has flecks of green visible in direct light.  The color looks good, but to get 5/5 stars it would have to be as dark as it looks in the bottle and picture.  It&#x27;s not black.</li>
            <li> This polish was not al all holo .. Not even a little bit. And completely black.. Not even dark brown! I understand there&#x27;s several versions of this color, but I must have got the worst one. On top of all this, I couldn&#x27;t wear it if I wanted to bc the brush was completely detached from the lid.. Usually when this happens I just twist it back closed tight and when I unscrew it its fine but this one was completely defective... In every way possible...&lt;br /&gt;I did however get a complete refund. I will try purchasing from another seller.. If it doesn&#x27;t work out this time, I will have to buy it from a store where I can see it before I buy it.</li>
            <li> I just love this color!!  It was same color was I except.  And shipping was quick too!  Thank you!!  I might go for next one!!</li>
            <li> I love mail polishes. What can I say. It&#x27;s just wonderful. Goes with everything on me XD. Olive skin XD.</li>
            <li> I love this color. The picture shows it perfectly! I pair it with the OPI nail envy base coat and it lasts for a couple weeks without chipping.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as pictured and described. It was shipped quickly and packaged safely so that the nail polish would not break.</li>
            <li> BEWARE!!!!!  This is the holographic shimmer version of MPJ not the Linear one.  The linear one goes for almost $100 on ebay.  If you really want the linear holographic orginal version then you best bet is to go to your local nail salons and see if they have it on their shelves and are willing to sell it to you.  Other than that you can pay $79 for it on ebay.</li>
            <li> Great brand, great quality nail polish and a reasonable price. This color is my favorite every day choice, dark but not distracting and I love the muted glittery feel.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this color, i got so many compliments on it.  its pretty with two coats and even more with three. it was a great price and quick shipping</li>
            <li> I love this color it&#x27;s going to look great on my nails..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cant wait to try it on, Thank you for quick delivery</li>
            <li> I am a fan of OPI polish and don&#x27;t mind paying a little more for it.  OPI stay on, covers well, and looks smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for different shade of black, black-blue, black-purple, black-grey and grey for my toes (due to &amp;#34;runner&#x27;s toes&amp;#34;, I need a dark color to cover the uglies).&lt;br /&gt;My Private Jet is actually a graphite grey color with iridescent colored glittery flecks in it.  Two coats gave a very pretty color, the iridescent sparkles were a nice surprise and reflect every so slightly in the sun or bright light.  It does NOT look like glitter polish and is NOT difficult to remove like the glitter polish (Mad as a Hatter - very difficult to remove!!)&lt;br /&gt;I think this color would be pretty and tasteful on fingernails as well.</li>
            <li> I finished soo fast. It had a halo affect that most nail polishes don&#x27;t have. It made my nails look great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read there are several versions of this color. The one I received Is black with tiny speckles of silver. Two or three coats looks best. Yet in the bottle it looks a bronze almost like a shiny, brownish-green with tiny specks of orange and blue. It&#x27;s a weird color to describe. And quite unpredictable.</li>
            <li> Delivery was prompt. I was so excited to have receive my new nail polish. I painted my nails, and voila, the color is beautiful. I will buy another one. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I thought this was the holographic version,but I should have known the price was too low for that!  Its a nice polish, just not what I expected.</li>
            <li> my private jet is a lovely charcoal brownish scattered holo polish. it is a gorgeous and very flattering color. however opi has changed the formula of the years so there are different versions of this floating around.</li>
            <li> Plenty of compliments on this color...it is black/brown/gunmetal all at the same time.</li>
            <li> I love this color! The polish I received was exactly what was shown in the picture. It&#x27;s so fun when the sun shines on it, too. This is my new favorite. I just ordered another one for my Mother-in-Law becuase I think she&#x27;ll love it, too!</li>
            <li> Shipped faster than expected pretty color matches the picture, yea I kinda purchased this because of the name lol. I&#x27;m new to opi and far from disappointed,I&#x27;ve been eyeballing this polish debating if I&#x27;d like it on my skin tone(caramel) initially I was a little on the fence but by day 3 I&#x27;m in love! This color is gorgeous in the sun I was BEYOND impressed!its a little more toned down in regular light but that&#x27;s fine. The shimmer is what I like to call a \\&quot;mature shimmer\\&quot;not kid like obnoxious shimmer it&#x27;s very work place friendly, and because it&#x27;s not black I think this is a perfect transition color for one who is going into darker colors such as myself but not yet ready to commit to a full black polish lol. I know this isn&#x27;t the original formula but this is a creamy dark, a different kind of chocolate grey color(very build-able) with a subtle yet beautiful holographic tint(the colors you see depends on you and number of coats, the more the darker) also hasn&#x27;t chipped one bit! I can&#x27;t stop looking at my nails! Buying another bottle asap:)</li>
            <li> Very flaky. Falls off easily.</li>
            <li> I had been eyeing this color for a while and finally bought it. I liked the fact that with one coat I could have the soft milk-chocolatey look shown in this photo, but with 3 coats my best friend could get the deeper darker color that she likes in a polish. after putting only one coat on my nails....I had the 3 coat darker color right off the bat. it was way darker than I anticipated. the good thing is that the more coats you put on, the more glittery sparkle appears. so while my initial reaction was &amp;#34;OMG...way to dark for me!&amp;#34;, after 2 coats the sparkly glitters of gold, silver, etc...lightened up the coffee brown polish color. it was actually a pleasant surprise. I would not recommend this for you girls out there who like lighter, softer shades. even the first coat is bold. :)</li>
            <li> This OPI nail polish was just how it is shown! Well, maybe a little darker with one coat, but it looks amazing none the less :D</li>
            <li> Although I thought this color was going to be different than it is, I still love and every time I wear it I get tons of compliments.  Arrived on time, flawless transaction!</li>
            <li> but I wish one coat of if looked more like the picture advertised. It&#x27;s more black than brown; however, I still really like it. It&#x27;s shimmery in a non-offensive way.</li>
            <li> This is a unique color.  It&#x27;s a brownish grey color with glitter.  I find that it takes about 3 coats for it to fully cover and I liked it better with 4 coats.  I think its a great color because it&#x27;s not something that everyone else will be wearing.  I find it goes with a good deal of my wardrobe and looks good while running errands or going out to a nice dinner. I would recommend this as a color that you would want to add to your collection.</li>
            <li> 5 star! This was a gift. I am very please with the quality and delivered as promised. I would definitely buy again. Recommend, you can buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> I love this color and would not be happier.  I love OPI polish and this was a steal!  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This polish to me looked better online.  When I put it on it really looked like grey polish with sand in it.</li>
