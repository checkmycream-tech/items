            <li>I have had difficulty over the years in finding a mousse that really gives my hair body and fullness and this is one of the products that really works.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the spray because it seems to squirt out too much and put way too much product in one area.</li>

            <li>This mousse by far makes my hair styling easier.</li>
            <li>The applicator nozzle is small and fine so you can apply exactly how much you need strategically at the roots and blow dry for instant hold - brush it out</li>
            <li>The product is difficult to get used to, but does offer a lift once you get the right amount for your length of hair - mine is fine and long.</li>

            <li> I have curly flat hair.  </li>

            <li> A little goes a long way so this bottle lasts a while.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Sure</li>
            <li> Hate to pay such high prices, but once in a while, you find a product that completely justifies that.  </li>
            <li> I dislike the typical \\&quot;product\\&quot; gunky feeling.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t think my hair will ever be voluminous, but at least it&#x27;s not plastered to my scalp with this product.</li>
            <li> was very inconvenient and I dislike having to take this action</li>
            <li> I was sent the wrong product and will have to return.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and have always hated that.</li>

            <li> I dislike the typical \\&quot;product\\&quot; gunky feeling. This product doesn&#x27;t leave any of the residue or create stiffness. I&#x27;ve used numerous times at the salon and decided to spend the money (I don&#x27;t splurge on extras). It&#x27;s totally worth it; as mentioned in other reviews a little goes a long way. :)    If you&#x27;re on the fence, give a bottle a try. I love it!!</li>
            <li> The top of this item was mossing. The cap was there but the part that makes the product come out was missing. And they do not except returns. So I am stuck with and item I can&#x27;t use.  Pamlea Allen</li>
            <li> I have had difficulty over the years in finding a mousse that really gives my hair body and fullness and this is one of the products that really works.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff everyday and it works great. It gives my hair good volume, dries well, and holds. It&#x27;s flexible and easy to brush through. It has a very light smell which I like. It smells very natural. I would recommend this product to anyone. Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I was sent the wrong product and will have to return.&lt;br /&gt;This was very inconvenient and I dislike having to take this action</li>
            <li> The product is difficult to get used to, but does offer a lift once you get the right amount for your length of hair - mine is fine and long.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! Spray on damp hair roots and blow dry. AMAZEBALLS! Volume!</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday. A little goes a long way so this bottle lasts a while. The applicator nozzle is small and fine so you can apply exactly how much you need strategically at the roots and blow dry for instant hold - brush it out and you have volume without stiffness. Since I have fine hair I spray a small mound into my palm, rub palms together and run fingers and hands through wet hair, focusing on applying to the scalp and roots and then reaching the rest of the hair. Your styling sets faster and holds longer with manageability. This product is gentle enough to use everyday, protects color from fading and no build up. I love it. And shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li> I used to use this product all the time but bought at a salon. My salon  stopped selling root lift by Pureology so I decided to buy this product. I don&#x27;t know why it was so different but it was not the same. The can looks exactly the same but the product was like water.</li>
            <li> I swear by pureology products. I have thin hair and have always hated that. However, ever since my stylist tried the volumizing mist, I&#x27;ve been hooked. This mousse by far makes my hair styling easier. It gives nice texture after blow drying, keeping those curls in my hair (all day) that have never stayed before. Way to go pureology, you did it for me!</li>
            <li> Packaging excellent, shipping time excellent, I love the product and plan to purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I have curly flat hair.  I have been using a styling cream but had very little body.  I moved the Root Lifter with styling creme and my hair looks good.  Much more body.  Used the Root lifter alone and did not work as well for me.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this for years.  i have very fine hair and it gives me the body and lift i love</li>
            <li> The Complex adds volume to my very fine textured hair and still feels light. I do not have to wash it any more often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and absolutely LOVE what it does for my hair.  Especially good for colored/highlighted hair!</li>
            <li> I would rather use Pureology&#x27;s mousse.  I don&#x27;t like the spray because it seems to squirt out too much and put way too much product in one area.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, blonde hair that just hangs straight against my scalp without product. This stuff is my fave! I use it every day for texture at the roots to prevent limp, hanging hair. I don&#x27;t think my hair will ever be voluminous, but at least it&#x27;s not plastered to my scalp with this product. And it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or turn into greasy hairspry kind of feeling at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Ordered pureology anti fade root lift mousse for color treated hair. Got the item quickly, but it wasn&#x27;t for color treated hair. 😞</li>
            <li> Hate to pay such high prices, but once in a while, you find a product that completely justifies that.  Gives so much body, without weight--great texturizer too.</li>
            <li> Product great but any time I take on a trip thepressure does not ho;d and it goes all over. Need to make a traqvel size</li>
            <li> I have fine hair which tends to lie flat.  This product provides much needed lift.  It feels very natural.  By the way, I don&#x27;t blue dry but just letkt hair air dry and still get good results.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Sure make my hair look thicker and nicer.&lt;br /&gt;Pureology is a product you can count on.</li>
