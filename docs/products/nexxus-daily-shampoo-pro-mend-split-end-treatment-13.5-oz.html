            <li>Excellent shampoo.</li>
            <li>This nexxus pro-mend shampoo does a wonderful job.</li>
            <li>Great stuff!  </li>
            <li>Great Price!  </li>
            <li>Price is best on Amazon, although a month or two ago it was like $7.50, but I can&#x27;t complain re Amazon -</li>
            <li>The product itself is absolutely awesome.</li>
            <li>Then, I found this beautiful product.</li>
            <li>but this product improved the health of my ends greatly.</li>
            <li>Great product - does what it advertises.</li>
            <li>Another great tip is to add 5-6 drops of rosemary oil to the conditioner-</li>
            <li>I will say that I do have some Pro-Mend Heat Protexx heat protectant that I purchased before I bought the rest of this line, and it is great.</li>
            <li>Great Shampoo - pairs well with the Nexxus Pro Mend Conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair feels great and I am getting lots of complements on my hair now.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is great.  </li>
            <li>I have used the Diametress and loved it.  </li>
            <li>good shampoo can prevent the split end by nourishing hair ends..  </li>
            <li>It is good.  </li>
            <li>Both smell clean and delicious without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>and i feel pleased and happy with it</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>And did I mention that the smell is amazing?</li>
            <li>Smells AMAZING</li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>All three products are great my hair is smooth</li>
            <li>It smells so AMAZING.</li>
            <li>My split ends were getting to the point of having a mind of their own.</li>
            <li>The kind they sell around Christmas a lot.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ll be honest,  </li>
            <li>I washed my hair with the shampoo which felt nice and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It works up to a nice lather</li>
            <li>this is OK shampoo, havent really seen any awesome split end improvement.</li>
            <li>so knots after a shower happen and my brush glides through my hair after using this shampoo/conditioner....I even started looking into nexxus&#x27;s other products because I was so impressed with how much I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>Honestly that&#x27;s the most I&#x27;ve ever paid for conditioner, but</li>
            <li>Def an amazing product after trying out so many shampoos.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written on any product, that&#x27;s how happy Nexxus has made me.  </li>
            <li>thought I liked the shampoo at first, my hair was a nice texture and the smell was nice, not overly girly like some.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Still, how many times does something claim to fix your hair and how many times do you come away disappointed?&lt;br</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>but it helps the pieces lie closer together and look more like 1 strand which will of course help you with your frizz problems.</li>
            <li>More than anything I love the way it makes my hair smell and feel.</li>
            <li>but I would say it probably does better at preventing them by keeping your hair healthy</li>
            <li>Boy, am I glad I did.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell WONDERFUL</li>
            <li>The next day, my hair still smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I am in love.</li>
            <li>However, that&#x27;s still a lot better than the alternative of having knotted, damaged hair.</li>
            <li>either so the idea that it could do what it said was comical to me.  </li>
            <li>It is not a terrible shampoo, but the smell is horrendous.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy after researching multiple products I landed on the Nexxus line...</li>
            <li>But I needed more fixing than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Truthfully in 2 days I noticed smoother hair.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s the most I&#x27;ve ever paid for conditioner, but sometimes you can get coupons on the retailer&#x27;s website.  </li>
            <li>However I will continue to use as my hair seems to be improving with more use</li>
            <li>I did not have this luck with most of the Nexxus Pro-Mend Line.</li>
            <li>Nice, light weight, and leaves no sticky residue.</li>
            <li>my ends seemed much more hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the shampoo</li>
            <li>The conditioner was interesting.  </li>
            <li>Now for my favorite part - the leave in creme.  </li>
            <li>I get split ends and dryness from highlights (on top of highlights, and so on).</li>
            <li>And I love how it smells.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t love any of them, but this is a review on the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>infact i had more split ends..</li>
            <li>But it will make your hair feel nice &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference right away; my hair felt healthier, it felt softer, looks thicker, it looked better and stayed looking nice, and as a perk it smelled nice too.  </li>
            <li>I blow dry it and it turns out wonderful and more manageable.</li>
            <li>Id say you get a pretty good amount.</li>
            <li>When I first bought the shampoo and conditioner at Ulta, the sales clerk told me she had a friend who tried it and LOVED it.</li>
            <li>It was icing on the cake to find out I could order it on \\&quot;Subscribe and Save,\\&quot; saving 20% over Amazon&#x27;s already pretty good price.</li>
            <li>I have been using this off and on for several years and it is a very good conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Yesterday just used a bit of another brand conditioner instead of the treatment and my hair is silky smooth, no knots, works so much better than the Nexxus split end treatment.</li>
            <li>- it has a good lather and feels like it really cleans, but leaves my hair moisterized.  </li>
            <li>There was a noticeable difference after the first time I used it and after using the whole bottle along with the conditioner my stylist of 10 years is super impressed with the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li>After the FIRST use my ends felt so much better!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s strong.</li>
            <li>it will make your hair shiny and strong</li>
            <li>Amazing difference after the first use of this and the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell (unless you don&#x27;t like it), but it&#x27;s a lot stronger than most hair care products I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just switched from a special keratin shampoo which I don&#x27;t think was doing a very good job actually cleaning my hair-</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and tinted.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is wavy and gets frizzy and damaged from coloring and styling.  </li>
            <li>You can tell a huge difference in the silkiness of your hair after just ONE use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to say that I was split end free</li>
            <li>the longer I use Pro Mend, the more my over processed hair looks freshly cut.  </li>
            <li>It does give your hair a very distinct feeling, however, that some might not like.</li>
            <li>Also, even when I just had a small amount in my palm, I could smell the awesome scent-</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try the Nexxus.</li>
            <li>all that clean.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t wait to see how my hair responds to the full treatment of Pro-Mend, and I wholeheartedly recommend this product to any woman with this problem.  </li>
            <li>When I saw this line on sale at Costco, I took two sets because I had read such good things about it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about these products.  </li>
            <li>Maybe good for someone who shampoos daily.</li>
            <li>(though to be fair I only used about one bottle&#x27;s worth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair had a nice shine and felt so soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year now and love the way it makes my hair feel, very silky.  </li>
            <li>After the first use I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference, in fact it seemed my hair knotted more easily.</li>
            <li>I also used Biosilk (which also has a pretty strong scent) and I can&#x27;t even smell it over the Nexxus.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re there in the back where I can&#x27;t seethem, but I&#x27;ve never been able to look at the front ends of my hair and not see split ends.  </li>
            <li>but I could see and feel a huge improvement after the first wash.</li>
            <li>Quick results after the first use!</li>
            <li>As soon as it hits your scalp, you can feel your hair becoming smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>It really, really works!!  </li>
            <li>After you take a shower, your hair doesn&#x27;t only feel amazing, but it smells like you just went to a salon to get your hair done.</li>
            <li>it would be worth it.  </li>
            <li>You can kind of feel that the hair shafts are glued back together.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this as coloring my hair, I have developed many split ends.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try if you are trying to repair your hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try if you are trying to repair your hair.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t find any split ends right now</li>
            <li>I just run about a quarter sized amount through my hair again and it soaks right in, leaving no residue.  </li>
            <li>I just run about a quarter sized amount through my hair again and it soaks right in, leaving no residue.  </li>
            <li>I believe it fused most of them together as it appears today that they are more or less gone.</li>
            <li>Have been using all for about 3 weeks, I have very fine hair that weighs down easily.</li>
            <li>I decided to pay a little more for my products and now use Pureology products, and my hair is healthy, shiny and bouncy again.</li>
            <li>I first saw this product at the Bx and my first reaction was to laugh at it.  </li>
            <li>After a few weeks I noticed my scalp was getting more and more irritated</li>
            <li>I honestly think I had split ends on ever single hair.</li>
            <li>though my hair looks great the first day I use this product, by the second day my split ends are back.</li>
            <li>I was literally stunned with the first try.  </li>
            <li>first thing I noticed was the smell - it smells like a vanilla cookie candle.</li>
            <li>I could not stop touching my hair, something that usually only happens after a trip to the salon.  </li>
            <li>Ok - I have never in my 30 years of life come across a shampoo that actually does what it says -Nexxus</li>
            <li>SO MUCH NEXXUS!</li>
            <li>(Different from Nexxus Emergencee, I like Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor better).</li>
            <li>and it has done a stellar job at reducing the appearance of split ends in my bangs.</li>
            <li>Dare I say, a stellar job?</li>
            <li>This is exactly what Pro-Mend was supposed to do, except the Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling sticky.</li>
            <li>Your split ends will be gone after the first treatment.  </li>
            <li>A CHANGE YALL SEE A CHANGE WHEN YOU FIRST WASH YOUR HAIR</li>
            <li>I first heard about this Nexxus product on the radio, during a time when I have been wishing for smoother hair.</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve done the repair, you might want to use it ever few days or a couple times a month and use another good shampoo and conditioner in between.  </li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve done the repair, you might want to use it ever few days or a couple times a month and use another good shampoo and conditioner in between.  </li>
            <li>It said to wait for a few uses, so to be fair</li>
            <li>I have tried may products to help with the frizz and protect my hair from damage but none have really worked well and many of them just weighed down my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Usually, my hair doesn&#x27;t retain fragrances from shampoos, but even now, 4 hours after my shower and after a blow dry, it still smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>but it does really improve your split ends.</li>
            <li>I do recommend this product to my friends and will continue to use it because I feel it makes my hair look and feel much healthier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to lie, I was VERY unsure about this product</li>
            <li>and I was dreading having to cut so much of my hair off</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Hair always feels so smooth after conditioning, but this was different.</li>
            <li>It hung all together and straight.</li>
            <li>My hair seemed to instantly detangle and smooth out even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>READY</li>
            <li>IT REALLY DOSE</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find much appeal with this shampoo ( or conditioner).</li>
            <li>I bought the whole system and started with the overnight treatment.  </li>
            <li>It was very creamy</li>
            <li>My hair felt very silky when it rinsed out.    </li>
            <li>Now for what you really want to know - did it fix my split ends???  </li>
            <li>I tried it for a whole month.</li>
            <li>This really helped my hair out a lot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s of medium texture and straight as a stick, or was until I moved and the underneath got a bit</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m too attached to it to cut much off</li>
            <li>I used this whole bottle before writing the review..</li>
            <li>And I am really disapointed, I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement -.-</li>
            <li>and now I don&#x27;t even have to used them so much because I have no split ends to tackle.</li>
            <li>I also feel as though, and the smell may be to blame, that it does not clean my hair very well or that it does not rinse out very easily.  </li>
            <li>I, like many other reviewers, saw a visible improvement in the ends of my hair after just one use.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair which is fine.</li>
            <li>First, a little about my hair type:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I moved from a very dry, hot climate, where my hair looked great so long as I used a moisturizing shampoo, any moisturizing shampoo, to a high humidity cool climate where my hair is unruly with fly-a-ways, static and and just a slight wave in the underneath.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Currently I&#x27;m using the full system and I can&#x27;t find any split ends.  </li>
            <li>and this is partially due to me recently dying my hair which made it super dry and battled against all the good pro-mend does!).&lt;br /&gt;Almost a year without split ends is miraculous in my book-</li>
            <li>not daily, however its safe to do daily if you wish).</li>
            <li>not repurchase anything in this particular Nexxus line.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product.</li>
            <li>have VERY long hair that gets oily near the scalp very quickly</li>
            <li>My hair is very soft and smooth when dry.</li>
            <li>The only down side is the smell which is quite strong, it&#x27;s not unpleasant but just too perfumed.</li>
            <li>I read about Pro-Mend in Better Home &amp; Garden a few days ago.  </li>
            <li>I rarely ever write reviews, but couldn&#x27;t believe that the the Pro-Mend system actually does what it says, so I just thought I&#x27;d share my experience.</li>
            <li>Its worth the extra money, and</li>
            <li>I would say that my hair looked better than usual when styled - both when curly and straight.    </li>
            <li>Okay long story short, lost some hair due to an accident and some neurological meds, growing it back, really want to keep it healthy.</li>
            <li>I cant get over how much I love this shampoo and conditioner combo - i have very long -dyed- blonde hair</li>
            <li>I only have the Conditioner right now.  </li>
            <li>I think everyone is a little skeptical of this product at first because it just sounds too good to be true!</li>
            <li>so I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li>Now I just got back from Afghanistan in July, and for obvious reasons this rotation wasn&#x27;t available to me while deployed.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner was $13.49, a lot for someone on a fixed income, but if it works, Yahoo!</li>
            <li>A big first for me.  </li>
            <li>When I got home one of my first stops was to the salon where I told my stylist to just cut off the damage, which ended up being about 4 inches (a big deal for someone with hair like mine).  </li>
            <li>After the first 3 washes, I felt and saw a big difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In general, it is best to get a hair cut if your hair is in bad condition, but as in my case, sometimes it just isn&#x27;t practical.</li>
            <li>I generally use products costing 2-3 times as much as this line, so I was surprised that this system worked so well.    </li>
            <li>Goodbye split ends for my 10 year old.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo exceeded my expectations by far.  </li>
            <li>However, I kept using it and two weeks later, my hair looks SO MUCH healthier.  </li>
            <li>far stiffer</li>
            <li>The next time I styled it straight.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully Amazon will keep the price reasonable, unlike your local drugstore.</li>
            <li>I only gave this 3 stars because I do not think that the shampoo is necessary (or maybe just worth the money) to get the desired results of hiding split ends.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried it I styled my hair wavy, and it looked better than usual - it did not weigh down my hair.  </li>
            <li>I saw the most dramatic difference the first time I used the product (like the commercial says).</li>
            <li>Made my fine hair look flat, dull, lifeless and very greasy.  </li>
            <li>Never got better in fact got worse, hair knotted constantly at the ends and hair fell out more than usual.</li>
            <li>I have tried lots of different brands of shampoo and conditioner and Nexxus is definitely one of my very favorites.</li>
            <li>and I expected it to soak right in, but it initially just sits on your hair like a film.  </li>
            <li>My hair was better, slightly less frizz on the ends, but I could feel that the back was still in rough shape.  </li>
            <li>I plan on buying the complete system next week, I am sold on it.  </li>
            <li>As for mending split ends, Im not sure how true that is</li>
            <li>The shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, so if I am running late or pressed for time, I am okay with skipping the conditioner for that morning</li>
            <li>its not good to go this long without a cut because the longer you go the worse split ends get which means the more they need to cut off to make your hair look healthy again)-</li>
            <li>I have very damaged hair due to 2 unsuccesful hair relaxation treatments.</li>
            <li>and even though its been nearly a year since I last got my hair cut, I am just now starting to see some hints of split ends scattered about my head (</li>
            <li>and I was worried that it would be very weighed down.  </li>
            <li>This affects the texture of my hair to the touch slightly, and doesn&#x27;t really bother me.  </li>
            <li>It feels less brittle and looks much healthier.</li>
            <li>~It works for thin, fine hair  </li>

            <li> Excellent shampoo.</li>
            <li> This nexxus pro-mend shampoo does a wonderful job.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  </li>
            <li> Great Price!  </li>
            <li> Price is best on Amazon, although a month or two ago it was like $7.50, but I can&#x27;t complain re Amazon -</li>
            <li> The product itself is absolutely awesome.</li>
            <li> Then, I found this beautiful product.</li>
            <li> but this product improved the health of my ends greatly.</li>
            <li> Great product - does what it advertises.</li>
            <li> Another great tip is to add 5-6 drops of rosemary oil to the conditioner-</li>
            <li> I will say that I do have some Pro-Mend Heat Protexx heat protectant that I purchased before I bought the rest of this line, and it is great.</li>
            <li> Great Shampoo - pairs well with the Nexxus Pro Mend Conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair feels great and I am getting lots of complements on my hair now.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great.  </li>
            <li> I have used the Diametress and loved it.  </li>
            <li> good shampoo can prevent the split end by nourishing hair ends..  </li>
            <li> It is good.  </li>
            <li> Both smell clean and delicious without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li> and i feel pleased and happy with it</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> And did I mention that the smell is amazing?</li>
            <li> Smells AMAZING</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> All three products are great my hair is smooth</li>
            <li> It smells so AMAZING.</li>
            <li> My split ends were getting to the point of having a mind of their own.</li>
            <li> The kind they sell around Christmas a lot.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ll be honest,  </li>
            <li> I washed my hair with the shampoo which felt nice and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It works up to a nice lather</li>
            <li> this is OK shampoo, havent really seen any awesome split end improvement.</li>
            <li> so knots after a shower happen and my brush glides through my hair after using this shampoo/conditioner....I even started looking into nexxus&#x27;s other products because I was so impressed with how much I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Honestly that&#x27;s the most I&#x27;ve ever paid for conditioner, but</li>
            <li> Def an amazing product after trying out so many shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair.  </li>
            <li> This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written on any product, that&#x27;s how happy Nexxus has made me.  </li>
            <li> thought I liked the shampoo at first, my hair was a nice texture and the smell was nice, not overly girly like some.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Still, how many times does something claim to fix your hair and how many times do you come away disappointed?&lt;br</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> but it helps the pieces lie closer together and look more like 1 strand which will of course help you with your frizz problems.</li>
            <li> More than anything I love the way it makes my hair smell and feel.</li>
            <li> but I would say it probably does better at preventing them by keeping your hair healthy</li>
            <li> Boy, am I glad I did.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell WONDERFUL</li>
            <li> The next day, my hair still smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I am in love.</li>
            <li> However, that&#x27;s still a lot better than the alternative of having knotted, damaged hair.</li>
            <li> either so the idea that it could do what it said was comical to me.  </li>
            <li> It is not a terrible shampoo, but the smell is horrendous.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy after researching multiple products I landed on the Nexxus line...</li>
            <li> But I needed more fixing than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Truthfully in 2 days I noticed smoother hair.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the most I&#x27;ve ever paid for conditioner, but sometimes you can get coupons on the retailer&#x27;s website.  </li>
            <li> However I will continue to use as my hair seems to be improving with more use</li>
            <li> I did not have this luck with most of the Nexxus Pro-Mend Line.</li>
            <li> Nice, light weight, and leaves no sticky residue.</li>
            <li> my ends seemed much more hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the shampoo</li>
            <li> The conditioner was interesting.  </li>
            <li> Now for my favorite part - the leave in creme.  </li>
            <li> I get split ends and dryness from highlights (on top of highlights, and so on).</li>
            <li> And I love how it smells.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t love any of them, but this is a review on the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> infact i had more split ends..</li>
            <li> But it will make your hair feel nice &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference right away; my hair felt healthier, it felt softer, looks thicker, it looked better and stayed looking nice, and as a perk it smelled nice too.  </li>
            <li> I blow dry it and it turns out wonderful and more manageable.</li>
            <li> Id say you get a pretty good amount.</li>
            <li> When I first bought the shampoo and conditioner at Ulta, the sales clerk told me she had a friend who tried it and LOVED it.</li>
            <li> It was icing on the cake to find out I could order it on \\&quot;Subscribe and Save,\\&quot; saving 20% over Amazon&#x27;s already pretty good price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this off and on for several years and it is a very good conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Yesterday just used a bit of another brand conditioner instead of the treatment and my hair is silky smooth, no knots, works so much better than the Nexxus split end treatment.</li>
            <li> - it has a good lather and feels like it really cleans, but leaves my hair moisterized.  </li>
            <li> There was a noticeable difference after the first time I used it and after using the whole bottle along with the conditioner my stylist of 10 years is super impressed with the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li> After the FIRST use my ends felt so much better!</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s strong.</li>
            <li> it will make your hair shiny and strong</li>
            <li> Amazing difference after the first use of this and the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad smell (unless you don&#x27;t like it), but it&#x27;s a lot stronger than most hair care products I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just switched from a special keratin shampoo which I don&#x27;t think was doing a very good job actually cleaning my hair-</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and tinted.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is wavy and gets frizzy and damaged from coloring and styling.  </li>
            <li> You can tell a huge difference in the silkiness of your hair after just ONE use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to say that I was split end free</li>
            <li> the longer I use Pro Mend, the more my over processed hair looks freshly cut.  </li>
            <li> It does give your hair a very distinct feeling, however, that some might not like.</li>
            <li> Also, even when I just had a small amount in my palm, I could smell the awesome scent-</li>
            <li> so I was excited to try the Nexxus.</li>
            <li> all that clean.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t wait to see how my hair responds to the full treatment of Pro-Mend, and I wholeheartedly recommend this product to any woman with this problem.  </li>
            <li> When I saw this line on sale at Costco, I took two sets because I had read such good things about it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about these products.  </li>
            <li> Maybe good for someone who shampoos daily.</li>
            <li> (though to be fair I only used about one bottle&#x27;s worth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair had a nice shine and felt so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year now and love the way it makes my hair feel, very silky.  </li>
            <li> After the first use I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference, in fact it seemed my hair knotted more easily.</li>
            <li> I also used Biosilk (which also has a pretty strong scent) and I can&#x27;t even smell it over the Nexxus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re there in the back where I can&#x27;t seethem, but I&#x27;ve never been able to look at the front ends of my hair and not see split ends.  </li>
            <li> but I could see and feel a huge improvement after the first wash.</li>
            <li> Quick results after the first use!</li>
            <li> As soon as it hits your scalp, you can feel your hair becoming smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> It really, really works!!  </li>
            <li> After you take a shower, your hair doesn&#x27;t only feel amazing, but it smells like you just went to a salon to get your hair done.</li>
            <li> it would be worth it.  </li>
            <li> You can kind of feel that the hair shafts are glued back together.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this as coloring my hair, I have developed many split ends.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try if you are trying to repair your hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try if you are trying to repair your hair.  </li>
            <li> It is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t find any split ends right now</li>
            <li> I just run about a quarter sized amount through my hair again and it soaks right in, leaving no residue.  </li>
            <li> I just run about a quarter sized amount through my hair again and it soaks right in, leaving no residue.  </li>
            <li> I believe it fused most of them together as it appears today that they are more or less gone.</li>
            <li> Have been using all for about 3 weeks, I have very fine hair that weighs down easily.</li>
            <li> I decided to pay a little more for my products and now use Pureology products, and my hair is healthy, shiny and bouncy again.</li>
            <li> I first saw this product at the Bx and my first reaction was to laugh at it.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks I noticed my scalp was getting more and more irritated</li>
            <li> I honestly think I had split ends on ever single hair.</li>
            <li> though my hair looks great the first day I use this product, by the second day my split ends are back.</li>
            <li> I was literally stunned with the first try.  </li>
            <li> first thing I noticed was the smell - it smells like a vanilla cookie candle.</li>
            <li> I could not stop touching my hair, something that usually only happens after a trip to the salon.  </li>
            <li> Ok - I have never in my 30 years of life come across a shampoo that actually does what it says -Nexxus</li>
            <li> SO MUCH NEXXUS!</li>
            <li> (Different from Nexxus Emergencee, I like Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor better).</li>
            <li> and it has done a stellar job at reducing the appearance of split ends in my bangs.</li>
            <li> Dare I say, a stellar job?</li>
            <li> This is exactly what Pro-Mend was supposed to do, except the Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> Your split ends will be gone after the first treatment.  </li>
            <li> A CHANGE YALL SEE A CHANGE WHEN YOU FIRST WASH YOUR HAIR</li>
            <li> I first heard about this Nexxus product on the radio, during a time when I have been wishing for smoother hair.</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve done the repair, you might want to use it ever few days or a couple times a month and use another good shampoo and conditioner in between.  </li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve done the repair, you might want to use it ever few days or a couple times a month and use another good shampoo and conditioner in between.  </li>
            <li> It said to wait for a few uses, so to be fair</li>
            <li> I have tried may products to help with the frizz and protect my hair from damage but none have really worked well and many of them just weighed down my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Usually, my hair doesn&#x27;t retain fragrances from shampoos, but even now, 4 hours after my shower and after a blow dry, it still smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li> but it does really improve your split ends.</li>
            <li> I do recommend this product to my friends and will continue to use it because I feel it makes my hair look and feel much healthier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie, I was VERY unsure about this product</li>
            <li> and I was dreading having to cut so much of my hair off</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Hair always feels so smooth after conditioning, but this was different.</li>
            <li> It hung all together and straight.</li>
            <li> My hair seemed to instantly detangle and smooth out even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> READY</li>
            <li> IT REALLY DOSE</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find much appeal with this shampoo ( or conditioner).</li>
            <li> I bought the whole system and started with the overnight treatment.  </li>
            <li> It was very creamy</li>
            <li> My hair felt very silky when it rinsed out.    </li>
            <li> Now for what you really want to know - did it fix my split ends???  </li>
            <li> I tried it for a whole month.</li>
            <li> This really helped my hair out a lot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s of medium texture and straight as a stick, or was until I moved and the underneath got a bit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too attached to it to cut much off</li>
            <li> I used this whole bottle before writing the review..</li>
            <li> And I am really disapointed, I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement -.-</li>
            <li> and now I don&#x27;t even have to used them so much because I have no split ends to tackle.</li>
            <li> I also feel as though, and the smell may be to blame, that it does not clean my hair very well or that it does not rinse out very easily.  </li>
            <li> I, like many other reviewers, saw a visible improvement in the ends of my hair after just one use.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair which is fine.</li>
            <li> First, a little about my hair type:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I moved from a very dry, hot climate, where my hair looked great so long as I used a moisturizing shampoo, any moisturizing shampoo, to a high humidity cool climate where my hair is unruly with fly-a-ways, static and and just a slight wave in the underneath.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Currently I&#x27;m using the full system and I can&#x27;t find any split ends.  </li>
            <li> and this is partially due to me recently dying my hair which made it super dry and battled against all the good pro-mend does!).&lt;br /&gt;Almost a year without split ends is miraculous in my book-</li>
            <li> not daily, however its safe to do daily if you wish).</li>
            <li> not repurchase anything in this particular Nexxus line.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product.</li>
            <li> have VERY long hair that gets oily near the scalp very quickly</li>
            <li> My hair is very soft and smooth when dry.</li>
            <li> The only down side is the smell which is quite strong, it&#x27;s not unpleasant but just too perfumed.</li>
            <li> I read about Pro-Mend in Better Home &amp; Garden a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> I rarely ever write reviews, but couldn&#x27;t believe that the the Pro-Mend system actually does what it says, so I just thought I&#x27;d share my experience.</li>
            <li> Its worth the extra money, and</li>
            <li> I would say that my hair looked better than usual when styled - both when curly and straight.    </li>
            <li> Okay long story short, lost some hair due to an accident and some neurological meds, growing it back, really want to keep it healthy.</li>
            <li> I cant get over how much I love this shampoo and conditioner combo - i have very long -dyed- blonde hair</li>
            <li> I only have the Conditioner right now.  </li>
            <li> I think everyone is a little skeptical of this product at first because it just sounds too good to be true!</li>
            <li> so I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li> Now I just got back from Afghanistan in July, and for obvious reasons this rotation wasn&#x27;t available to me while deployed.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner was $13.49, a lot for someone on a fixed income, but if it works, Yahoo!</li>
            <li> A big first for me.  </li>
            <li> When I got home one of my first stops was to the salon where I told my stylist to just cut off the damage, which ended up being about 4 inches (a big deal for someone with hair like mine).  </li>
            <li> After the first 3 washes, I felt and saw a big difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In general, it is best to get a hair cut if your hair is in bad condition, but as in my case, sometimes it just isn&#x27;t practical.</li>
            <li> I generally use products costing 2-3 times as much as this line, so I was surprised that this system worked so well.    </li>
            <li> Goodbye split ends for my 10 year old.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo exceeded my expectations by far.  </li>
            <li> However, I kept using it and two weeks later, my hair looks SO MUCH healthier.  </li>
            <li> far stiffer</li>
            <li> The next time I styled it straight.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully Amazon will keep the price reasonable, unlike your local drugstore.</li>
            <li> I only gave this 3 stars because I do not think that the shampoo is necessary (or maybe just worth the money) to get the desired results of hiding split ends.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried it I styled my hair wavy, and it looked better than usual - it did not weigh down my hair.  </li>
            <li> I saw the most dramatic difference the first time I used the product (like the commercial says).</li>
            <li> Made my fine hair look flat, dull, lifeless and very greasy.  </li>
            <li> Never got better in fact got worse, hair knotted constantly at the ends and hair fell out more than usual.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of different brands of shampoo and conditioner and Nexxus is definitely one of my very favorites.</li>
            <li> and I expected it to soak right in, but it initially just sits on your hair like a film.  </li>
            <li> My hair was better, slightly less frizz on the ends, but I could feel that the back was still in rough shape.  </li>
            <li> I plan on buying the complete system next week, I am sold on it.  </li>
            <li> As for mending split ends, Im not sure how true that is</li>
            <li> The shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, so if I am running late or pressed for time, I am okay with skipping the conditioner for that morning</li>
            <li> its not good to go this long without a cut because the longer you go the worse split ends get which means the more they need to cut off to make your hair look healthy again)-</li>
            <li> I have very damaged hair due to 2 unsuccesful hair relaxation treatments.</li>
            <li> and even though its been nearly a year since I last got my hair cut, I am just now starting to see some hints of split ends scattered about my head (</li>
            <li> and I was worried that it would be very weighed down.  </li>
            <li> This affects the texture of my hair to the touch slightly, and doesn&#x27;t really bother me.  </li>
            <li> It feels less brittle and looks much healthier.</li>
            <li> ~It works for thin, fine hair  </li>
            <li> I have dry hair and notice a big difference in the ends and overall feel, moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I would say that at least 50% of my split ends disappeared after the first use.  </li>
            <li> Long story short:  </li>
            <li> It is thick and soaks right into the dry ends of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I mean I thought it was going to take a bit of using to get them mended but the first time was all I needed.</li>
            <li> use far less shampoo than with some brands, it lathers like crazy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only problem is that I have tons of layers, I blowdry every day, I dye my dishwater blonde hair to a medium to dark brown, and I also highlight.</li>
            <li> For as long as I can remember my mother and science have told me that \\&quot;No shampoo can fix split ends.\\</li>
            <li> HOW LONG YOU NEED TO DO IT</li>
            <li> Honestly, I couldn&#x27;t pick up a hunk of my hair without finding some pretty insane split ends.</li>
            <li> I have hair down to my low back area and of course the ends are split.</li>
            <li> When you have very long hair</li>
            <li> I do not color, perm or chemically alter it, yet I do blow dry and use a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> My hair started breaking off and was so dry that she had to cut about 2\\&quot; off because of the damage this product did to my hair.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have a problem with my hair being dry, brittle and so tangled</li>
            <li> It made my hair so dry and brittle even after I used conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was very much under the impression that you could not fix broken hair.  </li>
            <li> I straighten my hair every single say.</li>
            <li> Much better than some very expensive brands out there advertised on TV.  </li>
            <li> I only gave the product 4 stars because, due to the fact that my hair is naturally dry and a wavy, hair dressers have always told me to wash my hair every other day, and</li>
            <li> I figured it might change after I flat ironed the next day, but it was still stiff.</li>
            <li> Also, my scalp is usually dry and itchy, and the shampoo has eliminated this for me!  </li>
            <li> So it does what it says it does - gets rid of split ends - and it left my hair feeling moisterized and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> (I cut it two inches long before basic and didn&#x27;t have to start pulling it back while in uniform for at least a year)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even finish the bottle (which with my long hair doesn&#x27;t take long, about a month to a month and a half depending on the shampoo).</li>
            <li> I followed up with the very thick conditioner, which also seemed like it might be promising.</li>
            <li> the ends are the oldest part, and they do dry and split, causing you to have to cut them endlessly.  </li>
            <li> it meant my hair never really got longer than shoulder length.  </li>
            <li> This was a big waste of money once again.</li>
            <li> the cap was loose and part of it spilled o the other things in the box.</li>
            <li> My hair is also very thin and fine (a horrible combination)and splits easily dispite the fact that I only blow dry my hair a few times a year and flat iron about as often.  </li>
            <li> In two days, using all four products there was an extreme and noticeable difference in the smoothness of my hair.  </li>
            <li> shampoo is like any other shampoo, lather, rinse.  </li>
            <li> It does not feel tacky and greasy like a lot of other products.</li>
            <li> a little of the conditioner goes a long way!</li>
            <li> (I do it about every other time-</li>
            <li> Buy this along with the other nexxus promend system.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After I let my hair air dry for a little bit, I put the leave in creme in.</li>
            <li> I straighten and  blow dry my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> This product has never let me down, and I assure you, it won&#x27;t let you down either.</li>
            <li> I constantly straighten it and I am constantly mean to it.</li>
            <li> My bangs are badly damaged at the ends due to the perm and the fact that I hit this part of my hair hardest with the flat iron, but I just can&#x27;t go much shorter.</li>
            <li> Usually shampoo makes my hair very dry.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve always had to wash my hair every day) and a few inches at the bottom that are split, gradually getting less and less split as it goes up.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t brush it (not many other shampoos I can say that</li>
            <li> It felt a little greasy going on, but it soaked in and by the morning</li>
            <li> Like i&#x27;ve mentioned in other reviews for this line, not sure it mends split ends.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that I could do worse to my hair is if I added flat-ironing to my routine.</li>
            <li> My hair has been stuck at this length ever since I chopped it off up to my chin a few years ago on a whim.</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;ve only gotten worse.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a cheap brand, but it&#x27;s not salon priced</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> you put a quarter sized amount in your hand and run through your hair, concentrate on trouble zones and/or ends.  </li>
            <li> When my hair dried, I was a bit dismayed....</li>
            <li> I gave it a few days, then returned both sets when I didn&#x27;t see any visible improvement in my hair to justify the sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> and it feels dried out.  </li>
            <li> I combed it through and after a few minutes it felt like it had soaked in -</li>
            <li> started using a few products in this line, the ProMend shampoo, the ProMend Overnight Treatment, and the ProMend Heat</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this shampoo, i had worst kind of hair</li>
            <li> I have very VERY thin and long, dry hair.</li>
            <li> I did notice that my hair feels like it has a very slight film over it -</li>
            <li> If i let it grow much longer than this, it gets bad split ends.</li>
            <li> Well its not magic in a bottle</li>
            <li> The conditioner didn&#x27;t give that slick conditioned feeling.</li>
            <li> I use it with the conditioner too - usually I go through 2-2.5 shampoo&#x27;s for every conditioner bottle</li>
            <li> I permed my hair in August 2011 thinking I might go for that look rather than messing with my hair each day, but unfortunately couldn&#x27;t stand the look, so I reverted back to heat styling.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, my hair has taken a beating for the past several months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe, but your hair is slick, but not oily.</li>
            <li> Its thin when straitened, but poofy and slightly wavy</li>
            <li> Then I found it at Amazon, a few dollars less expensive.</li>
            <li> She has very thick hair and split ends really made it look bad.  </li>
            <li> I have not cut my hair since then and buns are not kind to one&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> Everyone who knows me knows that I have complained about my split ends all the time, now I have nothing to complain  about.</li>
            <li> so I just avoid it and only go when my hair is REALLY bad</li>
            <li> I had to get them trimmed, and since my hair grows very slowly</li>
            <li> I had been thinking about having 3 inches taken off the ends, NO MORE!!</li>
            <li> Not a happy camper as I will never use this or the conditioner again.  </li>
            <li> But I do have some broken ends because I am trying to grow my hair out from the hair loss I suffered</li>
            <li> I had the absolute worst split ends imaginable.</li>
            <li> To make things worse, every time I touched my hair, I got a sticky residue on my hand.</li>
            <li> but my hair felt very dirty and heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a skeptical person by nature.  </li>
            <li> but then I used this product one time and it made my hair breakage even worse!</li>
            <li> I realized it is expensive</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with any Nexxus product and that&#x27;s a fact.</li>
            <li> I hated how my hair ended up limp</li>
            <li> They were rough and nasty, I was sickened by them.</li>
            <li> I have lots of split ends that drive me crazy, even though I cut my hair every six weeks.  </li>
            <li> I used alot of it and then decided to shampoo with something else because my hair still smelled dirty.</li>
            <li> Crazy</li>
            <li> but the stuff soaks in like mad.  </li>
            <li> So every time noticed my split ends were getting bad</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t cut my hair in over 2 years, so you can imagine how bad it was; but now, my hair is no longer brittle or frizzy.  </li>
            <li> So maybe my hair wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought, or maybe it was because I&#x27;d already been treating my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought my hair was bad</li>
            <li> I decided to try the Pro-Mend series of Nexxus and am extremely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was so disappointed with this and the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely HATE getting my hair cut</li>
            <li> I hate when you washed out shampoo</li>
            <li> I hate having my hair cut</li>
            <li> The ends of my hair are absolutely horrific.</li>
            <li> My hair looked and felt horrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My GF loves it. Said it&#x27;s the best ever.</li>
            <li> Goodbye split ends for my 10 year old.  She has very thick hair and split ends really made it look bad.  Noticed a big difference.</li>
            <li> I read about Pro-Mend in Better Home &amp; Garden a few days ago.  I have long hair which is fine. I do not color, perm or chemically alter it, yet I do blow dry and use a curling iron.  I have breakage and split ends.  The article said for women who are loathe to cut their hair, that&#x27;s me!!  Still, how many times does something claim to fix your hair and how many times do you come away disappointed?&lt;br /&gt;In me, hope springs eternal so I looked for it at Wal-mart and found it there.  The conditioner was $13.49, a lot for someone on a fixed income, but if it works, Yahoo! it would be worth it.  If not, Wally&#x27;s will take it back.  I was literally stunned with the first try.  Keep in mind I only have the Conditioner right now.  I can&#x27;t tell you how much of an vast improvement I saw in my ends.  When you have very long hair the ends are the oldest part, and they do dry and split, causing you to have to cut them endlessly.  I had been thinking about having 3 inches taken off the ends, NO MORE!! :)  I plan on buying the complete system next week, I am sold on it.  It really, really works!!  I was hoping to get it here, but it is cheaper at the Wally&#x27;s, and no shipping charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to see how my hair responds to the full treatment of Pro-Mend, and I wholeheartedly recommend this product to any woman with this problem.  No kidding, it works!  It actually does what it claims.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the Pro-Mend series of Nexxus and am extremely disappointed.  I&#x27;ve been growing my hair out and had noticed that I was getting split ends.  After using the Pro-Mend Shampoo and Conditioner for 2 weeks, I had to book an emergency appointment with my stylist.  My hair started breaking off and was so dry that she had to cut about 2\\&quot; off because of the damage this product did to my hair.  I know it was the shampoo and conditioner as nothing else had changed--same diet, vitamins, water, etc.  I decided to pay a little more for my products and now use Pureology products, and my hair is healthy, shiny and bouncy again.</li>
            <li> I think everyone is a little skeptical of this product at first because it just sounds too good to be true! Well its not magic in a bottle but it does really improve your split ends. It doesnt seem to me like it actually mends mine but it helps the pieces lie closer together and look more like 1 strand which will of course help you with your frizz problems. I saw the most dramatic difference the first time I used the product (like the commercial says). More than anything I love the way it makes my hair smell and feel. I do recommend this product to my friends and will continue to use it because I feel it makes my hair look and feel much healthier. As for mending split ends, Im not sure how true that is but I would say it probably does better at preventing them by keeping your hair healthy so start using it after you get a haircut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie, I was VERY unsure about this product but I decided to buy it anyway. I straighten and  blow dry my hair everyday. My split ends were getting to the point of having a mind of their own. I absolutely HATE getting my hair cut so I just avoid it and only go when my hair is REALLY bad (you&#x27;d think I&#x27;d learn...). Well it was getting to that point and I was dreading having to cut so much of my hair off so I decided to try something new. Honestly, I couldn&#x27;t pick up a hunk of my hair without finding some pretty insane split ends. It just wasn&#x27;t possible. So, I decided to take one last attempt at buying a product that is suppose to mend split ends.  Boy, am I glad I did. Not only does it smell WONDERFUL but I could see and feel a huge improvement after the first wash. I&#x27;m not going to say that I was split end free but this product improved the health of my ends greatly. A hair cut will still be in order but instead of having to cut 4 inches or so off I could probably squeak by with an inch or so.   I will definitely continue to buy and use this product. It is a miracle worker. And did I mention that the smell is amazing?</li>
            <li> I have been using this off and on for several years and it is a very good conditioner.  I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This shampoo exceeded my expectations by far.  Smells AMAZING, I was in heaven when I lathered up.  The next day, my hair still smells wonderful.  When I rinsed the shampoo out, my hair was silky as if I&#x27;d just deep conditioned, not shampooed!  A big first for me.  Usually shampoo makes my hair very dry.  Also, my scalp is usually dry and itchy, and the shampoo has eliminated this for me!  I never thought I could get these kinds of results from a shampoo and conditioner.  This is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written on any product, that&#x27;s how happy Nexxus has made me.  Thank you Nexxus!  I am in love.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING. I ordered the Nexxus Pro-Mend Shampoo and Conditioner as an ongoing subscription to get the cheaper price. I WILL continue to receive the shipments! You can tell a huge difference in the silkiness of your hair after just ONE use. It does NOT leave your hair feeling greasy or weighted at all. Feels like your just got out of the salon. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of different brands of shampoo and conditioner and Nexxus is definitely one of my very favorites. I also like the smell.</li>
            <li> I have just below shoulder length hair that I&#x27;ve been trying to grow out. Only problem is that I have tons of layers, I blowdry every day, I dye my dishwater blonde hair to a medium to dark brown, and I also highlight. The only thing that I could do worse to my hair is if I added flat-ironing to my routine. My hair has been stuck at this length ever since I chopped it off up to my chin a few years ago on a whim. If i let it grow much longer than this, it gets bad split ends. This morning I used the conditioner plus this treatment creme and already I think these products are finally going to help me grow my hair out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was the smell - it smells like a vanilla cookie candle. The kind they sell around Christmas a lot. And it&#x27;s strong. I also used Biosilk (which also has a pretty strong scent) and I can&#x27;t even smell it over the Nexxus. It&#x27;s not a bad smell (unless you don&#x27;t like it), but it&#x27;s a lot stronger than most hair care products I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed as soon as I used the conditioner that my hair felt...different. Hair always feels so smooth after conditioning, but this was different. It hung all together and straight. I was excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I let my hair air dry for a little bit, I put the leave in creme in. My hair seemed to instantly detangle and smooth out even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very impressed with this product. It does give your hair a very distinct feeling, however, that some might not like. It&#x27;s hard to describe, but your hair is slick, but not oily. You can kind of feel that the hair shafts are glued back together. However, that&#x27;s still a lot better than the alternative of having knotted, damaged hair. Bottom line - if you like the smell, buy these products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a skeptical person by nature.  For as long as I can remember my mother and science have told me that \\&quot;No shampoo can fix split ends.\\&quot;  So every time noticed my split ends were getting bad I had to get them trimmed, and since my hair grows very slowly (I cut it two inches long before basic and didn&#x27;t have to start pulling it back while in uniform for at least a year) it meant my hair never really got longer than shoulder length.  My hair is also very thin and fine (a horrible combination)and splits easily dispite the fact that I only blow dry my hair a few times a year and flat iron about as often.  I have tried everything, but the only thing that ever came close to working was a constant rotation of shampoos, conditioners, and leave-ins.     Now I just got back from Afghanistan in July, and for obvious reasons this rotation wasn&#x27;t available to me while deployed.  When I got home one of my first stops was to the salon where I told my stylist to just cut off the damage, which ended up being about 4 inches (a big deal for someone with hair like mine).  Even with this I still found split ends here and there.  I have not cut my hair since then and buns are not kind to one&#x27;s hair so they&#x27;ve only gotten worse.    I first saw this product at the Bx and my first reaction was to laugh at it.  It&#x27;s not a cheap brand, but it&#x27;s not salon priced either so the idea that it could do what it said was comical to me.  So I passed it by until I recently went on leave to visit my family and used my sister&#x27;s shampoo, this shampoo.  I noticed a difference right away; my hair felt healthier, it felt softer, looks thicker, it looked better and stayed looking nice, and as a perk it smelled nice too.  I could not stop touching my hair, something that usually only happens after a trip to the salon.  The initial use was only with the shampoo and conditioner.    Currently I&#x27;m using the full system and I can&#x27;t find any split ends.  I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re there in the back where I can&#x27;t seethem, but I&#x27;ve never been able to look at the front ends of my hair and not see split ends.  For once I actually have hopes for growing my hair out.  I might have to get the heat barrier stuff and try actually styling my hair for once.      Long story short:  ~It repaired 6 months of deployment damage (and I actually wore Kevlar on missions for over 8 hours at a time)  ~It works for thin, fine hair  ~I can&#x27;t find any split ends right now</li>
            <li> I only gave this 3 stars because I do not think that the shampoo is necessary (or maybe just worth the money) to get the desired results of hiding split ends.  It is not a terrible shampoo, but the smell is horrendous.  I also feel as though, and the smell may be to blame, that it does not clean my hair very well or that it does not rinse out very easily.  When I did the entire routine (shampoo, conditioner, leave-in) I hated how my hair ended up limp that I rewashed it and just used the leave-in.  I think the leave-in alone will get you your desired results without the shampoo and conditioner.    I recommend investing in a moisturizing shampoo like therappe, and humectra conditioner and using the leave-in pro mend.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ll be honest,  I didn&#x27;t notice a difference after just one use. However, I kept using it and two weeks later, my hair looks SO MUCH healthier.  I LOVE this stuff.  I haven&#x27;t cut my hair in over 2 years, so you can imagine how bad it was; but now, my hair is no longer brittle or frizzy.  The shampoo doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, so if I am running late or pressed for time, I am okay with skipping the conditioner for that morning and I don&#x27;t have a problem with my hair being dry, brittle and so tangled I can&#x27;t brush it (not many other shampoos I can say that about).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo to use with the Nexxus emergencee treatment. Love it! My hair is extrememly damaged from over processing both with heat and chemicals. I&#x27;m very happy after researching multiple products I landed on the Nexxus line...specifically the split end treatment. Quick results after the first use! I am setting this product up on the regular shipment program because I will continue to use this product going forward.</li>
            <li> I have very VERY thin and long, dry hair. I constantly straighten it and I am constantly mean to it. The ends of my hair are absolutely horrific. They were rough and nasty, I was sickened by them. Then, I found this beautiful product. After the FIRST use my ends felt so much better! I was astonished. This product has never let me down, and I assure you, it won&#x27;t let you down either. Oh and btw, the smell is wonderful. After you take a shower, your hair doesn&#x27;t only feel amazing, but it smells like you just went to a salon to get your hair done. I do NOT have any complaints whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of Nexxus products.  I have used the Diametress and loved it.  I decided to try this as coloring my hair, I have developed many split ends.  I have very fine hair.  I was so disappointed with this and the conditioner.  Not a noticeable difference in my split ends at all.  Made my fine hair look flat, dull, lifeless and very greasy.  My hair looked and felt horrible.  Not a happy camper as I will never use this or the conditioner again.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Amazing difference after the first use of this and the conditioner.  My hair is fine and tinted. The conditioner didn&#x27;t give that slick conditioned feeling. far stiffer but the stuff soaks in like mad.  I used the leaveiin as well. My color looks richer, ends no longer brittle &amp; fuzzy. the longer I use Pro Mend, the more my over processed hair looks freshly cut.  As a former hairdresser, I&#x27;m stunned by that. Its hair rescue.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Ulta, since they have weekly coupons (It came up to about 6 bucks after the $3.50 off coupon).  I love this shampoo! As soon as it hits your scalp, you can feel your hair becoming smooth and soft.  Also, even when I just had a small amount in my palm, I could smell the awesome scent-&gt; smells like candy!!!!  Usually, my hair doesn&#x27;t retain fragrances from shampoos, but even now, 4 hours after my shower and after a blow dry, it still smells wonderful.  I love this shampoo!!!!!!  I also bought the leave in treatment for split ends. (I started getting highlights in my hair last year and my hair is suffering from it...)</li>
            <li> Okay long story short, lost some hair due to an accident and some neurological meds, growing it back, really want to keep it healthy. I have had some breakage in the back of my head.  I have been using satin pillowcases to reduce breakage and a satin nightcap on my restless nights to stop snarls.  But I do have some broken ends because I am trying to grow my hair out from the hair loss I suffered and I&#x27;m going a  lot longer in between haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially I tried the leave in day conditioner as a stand alone product and it smoothed frizz and controlled flyaways.  But I needed more fixing than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So then I tried the overnight treatment in combination with the leave in treatment.  My hair was better, slightly less frizz on the ends, but I could feel that the back was still in rough shape.  I tried the leave in conditioner for 1 week before adding the overnight.  I tried the overnight cream with the day cream for 1 week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I decided to splurge and try the Nexxus ProMend shampoo and conditioner.  2 days.  In two days, using all four products there was an extreme and noticeable difference in the smoothness of my hair.  I was very much under the impression that you could not fix broken hair.  Truthfully in 2 days I noticed smoother hair.  The bottle says in 3 days use you will see results.  So maybe my hair wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought, or maybe it was because I&#x27;d already been treating my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is like any other shampoo, lather, rinse.  The conditioner you leave on for 3 minutes, comb through, I recently switched to the Tool Structure Shower Detangling Comb (http://www.amazon.com/Tool-Structure-Shower-Detangler-Comb/dp/B003JMWOR8) .  Both smell clean and delicious without being overpowering.  The leave in conditioner you put a quarter sized amount in your hand and run through your hair, concentrate on trouble zones and/or ends.  I used more than a quarter sized amount to nourish all my ends and the troubled back spot.  For the nigt time treatment you do not need to rewash your hair - unless you have a lot of product in there.  I just run about a quarter sized amount through my hair again and it soaks right in, leaving no residue.  In the morning, wash it out. I followed with the Nexxus shampoo and conditioner and started all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly that&#x27;s the most I&#x27;ve ever paid for conditioner, but sometimes you can get coupons on the retailer&#x27;s website.  It&#x27;s worth a try if you are trying to repair your hair.  Once you&#x27;ve done the repair, you might want to use it ever few days or a couple times a month and use another good shampoo and conditioner in between.  I also like John Freida&#x27;s Frizz repair shampoo and conditioner.ment you do not need to rewash your hair - unless you have a lot of product in there.

            <li> I also purchased the Promend conditioner and heat protecting spray. Have been using all for about 3 weeks, I have very fine hair that weighs down easily. All three products are great my hair is smooth and I can see the difference in the split ends. It does not feel tacky and greasy like a lot of other products. The only down side is the smell which is quite strong, it&#x27;s not unpleasant but just too perfumed. However I will continue to use as my hair seems to be improving with more use</li>
            <li> I thought my hair was bad but then I used this product one time and it made my hair breakage even worse! It made my hair so dry and brittle even after I used conditioner. It was not at all what this product says it is supposed to do!! I do not recommend this product after what it did to my hair and didn&#x27;t do for my hair.</li>
            <li> I rarely ever write reviews, but couldn&#x27;t believe that the the Pro-Mend system actually does what it says, so I just thought I&#x27;d share my experience. I&#x27;m currently using the shampoo, conditioner, and leave in treatment because I&#x27;ve found the products do not work as well by themselves as they do as an entire regiment. I, like many other reviewers, saw a visible improvement in the ends of my hair after just one use.  I started using this product because, even after getting a hair cut, my hair would always split.  I only gave the product 4 stars because, due to the fact that my hair is naturally dry and a wavy, hair dressers have always told me to wash my hair every other day, and though my hair looks great the first day I use this product, by the second day my split ends are back. This product is truly a daily shampoo.   Great product - does what it advertises. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks and will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Ok - I have never in my 30 years of life come across a shampoo that actually does what it says -Nexxus Pro-Mend actually prevents split ends and makes the ones you have disappear. I don&#x27;t know how it works- but I do know I am living proof it actually works.&lt;br /&gt;I have not had my hair cut since Dec 2011 (I know I know... its not good to go this long without a cut because the longer you go the worse split ends get which means the more they need to cut off to make your hair look healthy again)- and even though its been nearly a year since I last got my hair cut, I am just now starting to see some hints of split ends scattered about my head (and this is partially due to me recently dying my hair which made it super dry and battled against all the good pro-mend does!).&lt;br /&gt;Almost a year without split ends is miraculous in my book- if you are on the fence about this shampoo please take my advice and get it. I use it with the conditioner too - usually I go through 2-2.5 shampoo&#x27;s for every conditioner bottle I buy - a little of the conditioner goes a long way! Another great tip is to add 5-6 drops of rosemary oil to the conditioner- it will make your hair shiny and strong (I do it about every other time- not daily, however its safe to do daily if you wish).</li>
            <li> I had the absolute worst split ends imaginable. I straighten my hair every single say. My hair has a lot of airy poof. Its thin when straitened, but poofy and slightly wavy when its not. I honestly think I had split ends on ever single hair. I used this shampoo at night. In the morning, I got up and straightened my hair as always. My split ends were GONE. Everyone who knows me knows that I have complained about my split ends all the time, now I have nothing to complain  about. Also Id buy it just for the smell. It smells so AMAZING. Its the best smelling shampoo Ive ever had. Its worth the extra money, and Id say you get a pretty good amount. THANKS SO MUCH NEXXUS!</li>
            <li> I permed my hair in August 2011 thinking I might go for that look rather than messing with my hair each day, but unfortunately couldn&#x27;t stand the look, so I reverted back to heat styling. Needless to say, my hair has taken a beating for the past several months. I tried to preserve it, but I just didn&#x27;t have any luck. When I saw this line on sale at Costco, I took two sets because I had read such good things about it. I washed my hair with the shampoo which felt nice and moisturizing. I followed up with the very thick conditioner, which also seemed like it might be promising. I also tried the leave in included. When my hair dried, I was a bit dismayed....my hair felt like straw. I figured it might change after I flat ironed the next day, but it was still stiff. To make things worse, every time I touched my hair, I got a sticky residue on my hand. It appears that this is how this product works. Another reviewer likened this product to glue. I have to agree. Also, I tried not using the leave in to see if that would help...it didn&#x27;t. My hair was still sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all know that no shampoo, conditioner, or leave in is going to get rid of split ends, but rather just reduce the appearance of the split ends. I did not have this luck with most of the Nexxus Pro-Mend Line. I gave it a few days, then returned both sets when I didn&#x27;t see any visible improvement in my hair to justify the sticky feeling. I will say that I do have some Pro-Mend Heat Protexx heat protectant that I purchased before I bought the rest of this line, and it is great. Nice, light weight, and leaves no sticky residue. I will continue to use that. Just not the shampoo, conditioner, or leave in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, it is best to get a hair cut if your hair is in bad condition, but as in my case, sometimes it just isn&#x27;t practical. My bangs are badly damaged at the ends due to the perm and the fact that I hit this part of my hair hardest with the flat iron, but I just can&#x27;t go much shorter. If youare looking for something that reduces the appearance of split ends, you might try Nexxus Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor (Different from Nexxus Emergencee, I like Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor better). I used it just last night and it has done a stellar job at reducing the appearance of split ends in my bangs. Dare I say, a stellar job? I believe it fused most of them together as it appears today that they are more or less gone. I know they are still there, but I can&#x27;t see them. It is awesome. This is exactly what Pro-Mend was supposed to do, except the Polymedic Emergency Reconstructor doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! It&#x27;s great! This is my 3rd time buying this product and i feel pleased and happy with it</li>
            <li> I had severe hair fall just after one use, I would not recommend it. I am returning it. I did not buy it at amazon.</li>
            <li> Buy this along with the other nexxus promend system.  It is worth the money.  You will be amazed.  Your split ends will be gone after the first treatment.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about these products.  Finally, a product that does what it says it does!</li>
            <li> HEY WELL I BOUGHT THIS THE CONDITIONER AND LEAVE IN CREAM AFTER YOU SHOWER THEN THE OVEER NIGHT TREAT MENT IVE USED THIS FOR  3 DAYS ALL READY AND THATS HOW LONG YOU NEED TO DO IT BEFOR YOU SEE A CHANGE YALL SEE A CHANGE WHEN YOU FIRST WASH YOUR HAIR BUT THE 3THRD DAY IS TEH BEST RESULTS .... IT REALLY DOSE WHAT IT SAYS IM A BLONDE SO YOU KNOW I DIE AND BLEACH MY HAIR ALL THE TIME ... I RECOMEND THIS 100%% BUY  ALL 4 PRODUCTS FOR BEST RESULTS ...... BEST PRODUCT FOR BLONDES</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo. Helps with volume and  makes my hair easier to style.</li>
            <li> Great Shampoo - pairs well with the Nexxus Pro Mend Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find much appeal with this shampoo ( or conditioner). Yes, I saw some noticeable mending and binding of my ends but my hair felt very dirty and heavy. Blowout took forever.&lt;br /&gt;Will not repurchase anything in this particular Nexxus line.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is wavy and gets frizzy and damaged from coloring and styling.  I have lots of split ends that drive me crazy, even though I cut my hair every six weeks.  I have tried may products to help with the frizz and protect my hair from damage but none have really worked well and many of them just weighed down my fine hair.  I generally use products costing 2-3 times as much as this line, so I was surprised that this system worked so well.    I bought the whole system and started with the overnight treatment.  It felt a little greasy going on, but it soaked in and by the morning my ends seemed much more hydrated.  I then washed it out with the shampoo.  I LOVE the shampoo - it has a good lather and feels like it really cleans, but leaves my hair moisterized.  I hate when you washed out shampoo and it feels dried out.  The conditioner was interesting.  It was very creamy and I expected it to soak right in, but it initially just sits on your hair like a film.  I combed it through and after a few minutes it felt like it had soaked in - you should definitely leave it on for the recommended time.  My hair felt very silky when it rinsed out.    Now for my favorite part - the leave in creme.  It is thick and soaks right into the dry ends of my hair.  My hair felt fully saturated with moisture and I was worried that it would be very weighed down.  The first time I tried it I styled my hair wavy, and it looked better than usual - it did not weigh down my hair.  The next time I styled it straight.  I did notice that my hair feels like it has a very slight film over it - I&#x27;m guess that is how it works.  This affects the texture of my hair to the touch slightly, and doesn&#x27;t really bother me.  I would say that my hair looked better than usual when styled - both when curly and straight.    Now for what you really want to know - did it fix my split ends???  I would say that at least 50% of my split ends disappeared after the first use.  I don&#x27;t even know how that ispossible, but they are gone.  I still have some - but I have to search for them instead of seeing tons of them every time I look.  So it does what it says it does - gets rid of split ends - and it left my hair feeling moisterized and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I cant get over how much I love this shampoo and conditioner combo - i have very long -dyed- blonde hair so knots after a shower happen and my brush glides through my hair after using this shampoo/conditioner....I even started looking into nexxus&#x27;s other products because I was so impressed with how much I love this stuff!! A bit pricey, but you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> I first heard about this Nexxus product on the radio, during a time when I have been wishing for smoother hair. I get split ends and dryness from highlights (on top of highlights, and so on). When I first bought the shampoo and conditioner at Ulta, the sales clerk told me she had a friend who tried it and LOVED it. I realized it is expensive and I&#x27;d have to buy it only now and then, as a splurge. Then I found it at Amazon, a few dollars less expensive. It was icing on the cake to find out I could order it on \\&quot;Subscribe and Save,\\&quot; saving 20% over Amazon&#x27;s already pretty good price.</li>
            <li> I bought this treatment along with the shampoo and conditioner. After the first use I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference, in fact it seemed my hair knotted more easily. It said to wait for a few uses, so to be fair I tried it for a whole month. Never got better in fact got worse, hair knotted constantly at the ends and hair fell out more than usual. Yesterday just used a bit of another brand conditioner instead of the treatment and my hair is silky smooth, no knots, works so much better than the Nexxus split end treatment.</li>
            <li> This really helped my hair out a lot. And I love how it smells. Def an amazing product after trying out so many shampoos.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the scent of this shampoo, but I just don&#x27;t feel that it leaves my hair all that clean. I used alot of it and then decided to shampoo with something else because my hair still smelled dirty. Maybe good for someone who shampoos daily. By the way it&#x27;s smells sort of like pina colada.</li>
            <li> First, a little about my hair type:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I moved from a very dry, hot climate, where my hair looked great so long as I used a moisturizing shampoo, any moisturizing shampoo, to a high humidity cool climate where my hair is unruly with fly-a-ways, static and and just a slight wave in the underneath.&lt;br /&gt;I have VERY long hair that gets oily near the scalp very quickly (I&#x27;ve always had to wash my hair every day) and a few inches at the bottom that are split, gradually getting less and less split as it goes up. It&#x27;s of medium texture and straight as a stick, or was until I moved and the underneath got a bit wavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using a few products in this line, the ProMend shampoo, the ProMend Overnight Treatment, and the ProMend Heat Protecting Styling Spray.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t love any of them, but this is a review on the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I liked the shampoo at first, my hair was a nice texture and the smell was nice, not overly girly like some.&lt;br /&gt;Well I didn&#x27;t even finish the bottle (which with my long hair doesn&#x27;t take long, about a month to a month and a half depending on the shampoo). After a few weeks I noticed my scalp was getting more and more irritated and then I started having dandruff. I&#x27;ve never had dandruff issues in my life. Once the dandruff started I put up with it for about a week before I switched shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Nice smell&lt;br /&gt;Thick texture&lt;br /&gt;I use far less shampoo than with some brands, it lathers like crazy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Itchy scalp&lt;br /&gt;Caused uncharacteristic dandruff&lt;br /&gt;I saw no improvement in my breakage or split ends (though to be fair I only used about one bottle&#x27;s worth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never use this again.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My hair feels great and I am getting lots of complements on my hair now. In just about a week I began to feel the difference. I blow dry it and it turns out wonderful and more manageable. It is no longer freeze. I will continue to buy this, the conditioner and the leave in treatment. Love it!</li>
            <li> I literally recommend this to all my friends! I have hair down to my low back area and of course the ends are split. I&#x27;m too attached to it to cut much off so I was excited to try the Nexxus. After the first 3 washes, I felt and saw a big difference. My hair had a nice shine and felt so soft. I&#x27;m now on my third set of shamp/cond. and plan to keep using it!</li>
            <li> this is OK shampoo, havent really seen any awesome split end improvement.</li>
            <li> actually, the shampoo is not the issue.  the way it was shipped was the problem.  the cap was loose and part of it spilled o the other things in the box.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great.  I have very damaged hair due to 2 unsuccesful hair relaxation treatments. I just switched from a special keratin shampoo which I don&#x27;t think was doing a very good job actually cleaning my hair- it wouldn&#x27;t develop a lather. This nexxus pro-mend shampoo does a wonderful job. It works up to a nice lather so I know it is actually cleaning my hair. My hair is very soft and smooth when dry. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Well its a myth that a shampoo can seal back your split end..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good shampoo can prevent the split end by nourishing hair ends..  I used this whole bottle before writing the review..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this shampoo, i had worst kind of hair fall... There were hairs all over the place..on floor, on pillow , couch etc. I still continue to use it to see what happens.. It did not improve my split end in any way.. infact i had more split ends.. so i can not recommend this shampoo..</li>
            <li> Much better than some very expensive brands out there advertised on TV.  I have found my brand and will stick with it. Hopefully Amazon will keep the price reasonable, unlike your local drugstore.</li>
            <li> I went from Pantene, to TreSemme, to this. And I am really disapointed, I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement -.- This was a big waste of money once again.</li>
            <li> Yes it does mend your split ends I bought the entire promend line and now I don&#x27;t even have to used them so much because I have no split ends to tackle. I mean I thought it was going to take a bit of using to get them mended but the first time was all I needed.</li>
            <li> It is good.  Like i&#x27;ve mentioned in other reviews for this line, not sure it mends split ends.  But it will make your hair feel nice &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  Great Price!  The package arrived on time and I use this shampoo on a regular basis.  I&#x27;ll keep ordering!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year now and love the way it makes my hair feel, very silky.  I have dry hair and notice a big difference in the ends and overall feel, moisturized.  I hate having my hair cut and this makes me go alot longer between cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it with the Nexus conditioner.  Price is best on Amazon, although a month or two ago it was like $7.50, but I can&#x27;t complain re Amazon - my local Rite Aid charges around $12-13 for it!!  Crazy...love Amazon.</li>
            <li> I must say that when my product came,the cap had come open and some of it leaked out.The product itself is absolutely awesome. You can&#x27;t go wrong with any Nexxus product and that&#x27;s a fact.</li>
            <li> There was a noticeable difference after the first time I used it and after using the whole bottle along with the conditioner my stylist of 10 years is super impressed with the condition of my hair. It feels less brittle and looks much healthier. But a heads up that I did get dandruff when using this for prolonged periods of time.</li>
