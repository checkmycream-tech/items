            <li>Move over Buf Puf because this towel is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I knew I wanted an exfoliating cloth, so I researched Amazon to find the best one.</li>

            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>Awesome washcloth.  </li>

            <li>Amazing product!  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase!!! :)</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;d pay $11 and change for two of them if I couldn&#x27;t get it otherwise, because yes, it is that good.</li>
            <li>GOOD</li>
            <li>They are priced good too,  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Simply place the towel in desired area and massage thoroughly, is really good for every part of the body.</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>but they work amazingly well</li>
            <li>My body wash lathers really nicely</li>
            <li>This feels good against your skin, holds shower gel just fine and dries out faster than a wash cloth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can buy these for $4.99 at Ulta and save a lot more when then have the BOGO 1/2 on Earth Therapeutics products.</li>
            <li>My skin looks like a baby skin :) Love it.</li>
            <li>I tried it last night and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I researched this towel on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>I love that the the length of this allows me to reach all of those unreachable bits.</li>
            <li>the cloth is mostly cotton (I think 90%).</li>
            <li>Most of the competition is made up of synthetic material (yuck).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>mentioned, I do love this cloth.</li>
            <li>and it is mostly biodegradable and also recyclable.</li>
            <li>I love these towels.</li>
            <li>As the desription says, it&#x27;s the perfect length for washing your back.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect length for scrubbing your back and it allows for lots of lather.</li>
            <li>I personally love this washing cloth and would recommend you try it.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>Perfect for your back</li>
            <li>I gave some as gifts to some family members and they love them.</li>
            <li>I love these cloths.</li>
            <li>I am still searching for something better.  </li>
            <li>Excellent back scrubbing cloth.  </li>
            <li>Over all the product is okay, it does exfoliate my skin pretty good.</li>
            <li>Great exfoliating product I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It has a pretty surprisingly course texture but with soap applied</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, it lathers the soap really well.</li>
            <li>it just feels really good on your skin and leaves you shiny and new!</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t even use any soap at all, and it buffed me clean and smooth!  </li>
            <li>but these are easier to hold and soap foams up easily.</li>
            <li>Very highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>Great back scrubbers.</li>
            <li>you will love the fresh feeling on your skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does a perfect job of exfoliating and removing dead skin and dirt.</li>
            <li>However, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the right one that I read on Amazon with all the stars and bought it anyway, hoping the buyer for the store knew what they were doing.  </li>
            <li>Paying more than $20 for two of these is too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Vic&#x27;s face cloth for at least 20 years and it was the best product I had found for my face.</li>
            <li>Just enough texture to do a good job without the scratchiness of loofa and you can launder it without any damage.  </li>
            <li>They feel WONDERFUL on the face and back, and I always travel with one (easy to dry!).  </li>
            <li>Dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I love how you can wash your back so easily.</li>
            <li>She is very pleased with it, and acts as if she has been waiting for something like this for a long time.</li>
            <li>It gets my skin clean quickly, I can reach my back with it, and unlike the plastic shower puffs, it rinses COMPLETELY clean in the shower, not just mostly clean.</li>
            <li>The first time you get this, if you feel it&#x27;s too stiff, try rinsing it in warm water (it softens more with use.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long enough to reach all areas, cleans/exfoliates very well without damaging skin, works up a good lather with just a bit of soap, and rinses out very easily.    </li>
            <li>Whole Foods had it!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s taken me to the next level of smooth skin!</li>
            <li>I saw one of these advertised at a much higher price on one of the home shopping networks.</li>
            <li>This is better than the pouf since it unfolds into a 3X1 piece that can be used to scrub the back.</li>
            <li>These are way better than the Japanese imports, because these are softer and don&#x27;t irritate my aging skin, but do a stellar job of cleaning and invigorating.</li>
            <li>Only okay.</li>
            <li>I used to have several of those brushes for my back (wood and plastic), but neither one worked as good as this towel.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin super soft!</li>
            <li>(it works well with bar soap and can readily be tossed in the wash); my first choice is this towel, which I use on my face and pretty much everywhere else.    </li>
            <li>This product is also really good for cleaning your back because it&#x27;s very long.</li>
            <li>It exfoliates like a dream and really helps to remove</li>
            <li>I went to Whole Foods today because GNC didn&#x27;t have the supplements I needed.  </li>
            <li>or if it was how it was supposed to feel, i don&#x27;t really know...</li>
            <li>Our whole family loves it and we even had some sent abroad.</li>
            <li>I will not go to another brand I like these so much.  </li>
            <li>I have never had one develop mold or mildew; as they get old I use them for travel, they dry quickly so are easy to bring along.</li>
            <li>, mine is NOT, so I just wanted to set the record straight.  </li>
            <li>Most of these cloths on the market are made of nylon and other inorganic materials.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy rinse and hang up to dry, and it washes well in the machine with towels.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking for it since then because I can&#x27;t get the same level of clean with body brushes or bath</li>
            <li>The nonabsorbent material dries super fast, making it possible to take it on trips:</li>
            <li>They rinse clean and dry fast.</li>
            <li>You will see a big difference in the feel and texture of your skin even after just one use--lotions slide on better, skin is brighter, and even helped reduce back acne.</li>
            <li>Outstanding product, just try it you&#x27;ll know exactly what I mean.</li>
            <li>The length is just right for cleaning my back.</li>
            <li>A reviewer above is right - the sides aren&#x27;t hemmed, but let me tell you: You will want to buy a new one for hygienic reasons way before the sides show any signs of wear.</li>
            <li>I am going to keep the item as my husband does like it, nice and long enough to get his back.</li>
            <li>My mom gave me one of these about 15 years ago, and I have just retired it for a new pack of 2.  </li>
            <li>This also makes soaps/ shower gels and creams lather up easily so you use less product.</li>
            <li>It gets softer with use and it is long so you can easily scrub your back.</li>
            <li>but if you have very dry skin that needs serious exfoliation, this product is great.</li>
            <li>At first glance it might seem a bit flimsy, but it will definitely surprise you once you get under the water.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I first purchased this cloth 3 months ago, and have repurchased another set so that I have an extra one for me and another to give as a gift.</li>
            <li>And for this price plus the free shipping, it&#x27;s a bargain especially for how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>At the same time, I find the length to be a little overwhelming at times.</li>
            <li>I stocked up on natural skin products galore.</li>
            <li>using the other washcloths, i never knew how much dirt i really had on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, in the several months that I was using said \\&quot;pouf\\&quot;, I developed back pimples for the first time in my adult life.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m cheap, and laugh in the face of germs), and other than a blueish tint it got from a trip through the washing machine with some dark clothes, it looks the same as it did when I bought it.</li>
            <li>Needless, to say I am VERY PLEASED WITH IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They feel really rough at first, but you get used to it</li>
            <li>I also gave my second one to my mom who is very particular about what she likes and definitely what she doesn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only bought new ones because I&#x27;ve lost others.</li>
            <li>My back especially has seen much fewer breakouts since I started using these towels.  </li>
            <li>, I went back to using my old faithful hydro scrubbie thingie, and wham!</li>
            <li>They are a bit stiff new, but I use them for whole body and face once they soften up a bit.</li>
            <li>My suggestion is to go with the lowest price plus s&amp;h so long as the packaging is the same - unless you just MUST have a particular color.</li>
            <li>Other than that - which may be an issue for large adults - this towel is made the same and works just as well.    </li>
            <li>and I cannot find it anymore at my local Whole Foods store or any other stores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thin and weighs almost nothing so it can be easily packed for a trip or stored.</li>

            <li> Needless, to say I am VERY PLEASED WITH IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They feel really rough at first, but you get used to it</li>
            <li> I also gave my second one to my mom who is very particular about what she likes and definitely what she doesn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only bought new ones because I&#x27;ve lost others.</li>
            <li> My back especially has seen much fewer breakouts since I started using these towels.  </li>
            <li> , I went back to using my old faithful hydro scrubbie thingie, and wham!</li>
            <li> They are a bit stiff new, but I use them for whole body and face once they soften up a bit.</li>
            <li> My suggestion is to go with the lowest price plus s&amp;h so long as the packaging is the same - unless you just MUST have a particular color.</li>
            <li> Other than that - which may be an issue for large adults - this towel is made the same and works just as well.    </li>
            <li> and I cannot find it anymore at my local Whole Foods store or any other stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin and weighs almost nothing so it can be easily packed for a trip or stored.</li>
            <li> i ordered two(4) orders of this one was fantastically rough while the other was much softer.</li>
            <li> Of course, I haven&#x27;t been using the same one for ten years, but they do last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely update this review to let you know how long they last.</li>
            <li> Now I can finally stop putting prescription lotions and creams all over my skin that the dermatologists give me for dry skin, oily skin, PMS zits, and folliculitis, which only work temporarily and I believe have contributed to me always feeling</li>
            <li> It does the job I guess with my back since that&#x27;s a difficult area to exfoliate, but I think just going with a dry brushing technique using a long handle is the better option.</li>
            <li> i am not sure if it was just that particular batch off the line</li>
            <li> do notice I use less soap with this cloth (versus using my bare hands to lather up).</li>
            <li> Other than the above caveat,</li>
            <li> my review below (for the other similar towels) fits this product as well.  </li>
            <li> I just want to notify other potential buyers that this is just scratchy 100% nylon material, product of Taiwan.  </li>
            <li> Shower in the evening, it&#x27;s dry by morning</li>
            <li> This towel is a few inches shorter than the other similar Japanese exfoliating &#x27;towels&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I usually fold and ball it up to wash my entire body, and then when its time for the back, I unfold it, and it is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can use less body wash than I use with a regular washcloth.</li>
            <li> The wash cloth also makes lots of bubbles when body wash is applied to the wet cloth.</li>
            <li> This is a little rough</li>
            <li> I exercise regularly, including cycling, and all that sweat is really hard on my skin.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that i think that there are two textures with this.</li>
            <li> Growing up, my mama used to scrub me down with these bath cloths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Buyer beware this is NOT cotton, as stated by previous reviewers and previously was in the description.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to read reviews of other products that were simply imitations being sold as the real thing.</li>
            <li> no special scrubs required...just soap.</li>
            <li> and they break in a little after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> dried, dead</li>
            <li> As mentioned in at least one other review, liquid (not bar soap) soap should be used with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this after owning the ultimate buffing cloth from Dermalogica but deciding it was a little too expensive.</li>
            <li> This little cloth is a miracle worker… I look forward to using it from head to toes!</li>
            <li> Keratosis Pilaris (KP or Chicken Skin) and a regular &#x27;pouf sponge&#x27; is not good enough.</li>
            <li> Ulta usually has $3.50 off $10 or $5 off $15 coupons, so you can stock up when they have those promotions.</li>
            <li> I have no more backne, as it&#x27;s called.</li>
            <li> A few people upset that it isn&#x27;t cotton-but if it were cotton, it wouldn&#x27;t work well!  </li>
            <li> The tag says &amp;#34;100% nylon / Made in Taiwan.&amp;#34; I was hoping to get a wash cloth made out of natural material, so I am a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Said pack of two but only one towel in pack! :(</li>
            <li> But this is too irritating for my skin.</li>
            <li> They really don&#x27;t go bad, just soften over time.</li>
            <li> This is nothing bad against the seller as they did not state what the material was made of.</li>
            <li> Agressively exfoliates without being too brutal...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A reviewer above is right - the sides aren&#x27;t hemmed, but let me tell you: You will want to buy a new one for hygienic reasons way before the sides show any signs of wear. I&#x27;ve had mine for years (I&#x27;m cheap, and laugh in the face of germs), and other than a blueish tint it got from a trip through the washing machine with some dark clothes, it looks the same as it did when I bought it. It still works the same, too. I stopped using it for a while, in favor of a traditional \\&quot;pouf\\&quot;, you know, those balled up pieces of plastic netting? Well, in the several months that I was using said \\&quot;pouf\\&quot;, I developed back pimples for the first time in my adult life. I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was the deal, until finally, I went back to using my old faithful hydro scrubbie thingie, and wham! The backne&#x27;s gone, and my skin&#x27;s happy again. For germ-ridding purposes, I&#x27;ll probably buy myself another one of these things soon, but man... it lasts and lasts. Oh, and as another reviewer said - it&#x27;s cheaper if you can find it locally. My grocery store carries it. But I&#x27;d pay $11 and change for two of them if I couldn&#x27;t get it otherwise, because yes, it is that good.</li>
            <li> I stopped using shower puffs ever since I discovered these. It exfoliates like a dream and really helps to remove dried, dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can buy these for $4.99 at Ulta and save a lot more when then have the BOGO 1/2 on Earth Therapeutics products. Ulta usually has $3.50 off $10 or $5 off $15 coupons, so you can stock up when they have those promotions. Paying more than $20 for two of these is too much.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin exfoliated on a day-to-day basis! Love!</li>
            <li> This towel is a few inches shorter than the other similar Japanese exfoliating &#x27;towels&#x27;. Other than that - which may be an issue for large adults - this towel is made the same and works just as well.    Other than the above caveat, my review below (for the other similar towels) fits this product as well.  This &#x27;towel&#x27; works great! As mentioned in at least one other review, liquid (not bar soap) soap should be used with it. It&#x27;s long enough to reach all areas, cleans/exfoliates very well without damaging skin, works up a good lather with just a bit of soap, and rinses out very easily.    I&#x27;ve used the Vic&#x27;s face cloth for at least 20 years and it was the best product I had found for my face. Now, I only use it when I&#x27;m in a hurry (it works well with bar soap and can readily be tossed in the wash); my first choice is this towel, which I use on my face and pretty much everywhere else.    At Amazon, several different sellers market this same towel, just in different colors. All with the same packaging are the same towel - only the color is different. My suggestion is to go with the lowest price plus s&amp;h so long as the packaging is the same - unless you just MUST have a particular color.</li>
            <li> Works great for me!   My skin looks like a baby skin :) Love it.</li>
            <li> I went to Whole Foods today because GNC didn&#x27;t have the supplements I needed.  I stocked up on natural skin products galore. I remember reading about these towels, so I looked for it. Whole Foods had it!  However, I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was the right one that I read on Amazon with all the stars and bought it anyway, hoping the buyer for the store knew what they were doing.  Thankfully they did.  I tried it last night and it&#x27;s wonderful. Move over Buf Puf because this towel is wonderful.  At first glance it might seem a bit flimsy, but it will definitely surprise you once you get under the water.  I&#x27;m so glad I researched this towel on Amazon.com.  Now I can finally stop putting prescription lotions and creams all over my skin that the dermatologists give me for dry skin, oily skin, PMS zits, and folliculitis, which only work temporarily and I believe have contributed to me always feeling like I need a nap.</li>
            <li> I love that the the length of this allows me to reach all of those unreachable bits. It&#x27;s so easy rinse and hang up to dry, and it washes well in the machine with towels. Agressively exfoliates without being too brutal...no special scrubs required...just soap. The 2-pack was a bonus!</li>
            <li> I gave this to everyone at Christmas. Makes your skin super soft!</li>
            <li> I knew I wanted an exfoliating cloth, so I researched Amazon to find the best one. I was disappointed to read reviews of other products that were simply imitations being sold as the real thing. I read every review to be read on exfoliating cloths on this site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT SOLD ME ON THIS ONE WAS:&lt;br /&gt;1- the cloth is mostly cotton (I think 90%). Most of the competition is made up of synthetic material (yuck).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2- Then I used it.... and as someone who has been drybrushing for years, I have noticed that this cloth within just one week, has smoothed my skin in ways the skinbrushing hasn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s taken me to the next level of smooth skin! Needless, to say I am VERY PLEASED WITH IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I MIGHT LIKE BETTER:&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned, I do love this cloth. At the same time, I find the length to be a little overwhelming at times. I usually fold and ball it up to wash my entire body, and then when its time for the back, I unfold it, and it is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I DEFINITELY DO LIKE:&lt;br /&gt;I do notice I use less soap with this cloth (versus using my bare hands to lather up). I also gave my second one to my mom who is very particular about what she likes and definitely what she doesn&#x27;t like. She is very pleased with it, and acts as if she has been waiting for something like this for a long time. I am getting another set for my dad and sister, and will be getting some for friends as well. GOOD STUFF!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I first purchased this cloth 3 months ago, and have repurchased another set so that I have an extra one for me and another to give as a gift. I am really happy with this purchase. It literally raises my spirit each time I get into the shower. I am very pleased with this purchase!!! :)</li>
            <li> Most of these cloths on the market are made of nylon and other inorganic materials. This one is 90% cotton and only 10% lycra and it is mostly biodegradable and also recyclable. It has a pretty surprisingly course texture but with soap applied it just feels really good on your skin and leaves you shiny and new! It gets softer with use and it is long so you can easily scrub your back. It did shrink in the washer but it was still quite usable. They are priced good too,  I replace them about once a month or so. Great exfoliating product I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> i bought these alittle while ago,and they are wonderful! using the other washcloths, i never knew how much dirt i really had on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my only complaint is that i think that there are two textures with this. i ordered two(4) orders of this one was fantastically rough while the other was much softer. i am not sure if it was just that particular batch off the line or if it was how it was supposed to feel, i don&#x27;t really know... &gt;,&gt; but they work amazingly well</li>
            <li> I love these towels. After using these for a while my skin is softer than it&#x27;s been in years. As the desription says, it&#x27;s the perfect length for washing your back. I have no more backne, as it&#x27;s called. My body wash lathers really nicely and I can use less body wash than I use with a regular washcloth.</li>
            <li> I have been using these wash cloths for about ten years. Great back scrubbers. They rinse clean and dry fast. Of course, I haven&#x27;t been using the same one for ten years, but they do last a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect length for scrubbing your back and it allows for lots of lather. It&#x27;s thin and weighs almost nothing so it can be easily packed for a trip or stored. Works great!</li>
            <li> URGENT!!!&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE DONT RUB WITH THIS TOWEL!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply place the towel in desired area and massage thoroughly, is really good for every part of the body.</li>
            <li> Earth Therapeutics Hydro Exfoliating Towel  This towel is amazing! I used to have several of those brushes for my back (wood and plastic), but neither one worked as good as this towel. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I saw one of these advertised at a much higher price on one of the home shopping networks. I love how you can wash your back so easily. The wash cloth also makes lots of bubbles when body wash is applied to the wet cloth. I personally love this washing cloth and would recommend you try it.</li>
            <li> Our whole family loves it and we even had some sent abroad. This is better than the pouf since it unfolds into a 3X1 piece that can be used to scrub the back. This also makes soaps/ shower gels and creams lather up easily so you use less product. It exfoliates well without being too abrasive. The first time you get this, if you feel it&#x27;s too stiff, try rinsing it in warm water (it softens more with use.) You will see a big difference in the feel and texture of your skin even after just one use--lotions slide on better, skin is brighter, and even helped reduce back acne. And for this price plus the free shipping, it&#x27;s a bargain especially for how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> Awesome washcloth.  It gets my skin clean quickly, I can reach my back with it, and unlike the plastic shower puffs, it rinses COMPLETELY clean in the shower, not just mostly clean.</li>
            <li> I exercise regularly, including cycling, and all that sweat is really hard on my skin.  These towels help get all the grit out.  My back especially has seen much fewer breakouts since I started using these towels.  They feel really rough at first, but you get used to it and they break in a little after a few uses.  It also helps with KP on my upper arms.  Get the two pack so you have one at home and one at the gym.</li>
            <li> This feels good against your skin, holds shower gel just fine and dries out faster than a wash cloth. What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> Said pack of two but only one towel in pack! :(</li>
            <li> Amazing product!  A few people upset that it isn&#x27;t cotton-but if it were cotton, it wouldn&#x27;t work well!  Perfect for your back, I didn&#x27;t even use any soap at all, and it buffed me clean and smooth!  Dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware this is NOT cotton, as stated by previous reviewers and previously was in the description.The tag says &amp;#34;100% nylon / Made in Taiwan.&amp;#34; I was hoping to get a wash cloth made out of natural material, so I am a little disappointed. Over all the product is okay, it does exfoliate my skin pretty good.</li>
            <li> the best exfoliating towel ever!&lt;br /&gt;I bring it with me anywhere i go.&lt;br /&gt;Use it with any dr brannier soup. you will love the fresh feeling on your skin.</li>
            <li> My mom gave me one of these about 15 years ago, and I have just retired it for a new pack of 2.  They feel WONDERFUL on the face and back, and I always travel with one (easy to dry!).  Very highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this after owning the ultimate buffing cloth from Dermalogica but deciding it was a little too expensive. You get two Earth Therapeutics Hydro Towels for the price of one Dermalogica buffing cloth and they&#x27;re extremely similar. The weave is almost the same with Earth Therapeutics&#x27; being just a tad bit coarser. I gave some as gifts to some family members and they love them. I&#x27;m expecting them to last for years. I&#x27;ll definitely update this review to let you know how long they last.</li>
            <li> I have my husband using them now.</li>
            <li> I love these cloths. My sister recommended them years ago and I have used them ever since. I will not go to another brand I like these so much.  They have been my go to gift for friends w a bottle of body wash. I will not shower without one. They are a bit stiff new, but I use them for whole body and face once they soften up a bit. I have never had one develop mold or mildew; as they get old I use them for travel, they dry quickly so are easy to bring along. They really don&#x27;t go bad, just soften over time. I&#x27;ve only bought new ones because I&#x27;ve lost others.</li>
            <li> This is a little rough but if you have very dry skin that needs serious exfoliation, this product is great. I have Keratosis Pilaris (KP or Chicken Skin) and a regular &#x27;pouf sponge&#x27; is not good enough. This product is also really good for cleaning your back because it&#x27;s very long. Surprisingly, it lathers the soap really well. It dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I just want to notify other potential buyers that this is just scratchy 100% nylon material, product of Taiwan.  I went ahead and purchased based on others reviews that it was 90% cotton, mine is NOT, so I just wanted to set the record straight.  I am going to keep the item as my husband does like it, nice and long enough to get his back. But this is too irritating for my skin. I am still searching for something better.  This is nothing bad against the seller as they did not state what the material was made of.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product, just try it you&#x27;ll know exactly what I mean.</li>
            <li> This little cloth is a miracle worker… I look forward to using it from head to toes!</li>
            <li> It feels great!  I have been using it for years and I cannot find it anymore at my local Whole Foods store or any other stores.</li>
            <li> Excellent back scrubbing cloth.  Just enough texture to do a good job without the scratchiness of loofa and you can launder it without any damage.  The nonabsorbent material dries super fast, making it possible to take it on trips: Shower in the evening, it&#x27;s dry by morning</li>
            <li> These are way better than the Japanese imports, because these are softer and don&#x27;t irritate my aging skin, but do a stellar job of cleaning and invigorating. The length is just right for cleaning my back. Otherwise I fold them and use them just like a washcloth but these are easier to hold and soap foams up easily.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and as advertised.  Lathers well and gives that bath brush tingle.</li>
            <li> Only okay. I was expecting something thicker. It does the job I guess with my back since that&#x27;s a difficult area to exfoliate, but I think just going with a dry brushing technique using a long handle is the better option.</li>
            <li> Growing up, my mama used to scrub me down with these bath cloths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been looking for it since then because I can&#x27;t get the same level of clean with body brushes or bath puffs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a perfect job of exfoliating and removing dead skin and dirt.</li>
