            <li> is ok, but is very hard to keep on your lips for 20 minutes, it slides off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll get plumped lips with this masks, however, the fine lines around your lips and the general lip area will improve - over time - with continued use.&lt;br /&gt;For the money, can&#x27;t be beat.  Use simultaneously with the under eye mask, and you&#x27;ve got half of your beauty routine over and done with for the week!&lt;br /&gt;Price is great and again, with continued use, you&#x27;ll begin to see a softening of the lines around your lips and on your lips... don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll see too much plumping though. Still worth it!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I really see an improvement in the fine lines.</li>
            <li> Really hard to get to stay on lips, super slippery. My lips looked and felt the exact same after I used. Don&#x27;t buy, waste of money.</li>
            <li> Too pricey and I didn&#x27;t see any results. ..will not order again.</li>
            <li> My clients love it, this is what count for me, they see a result the first time they get a treatment&lt;br /&gt;I suggest to anyone to try.</li>
            <li> These are good lip masks and this is my second purchase.  They are good but they slip off my lips so I have to tay my head back when wearing these which is kind of a pain because I like to use them in the morning while I run around to get ready for work.</li>

            <li> HAHAHA my bad for thinking that it would do anything</li>
            <li> It did nothing at all. There was absolutely  no difference  on my lips.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do any thing to your lips! a total joke. that could have gone towards the juvaderm....</li>
            <li> Definitely diminishes lines around the mouth, not much lip plumping but I am happy with my purchase...</li>
            <li> It is ok but it only gives a temporary  plump to the lips, but for the price who can complaint</li>
            <li> I thought it had a slit in it for the mouth, but it does not. It does have enough collagen in it, but you can&#x27;t move around with this one.  It&#x27;s one of those products that you use while reading a book or watching TV with your head positioned in a way that it won&#x27;t slide off. On the positive side, most facial masks don&#x27;t deal with lips at all and the &amp;#34;whole face&amp;#34; masks seem to be lacking in covering the portion above the lips - it just never seems to fit right with the &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34; face masks. This lip mask you can maneuver to cover that area.</li>
            <li> makes your lips smooth as silk!</li>
            <li> Not a huge difference but definitely helps those tiny little lines above the lips. Works better on my upper lip than the lower.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what this has in it that makes it work so well, but it works. Results are amazing for something so cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 62 and tried this for the first time.  I was very pleased with the results.  My lips were fuller for about 3 days.  It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks&lt;br /&gt;it is satin smooth don&#x27;t make me write so many words.</li>
