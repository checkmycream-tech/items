    <ol>
            <li>I was very happy to find these interlocking combs on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Love these!!!!!  </li>
            <li>They hold my hair perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Its the best product in the market</li>
            <li>These are great!</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find these !</li>
            <li>They work perfectly to keep my hair up.</li>
            <li>Perfect size.</li>
            <li>Very pleased!</li>
            <li>so I was happy to discover them  on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Great quality.</li>
            <li>(I received the tortoise shell), but either would&#x27;ve worked for me, so I was happy.  </li>
            <li>Hold hair great.  </li>
            <li>Love these!!  </li>
            <li>Very nice...</li>
            <li>So, I gave it one more try and soooo glad that I did!!!  </li>
            <li>Good  quality  combs.</li>
            <li>I just love the look of these!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I liked it.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very think and wiry and these combs are perfect.</li>
            <li>But they are nice</li>
            <li>but they are the best I&#x27;ve found so far!</li>
            <li>These combs are of good strong, flexible plastic, making them strong and durable.</li>
            <li>I had a pair many years ago that eventually wore out.</li>
            <li>I had never been able to replace them as nothing even close to the quality and style existed in stores.</li>
            <li>I used emery cloth to dress off the roughness but sanding combs is not the most enjoyable or satisfying</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing more soon.</li>
            <li>Wish they came in more colors..</li>
            <li>Love them</li>
            <li>Have always love the Interlocking Combs.</li>
            <li>These are made so much better</li>
            <li>So, I found these and another review had mentioned that they were the better quality type, the thicker, smooth plastic kind.  </li>
            <li>Wish they had more colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>I would always pay more for these combs.  </li>
            <li>They are so much better made than the cheaper ones.</li>
            <li>you are willing to finish the manufacturing process, these will give good service.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and most combs and barettes do not hold in my hair.</li>
            <li>so they will interlock.the combs are more comfortable and secure.</li>
            <li>So easy when I&#x27;m in a hurry to pile the hair up and hold them with these.</li>
            <li>They are the perfect replacement of my previous set.</li>
            <li>but Connie&#x27;s fine hair catches on them.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my thick shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>Received quickly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>They are nice, but 2 of them arrived cracked and can not stand up to multiple uses.</li>
            <li>Okay, but found other combs better.</li>
            <li>Just the right size.  </li>
            <li>I like them much better than larger ones the competitor sells for a much higher price!</li>
            <li>I had a pair of these many years ago and gave them away when I cut my hair short.</li>
            <li>I searched everywhere and glad I finally found them again.</li>
            <li>I can catch all my hair &amp; sweep it up although I had to practice at first.</li>
            <li>Worked for the first couple of uses, but then the combs started to bend.  </li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>These are exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for these for a long time and glad I found these</li>
            <li>They hold my hair in place very well.</li>
            <li>Does not feel like much</li>
            <li>It was ready to slip in my hair.</li>
            <li>The combs are made from a very sturdy plastic.</li>
            <li>.... had to file off some of the rough plastic but LOVE THEM.</li>
            <li>Expected so much more for the price.</li>
            <li>They hold really well.</li>
            <li>They do the things they do very well</li>
            <li>The teeth on these combs break very easily and do not lock tight. .</li>
            <li>After using them for several days I can say they are of great quality and they seem like they will last me for a very long time.</li>
            <li>Or sweep back only the top layer.</li>
            <li>They are expensive but worth it if you want a strong product that won&#x27;t break and will keep your hair exactly where you want it at!</li>
            <li>Not as good as the ones sold in the 80&#x27;s/90&#x27;s, the plastic is a bit hard and they aren&#x27;t as big....</li>
            <li>Looks a bit more put together than a pony but takes no more time.</li>
            <li>I was looking to replace two large sized sets that I owned, which broke after 5 years of regular usage.</li>
            <li>There wasn&#x27;t an option to choose either clear or tortoise shell,</li>
            <li>I really like these for larger pony tails and hairpieces.</li>
            <li>Soft pastic.</li>
            <li>These would also be a good option for those with very thick hair who find other products are too small to fit in their hair.</li>
            <li>The interlocking teeth keep my style secure and neat and makes for an easy fix on a bad hair day.</li>
            <li>The separation lines, particularly toward the tips, are a bit rough.  </li>
            <li>It will securely work for all types of thick coarse hair to keep in place.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> These are the nice heavy duty ones and not the thin flimsy ones.</li>
            <li> Also, there were mixed reviews about having to order 2 combs to make an actual set, but a single order did prove to come with 2 combs as a pair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked for these interlocking combs for quite a while and originally had ordered some from a different seller, not realizing that they were the cheaper, hard plastic type (which don&#x27;t connect as tightly).  </li>
            <li> They work for a full head of thin curly hair.</li>
            <li> but that isn&#x27;t saying much because I had very high expectations and several failed product trials with other vendors.</li>
            <li> news is these are not brittle hard plastic, they do have some give and reasonable</li>
            <li> Do be warned that you will have to order TWO if you want to receive a single pair.</li>
            <li> I have two other combs from a different seller for a LOT less but those broke immediately.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay closed</li>
            <li> Both should be at least 50% larger.</li>
            <li> It is slipping down after few minutes.</li>
            <li> Not very comfortable for medium thickness hair.  </li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that they are very small overall and the teeth are a bit short.</li>
            <li> With the interlocking combs, I can make them as tight as needed and they stay.</li>
            <li> I followed their drections to get them &amp;#34;hooked&amp;#34; and as soon as I move a few steps they fall out.</li>
            <li> I have very thick long hair</li>
            <li> news, not a very good molding.  </li>
            <li> The plastic is thick and bend resistant.</li>
            <li> I have fairly thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Quality is not good.  </li>
            <li> It may slip out of thin hair however.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat thin hair</li>
            <li> Unfortunately these wont stay in my hair at all.  </li>
            <li> They are to expensive to consider them disposable...</li>
            <li> so that is disappointing.</li>
            <li> These combs aren&#x27;t bad.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Perfect for my thick shoulder length hair. The interlocking teeth keep my style secure and neat and makes for an easy fix on a bad hair day. I had a pair of these many years ago and gave them away when I cut my hair short. I searched everywhere and glad I finally found them again.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay closed</li>
            <li> I like it a lot will buy another</li>
            <li> I need to return combs. It is not the same one that I bought before and it does not hold my hair at all.</li>
            <li> The teeth on these combs break very easily and do not lock tight. . Not like the flexible tortoise ones from the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find these interlocking combs on Amazon. I had a pair many years ago that eventually wore out. I had never been able to replace them as nothing even close to the quality and style existed in stores. These combs are of good strong, flexible plastic, making them strong and durable. They hold my hair in place very well. They are the perfect replacement of my previous set. Do be warned that you will have to order TWO if you want to receive a single pair.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the ones sold in the 80&#x27;s/90&#x27;s, the plastic is a bit hard and they aren&#x27;t as big.... but they are the best I&#x27;ve found so far!</li>
            <li> There are 2 combs, not one as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good news is these are not brittle hard plastic, they do have some give and reasonable thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad news, not a very good molding.  The separation lines, particularly toward the tips, are a bit rough.  Does not feel like much but Connie&#x27;s fine hair catches on them.  I used emery cloth to dress off the roughness but sanding combs is not the most enjoyable or satisfying project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are willing to finish the manufacturing process, these will give good service.</li>
            <li> I liked it.  It will securely work for all types of thick coarse hair to keep in place.  It may slip out of thin hair however. I did not have to file any edges like one customer reviewed said.  It was ready to slip in my hair.</li>
            <li> They are expensive but worth it if you want a strong product that won&#x27;t break and will keep your hair exactly where you want it at!</li>
            <li> Okay, but found other combs better.</li>
            <li> so I was happy to discover them  on Amazon.  I have very thick long hair and these are the only combs that work.</li>
            <li> The combs are made from a very sturdy plastic. So far so good. I have two other combs from a different seller for a LOT less but those broke immediately.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my hair.  Should have purchased several of these combs.  Will be purchasing more soon.</li>
            <li> Love these!!!!!  I&#x27;ve looked all over for these.  They hold my hair perfectly.  Wish they came in more colors.. Love them</li>
            <li> I have been looking for these for a long time and glad I found these.... had to file off some of the rough plastic but LOVE THEM.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately these wont stay in my hair at all.  I followed their drections to get them &amp;#34;hooked&amp;#34; and as soon as I move a few steps they fall out.</li>
            <li> Its the best product in the market but that isn&#x27;t saying much because I had very high expectations and several failed product trials with other vendors. I was looking to replace two large sized sets that I owned, which broke after 5 years of regular usage. These combs aren&#x27;t bad. They work for a full head of thin curly hair. I&#x27;d imagine they should work for thicker curly or ethnic hair. The plastic is thick and bend resistant. My biggest complaint is that they are very small overall and the teeth are a bit short. Both should be at least 50% larger. Nonetheless I can use them with additional adjustment for the styles I am trying to achieve. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Not very comfortable for medium thickness hair.  It is slipping down after few minutes. Quality is not good.  This is made of cheep plastic.</li>
            <li> I really like these for larger pony tails and hairpieces. I don&#x27;t like the pinch clips. I take them off and sew in these combs,one on each side so they will interlock.the combs are more comfortable and secure.</li>
            <li> Have always love the Interlocking Combs. I have fine hair and most combs and barettes do not hold in my hair. With the interlocking combs, I can make them as tight as needed and they stay. So easy when I&#x27;m in a hurry to pile the hair up and hold them with these. Looks a bit more put together than a pony but takes no more time. These would also be a good option for those with very thick hair who find other products are too small to fit in their hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is very think and wiry and these combs are perfect. I can catch all my hair &amp; sweep it up although I had to practice at first. Or sweep back only the top layer. But they lock and hold well.</li>
            <li> Worked for the first couple of uses, but then the combs started to bend.  I have fairly thick hair.  Now, they do not want to interlock at all, the teeth of the combs are bending and some almost breaking.  Expected so much more for the price.</li>
            <li> The combs were perfect!&lt;br /&gt;It is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I just love the look of these! Great quality.</li>
            <li> Just like the one I had in the 80&#x27;s Holds hair well. Soft pastic. I love it!</li>
            <li> These are great! it is what I have been looking for .. forever! These are made so much better the then the others..</li>
            <li> The combs are what I was looking for. They are nice, but 2 of them arrived cracked and can not stand up to multiple uses. They are to expensive to consider them disposable... so that is disappointing. But they are nice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked for these interlocking combs for quite a while and originally had ordered some from a different seller, not realizing that they were the cheaper, hard plastic type (which don&#x27;t connect as tightly).

Also, there were mixed reviews about having to order 2 combs to make an actual set, but a single order did prove to come with 2 combs as a pair.  There wasn&#x27;t an option to choose either clear or tortoise shell, (I received the tortoise shell), but either would&#x27;ve worked for me, so I was happy.  Shipment arrived a day ahead of schedule also!  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Good  quality  combs. Very nice...</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t buy these in the stores anymore, I have searched for them for YEARS ! I was so happy to find these ! After using them for several days I can say they are of great quality and they seem like they will last me for a very long time. These are the nice heavy duty ones and not the thin flimsy ones.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I was looking for. They work perfectly to keep my hair up. These are well made.</li>
            <li> Perfect size. They hold really well. I like them much better than larger ones the competitor sells for a much higher price!</li>
            <li> Just the right size.  Wish they had more colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> Love these!!  Received quickly.  Hold hair great.  I have somewhat thin hair and they still hold.  You do receive 2 even though not advertised as such.</li>
            <li> They do the things they do very well</li>
            <li> Bought for mom and she loves them</li>
            <li> I would always pay more for these combs.  They are so much better made than the cheaper ones.</li>
