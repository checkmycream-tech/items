    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Klima Antiperspirant is an excellent product!</li>
            <li>Great stuff</li>
            <li>it works so great</li>
            <li>so I am using every 2-3 days and it is amazing!</li>
            <li>Dricloris much more \\&quot;cost effective\\&quot; if you spend some time on here looking for the best price.</li>
            <li>I am good for 3 days at a time with two showers a day.</li>
            <li>and when I took them off, I made sure to smell my feet and there was literally NO SMELL!</li>
            <li>If I could get this product more than 5 stars, I would!</li>
            <li>I truly LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>After using this product, I have been so happy and excited.</li>
            <li>I been useing it just to finish the bottle but not for me, i was expecting better</li>
            <li>Worked better than the ONOX spray for me.  </li>
            <li>I feel so confident.</li>
            <li>So for many years I wandered around wondering why I destroyed flip flops and made them stinky.</li>
            <li>so I use the hair dryer before and after application to make sure it fully absorbs.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably buy it again because it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
            <li>Not so sure about that.</li>
            <li>Readers you&#x27;re better off saving your money.</li>
            <li>But lotion will do just fine.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the MONEY!</li>
            <li>This product is awesome stop excessive sweating and feet also bought the soap that also stopped sweating on my shirts.</li>
            <li>used similar products that are not as good.</li>
            <li>The most amazing product I have purchased in a long time!</li>
            <li>Klima dries quickly without any type of residue or feeling like anything is on your feet.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.    </li>
            <li>Kind of pricey, but it definitely does what it says it does!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t rid my problem completely, but it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Kilma for over a week now, applying twice as much as directed-three times as often as directed, and I&#x27;m not too excited about it.</li>
            <li>I just bought a new pair of cute penny loafers and wore them for around 8 hours straight yesterday</li>
            <li>For me, I would compare this stuff to being a little bit better than a $4 can of underarm antiperspirant, nothing more.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fantastic - that will stop sweating completely!</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have a severe case like I do, I&#x27;m sure it will last longer for you.  </li>
            <li>tried this stuff, sprayed a LOT on the first time, my feet did sweat initially-&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>My husband was pretty astounded.  </li>
            <li>Really seems to work!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty small-i&#x27;d estimate around 3-4 ounces.</li>
            <li>Both worked much much better for me, and now I only have to apply once every 5-7 days.</li>
            <li>Also I found it very important to apply to completely dry feet</li>
            <li>It really helps me not slip out of my flip-flops on our hot Texas summers.</li>
            <li>At first this did not help much.</li>
            <li>am going to try the Certain Dri product for the feet because I use that brand of deoderant</li>
            <li>However, this stuff really works.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product if you think you need it.</li>
            <li>Like, really stinky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my feet.</li>
            <li>i would really get what i paid for but this product didnt work for me.</li>
            <li>This product works ok, although I still had some days when it didn&#x27;t work as well as expected.  </li>
            <li>This really does work...</li>
            <li>Oh, and there&#x27;s no description on here about how much you get-and there&#x27;s no \\&quot;fl</li>
            <li>It does work better than other things I have tried</li>
            <li>Now with the use of Klima, my summertime footware has been dry and comfortable.</li>
            <li>So I thought, maybe if I bought some good really expensive stuff, it&#x27;d be well worth it.</li>
            <li>I was very sceptical buying this product as I tried others before and haven&#x27;t noticed any action on their part.</li>
            <li>It took about a week of daily use (4 sprays/foot) to reach the full effectiveness of the product and I continue to use it pretty much daily</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s great that such a little bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li>At first I wore socks as much as possible but I missed my flats</li>
            <li>You spray it on your feet every 5 days, and they stay totally fresh and dry.</li>
            <li>Before I get my professional treatment/surgery, I&#x27;m buying another one.  </li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I felt confident to try this product, though unfortuanately it didn&#x27;t work for me at all, not in the least.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m always really embarrassed by it because I&#x27;m a female.</li>
            <li>I work in an office environment and don&#x27;t wear socks with my dress shoes and often feel self conscious about whether people can smell my feat or not.</li>
            <li>But it seems like there should be enough for 1-2 months of sprays depending on how much you need to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has completely ended all sweat and odor foot issues...completely.</li>
            <li>but it was very obvious to me that it wasn&#x27;t normal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different sprays over the years, right guard spray antiperspirant, even clinical sticks- all of them had mediocre effects.</li>
            <li>so I ordered this and was very pleasantly surprised when it actually worked.  </li>
            <li>Now I will notice a small amount of moisture, but more damp than actually wet.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that when I&#x27;m spraying it, it doesn&#x27;t dry as fast as it says (15 seconds) and sometimes, the mist gets in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it was worth the price or not.  </li>
            <li>Not perfect, but a HUGE improvement!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Not perfect, but a HUGE improvement!</li>
            <li> I will say that the tops of my feet stay good and dry now-which used to sweat bad too, but there&#x27;s only a so so change with the bottoms.</li>
            <li> , my days of smelly feet are part of the past this product really worked</li>
            <li> Within the past few months I came to realize that my feet sweat way more than the average person.</li>
            <li> This does not completely eliminate the sweating, but does make a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this spray, I had to make fists with my toes to keep my flip flops from slipping off.</li>
            <li> But if you have a really bad problem like me, you probably only have about a 50/50 chance of being satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> like moment where my feet are now magically dry.</li>
            <li> My feet are dry</li>
            <li> so I can rotate them because they take 12-24 hours to fully dry out after wearing them for extended periods of time.</li>
            <li> I still have to sit my work shoes in the window sill to dry out after wearing them.</li>
            <li> DID notice that it caused the skin on my feet to dry out severely.</li>
            <li> I have to spray it every single morning before I put on my socks and leave the house.  </li>
            <li> after the 2nd application it seemed I&#x27;d gotten it down (to spray it, rub it a bit, and let it evaporate!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that at first I thought I would need to use everyday but using it everyday for a week dried my feet out</li>
            <li> For reference, without it, my socks get wring-out wet within about two hours of getting out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> Klima Surefoot works extremely well for me.</li>
            <li> Wearing flats without socks before used to be a wet swamp by the end of the day - not anymore!</li>
            <li> But it might work well for other people.</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I sprayed it on top of my toes instead of in between them (where they sweat), and it dried out my skin badly.  </li>
            <li> This product works a little, but not as I expected.</li>
            <li> In some shoes, that offer absolutely no fabric at all, my feet still will sweat a little bit (or maybe it&#x27;s condensation inside the shoe??)</li>
            <li> Do be careful spraying it on top of your feet or where there aren&#x27;t any sweating, because it will dry out your skin very badly.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I see other people on here had luck-but also a few that didn&#x27;t either.</li>
            <li> I still sweat in my socks throughout the day, just about 30% less and NO ODOR like before.  </li>
            <li> My feet might sweat a little less, but there was no zen</li>
            <li> With the Klima my feet stay perfectly dry for at least a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I gave this three stars because it does seem to work a little bit.</li>
            <li> I will say that it has cut my problem about in half, however after work the bottoms of my socks are still saturated with sweat :/</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for sweat-free shoes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how chronic my foot sweat is compared to others</li>
            <li> From a few months of using Driclor, at least 80% of my sweaty foot problems have been solved.</li>
            <li> Love it and it doesn&#x27;t have a horrible smell.  </li>
            <li> No more dirty, wet feet in flip flops!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive for me.  </li>
            <li> It does appear to help out with the odor, despite the mediocre effectiveness on the perspiration.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a miracle, but unfortunately, Klima did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> I usually hate leaving negative comments, but in this case the seller has earned it.</li>
            <li> My order was shipped out August 7th, as infuriating</li>
            <li> So for years I&#x27;ve had this miserable problem with excessively sweaty feet.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not too bad when I&#x27;m just sitting around or driving, but when I&#x27;m up and moving with my blood pumping-such as at work or doing yard work,etc-they sweat like crazy!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product because my feet smell HORRIBLE</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> Bottom line is this product is crap as is the customer service.</li>
            <li> i started reading up on Hyperhidrosis and realized that I&#x27;m a nasty sweaty footed</li>
            <li> They are cracked by my toes and look terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Only thing that works for me.</li>
            <li> Klima Antiperspirant is an excellent product! Worth every penny.    Hello,    I purchased the Klima Surefoot spray for my sweaty feet. You spray it on your feet every 5 days, and they stay totally fresh and dry. There is no odor at all when I take off my shoes. This product is a lifesaver.    Thank you,    Dr. Peters</li>
            <li> I was very sceptical buying this product as I tried others before and haven&#x27;t noticed any action on their part. However, this stuff really works. But you have to remember something - although they claim on the package that it will work for up to 5 days, they also say that it lasts through 3 showers. So unless you don&#x27;t wash every day there is no way it will last 5 days. I am using it twice a week and that&#x27;s enough to forget about the smell altogether. I will definetely keep buying it!</li>
            <li> I gave this three stars because it does seem to work a little bit. My feet might sweat a little less, but there was no zen like moment where my feet are now magically dry. It does appear to help out with the odor, despite the mediocre effectiveness on the perspiration.</li>
            <li> It didt work at all... I been useing it just to finish the bottle but not for me, i was expecting better</li>
            <li> This does not completely eliminate the sweating, but does make a noticeable difference. It really helps me not slip out of my flip-flops on our hot Texas summers. It is a little expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I have a severe case of hyperhidrosis.  I literally sweat all the time and I have tried everything, but nothing works.  Even GoldBond.  This doesn&#x27;t stay on for 5 days consecutively.  I have to spray it every single morning before I put on my socks and leave the house.  I still sweat in my socks throughout the day, just about 30% less and NO ODOR like before.  Before I get my professional treatment/surgery, I&#x27;m buying another one.  I was going to give it 2 stars, but since it helped me with the odor, I give this product 3 stars.  If you don&#x27;t have a severe case like I do, I&#x27;m sure it will last longer for you.  Do be careful spraying it on top of your feet or where there aren&#x27;t any sweating, because it will dry out your skin very badly.  I sprayed it on top of my toes instead of in between them (where they sweat), and it dried out my skin badly.  But lotion will do just fine.  Hope the product works for you!</li>
            <li> Within the past few months I came to realize that my feet sweat way more than the average person. At first I wore socks as much as possible but I missed my flats so I ordered this and was very pleasantly surprised when it actually worked.  I have to re-apply every 3 days or so as opposed to the 5 advertised but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for sweat-free shoes.  I absolutely recommend this product if you think you need it.</li>
            <li> Worked better than the ONOX spray for me.  Kind of pricey, but it definitely does what it says it does!  For reference, without it, my socks get wring-out wet within about two hours of getting out of the shower.  With the Klima my feet stay perfectly dry for at least a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Klima Surefoot works extremely well for me. You will have to dial in to what frequency works for you. I am good for 3 days at a time with two showers a day. I&#x27;m kicking myself for not trying this years ago. I had no idea that my foot discomfort was not because of my shoes but rather the dampness causing the blistering, sliding around, rawness and burning from moist friction. Now with the use of Klima, my summertime footware has been dry and comfortable. I feel so confident. Wearing flats without socks before used to be a wet swamp by the end of the day - not anymore! Klima dries quickly without any type of residue or feeling like anything is on your feet. I&#x27;m not sure how chronic my foot sweat is compared to others but it was very obvious to me that it wasn&#x27;t normal. This has improved the quality of my life.</li>
            <li> I was nervous to buy this product because NOTHING else like this has worked. But, this product actually works! It doesn&#x27;t rid my problem completely, but it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. No more dirty, wet feet in flip flops! I will keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> So for many years I wandered around wondering why I destroyed flip flops and made them stinky. Like, really stinky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then i started reading up on Hyperhidrosis and realized that I&#x27;m a nasty sweaty footed bastard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this stuff, sprayed a LOT on the first time, my feet did sweat initially-&lt;br /&gt;Then after the 2nd application it seemed I&#x27;d gotten it down (to spray it, rub it a bit, and let it evaporate!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next thing I know, I can run around and do whatever all day, go to baseball games in the heat, hiking, etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND I DON&#x27;T HAVE SWEATY FEET! Now if I could just get a bulk packaged box set of these, a larger can, or something...&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a miracle, but unfortunately, Klima did not work for me.  I tried using it daily and I also tried using it before bed.  I have a severe case of plantar hyperhidrosis and my feet literally drip!&lt;br /&gt;My hands give me the same problem.  My \\&quot;wet\\&quot; life continues.</li>
            <li> Not perfect, but a HUGE improvement! Prior to using this spray, I had to make fists with my toes to keep my flip flops from slipping off. Now I will notice a small amount of moisture, but more damp than actually wet. It took about a week of daily use (4 sprays/foot) to reach the full effectiveness of the product and I continue to use it pretty much daily (I can get by skipping a day here and there). Also I found it very important to apply to completely dry feet so I use the hair dryer before and after application to make sure it fully absorbs.</li>
            <li> This did not work for me. Had no affect at all. My feet still sweat the same.</li>
            <li> Overpriced. Didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my feet. Definitely not worth the price.</li>
            <li> This actually work.. Great stuff</li>
            <li> I suffer from sweety feet and I discover this wonder, my days of smelly feet are part of the past this product really worked</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I felt confident to try this product, though unfortuanately it didn&#x27;t work for me at all, not in the least.</li>
            <li> This product works a little, but not as I expected. For the price, I wouldn&#x27;t buy again. I apply every day and my feet still sweat some.  Maybe not \\&quot;as much\\&quot; as before, but they do still sweat (in sandals).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try the Certain Dri product for the feet because I use that brand of deoderant and it&#x27;s fantastic - that will stop sweating completely!</li>
            <li> i thought for the price i would really get what i paid for but this product didnt work for me. Odaban spray actually did work. would not recommend this product</li>
            <li> This product works ok, although I still had some days when it didn&#x27;t work as well as expected.  It&#x27;s a little expensive for me.  But it might work well for other people.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product because my feet smell HORRIBLE and I&#x27;m always really embarrassed by it because I&#x27;m a female. After using this product, I have been so happy and excited. I work in an office environment and don&#x27;t wear socks with my dress shoes and often feel self conscious about whether people can smell my feat or not. I don&#x27;t have to worry anymore. In some shoes, that offer absolutely no fabric at all, my feet still will sweat a little bit (or maybe it&#x27;s condensation inside the shoe??) but the sweat doesn&#x27;t smell ONE BIT. I just bought a new pair of cute penny loafers and wore them for around 8 hours straight yesterday and when I took them off, I made sure to smell my feet and there was literally NO SMELL! My husband was pretty astounded.  I love this product. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that when I&#x27;m spraying it, it doesn&#x27;t dry as fast as it says (15 seconds) and sometimes, the mist gets in my mouth.  If I could get this product more than 5 stars, I would!</li>
            <li> It became operational after 15 days</li>
            <li> At first this did not help much. It took about 2 weeks before I noticed a difference.  I need to spray it on my feet every three days.  It does work better than other things I have tried but my feet still sweat.  I bought this to use when I wear sandals. When I wear sandals the bottoms of my feet sweat and smell, using this product I can now wear sandals without the smell but there is no way I could wear regular shoes without socks.  I&#x27;m not sure if it was worth the price or not.  Considering that it&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found that helps some I&#x27;ll probably buy it again because it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
            <li> This really does work... it works so great that at first I thought I would need to use everyday but using it everyday for a week dried my feet out so I am using every 2-3 days and it is amazing! My feet are dry no ordor I truly LOVE this stuff! I think it&#x27;s great that such a little bit goes a very long way. Well worth the MONEY!</li>
            <li> Really seems to work!</li>
            <li> So for years I&#x27;ve had this miserable problem with excessively sweaty feet. They&#x27;re not too bad when I&#x27;m just sitting around or driving, but when I&#x27;m up and moving with my blood pumping-such as at work or doing yard work,etc-they sweat like crazy! I hate it. I have to keep several pairs of shoes around so I can rotate them because they take 12-24 hours to fully dry out after wearing them for extended periods of time. I&#x27;ve tried many different sprays over the years, right guard spray antiperspirant, even clinical sticks- all of them had mediocre effects. So I thought, maybe if I bought some good really expensive stuff, it&#x27;d be well worth it. Not so sure about that. I&#x27;ve been using Kilma for over a week now, applying twice as much as directed-three times as often as directed, and I&#x27;m not too excited about it. I will say that it has cut my problem about in half, however after work the bottoms of my socks are still saturated with sweat :/ I still have to sit my work shoes in the window sill to dry out after wearing them. I will say that the tops of my feet stay good and dry now-which used to sweat bad too, but there&#x27;s only a so so change with the bottoms. For me, I would compare this stuff to being a little bit better than a $4 can of underarm antiperspirant, nothing more. I see other people on here had luck-but also a few that didn&#x27;t either. So, my advice would be-if you&#x27;ve got the extra $ laying around it&#x27;s worth a shot. But if you have a really bad problem like me, you probably only have about a 50/50 chance of being satisfied with the results. Oh, and there&#x27;s no description on here about how much you get-and there&#x27;s no \\&quot;fl ounces\\&quot; on the bottle either. It&#x27;s pretty small-i&#x27;d estimate around 3-4 ounces. But it seems like there should be enough for 1-2 months of sprays depending on how much you need to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**  I&#x27;ve since used both Odoban spray and Driclor. Both worked much much better for me, and now I only have to apply once every 5-7 days. Dricloris much more \\&quot;cost effective\\&quot; if you spend some time on here looking for the best price. From a few months of using Driclor, at least 80% of my sweaty foot problems have been solved. One 75ml bottle of Driclor also lasted me several months. Something to consider, just thought I&#x27;d share since it&#x27;s taken me years to find a solution.</li>
            <li> I usually hate leaving negative comments, but in this case the seller has earned it. I had placed an order for this foot spray on June 30th and was supposed to have received my package around Tuesday July 10, 2012 - Wednesday July 18, that never happened. My order was shipped out August 7th, as infuriating that was I took my time, read the instructions and used the spray until the bottle was done. Was it effect? Not at all, I still continued to sweat from my feet despite following the instructions to the tee. Bottom line is this product is crap as is the customer service. Readers you&#x27;re better off saving your money.</li>
            <li> Love it and it doesn&#x27;t have a horrible smell.  will reorder again.  used similar products that are not as good.</li>
            <li> The most amazing product I have purchased in a long time! It has completely ended all sweat and odor foot issues...completely. LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Didnt notice any difference in sweating levels, I dont think the product works. I would not recommend it to others</li>
            <li> After using this product continually I did not notice a difference in the sweat.&lt;br /&gt;I DID notice that it caused the skin on my feet to dry out severely. They are cracked by my toes and look terrible. I had to stop using the product.&lt;br /&gt;It might work for some, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome stop excessive sweating and feet also bought the soap that also stopped sweating on my shirts.</li>
