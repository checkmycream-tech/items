            <li>I wish they didn&#x27;t otherwise they would be great.</li>
            <li>GREAT product.  </li>
            <li>Great price.  </li>
            <li>These are great for getting lint out of the bobbin case and under the bobbin case.</li>
            <li>The price is great, too.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes look amazing, so the Latisse is still working well!  </li>

            <li>great product.. much better than the ones that come with the latisse.</li>
            <li>Great Product at the right price.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made product.</li>
            <li>(Not to mention that they are much more affordable)</li>
            <li>but I got a way better deal at RoyalCosmetics.net</li>
            <li>Love them</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s more like it&#x27;s flocked at the end).</li>
            <li>Hope this helps! :)</li>
            <li>These may have been intended to apply eyelash extensions, but I got them for myself and a friend to use to clean our embroidery sewing machines!  </li>
            <li>Keeps everything clean!</li>
            <li>Knowing the risks inherent in this product, I want a more precise applicator.  </li>
            <li>the ends come off easily.</li>
            <li>The microbrush absorbs a drop of solution and allows one to apply it in a fine line along the lashes.  </li>
            <li>They are very fine so detailing is done out right.</li>
            <li>These are great for applying something like Latisse, though I use Careprost (another brand but same as Latisse).  </li>
            <li>make sure to get the right weight.</li>
            <li>love these this is my 2nd or 3rd order perfect tip for my Latisse...</li>
            <li>Good for tiny details.</li>
            <li>I ordered these microbrushes to apply Latisse to my lash line because I always seem to run out of the applicators included with Latisse so quickly.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but great quality.</li>
            <li>Really helps you be precise with the application of the lattice.  </li>
            <li>And I love these because they&#x27;re not the cheap flimsy ones I get from my local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>again, they were all the same kind when I wanted one of each size.</li>
            <li>So $20 for a year&#x27;s worth of microbrushes saved me literally hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li>You just have to hope that you get the right size.</li>
            <li>Price was right.</li>
            <li>These are just the right size.</li>
            <li>If you want a clean running machine, these pick up the lint very well.</li>
            <li>Happy they finally got to me but only had one tube with onr color.</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle of Latisse in December, 2014, and started using the microbrushes to apply.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this product, the tips are way too small, I have to use 2 or 3 instead of just 1 because they don&#x27;t absorb enough.</li>
            <li>/&gt;HOWEVER be aware that sizing does vary by the color.</li>
            <li>Thankfully I ended up with one of the sizes I would have most likely purchased anyway</li>
            <li>I was pointed to these not too long ago and decided to grab some seeing as the value was much greater.</li>
            <li>Easy enough to remove.</li>
            <li>Orange is Large 3.0mm</li>
            <li>but it does provide a soft tip, great for detailing and getting in hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>They work good, I just wish they were a little bit bigger for what I need them for(to apply Latisse)</li>
            <li>I actually prefer these to the applicators that come with the Latisse as I think those are designed to use up a lot of product quickly.</li>
            <li>Although the brushes I received were a little smaller that what I originally wanted they worked fine for the task at hand.</li>
            <li>There are similar brushes (at much higher prices) made for the purpose of cleaning sewing machines and equipment.  </li>
            <li>Judging by looks, they look exactly the same with just longer handles.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s pretty obvious on the package itself</li>
            <li>So these are great little applicators and get the job done without the waste!</li>
            <li>(These microbrushes are sterile, it&#x27;s safe to use about half a drop and use the same brush on both eyes, unless you have an eye infection.)  </li>
            <li>I guess no one offers that in a set?</li>
            <li>The brushes that come with Latisse are big and bulky and soak up too much product.</li>
            <li>I have used these microbrushes before and they do an excellent job with applying liquids to the base of eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Clean little brush that I use for my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Using these I can make one drop last for my eyelashes and eyebrows each night and am getting the same results as when I used twice as much with the included brushes.  </li>
            <li>All thanks to these clever little teensy micro-q-tips.</li>

            <li> All thanks to these clever little teensy micro-q-tips.</li>
            <li> My one bottle of Latisse has lasted so far 2 and a half months, and it&#x27;s not empty yet.</li>
            <li> These are tiny and allow for a small amount of product to be applied to the lash line wthout wasting too much product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;According to the case (which is very high quality by the way!):&lt;br /&gt;White/Purple is Small</li>
            <li> Bottle will last twice as long.</li>
            <li> Instead of my bottle lasting 6 weeks with the huge unnecessary brushes that came with it, my bottle lasted 15 MONTHS!</li>
            <li> Like most posters, I am using these for Latisse, not applying artificial lashes.</li>
            <li> I use one tiny half drop of product total for both eyes and my lashes look like a mascara ad.</li>
            <li> Amazingly enough, the ones that come with that are pretty much designed to make you waste as much (of a very expensive) product as possible.  </li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; at the ends</li>
            <li> They use so much less of the product than the brushes that come with Latisse so.</li>
            <li> A little less fluffy</li>
            <li> but they come in little cardboard boxes.</li>
            <li> Confused by the different color packages.</li>
            <li> It needlessly wastes product.</li>
            <li> So not only is the color you get at random, so is the size due to this.</li>
            <li> I’m not sure how you would use these for eyelash extensions –</li>
            <li> (small must be invisible)</li>
            <li> These were the small ones which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> there is hardly any tip on the end.</li>
            <li> If it were less expensive, I&#x27;d give it five stars.</li>
            <li> The brushes provided with Latisse are bulky, sloppy and waste expensive product.</li>
            <li> While I understand random color choosing, I don&#x27;t like random size choosing.</li>
            <li> They are way too thin!!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Good for tiny details.</li>
            <li> You only get one container!!!!</li>
            <li> Item arrived quicker than they said. And I love these because they&#x27;re not the cheap flimsy ones I get from my local beauty supply store. (Not to mention that they are much more affordable)</li>
            <li> love these this is my 2nd or 3rd order perfect tip for my Latisse...no complains and speedy delivery</li>
            <li> A little pricey but great quality. I use it to apply Latisse to my eyelash line. Saves product consumption.  If it were less expensive, I&#x27;d give it five stars.</li>
            <li> These are great microbrushes! They are very fine so detailing is done out right.</li>
            <li> These may have been intended to apply eyelash extensions, but I got them for myself and a friend to use to clean our embroidery sewing machines!  There are similar brushes (at much higher prices) made for the purpose of cleaning sewing machines and equipment.  But, these brushes are basically the same and will work just as well.</li>
            <li> Why this picture is 4 peaces?  It was got only One!!</li>
            <li> Happy they finally got to me but only had one tube with onr color. The picture made it seem that it came with all four different colors.</li>
            <li> These microbrushes work perfectly for applying liquid adhesives to intricate die cuts for card making &amp; scrapbooking.</li>
            <li> again, they were all the same kind when I wanted one of each size. I guess no one offers that in a set?</li>
            <li> These are perfect. I wish they came in the containers shown in the picture but they come in little cardboard boxes.</li>
            <li> This might be the best Latisse applicator but I got a way better deal at RoyalCosmetics.net</li>
            <li> Although the brushes I received were a little smaller that what I originally wanted they worked fine for the task at hand.</li>
            <li> Clean little brush that I use for my eyelashes.  The only thing was that I had to wait for them to deliver</li>
            <li> The pic features 4 jars, so I was under the impression I would get all 4. But you only get 1 in the mail. If I would have known that I would have ordered 4 so that was a bit misleading.</li>
            <li> there is hardly any tip on the end.</li>
            <li> When using to remove lash extensions with a gel remover the ends come off easily. I wish they didn&#x27;t otherwise they would be great. But I guess for the price I can&#x27;t complain. I will just have to use like 10 per client to get the job done.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for fine tuning makeup and eyeliner.... Also for fixing mascara smudges... Love them</li>
            <li> good for lash extension priming,  removal &amp; sealing</li>
            <li> I use these for my eyelash growth serum.  Perfect application and disposable so there is no risk of eye infection.</li>
            <li> I have used these microbrushes before and they do an excellent job with applying liquids to the base of eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This is an update.  Like most posters, I am using these for Latisse, not applying artificial lashes. My eyelashes look amazing, so the Latisse is still working well!  I use one tiny half drop of product total for both eyes and my lashes look like a mascara ad. (These microbrushes are sterile, it&#x27;s safe to use about half a drop and use the same brush on both eyes, unless you have an eye infection.)  I bought my first bottle of Latisse in December, 2014, and started using the microbrushes to apply.  I just finished the bottle up in March, 2016.  Instead of my bottle lasting 6 weeks with the huge unnecessary brushes that came with it, my bottle lasted 15 MONTHS! So $20 for a year&#x27;s worth of microbrushes saved me literally hundreds of dollars. Starting my second bottle of Latisse, which I got for $70.</li>
            <li> The picture says it comes with 4 and I only received one. The yellow ones. They are way too thin!!!</li>
            <li> Good price and quantity but some times the cotton comes off when using with some removers. Easy enough to remove.</li>
            <li> Great Product at the right price.</li>
            <li> I’m not sure how you would use these for eyelash extensions – but I use them instead of the included brushes with my Latisse.  Amazingly enough, the ones that come with that are pretty much designed to make you waste as much (of a very expensive) product as possible.  Using these I can make one drop last for my eyelashes and eyebrows each night and am getting the same results as when I used twice as much with the included brushes.  Plus, these are disposable so you don’t have to worry about cleaning.  Great product and very good price for what you get.</li>
            <li> even though I ordered med they were a lot smaller then I hoped them to be&lt;br /&gt;but will make them work (small must be invisible)</li>
            <li> I am actually using the brushes to apply a lash medication and I needed something disposable that I could use every day.</li>
            <li> I use this for moisturizing my eyelashes. The container is awesome and love that I can shake out one at a time. Keeps everything clean!</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made product. Every time I dip them in the solution (such as alcohol and remover), the microfiber head falls off. I contacted the seller for a refund, but no answer or whatsoever. Do not wast your money for this!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this product, the tips are way too small, I have to use 2 or 3 instead of just 1 because they don&#x27;t absorb enough.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. Confused by the different color packages. Are they different sizes?</li>
            <li> GREAT product.  Great price.  Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I am a boeard certified ophthalmologist who loves using Latisse for longer and thicker eyelashes.  Knowing the risks inherent in this product, I want a more precise applicator.  The microbrush absorbs a drop of solution and allows one to apply it in a fine line along the lashes.  The brushes provided with Latisse are bulky, sloppy and waste expensive product.</li>
            <li> works perfectly - very happy</li>
            <li> These were the small ones which is what I wanted. You just have to hope that you get the right size. Some sell the bigger ones without telling you what size they are.</li>
            <li> Really helps you be precise with the application of the lattice.  Excellent absorbency!  great product.. much better than the ones that come with the latisse.</li>
            <li> Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered again. Arrived sooner than expected. Still good quality and perfect for applying Careprost. A 3-ml bottle lasts 4 months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect size for applying Latisse/Careprost. I got yellow ones.</li>
            <li> make sure to get the right weight. the ones I got were not enough micro fiber on the tip</li>
            <li> Was hoping these were micro brushes, but the ends are tipped with some type of material, but not cotton, I dont think. I want these for applying superglue to nail breaks and splits. Will see how they work. Took awhile to get here. Came from China. Price was right.</li>
            <li> I have four sewing machines that get lint in the bobbin. These are great for getting lint out of the bobbin case and under the bobbin case. The price is great, too. If you want a clean running machine, these pick up the lint very well.</li>
            <li> These are great for applying something like Latisse, though I use Careprost (another brand but same as Latisse).  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> They work good, I just wish they were a little bit bigger for what I need them for(to apply Latisse) They use so much less of the product than the brushes that come with Latisse so. Bottle will last twice as long.</li>
            <li> I ordered these microbrushes to apply Latisse to my lash line because I always seem to run out of the applicators included with Latisse so quickly. These are tiny and allow for a small amount of product to be applied to the lash line wthout wasting too much product. I actually prefer these to the applicators that come with the Latisse as I think those are designed to use up a lot of product quickly.</li>
            <li> perfect for removing lashes</li>
            <li> These are good quality. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> The brushes that come with Latisse are big and bulky and soak up too much product. These are just the right size. Your Latisse will go so much further. I use just one drop for both eyes — plus eyebrows. My one bottle of Latisse has lasted so far 2 and a half months, and it&#x27;s not empty yet. All thanks to these clever little teensy micro-q-tips.</li>
            <li> Bought these to use with my rx for Latisse. The brushes that come with my Latisse are big and bulky. It needlessly wastes product. So these are great little applicators and get the job done without the waste!</li>
            <li> Excellent shipping speed and they work perfectly.  Will definitely purchase these again.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I was using airbrush dabbers that look very similar to these but have shorter handles. I was pointed to these not too long ago and decided to grab some seeing as the value was much greater. Judging by looks, they look exactly the same with just longer handles. A little less fluffy maybe but I&#x27;ll take it! I don&#x27;t have to worry about wasting them. There&#x27;s not much &amp;#34;fluff&amp;#34; at the ends but it does provide a soft tip, great for detailing and getting in hard to reach areas. (It&#x27;s more like it&#x27;s flocked at the end). So A+ for product itself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER be aware that sizing does vary by the color. I wish the seller would separate the listings and just list the ones in stock. While I understand random color choosing, I don&#x27;t like random size choosing. So not only is the color you get at random, so is the size due to this. Maybe they don&#x27;t realize? But it&#x27;s pretty obvious on the package itself so I dunno.  Thankfully I ended up with one of the sizes I would have most likely purchased anyway (blue).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the case (which is very high quality by the way!):&lt;br /&gt;White/Purple is Small 1.0mm&lt;br /&gt;Yellow/Blue is Medium 2.0mm&lt;br /&gt;Green/Orange is Large 3.0mm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll attach a photo for your reference. Hope this helps! :)</li>
