            <li>Great power supply you will need a better pedal</li>
            <li>been wanting to get one of these for awhile.. very handy to have around for many uses..</li>
            <li>but It is SOOOO Much better than we thought!</li>
            <li>not giving me the color I ordered, they sent me free tips.&lt;br /&gt;Overall great machine.</li>
            <li>Amazing except for the pedal</li>
            <li>I liked it all.</li>
            <li>Looks nice..</li>
            <li>Power supply is very good quality dc unit I am a seasoned tattoo artist</li>
            <li>Its a great deal, flip a switch and you work lines or shading, definetly a cool product</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and its such a great price!</li>
            <li>Never was able to read voltage.</li>
            <li>The capabilities of this power supply are overwhelming.</li>
            <li>great so far!!</li>
            <li>Got this for my husband when his went out and at first we were like it can&#x27;t be that good for the price being asked</li>
            <li>Is a good power supply at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t happy that it shorted out in less than a month, though... don&#x27;t get this for your primary power supply!!</li>
            <li>work jus fine to me...</li>
            <li>Works great on the proper 110v setting!</li>
            <li>the clip cords are cheap and the foot pedal is decent over all a super good deal I am very pleased-Jeff Collins</li>
            <li>When I received this package it was packaged well and surrounded by air pouches, that however is about the only good thing I have to say.</li>
            <li>At first it worked fine.</li>
            <li>I love this machine and would recommend but make sure you check you volts on the back.</li>
            <li>and out.and it doesn&#x27;t sound consistent at all, but I can&#x27;t tell because the screen doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>but it would really be nice to have gotten something that I can use in real world applications, instead of having to buy  new one before I can start my career.</li>
            <li>Other than that this is a good value.</li>
            <li>was a gift and the price was right</li>
            <li>small and attractive.</li>
            <li>Before I was having to set up my liner remembering what my liner was running good on and write it down on my table in sharpe marker, then hook up my shader and repeat the process.</li>
            <li>Make sure the switch on the back is set for the right voltage.</li>
            <li>Will buy more products in the future</li>
            <li>Works as described and looks good but the real test is how long will it last</li>
            <li>Plenty of power works good comes switched make sure to flip the switch in the back that has been a common issue when getting these new out of the box.</li>
            <li>works really well, however, I suggest buying a higher quality footpedal, as the one included is not as high quality as the surface product itself.</li>
            <li>and I thought it was broke and got really upset</li>
            <li>his words &amp;#34;it feels like butter&amp;#34; (haha)</li>
            <li>The cords are straight s</li>
            <li>Someone with no experience is going to buy this and really really hurt someone.</li>
            <li>after 2 months it would not keep a steady voltage.</li>
            <li>I did fix the foot pedal wires and it does seem to work decently now, and the clip cords are fairly good, basically I paid $27 for 2 clip cords and a foot pedal that I had to fix, I&#x27;m not happy with the power supply at all.</li>
            <li>Nice but loses voltage after a while</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a heavy power supply box, but was hoping to use it for more than a paper weight</li>
            <li>new</li>
            <li>Machine doesnt work and the lights on it are very dim</li>
            <li>A third the price you&#x27;d pay for the exact device from a retailer shop.</li>
            <li>spend a little extra on one that is more dependable.</li>
            <li>Then It completely died.</li>
            <li>the only reason i give it 2 stars is because the clip cords are decent.</li>
            <li>He says you don&#x27;t have to turn it up very high and that it was so smooth he could hardly feel it!</li>
            <li>not sure if it was Amazon or the original supplier.</li>
            <li>Box itself is good foot pedal broke within 15 seconds very disappointing when u buy new stuff n</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t keep your tat gun at a steady moving pace therefore its not worth it</li>

            <li> some screws were floating around inside power supply, internal coil wasn&#x27;t fastened down.</li>
            <li> The pedal could&#x27;ve been a little bigger.</li>
            <li> I guess I am out the money I spent.</li>
            <li> Or it will suddenly slow down and you have to step on it numerous times for it to start working again.</li>
            <li> so they sent black and apologized.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> so I would appreciate it if I can have a little feedback on y</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll use this waste of space to repair another supply i have sitting around that the dial broke on.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not a huge deal until I start tattooing people</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> so I was forced to give it one.</li>
            <li> Shading port went out after approximately 15 pieces.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I got a bad one or what, but as my tattoo machine runs the power supply drops voltage and will cause my machine to cut out when I touch it to anything.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it wouldn&#x27;t let me give zero stars</li>
            <li> Overly priced for a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> Crap out of the box....</li>
            <li> this power supply is crap.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BUY THIS CRAP!</li>

            <li> I just got my Power Supply today. Tested and its fine.&lt;br /&gt;They were out of red so they sent black and apologized.&lt;br /&gt;For not giving me the color I ordered, they sent me free tips.&lt;br /&gt;Overall great machine.</li>
            <li> Great power supply you will need a better pedal It doesn&#x27;t always work  well. I like it saves table space.</li>
            <li> the power did not stay constant.  lcd screen was damaged and the back of the unit had scratches and chips.  not what i was hoping for.  can&#x27;t comment on the accessories didn&#x27;t use the footpedal or cords</li>
            <li> I just got it today I use and everything work jus fine to me...I love it. It great for the price of it</li>

            <li> Power supply is very good quality dc unit I am a seasoned tattoo artist the clip cords are cheap and the foot pedal is decent over all a super good deal I am very pleased-Jeff Collins</li>
            <li> The foot peddle is a piece of crap, but everything else is great works like a charm</li>
            <li> Nice but loses voltage after a while</li>
            <li> been wanting to get one of these for awhile.. very handy to have around for many uses.. great so far!!</li>
            <li> This power supply is the best, I JUST LOVE it. Before I was having to set up my liner remembering what my liner was running good on and write it down on my table in sharpe marker, then hook up my shader and repeat the process. Now all I have to do is set up both machines and just flip a switch, instead of readjusting the level of power. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Works great, saves time. Its a great deal, flip a switch and you work lines or shading, definetly a cool product</li>
            <li> It came with everything in the description. It works good and drives my tattoo machine well. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> One cord wasn&#x27;t working but I had a replacement and am overall very happy with product and very happy with seller. Will buy more products in the future</li>
            <li> Machine stopped working. Lcd screen came cracked. Never was able to read voltage. .would never buy or recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> When I received it, it didn&#x27;t even work the wiring and toggle switch had a short some were?  troubleshoot it myselfand got it to work for about a weeknow it in the trash</li>
            <li> not sure if it was Amazon or the original supplier. some screws were floating around inside power supply, internal coil wasn&#x27;t fastened down. We will see how long the unit lasts</li>
            <li> Machine doesnt work and the lights on it are very dim I dont recommend this power supply to anyone</li>
            <li> Shading port went out after approximately 15 pieces. Won&#x27;t hold a constant current. Do not buy! You will not be happy.</li>
            <li> Works as described and looks good but the real test is how long will it last but for now it will do</li>
            <li> I bought this for my brother for Christmas and he loves it! He says you don&#x27;t have to turn it up very high and that it was so smooth he could hardly feel it! his words &amp;#34;it feels like butter&amp;#34; (haha) definitely a great price for a great item!</li>
            <li> good for the price, does what it&#x27;s supposed to (when it works). not the best power supply out there but also not the worst. small and attractive. perfect for beginners and backup for apprentices or pros. wasn&#x27;t happy that it shorted out in less than a month, though... don&#x27;t get this for your primary power supply!! spend a little extra on one that is more dependable.</li>
            <li> shader plug was not working,only liner.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it wouldn&#x27;t let me give zero stars so I was forced to give it one. Power supply doesn&#x27;t work. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I liked it all. The pedal could&#x27;ve been a little bigger.</li>
            <li> The capabilities of this power supply are overwhelming. This is a good power supply for beginers and pros alike.</li>
            <li> Power suppy is good, but the pedal is junk. When you press the pedal the power supply cuts in and out while tattooing. Or it will suddenly slow down and you have to step on it numerous times for it to start working again.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I got a bad one or what, but as my tattoo machine runs the power supply drops voltage and will cause my machine to cut out when I touch it to anything. I am an apprentice so it&#x27;s not a huge deal until I start tattooing people but it would really be nice to have gotten something that I can use in real world applications, instead of having to buy  new one before I can start my career.</li>
            <li> Looks nice..that&#x27;s all! It does not work, plugged it in. It read zero and stayed on zero, no power coming out of the box at all. It&#x27;s a heavy power supply box, but was hoping to use it for more than a paper weight :/ I have contacted amazon, still no resolution. I guess I am out the money I spent.</li>
            <li> Overly priced for a piece of crap. At first it worked fine. Then it started shorting out. Then It completely died.</li>
            <li> Box itself is good foot pedal broke within 15 seconds very disappointing when u buy new stuff n have to wait on shipping</li>
            <li> The cords are straight s***, doesn&#x27;t put out correct voltage</li>
            <li> Make sure the switch on the back is set for the right voltage. We thought it was broke because we had the switch on 210v and the numbers were jumping all over the place. Works great on the proper 110v setting! Lol.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BUY THIS CRAP! the LCD no work,... poor quality... cheap material and finish... screws need adjust... etc etc etc.</li>
            <li> Is a good power supply at a reasonable price. A third the price you&#x27;d pay for the exact device from a retailer shop. Plus you get a foot switch and two patch cords extra.</li>
            <li> Crap out of the box.... Footpedal is a throw away,.Clipcord is junk.....the LCD screen glows but showed NO numbers,..it bogs and cuts out power . Someone with no experience is going to buy this and really really hurt someone.</li>
            <li> Amazing except for the pedal</li>
            <li> When I received this package it was packaged well and surrounded by air pouches, that however is about the only good thing I have to say. The power supply screen doesn&#x27;t work properly. It will run the machines but cut in and out.and it doesn&#x27;t sound consistent at all, but I can&#x27;t tell because the screen doesn&#x27;t work. The foot pedal connections were not properly attached to the wire and fell off when I opened the box. I did fix the foot pedal wires and it does seem to work decently now, and the clip cords are fairly good, basically I paid $27 for 2 clip cords and a foot pedal that I had to fix, I&#x27;m not happy with the power supply at all.</li>
            <li> arrived Before it was supposed to works great</li>
            <li> the power regulator is s*.. and it doesn&#x27;t keep your tat gun at a steady moving pace therefore its not worth it</li>
            <li> this power supply is crap. after 2 months it would not keep a steady voltage. the only reason i give it 2 stars is because the clip cords are decent. i&#x27;ll use this waste of space to repair another supply i have sitting around that the dial broke on.</li>
            <li> Great for the price, cannot beat this power source</li>
            <li> great job for the price. we now have two</li>
