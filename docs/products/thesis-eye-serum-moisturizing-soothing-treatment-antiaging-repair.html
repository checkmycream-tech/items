    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The serum itself smells great.</li>
            <li>LOL.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid lots of money for good eye creams, this product has beat them.  </li>
            <li>But a good product.</li>
            <li>Amazing product, no side effects as described by others.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s great for some real anti-oxidant repair at night.</li>
            <li>Overall, great organic serum for eyes!</li>
            <li>Love how it makes my skin around the eyes feel.</li>
            <li>It smooths the lines, makes my eyes look more youthful, and help give my make up a more youthful glow.</li>
            <li>BUT once I learned to use it, I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>okay if you don&#x27;t mind oil on your pillow.</li>
            <li>I use this at night mostly, but I have used it in the morning too.</li>
            <li>I love it and use it every night.  </li>
            <li>My eyes were noticeably more wrinkled using Burt&#x27;s Bees.  </li>
            <li>Also read that you couldn&#x27;t easily meter the dose.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the product to those who are worried about fine lines and/or are looking to moisturize and help the skin underneath/around the eyes.</li>
            <li>It reduces fine lines and hydrates.</li>
            <li>But, I am not disappointed with this at all</li>
            <li>Overall besides that fact it works well and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I was a little surprised at how potent the lavender and patchouli is, however, because I use it at night the relaxing scent of lavender is perfect aromatherapy.</li>
            <li>Also true.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating - works way better than any eye cream I have tried.</li>
            <li>I bought this because all the reviews said it really worked at making the eye area look so much better.  </li>
            <li>I think with few changes it would be a great product</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first because I thought it would be too oily, but it really absorbs quickly and works well under makeup.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if you women have tried looking for eye moisturizer, but there are not very many good ones out there.  </li>
            <li>When I first tried this product, I was apprehensive because it is an oil.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t sleep the first couple weeks...</li>
            <li>I unscrew the top to get a smaller dose out.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>So I purchased this product and it certainly does the trick.</li>
            <li>I wanted to find something organic and natural to help moisturize and minimize the severity of the fine lines I have developed underneath my eyes from smiling.</li>
            <li>and I wish the pump didn&#x27;t squirt so much out no matter</li>
            <li>In the morning, I can really see the difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I accidentally put too much on, it was no issue to wipe it off</li>
            <li>I still don&#x27;t like the smell of this product, but it really works, and unlike Burt&#x27;s Bees, never breaks me out.</li>
            <li>I am actually pretty surprised at the results that the product produced.</li>
            <li>I admit the first few nights I used it, the next day I did look much more rested.  </li>
            <li>The skin under my eyes is softer and smoother and I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing less fine lines with continued use.</li>
            <li>Use half a pump&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li>As it was said before the pump could give the smaller amount of serum,it doesn&#x27;t absorb well, so if I put as much as I get after sometime it somehow gets in to my eye</li>
            <li>The only problem i was having is it gets really oily</li>
            <li>Keeps eye area soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had dark circles under my eyes since forever (and due to irregular sleep, they weren&#x27;t getting any better), but the serum seems to be making them fade.</li>
            <li>I feel like my eyes can never receive enough moisture, it must be the allergies where I live.</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical about trying this because I have tried many different products that were all too strong for my sensitive eye area.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for only a few days, but the skin around my eyes already feels a bit stronger, and the fine lines are definitely smoother.</li>
            <li>Before I ordered it I thought it was more like a thin cream, but it is not.</li>
            <li>Only down side is it can be a bit oily if you use too much.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to give a little TLC to their eyes.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now and have found that it doesn&#x27;t work to well under makeup during the day but it&#x27;s great for some real anti-oxidant repair at night. A tiny bit goes a very long way and I wish the pump didn&#x27;t squirt so much out no matter how careful I try to be. The skin under my eyes is softer and smoother and I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing less fine lines with continued use. I was a little surprised at how potent the lavender and patchouli is, however, because I use it at night the relaxing scent of lavender is perfect aromatherapy. Overall, great organic serum for eyes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for only a few days, but the skin around my eyes already feels a bit stronger, and the fine lines are definitely smoother. I&#x27;ve had dark circles under my eyes since forever (and due to irregular sleep, they weren&#x27;t getting any better), but the serum seems to be making them fade. The serum itself smells great. It&#x27;s also oily, so I just put it on at night. In the morning, I can really see the difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My product shipped about two days after purchasing. I would definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Have not used the serum very long but it seems to be working. Love how it makes my skin around the eyes feel.</li>
            <li> I wanted to find something organic and natural to help moisturize and minimize the severity of the fine lines I have developed underneath my eyes from smiling. I have only used the product once but, a few hours after the first application of the eye serum, the skin around my eyes feels much less tight/sensitive and the wrinkles do not look so severe. I am actually pretty surprised at the results that the product produced. My boyfriend also noticed a difference in the skin around my eyes, stating that I look less tired and that my skin looks softer in general. I would recommend the product to those who are worried about fine lines and/or are looking to moisturize and help the skin underneath/around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Being a woman of 50 and still trying to fight aging tooth and nail, I&#x27;m always looking for eye creams to help me with my fight.  LOL.  I don&#x27;t know if you women have tried looking for eye moisturizer, but there are not very many good ones out there.  What you must know is this is not a cream, it&#x27;s an oil.  It smells like lavander.  So it you don&#x27;t like the smell of lavander then you should not order this product.  But if you don&#x27;t mind the scent, then I would recommend the product.  I&#x27;ve paid lots of money for good eye creams, this product has beat them.  It smooths the lines, makes my eyes look more youthful, and help give my make up a more youthful glow.</li>
            <li> I bought it because it is organic and I like to buy stuff from the small companies to support them. there are few things that could be improved about this product. As it was said before the pump could give the smaller amount of serum,it doesn&#x27;t absorb well, so if I put as much as I get after sometime it somehow gets in to my eye and it starts to sting.so I think with few changes it would be a great product</li>
            <li> I have only used the product once and think its not for me.  My face is always oily from it so I desist from using it</li>
            <li> When I first tried this product, I was apprehensive because it is an oil. BUT once I learned to use it, I fell in love with it. It brightened my eyes and helped diminish the lines. Plus it lasted me a year!&lt;br /&gt;A few tips on how to use it:&lt;br /&gt;- Use half a pump&#x27;s worth! A little goes a long way. I use half a pump and it kept me from feeling oily and gross. When I accidentally put too much on, it was no issue to wipe it off&lt;br /&gt;- I used it morning and night, had no problems sleeping with it or wearing makeup&lt;br /&gt;- It does smell like lavender, so beware if you don&#x27;t like that smell</li>
            <li> Before I ordered it I thought it was more like a thin cream, but it is not. It is oil and smells not very good.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure I will keep using it or not. But dont buy it if you are not expecting oil serum.</li>
            <li> Other reviews mentioned the overpowering smell. Man were they correct! I couldn&#x27;t sleep the first couple weeks... The smell abates to a faint level after a couple months. Also read that you couldn&#x27;t easily meter the dose. Also true. I unscrew the top to get a smaller dose out. Seems to work okay if you don&#x27;t mind oil on your pillow.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to hydrate the area around my eyes. This product does exactly what it says. It reduces fine lines and hydrates. I was a little skeptical about trying this because I have tried many different products that were all too strong for my sensitive eye area. But, I am not disappointed with this at all and I will continue to purchase. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to give a little TLC to their eyes.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first because I thought it would be too oily, but it really absorbs quickly and works well under makeup. Very hydrating - works way better than any eye cream I have tried. Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> This is a little oily but I like this stuff. I have noticed a difference, but it is not an overnight cure. But a good product. No smell!</li>
            <li> I feel like my eyes can never receive enough moisture, it must be the allergies where I live. I reached a point where I thought I should just put oil underneath them. So I purchased this product and it certainly does the trick. I use this at night mostly, but I have used it in the morning too. I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> I love it and use it every night.  It makes skin a bit too greasy to use under make up.  My eyes look moisturized in the morning.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, no side effects as described by others. I use little tiny drop for both eyes avoiding applying it too close to the lash line. No skincare product should be applied too close to the lash line to avoid eye irritation.</li>
            <li> I bought this because all the reviews said it really worked at making the eye area look so much better.  I admit the first few nights I used it, the next day I did look much more rested.  After a few uses, though, I didn&#x27;t see much difference than before using it.  It is very oily so a little goes a long way and you must be careful that it doesn&#x27;t drip into the eyes when lying in bed.  I ended up going back to my eye cream for bedtime.</li>
            <li> The only problem i was having is it gets really oily and i already have oily skin but thats my fault. Overall besides that fact it works well and has a pleasant smell. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I used this for a few weeks, then back to my Burt&#x27;s Bees Eye Serum because I really didn&#x27;t like the sharp, alcohol smell.  That&#x27;s when I noticed how well it had been working.  My eyes were noticeably more wrinkled using Burt&#x27;s Bees.  I still don&#x27;t like the smell of this product, but it really works, and unlike Burt&#x27;s Bees, never breaks me out.</li>
            <li> Keeps eye area soft and moisturized.  Only down side is it can be a bit oily if you use too much.</li>
