            <li>I first purchased it to help with vertigo, and it does a great job easing that.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for.  </li>
            <li>It worked great at first, but the smell quickly dissipated.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a strong strong scent, this may not be it for you.</li>
            <li>Mild and lightly scented...</li>
            <li>Good quality Essential Oil.</li>
            <li>Pretty!</li>
            <li>Contrary to what another reviewer said, you DO have to pay more for a really good long lasting oil, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I am trying oils from multiple companies, some of them pretty expensive, and honestly just trying to find the ones that work best for me.</li>
            <li>Instead of walking around stinking of sulphur, I have a crisp citrus smell.</li>
            <li>Love citrus oils and this tangerine is terrific.</li>
            <li>It also seems to help with insomnia, most definitely soothes nerves and calms.  </li>
            <li>The Tangerine is light, not \\&quot;acidy\\&quot; smelling, and overall has exactly what I imagined it to be.</li>
            <li>But I am active and happy and just trying to deal with life on life&#x27;s terms, and the essential oils have helped so much.</li>
            <li>Recommend product very highly A+.</li>
            <li>I used it to scent my soap orange creamsicle pops and they smell just like the real thing.  </li>
            <li>If you read my reviews you probably think I&#x27;m about ready to fall apart.</li>
            <li>That really isn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li>Discovering the oils has really been a life saver.</li>
            <li>I add a few drops to my alomond oil to to give ot a nice smell.</li>
            <li>This oil is high quality.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately this was not as good as the Young Living Oil</li>
            <li>The product is not clean, not sure they add some chemicals to it as it is far from close to what a real, clean essential oil smells, feels and taste like.</li>
            <li>I would say that there is only one other company that I purchase from as much as PT</li>

            <li> highly recommended product, on a side note I found this tangerine oil to give a slight irritation when used in massive amounts compared to other brands, but it was so minor that I do not consider that to lessen the total overall score of the product.</li>
            <li> or if that behavior is expected.</li>
            <li> I had a toxic reaction to a prescription drug four years ago that short-circuited my central nervous system, causing nausea, insomnia, vertigo and peripheral nerve pain to name a few, and then morphed into a secondary syndrome, fibromyalgia.</li>
            <li> Not sure if its something I did</li>
            <li> With all the sugars and crap that are in water flavering packets this is a godsend.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells wonderful, very reasonable</li>
            <li> Mild and lightly scented...</li>
            <li> Depending on what you want to use this for, you may or may not like it.  I use it for relaxation at night/bedtime.  Unfortunately this was not as good as the Young Living Oil i have always bought.  While the scent is pleasing, it is thinner and does not last - I will go back to YL after this is gone.  Contrary to what another reviewer said, you DO have to pay more for a really good long lasting oil, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good quality.  Although I am not an expert it is working for what I need it for.</li>
            <li> One drop of this in a bottle of water is amazing. Especially for someone that doesn&#x27;t like water. With all the sugars and crap that are in water flavering packets this is a godsend.</li>
            <li> Only after learning, reading and researching I realized I made a big mistake buying essential oils from this company. The product is not clean, not sure they add some chemicals to it as it is far from close to what a real, clean essential oil smells, feels and taste like.</li>
            <li> Good price - good product. Arrived on time. I love the smell of this stuff. I use it in my home-made household cleaner (equal parts water/vinegar plus some drops of tangerine oil.)  Makes my house smell wonderful.</li>
            <li> It was cost effective and arrived on time.  What more could you ask for.  It smells great as well.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> We diffuse this in our home and it immediately makes you feel happy. It&#x27;s a great oil to use! Pretty!</li>
            <li> This oil is high quality. I used it to scent my soap orange creamsicle pops and they smell just like the real thing.  Good product!</li>
            <li> highly recommended product, on a side note I found this tangerine oil to give a slight irritation when used in massive amounts compared to other brands, but it was so minor that I do not consider that to lessen the total overall score of the product.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  I started buying tangerine oil to mix with a sulphur product I use to treat my psoriasis.  It covers up the smell perfectly.  Instead of walking around stinking of sulphur, I have a crisp citrus smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try and add a scent to a cosmetic. It worked great at first, but the smell quickly dissipated.  Not sure if its something I did or if that behavior is expected.</li>
            <li> Very nice! Trust Plant Therapy to provide top-notch service and high quality products.</li>
            <li> The Tangerine oil is amazing to me. Anything in the citrus family has proven to be a winner in our household. The Tangerine is light, not \\&quot;acidy\\&quot; smelling, and overall has exactly what I imagined it to be. Plant Therapy Tangerine is a must in my collection of EOs. If you are looking for a strong strong scent, this may not be it for you. If you are looking for an uplifting scent, try it!</li>
            <li> Love citrus oils and this tangerine is terrific. I first purchased it to help with vertigo, and it does a great job easing that. I now also use it for stomach aches, and sinuses. It smells absolutely incredible. It also seems to help with insomnia, most definitely soothes nerves and calms.  If you read my reviews you probably think I&#x27;m about ready to fall apart. That really isn&#x27;t the case. I had a toxic reaction to a prescription drug four years ago that short-circuited my central nervous system, causing nausea, insomnia, vertigo and peripheral nerve pain to name a few, and then morphed into a secondary syndrome, fibromyalgia. But I am active and happy and just trying to deal with life on life&#x27;s terms, and the essential oils have helped so much. Discovering the oils has really been a life saver. I am trying oils from multiple companies, some of them pretty expensive, and honestly just trying to find the ones that work best for me. I have had great luck with Plant Therapy on most of their oils. Some of the more expensive brands have oils that didn&#x27;t do a thing therapeutically, didn&#x27;t hold their scent, last long or all of the above. I would say that there is only one other company that I purchase from as much as PT and they do not sell on Amazon.</li>
            <li> great smell, convenient dropper. I add a few drops to my alomond oil to to give ot a nice smell.</li>
            <li> Good quality Essential Oil. Good service and item packaged well for protection of glass jar. Recommend product very highly A+.</li>
