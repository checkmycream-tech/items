            <li>I recommend it to people who have never tried this kind of makeup and as a travel size on the go makeup.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a difference either way to be honest.</li>

            <li>Not as magical as advertised.</li>
            <li>I love bareminerals that&#x27;s why I ordered this product</li>
            <li>Great and shipped fast</li>

            <li>it will order more....</li>
            <li>is ok.</li>
            <li>I started out with this and kind of laughed because I thought it wouldn&#x27;t even last me a week.</li>
            <li>the box can literally fit in the palm of your hand and you can get free samples from Ulta</li>
            <li>This product is cheap and looks cheap upon arrival.  </li>
            <li>sephora even gives you a free mini makeover.</li>
            <li>Love, love ,love bare minerals!</li>
            <li>They are small but the perfect size to stick in the purse or travel.</li>
            <li>The product is great but the size of the containers isn&#x27;t what my wife expected.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten a starter kit before from Macy&#x27;s, and it was full sized items with full sized brushes.</li>
            <li>Light and stays on and makes me feel pretty.</li>
            <li>Bare minerals is a great product but the size of the pods were much smaller than they lead you to believe..</li>
            <li>Love bare minerals.</li>
            <li>Great product came quick just did not read the description well and was shock to see them smurf size seriously</li>
            <li>, the product is great to use on the face but next time I&#x27;ll purchase a bigger kit i guess.</li>
            <li>Very natural looking and light on the skin.</li>
            <li>I went to Ulta and found the right product, which includes more items for the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used bareMinerals products.  </li>
            <li>The products are light yet covers well and makes my complexion look young.  </li>
            <li>She can go to our local mall and by the starter kit for about $15 more and the containers are five times the size.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had pretty skin</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>All stores which carry bare mineral makeup should color match you for free.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I have average complexion--nothing troublesome to cover, however after application I looked like I had no makeup on</li>
            <li>but the product runs out too fast</li>
            <li>Products are decent, but what a rip off.</li>
            <li>Item was smaller than expected but am satisfied.</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting the same thing, but what came was 3 teeny tiny sample sized products that I could&#x27;ve gotten for free at a make up</li>
            <li>Got it earlier than expected, was what I had expected and the product is good.</li>
            <li>When I realized my supply was running low and didn&#x27;t have time to stop by the store I decided to browse my Amazon Prime fast shipping options.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li>It will really last you about one month depending on how much coverage you want.</li>
            <li>but, maybe that&#x27;s a technique problem on my part-I&#x27;m new to bare minierals.</li>
            <li>I was able to go to my local Ulta Store and get this product in a hard case and in bigger product sizes for $49 well worth the extra $9.</li>
            <li>You barely get any product, I realize it is a starter kit, but you don&#x27;t really get enough to judge it</li>
            <li>I usually burn threw makeup so fast that within a few weeks I find myself having to go back to the beauty store to get more.</li>
            <li>I made the switch to Bare Minerals and will never leave.</li>

            <li> Much smaller than expected!</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was skeptical of using bare minerals because it didn&#x27;t look like much.</li>
            <li> Well a month and a half later</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t use very much so it is too expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this could be considered the 30 day starter pack when the box barely holds a few products.  </li>
            <li> I was not pleased with this purchase as I felt the size of the products were very small and the price was a bit high.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the price.</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH MONEY</li>
            <li> They are very small as in mini sizes, I was expecting a bit bigger size!</li>
            <li> doesnt feel heavy.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  </li>
            <li> Quite disappointed in that especially for the big amount I paid :/&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ridiculously small sizes for the money!  </li>
            <li> Very small containers, but will give it another chance</li>
            <li> What was really annoying is that on the package it was clearly marked $22 and they sold it to me for $35 something?</li>
            <li> Just wish it wasn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> I have been using BareMinerals for almost 2 years now and I &amp;#34;assumed&amp;#34; for the price I was paying, I was getting what I would get from Ulta but living out in the sticks now, unable to purchase locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, I was giving this item as a gift for an exchange and the box looked like someone had kicked it around for hours and was badly beat up.  </li>
            <li> but when I opened the package, I was disappointed on the sizing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Deeply disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the quantity for the price.</li>
            <li> The color and coverage were horrible.</li>

            <li> Not as magical as advertised. Very small containers, but will give it another chance</li>
            <li> Not worth the price. Buy the larger kit instead.</li>
            <li> Tiny sample package. Definitely not worth the price. The color and coverage were horrible.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item, it did arrived on time but when I opened the package, I was disappointed on the sizing. They are very small as in mini sizes, I was expecting a bit bigger size! It doesn&#x27;t look like a miniature size on the pictures. I did not want to pay $35 for this so I returned it for a refund. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love bareminerals that&#x27;s why I ordered this product but I didn&#x27;t read the part that say SAMPLE SIZE or I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this. the box can literally fit in the palm of your hand and you can get free samples from Ulta</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used bareMinerals products.  The products are light yet covers well and makes my complexion look young.  I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great product came quick just did not read the description well and was shock to see them smurf size seriously the smallest brushes and containers I have ever seen  Oh well product is awesome</li>
            <li> Love it! received it on time however, it&#x27;s very different from the pictures! It appears to be much bigger in the photos but when I received it..It was sample size..Quite disappointed in that especially for the big amount I paid :/&lt;br /&gt;however, the product is great to use on the face but next time I&#x27;ll purchase a bigger kit i guess.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this makeup! Got it earlier than expected, was what I had expected and the product is good.</li>
            <li> THIS IS TINY  NOT WORTH MONEY</li>
            <li> Love, love ,love bare minerals!</li>
            <li> Much smaller than expected! Very disappointed with the quantity for the price. Box says $22 but i paid $33 plus shipping! Containers are the size of eyeshadow!</li>
            <li> Deceiving was only trial size. Could have gotten fullsize in local store for same price. Won&#x27;t order again</li>
            <li> Great and shipped fast</li>
            <li> great buy for 30 day trial. works well with oily skin. doesnt feel heavy. color great. would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Delivery on date specified, however I felt it took too long. Item was smaller than expected but am satisfied. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This product is cheap and looks cheap upon arrival.  I was able to go to my local Ulta Store and get this product in a hard case and in bigger product sizes for $49 well worth the extra $9.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with this purchase as I felt the size of the products were very small and the price was a bit high. I would not recommend purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a mistake when it came in the mail. I have gotten a starter kit before from Macy&#x27;s, and it was full sized items with full sized brushes. I thought I was getting the same thing, but what came was 3 teeny tiny sample sized products that I could&#x27;ve gotten for free at a make up counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total rip off. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> I have used bareminerals exclusively for about a year now. When I realized my supply was running low and didn&#x27;t have time to stop by the store I decided to browse my Amazon Prime fast shipping options.  What I thought I was purchasing was not what ended up arriving to my door. $40 for sample size - literally the sample Ulta gives you with your purchase - is what this kit is composed of. Should have listened to the tiny reviews. :-/&lt;br /&gt;Feel ripped off!</li>
            <li> Best make up ever worn</li>
            <li> Honestly, I have average complexion--nothing troublesome to cover, however after application I looked like I had no makeup on and I really like a flawless look and got none.</li>
            <li> Bare minerals is a great product but the size of the pods were much smaller than they lead you to believe.. What was really annoying is that on the package it was clearly marked $22 and they sold it to me for $35 something? Atleast take the sticker off if you&#x27;re going to rip me off!!</li>
            <li> Love bare minerals. Light and stays on and makes me feel pretty. Just wish it wasn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> The product is great but the size of the containers isn&#x27;t what my wife expected.  She can go to our local mall and by the starter kit for about $15 more and the containers are five times the size. The make up is great but we won&#x27;t be buying from here again</li>
            <li> These are SAMPLE sizes. I have been using BareMinerals for almost 2 years now and I &amp;#34;assumed&amp;#34; for the price I was paying, I was getting what I would get from Ulta but living out in the sticks now, unable to purchase locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deeply disappointed.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  You barely get any product, I realize it is a starter kit, but you don&#x27;t really get enough to judge it</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was skeptical of using bare minerals because it didn&#x27;t look like much. I usually burn threw makeup so fast that within a few weeks I find myself having to go back to the beauty store to get more. I started out with this and kind of laughed because I thought it wouldn&#x27;t even last me a week. Well a month and a half later and I still have plenty left. This make up is awesome. I&#x27;ve never had pretty skin but my complexion looked amazing and my skin just glows. I love this product!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Much much smaller than what I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> I like it but the product runs out too fast and I don&#x27;t use very much so it is too expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> Love it love it will order more....</li>
            <li> package was destroyed when it arrived</li>
            <li> Ridiculously small sizes for the money!  Products are decent, but what a rip off.</li>
            <li> I made the switch to Bare Minerals and will never leave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how this could be considered the 30 day starter pack when the box barely holds a few products.

Not sure if this is normal or something that happened during processing.</li>
            <li> Bare Minerals is the best!</li>
            <li> Good set for the value. The powders are pretty small. It will really last you about one month depending on how much coverage you want. I have cystic acne and the product does not cover the acne all the way. It is a very good product though. Very natural looking and light on the skin. I recommend that you get color matched before buying the product. All stores which carry bare mineral makeup should color match you for free. sephora even gives you a free mini makeover. No appointment needed. I like that this set comes with 2 brushes. They are small but the perfect size to stick in the purse or travel. I would buy this product again. I recommend it to people who have never tried this kind of makeup and as a travel size on the go makeup.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try it out. I have olive skin and the color match is ok. The coverage I get isn&#x27;t great but, maybe that&#x27;s a technique problem on my part-I&#x27;m new to bare minierals. It does appear natrural on my skin. I don&#x27;t see the &amp;#34;dewy glow&amp;#34; they refer to in the ads though. I&#x27;ve appled the make-up with and without the primer...I don&#x27;t see a difference either way to be honest. My biggest complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last a whole work day (mind you I do work 12 hr shifts) but, even after 8 hrs I feel like there is a difference and I&#x27;d like to see it last longer, especially after using a primer and following all of the application steps.</li>
