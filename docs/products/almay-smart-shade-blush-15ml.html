            <li>I am admittedly extremely fair skinned.  </li>
            <li>This color is really good for my skin color which is a light/medium.</li>
            <li>color is amazing-</li>
            <li>nice to be able to find it.</li>
            <li>However, it is so very light as to be almost</li>
            <li>I love this product; used for years.</li>
            <li>no matter how many times you apply it.  </li>
            <li>have been using this for a couple of years and was so glad to find it for purchase on Amazon.</li>
            <li>If I need more color- as at night</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using this product for a number of reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased to find it on AMAZON!!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I love it because it looks so</li>
            <li>Goes on easy, smooth, natural, blends perfect.  </li>
            <li>So glad to see available online.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li>Easy to blend.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li>Easy to find.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, I assumed this smart-shade blush would be a light shade.  </li>
            <li>This creamy product blends into my skin smoothly and easily, and I like the fact that the results suit  my natural coloring so well.  </li>
            <li>This is by far my all time favorite blush.</li>
            <li>extra effect lightly dust a sparkly neutral shade on top</li>
            <li>It is just the right shade and consistency.</li>
            <li>Using both products in tandem works better than using only one of them.</li>
            <li>I refresh my makeup I refresh with almay Smart Shade Blush.</li>
            <li>Really like this blush which is cream rather than something you have to apply with a brush.  </li>
            <li>Love the smart shade blushes in Natural, Pink, and Berry.  </li>
            <li>It is not a clear gel, but rather a 2-part creme, but it blends in a great way, and the color is subtle and not fake looking at all.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth and looks so natural that I thought it would be a big hit.</li>
            <li>And although it goes on very smoothly and easily it&#x27;s a waste of effort.</li>
            <li>or when I&#x27;m going out - I brush a little powder blush on top.  </li>
            <li>I apply a small amount after my day moisturizing cream and it adds a nice soft blush  to my cheeks.</li>
            <li>but overall i really like it.</li>
            <li>This may have either been old or sat in a hot warehouse for too long.</li>
            <li>it is a pretty pink shade, but is a little light.</li>
            <li>there is a pink cream and a darker liquid in the tube which come out together to make an easy application of blush color lasting all day long.</li>
            <li>A little dab gives just the right color, making rosy cheeks that perk up your face.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Too watery. It doesn&#x27;t seem to ever mix well enough to use no matter how hard or long I shake it. This may have either been old or sat in a hot warehouse for too long. Had to just throw away.</li>
            <li> I love this product; used for years. I apply a small amount after my day moisturizing cream and it adds a nice soft blush  to my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Love the smart shade blushes in Natural, Pink, and Berry.  Use the Natural or Pink in the daytime, the berry at night.  Will definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> Very difficult to find. This is by far my all time favorite blush. It&#x27;s creamy but not liquid and powders are so dry hate those. I bought a dozen because I cannot find this anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the thing.... I am admittedly extremely fair skinned.  Therefore, I assumed this smart-shade blush would be a light shade.  However, it is so very light as to be almost invisible-- no matter how many times you apply it.  And although it goes on very smoothly and easily it&#x27;s a waste of effort.</li>
            <li> nice to be able to find it.</li>
            <li> have been using this for a couple of years and was so glad to find it for purchase on Amazon. Not available locally</li>
            <li> I love the product!!!!!!!!!  This blush gives me what I want in my daily makeup.  Each time  I refresh my makeup I refresh with almay Smart Shade Blush.</li>
            <li> This color is really good for my skin color which is a light/medium. My only complaint is that is seems to fade a little fast. I don&#x27;t know if it is because of summer so the sweat and whatnot but overall i really like it.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this blush...it is a pretty pink shade, but is a little light. I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> Gives your face a great glow wore it today to the doctors office she told me how great and healthy I looked.</li>
            <li> I am sorry that this product is no longer made.</li>
            <li> Really like this blush which is cream rather than something you have to apply with a brush.  Can&#x27;t find it in stores.  So glad to see available online.  A little dab gives just the right color, making rosy cheeks that perk up your face.</li>
            <li> This creamy product blends into my skin smoothly and easily, and I like the fact that the results suit  my natural coloring so well.  I&#x27;m very fair and so often my blush is just too dark. The results here are very natural and give my face a color without seeming artificial.  If I need more color- as at night or when I&#x27;m going out - I brush a little powder blush on top.  Using both products in tandem works better than using only one of them.</li>
            <li> Almay products are hypo- allergenic and I can wear the blush and it does not irritate my skin. It is just the right shade and consistency.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this product for a number of reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1.  Easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Easy to blend.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Works for any skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;4.  A small amount goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;5.  Hence, it lasts quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;6.  Not expensive.&lt;br /&gt;7.  Easy to find.  (That is up &#x27;til now.)</li>
            <li> this is the best blush I have ever used. Goes on easy, smooth, natural, blends perfect.  I am very happy with it and with the color.</li>
            <li> In striving to get make-up to ENHANCE, instead of alter or make a glaring change I found this to be very satisfactory as as small an amount as desired can be used for any look.</li>
            <li> Very good product. tough, durable and economical to use that I give. 100 percent recommended for the purchase of this product.</li>
            <li> It is not a clear gel, but rather a 2-part creme, but it blends in a great way, and the color is subtle and not fake looking at all.</li>
            <li> Promptly shipped and happy to find this as Almay has discontinued this product.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff but I gather it is being discontinued. It goes on so smooth and looks so natural that I thought it would be a big hit.</li>
            <li> I was told this was discontinued- I was pleased to find it on AMAZON!!&lt;br /&gt;The color is amazing- there is a pink cream and a darker liquid in the tube which come out together to make an easy application of blush color lasting all day long. I love it because it looks so natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For extra effect lightly dust a sparkly neutral shade on top</li>
