            <li>Made the Wife happy!</li>
            <li>It is delicious and musky.</li>
            <li>Eden&#x27;s Garden is wonderful, as is their service.</li>
            <li>But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
            <li>I found this product  to be very good.</li>
            <li>happy wife, happy life!</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Works great in my soaps and creams.</li>
            <li>I have used the oil, and it smells great.</li>
            <li>Great product line</li>
            <li>If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you!</li>
            <li>I think it is a good quality oil.</li>
            <li>I loved this.</li>
            <li>good price and speedy delivery</li>
            <li>It is an amazing oil.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve discovered the many valuable uses.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and it feels soothing.</li>
            <li>I mix with almost everything, body cream, lotions and more.</li>
            <li>Will buy more as needed.</li>
            <li>I have used oils extensively and these are superb.</li>
            <li>Good product not as strong as Doterra but not bad for the price</li>
            <li>Edens Gardens oils are high quality with a great price point.  </li>
            <li>Packaged nicely and arrived quick</li>
            <li>But, I do feel that each essential oil is good for us in some way and serves a good purpose, so, I am not writing this one off.</li>
            <li>This company offers quality oils for a great price.</li>
            <li>bought this product to use on my hands...will admit product has a strong smell but seems to be working.</li>
            <li>We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making quality products that can help in so many ways.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s interesting, just kind of bitter, though.</li>
            <li>Thank you for getting my order out quickly and packaging it well.</li>
            <li>That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just my own personal opinion.</li>
            <li>Am I right fella&#x27;s?</li>
            <li>Yeah I&#x27;m right.</li>
            <li>The price was right for my budget.  </li>
            <li>It is also very reasonably priced</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Eden&#x27;s Garden quality had not failed me yet</li>
            <li>I am not a dealer, do not know anyone associated with this company, do not work in this industry and am given nothing for giving positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I am new to essential oils, but have been completely satisfied with the Eden&#x27;s Garden oils I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>Placing the items in a box and diffusing the essential oils has helped control the odors tremendously!</li>
            <li>This nutmeg is so intense, one drop added to you massage oil</li>
            <li>and it comes alive with this wonderfull fresh ground scent.</li>
            <li>This has such a fantastic scent, I can&#x27;t wait to use in my home during the fall and experiment with mixing with cinammon and clove.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again EG.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this one much yet.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them side by side with much more expensive oils and they hold their own, no difference.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them to clean and disinfect my home, make my own air fresheners and bath salts, and have even used some lavender to help calm my dogs down when they&#x27;ve been anxious.</li>
            <li>Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers.</li>
            <li>Smells a bit too much like &#x27;musty old house&#x27; than anything like putting nutmeg in a pan and simmering it on low</li>
            <li>I just am not sure I care for this particular oil so much.</li>

            <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living.</li>

            <li> Perfect for the diffuser for fall</li>
            <li> I use it in my toothpaste and we like it. I think it is a good quality oil.</li>
            <li> The product is excellent. Exactly as expected. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> smelled the house up real good! Made the Wife happy! happy wife, happy life! Am I right fella&#x27;s? Yeah I&#x27;m right.</li>
            <li> I am new to essential oils, but have been completely satisfied with the Eden&#x27;s Garden oils I&#x27;ve purchased. I bought them for making blends to improve overall health and wellness and while doing so I&#x27;ve discovered the many valuable uses. I&#x27;ve used them to clean and disinfect my home, make my own air fresheners and bath salts, and have even used some lavender to help calm my dogs down when they&#x27;ve been anxious. After doing some research on how to manage Reynaud&#x27;s Syndrome (a circulatory abnormality that effects the extremities, especially in the cold, winter months), nutmeg oil was recommended (along with geranium). I have used it as part of a blend and rubbed it on my fingers and toes to alleviate symptoms. I love the scent and it feels soothing. Thanks for making quality products that can help in so many ways. I will be buying again!</li>
            <li> Good product not as strong as Doterra but not bad for the price</li>
            <li> I loved this. It is delicious and musky. I mix with almost everything, body cream, lotions and more. It is also very reasonably priced</li>
            <li> Smells a bit too much like &#x27;musty old house&#x27; than anything like putting nutmeg in a pan and simmering it on low... sorry...</li>
            <li> good price and speedy delivery</li>
            <li> Received this very quickly to help a friend who&#x27;s hands get cold and fall asleep.  Rubbing this essential oil on them has increased her circulation and made her smell yummy!</li>
            <li> The result of using nutmeg in any spray results in a holiday-scent that fills the house. Will buy more as needed.</li>
            <li> just started will update</li>
            <li> I found this product  to be very good.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance. Just wondering if an oil should it not be thicker?</li>
            <li> Eden&#x27;s Garden is wonderful, as is their service. I just am not sure I care for this particular oil so much. I will use it for it&#x27;s medicinal purposes, but as for the smell, I find it somewhat bitter. It&#x27;s just my own personal opinion. But, I do feel that each essential oil is good for us in some way and serves a good purpose, so, I am not writing this one off. The smell isn&#x27;t bad. It&#x27;s interesting, just kind of bitter, though.</li>

            <li> This company offers quality oils for a great price. I&#x27;ve used them side by side with much more expensive oils and they hold their own, no difference.  I use for health, cleaning and aromatic purposes and have not been disappointed. I have used oils extensively and these are superb. Will continue to purchase from Edens Garden if they have what I need. I am not a dealer, do not know anyone associated with this company, do not work in this industry and am given nothing for giving positive reviews.</li>
            <li> This has such a fantastic scent, I can&#x27;t wait to use in my home during the fall and experiment with mixing with cinammon and clove.  Edens Gardens oils are high quality with a great price point.  I haven&#x27;t been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works great in my soaps and creams.</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells divine! Thanks again EG.</li>
            <li> Our library receives books that sometimes reek of bad odors, including cigarette smoke.  Placing the items in a box and diffusing the essential oils has helped control the odors tremendously!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I received the item before the date promised.  It was well packaged.  The price was right for my budget.  I have used the oil, and it smells great.</li>
            <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this one much yet.  I got it for diffusing and it smells just like it should. Eden&#x27;s Garden quality had not failed me yet and I buy a lot of their oils.</li>
            <li> Thank you for getting my order out quickly and packaging it well. It is an amazing oil. Great product line</li>
            <li> I am using this product in conjunction with several other products that is supposed to help with the symptoms of endometriosis. I am not sure if it is helping yet.</li>
            <li> bought this product to use on my hands...will admit product has a strong smell but seems to be working. Packaged nicely and arrived quick</li>
