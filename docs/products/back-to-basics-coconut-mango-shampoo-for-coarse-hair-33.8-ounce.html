            <li>This is my absolute favorite shampoo!</li>
            <li>It is great for hair that needs extra moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product for thick course hair - use it with conditioner, gives you a full, clean and  beautiful look.</li>
            <li>When i received the package very shortly after ordering it i was even more thrilled....</li>
            <li>great if your hair is really dry.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great for my friend that has to wash her hair every day because it doesn&#x27;t dry it out</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel clean at all</li>
            <li>I was able to find it here at a reasonable price as it has been discontinued.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner (but the conditioner is just waaaay too much money), so I use the shampoo everyday and my hair always smells so good!</li>
            <li>Have used this product before but had not seen it in a retail outlet for a long time, glad to find it still available</li>
            <li>This shampoo is tough to find locally now so being able to purchase online is wonderful.</li>
            <li>but at a fraction of the price it&#x27;s still good, just has a slightly sharper smell.</li>
            <li>I have curly, heavy, course hair and have used the coconut mango shampoo for many years and absolutely love how it makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell, doesn&#x27;t dry hair out, and leaves hair shiny to boot.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair super soft, yet full.</li>
            <li>I love Back to Basics products for my hair.</li>
            <li>I love Back to Basics products.</li>
            <li>I really REALLY miss their hairspray!</li>
            <li>I was a bit disappointed because the two bottles that I had ordered seemed to have some skimmed off the top - not just due to &amp;#34;settling&amp;#34; but actually filled a good two inches from the top.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for carrying it in your warehouse.  </li>
            <li>I suppose it is just too much grease for my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the shampoo and the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this shampoo and the way it cleans your hair, leaving a great smell behind.</li>
            <li>Love Back to Basic Mango shampoo.</li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s a good thing, at least I don&#x27;t feel tempted to drink it!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The large bottle last me a very long time and is well worth the price!!</li>
            <li>My only wish would be for the company to go back to making that shampoo, because the cost of it now is huge.</li>
            <li>I just Love it and it is getting hard to find.</li>
            <li>The only shampoo I&#x27;ve found so far that leaves my hair feeling clean, not greasy, oily or dry.</li>
            <li>Frankly, I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference, but I do like the big bottle.</li>
            <li>Needless to say i didn&#x27;t pay only $5.00 for the beloved hair products.</li>
            <li>Since it is no longer available on the market, I was glad to find it, but still disappointed with the sender.</li>
            <li>A little more expensive than some shampoos, but well worth it.   </li>

            <li> You never have a dry scalp using them.</li>
            <li> Coconut Mango Shampoo is for course and dry hair.  </li>
            <li> See previous review on the regular hair product.  </li>
            <li> You only need to use a little</li>
            <li> I only use a small amount to shampoo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it four stars because I&#x27;m assuming most of my disappointment comes from the fact that I have hard water flowing through the taps in my area.</li>
            <li> and they clump up heavily when they dry, even if I use a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and coarse.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;And since it&#x27;s nearly impossible to find Back to Basics products anymore... I have to do a little plug for my new obession!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo and conditioner exclusively for the past 20 years.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that even though my scalp did develop that residue and itching after using pureology, this shampoo is not better than pureology.</li>
            <li> It is creamy, leaving my thick, wavy hair smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> thick &amp; goopy, probably expired 10 yrs ago!  </li>
            <li> If you have never experienced Anara Spa&#x27;s product they are to DIE for!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was a sad attempt to discard the evidence.</li>
            <li> and it just sad.</li>
            <li> I am very sad that this product has been discontinued.  </li>
            <li> To bad you cant buy this product at the beauty shops</li>
            <li> : (&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really hate the mfg has discontinued this product.</li>
            <li> i have used these products for 15 years and was very disappointed when i found out that the line was discontinued.</li>

            <li> Love Back to Basic Mango shampoo. It lathers well and smells great and is light on your hair. To bad you cant buy this product at the beauty shops anymore thank you amazon for carrying a product that i love.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this shampoo and the way it cleans your hair, leaving a great smell behind. I will be ordering more when this nice large bottle is finished.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like waking up in the tropics. I came for the the coconuts and stayed for the mango. I&#x27;ve ordered this shampoo exclusively for 4 years now. It does the trick every time.</li>
            <li> i found this conditioner while in marshalls one time. it smells great, i get compliments on my hair all the time and makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> The only shampoo I&#x27;ve found so far that leaves my hair feeling clean, not greasy, oily or dry. I only use a small amount to shampoo and I have long hair. A little more expensive than some shampoos, but well worth it.   On top of all that, I love the smell!</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair super soft, yet full. And the smell. OMG!! The delicious smell lasts for hours on your hair. I get compliments all the time!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo and conditioner exclusively for the past 20 years.  It is creamy, leaving my thick, wavy hair smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I have since started to color my hair and it is color safe too.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Not quite as nice smelling as the Coco Mango line from Anara Spa (Grand Hyatt, Kauai, HI) but at a fraction of the price it&#x27;s still good, just has a slightly sharper smell. Maybe that&#x27;s a good thing, at least I don&#x27;t feel tempted to drink it! I&#x27;ll just have to stock up on the Anara products next time we&#x27;re in Hawaii. If you have never experienced Anara Spa&#x27;s product they are to DIE for! My wife actually had to restrain me from spending over $40 + shipping from HI - FedEx Air, no ground shipping obviously - for a comparable bottle of Coco Mango so I had to settle and this will have to do in the meantime.</li>
            <li> I love Back to Basics products for my hair. You never have a dry scalp using them. Coconut Mango scent is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shampoo, and it is out of production.  Thanks for carrying it in your warehouse.  We&#x27;ll be sure to buy more.</li>
            <li> i have used these products for 15 years and was very disappointed when i found out that the line was discontinued. Searching for it online and finding it..i was thrilled.  When i received the package very shortly after ordering it i was even more thrilled....however upon inspecting the product i found (peeled off) a $5.00 big lots pricetag stuck to the bottom of the bottles.&lt;br /&gt;It was a sad attempt to discard the evidence. Needless to say i didn&#x27;t pay only $5.00 for the beloved hair products.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance.  My hair is thick and coarse.  This shampoo gets sudsy and seems to do the job. Wish they sold it in a smaller size for travel purposes.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for thick course hair - use it with conditioner, gives you a full, clean and  beautiful look. I&#x27;m 62 and use it daily.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner (but the conditioner is just waaaay too much money), so I use the shampoo everyday and my hair always smells so good!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best shampoos on the market and it has been discontinued.  It is great for hair that needs extra moisturizing.  The shipment was timely and wrapped properly!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this product smells great and leaves my hair soft . why do they discontinue great products!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  However, I thought I was ordering the conditioner.  I really hate the mfg has discontinued this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product I wish they didn&#x27;t go out of business and it just sad. All their products were always awesome.</li>
            <li> Great price.  Smells great and leaves my hair feeling clean and silky.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  My only wish would be for the company to go back to making that shampoo, because the cost of it now is huge.</li>
            <li> great if your hair is really dry. it doesn&#x27;t rinse out all your oils so if your hair is oily, you&#x27;ll come out of the shower and your hair might still seem oily. it&#x27;s great for my friend that has to wash her hair every day because it doesn&#x27;t dry it out</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great and makes your hair very soft.  We like to use it with their condition product as well.</li>
            <li> I have curly, heavy, course hair and have used the coconut mango shampoo for many years and absolutely love how it makes my hair feel.  It is so much more managable.  My hair-dresser can no longer get this product, so I&#x27;m extremely happy to see it available here.  The large bottle last me a very long time and is well worth the price!!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  It has a great smell and leaves my hair soft and shiny.  I was able to find it here at a reasonable price as it has been discontinued.  You only need to use a little so I will make this bottle last.</li>
            <li> I used for a while and liked the way the product smells, but I switched to something I liked better.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed because the two bottles that I had ordered seemed to have some skimmed off the top - not just due to &amp;#34;settling&amp;#34; but actually filled a good two inches from the top.  Since it is no longer available on the market, I was glad to find it, but still disappointed with the sender.</li>
            <li> I used to love this product but now it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel like silk. My hair tangles easier now then before. I feel like they out something else in it since it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> Back to Basics Coconut Mango Shampoo is for course and dry hair.  Amazon is the only place I can find it.  Thank you Amazon, my search is over and I can quit purchasing products which do not work.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, doesn&#x27;t dry hair out, and leaves hair shiny to boot. This shampoo is tough to find locally now so being able to purchase online is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Have used this product before but had not seen it in a retail outlet for a long time, glad to find it still available</li>
            <li> thick &amp; goopy, probably expired 10 yrs ago!  took about a month to receive.  awfull shipping</li>
            <li> I have to say that even though my scalp did develop that residue and itching after using pureology, this shampoo is not better than pureology. I suppose it is just too much grease for my hair. It doesn&#x27;t feel clean at all and they clump up heavily when they dry, even if I use a blow dryer. The scent is off the charts, though. I&#x27;m giving it four stars because I&#x27;m assuming most of my disappointment comes from the fact that I have hard water flowing through the taps in my area.</li>
            <li> I love Back to Basics products. I really REALLY miss their hairspray! This shampoo is great and the Coconut Mango is delish on my hair! Four stars for the price. : (&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And since it&#x27;s nearly impossible to find Back to Basics products anymore... I have to do a little plug for my new obession! Philosophy 3 in 1 shampoo-shower gel-bubble bath. True love indeed!</li>
            <li> This is great shampoo!</li>
            <li> I really like the shampoo and the conditioner. It smells wonderful and it makes my hair smooth and soft. Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> See previous review on the regular hair product.  This is listed &amp;#34;for coarse hair&amp;#34; and, as I&#x27;m about 20% gray, my hair is coarser than it used to be.  Frankly, I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference, but I do like the big bottle.</li>
            <li> I am very sad that this product has been discontinued.  I have used it for years.  I just Love it and it is getting hard to find.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite shampoo! I use it everyday and it makes my hair soft and manageable. I love it.</li>
            <li> I love that coconut mango smell...it is always summer on a tropical island when you use this stuff.  I wish they still made it.</li>
