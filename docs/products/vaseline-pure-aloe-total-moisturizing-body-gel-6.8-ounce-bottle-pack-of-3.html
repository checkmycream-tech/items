            <li>My grandfather must be so pleased.</li>
            <li>Great to put on instead of lotion when you are hot out of the shower and do not want to feel the effect of being hot the lotion all over you!!</li>
            <li>It smells super refreshing too.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel cool  and smooth.</li>
            <li>I put on after I take showers on thoes hott days to keep myself cool from the heat.</li>
            <li>Feels cool and is healing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own natural oils underneath the layer of gel.</li>
            <li>Smells clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I use this product as an aftershave because it doesn&#x27;t burn life aftershaves with alcohol in the ingredients; plus, it dries quickly without being sticky.  </li>
            <li>It smell very light and fresh and keeps your skin soft, he even uses it on his face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great for after sunburns but also for everyday moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing more beautiful than natural skin and this gel is coooool, makes my skin extra soft, even improves the condition of my skin and not expensive.</li>
            <li>This product works great on dry skin, makes your skin very soft after it soaks in.</li>
            <li>and it reads in large font \\&quot;aloe fresh moisturizing\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The smell is fresh clean and natural.</li>
            <li>but he always asks for this exact one.  </li>
            <li>It sounds yucky but he lived a very healthy life till the age of eighty five or eighty six and took no medications for any medical complaints till he was alive.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice, yet subtle scent and is very soothing on skin.</li>
            <li>I would love to use this on hot summer days and most of the year where I live, but this products has parabens in it, so marketing as natural is pretty dishonest.</li>
            <li>anything is very good.！&lt;br /&gt;beautiful</li>
            <li>Back to old faithful Hawaiian Tropic Cool Aloe I.C.E. With Lidocaine for me!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>and then large letters \\&quot;100% natural aloe vera</li>
            <li>For real sensitive skin, this Vaseline Aloe Gel is a God-send.  </li>
            <li>I went to apply some \\&quot;Vaseline 100% natural aloe vera gel\\&quot; someone had for me for a sunburn i got after using Burt&#x27;s Bees 30spf sunscreen which did absolutely nothing, and took a close look at the label</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first about trying this product,  but it actually helped me feel more refreshed,  &amp; cool during the summer heat &amp; humidity.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes all day and the scent is light enough to blend with my other perfumes</li>
            <li>I am originally from India settled in the USA and my grandfather who has now been dead for about thirty three years used to mix Aloe Vera in his food and eat it.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used 3 bottles of it on nightly applications over the past year, it has such a refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>but she still finds a blanket to lay on washed in the old detergent, but applying the gel helps her calm down until I can get her bathed.</li>
            <li>Being a person with hypersensitive skin there is very little I can use that is available in the market nowadays.</li>
            <li>Only used it twice so far.</li>
            <li>Aloe Vera is my &amp;#34;go to guy or girl&amp;#34; and is my only and complete make up.</li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t even tell you have it on after it dries, but I&#x27;m just not sure how moisturizing it really is?</li>
            <li> I like to work outside, plus run and bicycle long distances, and I just like using this product afterwards for sunburns and dry</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t take long to dry.</li>
            <li> I have tried buying him other things that are similar</li>
            <li> a couple mins to dry</li>
            <li> have an aloe plant, but a child had a rash so bad that I used most of it up, which necessitated the purchase of this.  </li>
            <li> My only problem is that I think (even at a little over $5 a bottle) it&#x27;s a little pricey...</li>
            <li> I feel like my skin is dry a few hours after applying.</li>
            <li> Vera is also known for properties of healing, dark circle reduction, blemish reduction and to some extent controlling breakouts and acne.</li>
            <li> She calmed down immediately.  </li>
            <li> This is watered down aloe vera juice re-gelled with a bunch of chemicals and fragrances.</li>
            <li> little pricey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I order it in bulk, he uses it everyday.  </li>
            <li> unlike other aloes for after sun this doesn&#x27;t have alcohol in it, which can be drying, and not good for everyday moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> i usually put it on my face instead of lotion.</li>
            <li> Those first three ingredients are crap, they dont do anything.</li>
            <li> Any packaged product that uses: (all)natural, holistic, organic, chemical-free, unprocessed, hypo-allergenic, green, eco-friendly, sustainable, and so forth should be regarded with extreme suspicion.</li>
            <li> she’s allergic (at least) to a laundry detergent we no longer use,</li>
            <li> Disappointed by this product.</li>
            <li> Unilever (owner of the vaseline trademark), like Burts Bee&#x27;s, used deception to push diluted overpriced crap and in doing so endangered the health of others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband hates using anything in the summer because he hate sweating and feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> It was horrible!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Makes my skin feel cool  and smooth. This is going to be great  after being in the sun</li>
            <li> I think I like it. Only used it twice so far. Smells clean and fresh. Goes on like aloe vera gel. No sticky feeling afterward. Can&#x27;t even tell you have it on after it dries, but I&#x27;m just not sure how moisturizing it really is?</li>
            <li> For real sensitive skin, this Vaseline Aloe Gel is a God-send.  I even use this product mixed with hair gel for my hair.  Sometimes I use it as hair gel only.  This is a multi-use product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know anywhere I can buy this stuff around my home.  I use this product as an aftershave because it doesn&#x27;t burn life aftershaves with alcohol in the ingredients; plus, it dries quickly without being sticky.  I like to work outside, plus run and bicycle long distances, and I just like using this product afterwards for sunburns and dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Beagle, which has an occasional skin allergy, seems to like this gel, too.  She was itching ferociously one night, so I put some of this on her skin out of desperation.  She calmed down immediately.  I’ve figured out she’s allergic (at least) to a laundry detergent we no longer use, but she still finds a blanket to lay on washed in the old detergent, but applying the gel helps her calm down until I can get her bathed.</li>
            <li> This product after applying at night before bed made my clothes stick to my body!  My husband and I both had to peel off our clothing (with some skin)!!!  It was horrible!  Back to old faithful Hawaiian Tropic Cool Aloe I.C.E. With Lidocaine for me!</li>
            <li> The cocoa body gel is much more hydrating. I feel like my skin is dry a few hours after applying. Disappointed by this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I put on after I take showers on thoes hott days to keep myself cool from the heat.This product isnt popular because passed in the drug store but its accually good.The smell is fresh clean and natural.I love it</li>
            <li> I went to apply some \\&quot;Vaseline 100% natural aloe vera gel\\&quot; someone had for me for a sunburn i got after using Burt&#x27;s Bees 30spf sunscreen which did absolutely nothing, and took a close look at the label and it reads in large font \\&quot;aloe fresh moisturizing\\&quot; and then tiny letters \\&quot;daily body gel with\\&quot; and then large letters \\&quot;100% natural aloe vera gel\\&quot;. Looking closer at the ingredients (ingredients being posted in order of largest-smallest quantity): water, pentylene glycol, glycerin, aloe vera leaf juice\\&quot;. Those first three ingredients are crap, they dont do anything. This is watered down aloe vera juice re-gelled with a bunch of chemicals and fragrances. Unilever (owner of the vaseline trademark), like Burts Bee&#x27;s, used deception to push diluted overpriced crap and in doing so endangered the health of others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I went to walgreens to get some of their aloe vera gel and the ingredients read: Aloe vera leaf juice, water, alcohol 40, glycerin\\&quot;. Yes, alot cheaper, alot more, and ITS MOSTLY ALOE VERA JUICE. Any packaged product that uses: (all)natural, holistic, organic, chemical-free, unprocessed, hypo-allergenic, green, eco-friendly, sustainable, and so forth should be regarded with extreme suspicion.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Light&lt;br /&gt;Smells nice&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for layering under lotion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Takes a couple mins to dry&lt;br /&gt;A little pricey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff. I put it on after taking a shower and it&#x27;s a lot lighter than lotion so it doesn&#x27;t take long to dry. It smells super refreshing too.

            <li> Love this stuff and can&#x27;t find it in stores</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizing gel. Doesn&#x27;t go on greasy. Moisturizes all day and the scent is light enough to blend with my other perfumes</li>
            <li> Great product.  Vaseline needs to bring it back.</li>
            <li> Great as a skin conditioner if you have oily skin. Lessens the appearance of blemishes and wrinkles. Leaves a beautiful glow, as if I got a mild tan on the beach :)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff but please..... Remove parabens!!</li>
            <li> I would love to use this on hot summer days and most of the year where I live, but this products has parabens in it, so marketing as natural is pretty dishonest. I love aloe vera and it&#x27;s healing powers but I don&#x27;t like all the added chemicals which cause cancer. I wish they would reformulate this and remove the parabens because the concept is great.</li>
            <li> anything is very good.！&lt;br /&gt;beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful !&lt;br /&gt;wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful  wonderful wonderful ！</li>
            <li> works great! love the way it makes my skin feel. i usually put it on my face instead of lotion. its get for overall skin health too. :D</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s a great for after sunburns but also for everyday moisturizing.  I like that unlike other aloes for after sun this doesn&#x27;t have alcohol in it, which can be drying, and not good for everyday moisturizing.  It&#x27;s good because it is lightweight and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff. It moisturizes well and smells good</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I wished they sold it in larger containers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an aloe plant, but a child had a rash so bad that I used most of it up, which necessitated the purchase of this.  We&#x27;ve used 3 bottles of it on nightly applications over the past year, it has such a refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Great to put on instead of lotion when you are hot out of the shower and do not want to feel the effect of being hot the lotion all over you!! Also great for summer because it has a coolness to it. Goes on and dries and than you never know you put on gel. Does not remain sticky after dries. Smell is great as well!!</li>
            <li> Being a person with hypersensitive skin there is very little I can use that is available in the market nowadays. Aloe Vera is my &amp;#34;go to guy or girl&amp;#34; and is my only and complete make up. There is nothing more beautiful than natural skin and this gel is coooool, makes my skin extra soft, even improves the condition of my skin and not expensive. I am five feet two inches tall and this size bottle lasts me for a month to two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Vera is also known for properties of healing, dark circle reduction, blemish reduction and to some extent controlling breakouts and acne. I am originally from India settled in the USA and my grandfather who has now been dead for about thirty three years used to mix Aloe Vera in his food and eat it. It sounds yucky but he lived a very healthy life till the age of eighty five or eighty six and took no medications for any medical complaints till he was alive. So Aloe Vera does work and now my father and I are big fans. I am so happy it is easily available to me because as destiny would have it I am allergic to almost everything under the sun except ALOE VERA. My grandfather must be so pleased.</li>
            <li> This lotion really is great for the summer.  Feels cool and is healing.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product... Received on time.  Will definitely use again</li>
            <li> My husband can&#x27;t get enough of this gel.  I order it in bulk, he uses it everyday.  It smell very light and fresh and keeps your skin soft, he even uses it on his face.</li>
            <li> I use this after being in the sun every weekend all summer. Always relieves a burn over night, smells amazing and prevents my skin from peeling. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This product works great on dry skin, makes your skin very soft after it soaks in. Works great on sunburn.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff I have ever found for applying to the face after taking a hot shower where you used a lot of soap on your face. You just put this stuff on afterward and you&#x27;re skin will be protected for enough time to release it&#x27;s own natural oils underneath the layer of gel.</li>
