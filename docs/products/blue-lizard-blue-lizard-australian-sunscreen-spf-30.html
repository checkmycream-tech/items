            <li>Very effective, even with my water sports.</li>
            <li>Nothing yucky (like some popular brands--Neutrogena, I&#x27;m talking about you!).</li>
            <li>Best I have ever used and I stay in the sun most of the day.  </li>
            <li>And most important, made in the U.S.A.!!!!  </li>
            <li>Excellent water resistance - Nice, very light scent - Has not irritated our eyes  </li>
            <li>I use it on our very fair daughter, and I have not had any problems, even with transfer to me, even though I am allergic to most sunscreens.</li>
            <li>I am so fair skined nothing works on me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to have both, I think.</li>
            <li>Good stuff</li>
            <li>It does offer a lot of good protection.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m fair skinned</li>
            <li>The beginning of this summer we were using Babyganics 50+ sunscreen in the pump bottle, and thought I loved it.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use on your dog as zinc oxide isn&#x27;t good for them.</li>
            <li>Whether hiking in the mountains or working in the yard, I put it on in the morning, and I&#x27;m good for the day.</li>
            <li>fair skin and</li>
            <li>It absorbs well and feels good on skin.</li>

            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>Perspiration (and I&#x27;m a very free perspirer!)</li>
            <li>Used on a cruise and very pleased.</li>
            <li>Hope this brand works better than Neutrogena!</li>
            <li>I have recommended it to many!  </li>
            <li>but it rubs on nicely.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful product that really works.  </li>
            <li>It does not burn your eyes, moisturizes the skin nicely and WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>and I really liked it.</li>
            <li>Best sunscreen i have ever used for my fair headed red head daughter.</li>
            <li>Quick ship,and great product.</li>
            <li>More like a nice body lotion.</li>
            <li>The Sport version of this sunblock is just as good as the original</li>
            <li>its very light</li>
            <li>I have very fair &amp; sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t appear to be any better than what I could buy at Walgreens</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon should delist this product until they correct the description to list the correct ingredients at the top.</li>
            <li>I finally found the perfect sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>the fact that the bottle turns blue in UV was awesome because it was easier to convince the rest of my family</li>
            <li>This is an Australian sunblock and is one of THE BEST sunblocks I have found in the many years</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Costs more</li>
            <li>(I did reapply once to more exposed areas out of habit).</li>
            <li>My husband and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Stay safe in this sun.</li>
            <li>Cute idea.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen and got it in a timely fashion.  </li>
            <li>and it feels like you are not wearing sunscreen unlike most feel greasy and makes you want to wash your hands after apply.</li>
            <li>I am confident if I have this on, no matter what tropical beach</li>
            <li>All I know is that it works better than any sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Reef safe.</li>
            <li>No nasty chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll go with that one and just re-apply more freq.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m okay with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a product that was safe, didn&#x27;t have benzene derivatives, and protected my skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since my Dermatologist recommended this brand, as for now, I&#x27;m just going to use what I have and see if there is anything else that is better.</li>
            <li>PROS - Love that it rubs in so quickly and feels nice on your skin.</li>
            <li>First test was about 2 hours splashing around the baby pool on our deck which gets a good amount of sun.</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s kind of cute to see the bottle turn a bright blue as you</li>
            <li>I was able to enjoy my time on the water and didn&#x27;t have to worry about being burnt by the sun</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a boater  and I spend most of my free time outdoors in Florida.</li>
            <li>Was happy to be using a &#x27;natural&#x27; product.</li>
            <li>The product description right below the product image claims &amp;#34;Contains 10% Zinc Oxide and 5% Titanium Dioxide for superior protection across the full UV spectrum.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite sunscreen!!</li>
            <li>It goes on CREAMY and rubs in, about the healthiest sun protection you can get with easy application.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t be beat in my opinion and I&#x27;m an easy &amp;#34;burner&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as strong as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>My wife has a mild skin condition and this stuff has treated us pretty good.</li>
            <li>slight con is that it is thicker/a bit greasier than some of the others so not the greatest if you&#x27;re going to a formal/semi-formal day time gathering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you for shipping as quickly as you could!</li>
            <li>My own experience is that I can be in the sun for most of the day with only two applications; I feel it is more tenacious than, say, Coppertone Sport</li>
            <li>Rubs in well, so skin is smooth and not sticky.  </li>
            <li>Hey, if this is chemical free, i rather use the lizard brand.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t burn - isn&#x27;t greasy.  </li>
            <li>100% chemical free formula&amp;#34;  WRONG!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I believe this product is also healthier than others which are filled with chemicals.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of chalky and does not seem to soak in very well.</li>
            <li>Worked great on my 5 day blue</li>
            <li>how important it was to use this.</li>
            <li>We applied prior to leaving our villa in the morning, and no one experienced any sunburn.</li>
            <li>This went on smooth, did not feel greasy and lasted for hours.  </li>
            <li>Not chemical free as the description claims.  </li>
            <li>I would not use this on myself or my family, even after getting it for free.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, don&#x27;t be fooled by the low spf rating.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen prevents that, and ever since using it my clothes are rust free.</li>
            <li>Blue Lizard Sunscreen is a great product.</li>
            <li>Another plus is the fact that there is no annoying scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would highly recommend - in fact, I bought three more bottles!</li>
            <li>Wish a higher SFP, like 40 was available, for better protection.</li>
            <li>This also makes it quick and easy to apply to wiggly kids.</li>
            <li>I used it on myself as well, and have always been able to feel that exact moment when sunblock stopped working and didn&#x27;t get that at all.  </li>
            <li>5 stars and for me, well worth the cost!</li>
            <li>My swim bag is FULL of sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is perfect, on the thick side</li>
            <li>The bottle is really cool too.</li>
            <li>Awesome product, slow delievery</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is easy to apply, chemical free, and that it is much cheaper than California baby.  </li>
            <li>Great ....works , stay on pretty long, it will be my lotion of choice</li>
            <li>Blue Lizard sunscreen is a product I have been using for many, many years.  </li>
            <li>It really has saved me from getting any skin cancer and disappears easily.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended Blue Lizard and we love it !  </li>
            <li>As someone who is very fair-skinned and has had a tendency to develop actinic keratoses (pre-cancerous lesions that are caused by exposure to broad-spectrum ultraviolet light), I have tried various kind of sunscreens.</li>
            <li>While not cheap, this stuff works great and stays on you.  </li>
            <li>As a fair-skinned distance runner in southern California, sunscreen is as important as running shoes--maybe more so if you take into account diminished ozone and increased melanomas.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>If you are looking for more natural sunscreen that works and doesn&#x27;t give you that clown look from zinc oxide I recommend checking this out.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>It makes your skin really white, doesn&#x27;t soak in as well as i would have liked.</li>
            <li>The cool bottle that turn blue in UVA/UVB light is cool too!</li>
            <li>Bought 5 bottles right away.</li>
            <li>Brand new, so just fine.</li>
            <li>In normal light this is not visible, but&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li>I could not blame heat or pool, because it was not too hot ( and they were in the shade) and they were in the kiddie pool with fresh water.</li>
            <li>Great product, my entire family used it last year when we were in Mexico.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more fluid than most other zinc based sunscreens, which makes it so easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Hands down the best product I have used in a very long time!  </li>
            <li>you look at the &#x27;ingredients&#x27; of blue lizard, then you&#x27;ll see that it doesn&#x27;t have all the additives of most sun</li>
            <li>for Red Headed children :-)</li>
            <li>Since purchasing this product 6 months ago Blue Lizard has become my favorite.  </li>
            <li>And Blue Lizard is the most recommended brand in the USA.</li>
            <li>I have always used California baby sunscreen, this is the first time I got this.  </li>
            <li>I like this product as it was recommended by my dermatologist many years ago and it has become difficult(impossible) to buy locally anymore.</li>
            <li>love the bottle that turns blue in the sun.</li>
            <li>but unfortunately, it&#x27;s not water proof.  </li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t ever go back to the chemical sprays most people use for convenience sake.</li>
            <li>Works really well!  </li>
            <li>It was my first time trying it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll gladly stick to Blue Lizard!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is also the first time I haven&#x27;t gotten burnt on this annual vacation.</li>
            <li>My oldest son has very sensitive  skin and with most sunscreen and lotions starts complaining immediately  that &#x27;it burns&amp;#34; but so far this hasn&#x27;t  caused any issues and no sunburn.</li>
            <li>this stuff was amazing this past summer - bought it specially for our trip to Destin,</li>
            <li>Most importantly it doesn&#x27;t have all the harsh chemicals that can irritate your skin and eye&#x27;s god forbid you get the lotion in them.</li>
            <li>Blue Lizard is the only sunscreen that truly works with my fair skin daughter.</li>
            <li>They are serious about using only the best ingredients.</li>
            <li>certain lighting conditions</li>
            <li>It certainly kept the sun from getting through on my face because of the zinc.</li>
            <li>con is that in certain light it makes your face look ghostly white.</li>
            <li>My son has sensitive skin so finding a great SPF 30 sunblock was hard.  </li>
            <li>Also another friend who is very protective of her skin.  </li>
            <li>it is fantastic and the bottle turning blue is a novelty in the sun.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s a whole fussier than me...</li>
            <li>and it performs very well.  </li>
            <li>It really blocks UV.</li>
            <li>I expected more from this brand.</li>
            <li>Worked very well for me and my granddaughters, ages 3 and 5.</li>
            <li>I like how light this sunscreen is, as well as how protective it is at the same time.</li>
            <li>Neat bottle (turns blue when hit with light) that almost acts as a reminder that I should be wearing sunscreen when the color changes.</li>
            <li>There are many other sunscreens out there that are not toxic for either my family nor the environment, work very well, and have a competitive price.</li>
            <li>I still get tanned from being out in the sun, but it does hold up a lot better than some of the other brands that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Also, it does not make me sweat more as other oxide sunscreens often do.</li>
            <li>Never disappointed with Blue Lizard.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t sweat off as easily as most other sunblocks.</li>
            <li>Blue Lizard has been a game changer and made the beach experience wonderful again by not only protecting the skin beyond other products with minimal applications, it also does not leave that greasy feeling on your skin but instead gives you a nice refreshing dry feeling to be comfortable in or out of your clothes.</li>
            <li>Have previously tried Honest Co. natural sunblock, but found it greasy.</li>
            <li>As far as I know, the first 3 ingredients are in fact chemical sunblocks.  </li>
            <li>Love that the Blue Lizard bottles turn blue in UV rays.</li>
            <li>so I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I lie in an area with a high iron content in its water.</li>
            <li>Fresh, very subtle scent and amazing coverage.</li>
            <li>For one thing, it contains zinc oxide (that stuff that lifeguards paint their noses with) along with two other sunscreen ingredients and for another it is formulated to stay on your skin without easily wearing off.</li>
            <li>Blue Lizard is a fabulous company from Australia--which has the least ozone and the most melanomas.</li>
            <li>do the job very well under the las vegas sun.better than any sunscreen i brought so far.</li>
            <li>Because of Australia&#x27;s strict sunscreen standards, we came across Blue Lizard as a brand worth having.</li>
            <li>When that water combines with normal sunscreen and my clothes, it oxidizes and produces rust stains on my clothes.</li>
            <li>I live the high numbers.  </li>
            <li>Bought to go to Florida for spring break (live in Michigan)  </li>
            <li>Went to Mexico one year with a bottle of this stuff and upon returning back to the US, you should of seen the countless people who either used cheap sun screen or none at all.</li>
            <li>I used it my first weekend outside by the pool.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this as well as other Blue Lizard pruducts and found that they are an outstanding buy.</li>
            <li>CONS - Zero so far!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t perform like before, my face gets really hot in a short period of time.</li>
            <li>(Yes, the bottle really does turn blue in direct sunlight.)</li>
            <li>Our daughter has extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>From a young baby, everything that we tried caused a reaction.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get a complete three hours of protection.</li>
            <li>Overall I really like this sun screen</li>
            <li>Octinoxate 7.5%, Octocrylene 2%, Oxybenzone 3%, Zinc Oxide 6% ...&amp;#34;  So only 6% Zinc, not Titanium Dioxide, and the very chemicals (e.g., Oxybenzone) that the CDC says should be avoided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I am near water and in the sun for any considerable amount of time without sunscreen  with zinc oxide in it I break out in hives within 24 hours.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and often make the comments that I have two colors.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and have not had any problems with this product.</li>
            <li>I took it to my dermatologist and they not only highly recommended it, the even sell it!  </li>
            <li>As long as I can order this and have it around I will continue to be a loyal customer, and user of Blue Lizard.</li>
            <li>We all used our respective sunscreens and reapplied at basically the same times as each other throughout the days, and I definitely came out ahead :-)</li>
            <li>I found that if I reapplied when I went inside to use the restroom, I&#x27;d look normal by the time I got back out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The sports version of blue lizard is certainly sweat and water resistant, so I would definitely recommend fellow Floridians to choose this version.</li>
            <li>my wife has sensitive skin and the high end sunscreen she was using started to create a minor reaction.  </li>
            <li>I have a 3 year old who, if he had his way, would spend every minute of every day outside, and every minute near any body of water in it/ sprayed by it/ playing with it.  </li>
            <li>Most recently my dermatologist recommended this product, at least partly because it screens across the ultraviolet spectrum, unlike some that only screen out ultraviolet A.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It does not irritate my sensitive skin, and it does not leave a white cast nor does it leave my face oily.</li>
            <li>The sport version goes on much easier than other zinc oxide products.  </li>
            <li>The blue lizard sensitive has only zinc and titnium</li>
            <li>does take some effort to get it all rubbed in, but your skin is worth a few extra minutes applying!</li>
            <li>Pretty water resistant, went in and out of the water at the beach a few times over a couple of hours and it still kept me protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, you look like a pale smurf when you first apply it.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and seems to absorb into the skin right away.</li>
            <li>We live in south Florida and are very careful about protecting ourselves from the sun.  </li>

            <li> Very effective, even with my water sports.</li>
            <li> Nothing yucky (like some popular brands--Neutrogena, I&#x27;m talking about you!).</li>
            <li> Best I have ever used and I stay in the sun most of the day.  </li>
            <li> And most important, made in the U.S.A.!!!!  </li>
            <li> Excellent water resistance - Nice, very light scent - Has not irritated our eyes  </li>
            <li> I use it on our very fair daughter, and I have not had any problems, even with transfer to me, even though I am allergic to most sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I am so fair skined nothing works on me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to have both, I think.</li>
            <li> Good stuff</li>
            <li> It does offer a lot of good protection.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m fair skinned</li>
            <li> The beginning of this summer we were using Babyganics 50+ sunscreen in the pump bottle, and thought I loved it.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use on your dog as zinc oxide isn&#x27;t good for them.</li>
            <li> Whether hiking in the mountains or working in the yard, I put it on in the morning, and I&#x27;m good for the day.</li>
            <li> fair skin and</li>
            <li> It absorbs well and feels good on skin.</li>

            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Perspiration (and I&#x27;m a very free perspirer!)</li>
            <li> Used on a cruise and very pleased.</li>
            <li> Hope this brand works better than Neutrogena!</li>
            <li> I have recommended it to many!  </li>
            <li> but it rubs on nicely.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful product that really works.  </li>
            <li> It does not burn your eyes, moisturizes the skin nicely and WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> and I really liked it.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen i have ever used for my fair headed red head daughter.</li>
            <li> Quick ship,and great product.</li>
            <li> More like a nice body lotion.</li>
            <li> The Sport version of this sunblock is just as good as the original</li>
            <li> its very light</li>
            <li> I have very fair &amp; sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t appear to be any better than what I could buy at Walgreens</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon should delist this product until they correct the description to list the correct ingredients at the top.</li>
            <li> I finally found the perfect sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> the fact that the bottle turns blue in UV was awesome because it was easier to convince the rest of my family</li>
            <li> This is an Australian sunblock and is one of THE BEST sunblocks I have found in the many years</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Costs more</li>
            <li> (I did reapply once to more exposed areas out of habit).</li>
            <li> My husband and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Stay safe in this sun.</li>
            <li> Cute idea.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen and got it in a timely fashion.  </li>
            <li> and it feels like you are not wearing sunscreen unlike most feel greasy and makes you want to wash your hands after apply.</li>
            <li> I am confident if I have this on, no matter what tropical beach</li>
            <li> All I know is that it works better than any sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Reef safe.</li>
            <li> No nasty chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll go with that one and just re-apply more freq.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m okay with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a product that was safe, didn&#x27;t have benzene derivatives, and protected my skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since my Dermatologist recommended this brand, as for now, I&#x27;m just going to use what I have and see if there is anything else that is better.</li>
            <li> PROS - Love that it rubs in so quickly and feels nice on your skin.</li>
            <li> First test was about 2 hours splashing around the baby pool on our deck which gets a good amount of sun.</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s kind of cute to see the bottle turn a bright blue as you</li>
            <li> I was able to enjoy my time on the water and didn&#x27;t have to worry about being burnt by the sun</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a boater  and I spend most of my free time outdoors in Florida.</li>
            <li> Was happy to be using a &#x27;natural&#x27; product.</li>
            <li> The product description right below the product image claims &amp;#34;Contains 10% Zinc Oxide and 5% Titanium Dioxide for superior protection across the full UV spectrum.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite sunscreen!!</li>
            <li> It goes on CREAMY and rubs in, about the healthiest sun protection you can get with easy application.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be beat in my opinion and I&#x27;m an easy &amp;#34;burner&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as strong as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> My wife has a mild skin condition and this stuff has treated us pretty good.</li>
            <li> slight con is that it is thicker/a bit greasier than some of the others so not the greatest if you&#x27;re going to a formal/semi-formal day time gathering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thank you for shipping as quickly as you could!</li>
            <li> My own experience is that I can be in the sun for most of the day with only two applications; I feel it is more tenacious than, say, Coppertone Sport</li>
            <li> Rubs in well, so skin is smooth and not sticky.  </li>
            <li> Hey, if this is chemical free, i rather use the lizard brand.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t burn - isn&#x27;t greasy.  </li>
            <li> 100% chemical free formula&amp;#34;  WRONG!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I believe this product is also healthier than others which are filled with chemicals.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of chalky and does not seem to soak in very well.</li>
            <li> Worked great on my 5 day blue</li>
            <li> how important it was to use this.</li>
            <li> We applied prior to leaving our villa in the morning, and no one experienced any sunburn.</li>
            <li> This went on smooth, did not feel greasy and lasted for hours.  </li>
            <li> Not chemical free as the description claims.  </li>
            <li> I would not use this on myself or my family, even after getting it for free.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, don&#x27;t be fooled by the low spf rating.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen prevents that, and ever since using it my clothes are rust free.</li>
            <li> Blue Lizard Sunscreen is a great product.</li>
            <li> Another plus is the fact that there is no annoying scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would highly recommend - in fact, I bought three more bottles!</li>
            <li> Wish a higher SFP, like 40 was available, for better protection.</li>
            <li> This also makes it quick and easy to apply to wiggly kids.</li>
            <li> I used it on myself as well, and have always been able to feel that exact moment when sunblock stopped working and didn&#x27;t get that at all.  </li>
            <li> 5 stars and for me, well worth the cost!</li>
            <li> My swim bag is FULL of sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is perfect, on the thick side</li>
            <li> The bottle is really cool too.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, slow delievery</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is easy to apply, chemical free, and that it is much cheaper than California baby.  </li>
            <li> Great ....works , stay on pretty long, it will be my lotion of choice</li>
            <li> Blue Lizard sunscreen is a product I have been using for many, many years.  </li>
            <li> It really has saved me from getting any skin cancer and disappears easily.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended Blue Lizard and we love it !  </li>
            <li> As someone who is very fair-skinned and has had a tendency to develop actinic keratoses (pre-cancerous lesions that are caused by exposure to broad-spectrum ultraviolet light), I have tried various kind of sunscreens.</li>
            <li> While not cheap, this stuff works great and stays on you.  </li>
            <li> As a fair-skinned distance runner in southern California, sunscreen is as important as running shoes--maybe more so if you take into account diminished ozone and increased melanomas.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money</li>
            <li> If you are looking for more natural sunscreen that works and doesn&#x27;t give you that clown look from zinc oxide I recommend checking this out.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> It makes your skin really white, doesn&#x27;t soak in as well as i would have liked.</li>
            <li> The cool bottle that turn blue in UVA/UVB light is cool too!</li>
            <li> Bought 5 bottles right away.</li>
            <li> Brand new, so just fine.</li>
            <li> In normal light this is not visible, but&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li> I could not blame heat or pool, because it was not too hot ( and they were in the shade) and they were in the kiddie pool with fresh water.</li>
            <li> Great product, my entire family used it last year when we were in Mexico.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more fluid than most other zinc based sunscreens, which makes it so easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Hands down the best product I have used in a very long time!  </li>
            <li> you look at the &#x27;ingredients&#x27; of blue lizard, then you&#x27;ll see that it doesn&#x27;t have all the additives of most sun</li>
            <li> for Red Headed children :-)</li>
            <li> Since purchasing this product 6 months ago Blue Lizard has become my favorite.  </li>
            <li> And Blue Lizard is the most recommended brand in the USA.</li>
            <li> I have always used California baby sunscreen, this is the first time I got this.  </li>
            <li> I like this product as it was recommended by my dermatologist many years ago and it has become difficult(impossible) to buy locally anymore.</li>
            <li> love the bottle that turns blue in the sun.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately, it&#x27;s not water proof.  </li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t ever go back to the chemical sprays most people use for convenience sake.</li>
            <li> Works really well!  </li>
            <li> It was my first time trying it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll gladly stick to Blue Lizard!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is also the first time I haven&#x27;t gotten burnt on this annual vacation.</li>
            <li> My oldest son has very sensitive  skin and with most sunscreen and lotions starts complaining immediately  that &#x27;it burns&amp;#34; but so far this hasn&#x27;t  caused any issues and no sunburn.</li>
            <li> this stuff was amazing this past summer - bought it specially for our trip to Destin,</li>
            <li> Most importantly it doesn&#x27;t have all the harsh chemicals that can irritate your skin and eye&#x27;s god forbid you get the lotion in them.</li>
            <li> Blue Lizard is the only sunscreen that truly works with my fair skin daughter.</li>
            <li> They are serious about using only the best ingredients.</li>
            <li> certain lighting conditions</li>
            <li> It certainly kept the sun from getting through on my face because of the zinc.</li>
            <li> con is that in certain light it makes your face look ghostly white.</li>
            <li> My son has sensitive skin so finding a great SPF 30 sunblock was hard.  </li>
            <li> Also another friend who is very protective of her skin.  </li>
            <li> it is fantastic and the bottle turning blue is a novelty in the sun.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s a whole fussier than me...</li>
            <li> and it performs very well.  </li>
            <li> It really blocks UV.</li>
            <li> I expected more from this brand.</li>
            <li> Worked very well for me and my granddaughters, ages 3 and 5.</li>
            <li> I like how light this sunscreen is, as well as how protective it is at the same time.</li>
            <li> Neat bottle (turns blue when hit with light) that almost acts as a reminder that I should be wearing sunscreen when the color changes.</li>
            <li> There are many other sunscreens out there that are not toxic for either my family nor the environment, work very well, and have a competitive price.</li>
            <li> I still get tanned from being out in the sun, but it does hold up a lot better than some of the other brands that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Also, it does not make me sweat more as other oxide sunscreens often do.</li>
            <li> Never disappointed with Blue Lizard.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t sweat off as easily as most other sunblocks.</li>
            <li> Blue Lizard has been a game changer and made the beach experience wonderful again by not only protecting the skin beyond other products with minimal applications, it also does not leave that greasy feeling on your skin but instead gives you a nice refreshing dry feeling to be comfortable in or out of your clothes.</li>
            <li> Have previously tried Honest Co. natural sunblock, but found it greasy.</li>
            <li> As far as I know, the first 3 ingredients are in fact chemical sunblocks.  </li>
            <li> Love that the Blue Lizard bottles turn blue in UV rays.</li>
            <li> so I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I lie in an area with a high iron content in its water.</li>
            <li> Fresh, very subtle scent and amazing coverage.</li>
            <li> For one thing, it contains zinc oxide (that stuff that lifeguards paint their noses with) along with two other sunscreen ingredients and for another it is formulated to stay on your skin without easily wearing off.</li>
            <li> Blue Lizard is a fabulous company from Australia--which has the least ozone and the most melanomas.</li>
            <li> do the job very well under the las vegas sun.better than any sunscreen i brought so far.</li>
            <li> Because of Australia&#x27;s strict sunscreen standards, we came across Blue Lizard as a brand worth having.</li>
            <li> When that water combines with normal sunscreen and my clothes, it oxidizes and produces rust stains on my clothes.</li>
            <li> I live the high numbers.  </li>
            <li> Bought to go to Florida for spring break (live in Michigan)  </li>
            <li> Went to Mexico one year with a bottle of this stuff and upon returning back to the US, you should of seen the countless people who either used cheap sun screen or none at all.</li>
            <li> I used it my first weekend outside by the pool.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this as well as other Blue Lizard pruducts and found that they are an outstanding buy.</li>
            <li> CONS - Zero so far!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t perform like before, my face gets really hot in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> (Yes, the bottle really does turn blue in direct sunlight.)</li>
            <li> Our daughter has extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> From a young baby, everything that we tried caused a reaction.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get a complete three hours of protection.</li>
            <li> Overall I really like this sun screen</li>
            <li> Octinoxate 7.5%, Octocrylene 2%, Oxybenzone 3%, Zinc Oxide 6% ...&amp;#34;  So only 6% Zinc, not Titanium Dioxide, and the very chemicals (e.g., Oxybenzone) that the CDC says should be avoided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I am near water and in the sun for any considerable amount of time without sunscreen  with zinc oxide in it I break out in hives within 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and often make the comments that I have two colors.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and have not had any problems with this product.</li>
            <li> I took it to my dermatologist and they not only highly recommended it, the even sell it!  </li>
            <li> As long as I can order this and have it around I will continue to be a loyal customer, and user of Blue Lizard.</li>
            <li> We all used our respective sunscreens and reapplied at basically the same times as each other throughout the days, and I definitely came out ahead :-)</li>
            <li> I found that if I reapplied when I went inside to use the restroom, I&#x27;d look normal by the time I got back out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The sports version of blue lizard is certainly sweat and water resistant, so I would definitely recommend fellow Floridians to choose this version.</li>
            <li> my wife has sensitive skin and the high end sunscreen she was using started to create a minor reaction.  </li>
            <li> I have a 3 year old who, if he had his way, would spend every minute of every day outside, and every minute near any body of water in it/ sprayed by it/ playing with it.  </li>
            <li> Most recently my dermatologist recommended this product, at least partly because it screens across the ultraviolet spectrum, unlike some that only screen out ultraviolet A.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It does not irritate my sensitive skin, and it does not leave a white cast nor does it leave my face oily.</li>
            <li> The sport version goes on much easier than other zinc oxide products.  </li>
            <li> The blue lizard sensitive has only zinc and titnium</li>
            <li> does take some effort to get it all rubbed in, but your skin is worth a few extra minutes applying!</li>
            <li> Pretty water resistant, went in and out of the water at the beach a few times over a couple of hours and it still kept me protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, you look like a pale smurf when you first apply it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and seems to absorb into the skin right away.</li>
            <li> We live in south Florida and are very careful about protecting ourselves from the sun.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The Blue Lizard Sensitive and Blue Lizard Baby both have active ingredients:</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and swim laps several times a week and need something heavy duty.  </li>
            <li> Its dry and long lasting, isint greassey.</li>
            <li> Money you spend on Blue Lizard is money well spent.</li>
            <li> Then noticed that after even an hour outside in partial sun, without water play, we were both getting some sun</li>
            <li> The lotion lasts a long time, I don&#x27;t burn from the sun.  </li>
            <li> Best sunscreen hands down with not all the nasty chemicals!!</li>
            <li> Plus, other sunscreens have been burning the kids faces on the second application.</li>
            <li> In addition... this doesn&#x27;t stain the gel coat and boat cushions and will last longer than other sunscreen products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This actually rubs in a little easier than the regular, but still lasts for hours getting in and out of the water.</li>
            <li> I refer to websites that rate the health safety of suscreens and have been using a zinc sunscreen for a few years that has not rubbed in well and left my kids looking &#x27;white&#x27;.</li>
            <li> 5 Stars for effectiveness but knocked one star off overall because it is very think and difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li> heavier than expected,</li>
            <li> My family and I recently spent a week in St. John, USVI</li>
            <li> We spent a week in the pool all day in 95 degrees and no sunburns.  </li>
            <li> Bought the sport version becuase of the time spent in the water.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I spent hours in the sun (on a boat) - swimming, etc</li>
            <li> It is a little thin and comes out very fast so watch the kids if you let them use it.</li>
            <li> strange and possibly merely bells-and-whistles feature is that the clear plastic container immediately turns blue (and I&#x27;m told the baby lotion version turn pink) on exposure to UV.</li>
            <li> I spent several days in a tropical sun and just had 3 little sunburn marks!</li>
            <li> It applies easily, a little goes a long way and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> so I needed a sun screen that was extremely waterproof.  </li>
            <li> I had two operations due to melanoma cancer and based on her recommendation</li>
            <li> Please stop using the other stuff out there.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my husband&#x27;s dermatologist for keeping melanoma and other skin cancers at bay.  </li>
            <li> Two very minor caveats: it will sting your eyes and it&#x27;s a little pricey.</li>
            <li> active ingredients are: Oxybenzone 3%, Octinoxate 7.5%, Octocrylene 2% and Zinc Oxide 6%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t end up using it because of concerns around the ingredients, particularly:&lt;br /&gt;1- OCTINOXATE active ingredient 7.5%&lt;br /&gt;Concerns:</li>
            <li> br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2- OXYBENZONE active ingredient 3%&lt;br /&gt;Concerns: Enhanced skin absorption, Biochemical or cellular level changes, Developmental/reproductive toxicity, Endocrine disruption, Allergies/immunotoxicity, Organ system toxicity, Persistence and bioaccumulation&lt;</li>
            <li> Of all my friends who rode 400+ miles on bikes this last week, I am the one with the least noticeable tan-lines and without ANY sunburn.</li>
            <li> correct description is way down the page.  </li>
            <li> My wife is picky when it comes to sunscreen and the usual residue left behind once applied not to mention the numerous applications that are required of hose greasy formulas.</li>
            <li> but I use less....</li>
            <li> I paid $5 less online though.  </li>
            <li> My family and I started using Blue Lizard products about 4 years ago when I started getting serious about cycling and triathlons.  </li>
            <li> Picked the Sport over the Baby version in attempts to avoid excessive applications on a wet wiggly preschooler.  </li>
            <li> It costs no more than any other sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I received the Blue Lizard Sports sunscreen for free to test and review, and after researching the ingredients, I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Bought this and within a few days the irritation went away and works same if not better!!</li>
            <li> pasty white, and lobster red painful burnt.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they changed what they were doing, my hands broke out in little blisters!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten burnt every summer of my life but very, very little with this product.</li>
            <li> I usually wear 80 or 90 +</li>
            <li> Australian product manufactured in Tennessee is relatively expensive</li>
            <li> This is helpful, I suppose, if you&#x27;re not sure whether to put the lotion on, say on a cloudy day.</li>
            <li> Very thin compared  to the tubes I bought at rite aid a while back.</li>
            <li> If you have any doubts about the UV in the atmosphere just hold the bottle up to the sky and you will know what I mean; the contents will change color in the presence of UV.</li>
            <li> It contains very few chemicals, rates well http://www.ewg.org/2015sunscreen/about-the-sunscreens/?search&#x3D;Blue+lizard&amp;advanced-search-submit&#x3D;Search, stays on, and requires fewer applications!  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Last summer while using sunblock I got 2 really bad sunburns.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know the science behind it.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in my previous &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; sunscreen!  </li>
            <li> you get bored</li>
            <li> The best!!&lt;br /&gt;So unfortunate that you can&#x27;t find this in the</li>
            <li> Why is the california baby so outrageously expensive?!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the bad chemicals.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought a bottle of Blue Lizard Sport locally last summer and have been using it while playing golf.  It goes on easily enough and I have not had any sunburn or reddening on the golf course.  No problems to report.</li>
            <li> Our daughter has extremely sensitive skin. From a young baby, everything that we tried caused a reaction.&lt;br /&gt;If you look at the &#x27;ingredients&#x27; of blue lizard, then you&#x27;ll see that it doesn&#x27;t have all the additives of most sun screens.&lt;br /&gt;This works, and continues to works. Our daughter doesn&#x27;t have the same level of allergic reaction that she did as a baby, but anything else we&#x27;ve tried she just burns.&lt;br /&gt;Ideal for Red Headed children :-)</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and swim laps several times a week and need something heavy duty.  My swim bag is FULL of sunscreens.  Since purchasing this product 6 months ago Blue Lizard has become my favorite.  The consistency is perfect, on the thick side but it rubs on nicely.  I like that it has zinc oxide and is not perfumed.  Seems like a quality product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I am so fair skined nothing works on me.  I usually wear 80 or 90 +spf.  I know nothing is suppose to work above 35 spf b ut I live the high numbers.  I have never been burned with blue lizard.  It doesn&#x27;t even smell like sunscreen.  The bottle is really cool too.</li>
            <li> Excellent!   I love this product.  Have been buying it for a couple years.</li>
            <li> I teach swim lessons in the pool for 3 hours a day so I needed a sun screen that was extremely waterproof.  I have been using this product for two summer now and have not gotten burned. I don&#x27;t get a complete three hours of protection. I still get tanned from being out in the sun, but it does hold up a lot better than some of the other brands that I have tried.  My only con is that this sunscreen does sting my eyes whenever I go underwater, and I have tried applying it up to 30 minutes before getting into the water.  Now I am using a face sunscreen along with this one.  Overall I really like this sun screen and I definitely would recommend it!</li>
            <li> Best.Sunscreen.In.The.World. Seriously. Wholesome ingredients that work. Nothing yucky (like some popular brands--Neutrogena, I&#x27;m talking about you!). Does a great job with no fuss. Love that the Blue Lizard bottles turn blue in UV rays. It&#x27;s a big blue reminder to wear your sunscreen. As a fair-skinned distance runner in southern California, sunscreen is as important as running shoes--maybe more so if you take into account diminished ozone and increased melanomas. Blue Lizard is a fabulous company from Australia--which has the least ozone and the most melanomas. They are serious about using only the best ingredients. And Blue Lizard is the most recommended brand in the USA. It costs no more than any other sunscreen. Why not buy the best? One note I can add, though, the Blue Lizard SPORT lasts longer than the Blue Lizard FACE does. It&#x27;s good to have both, I think. I keep bottles in each car and around the house and in gym bags. Money you spend on Blue Lizard is money well spent.</li>
            <li> Heard this stuff was the best. Bought to go to Florida for spring break (live in Michigan)  I&#x27;m a freak about applying liberally on my son whom is very fair. He still got burnt. Doesn&#x27;t appear to be any better than what I could buy at Walgreens</li>
            <li> As someone who is very fair-skinned and has had a tendency to develop actinic keratoses (pre-cancerous lesions that are caused by exposure to broad-spectrum ultraviolet light), I have tried various kind of sunscreens. Most recently my dermatologist recommended this product, at least partly because it screens across the ultraviolet spectrum, unlike some that only screen out ultraviolet A.&lt;br /&gt;This Australian product manufactured in Tennessee is relatively expensive but I think it&#x27;s worth it. For one thing, it contains zinc oxide (that stuff that lifeguards paint their noses with) along with two other sunscreen ingredients and for another it is formulated to stay on your skin without easily wearing off. My own experience is that I can be in the sun for most of the day with only two applications; I feel it is more tenacious than, say, Coppertone Sport Sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;One strange and possibly merely bells-and-whistles feature is that the clear plastic container immediately turns blue (and I&#x27;m told the baby lotion version turn pink) on exposure to UV. This is helpful, I suppose, if you&#x27;re not sure whether to put the lotion on, say on a cloudy day. But those of us with sun-sensitive skin know that ultraviolet penetrates the layer of clouds which are no protection against skin damage. Still, it&#x27;s kind of cute to see the bottle turn a bright blue as you watch.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Scott Morrison</li>
            <li> Rubs in well, so skin is smooth and not sticky.  Wish a higher SFP, like 40 was available, for better protection.</li>
            <li> I have always used California baby sunscreen, this is the first time I got this.  I like the fact that it is easy to apply, chemical free, and that it is much cheaper than California baby.  Why is the california baby so outrageously expensive?! Hey, if this is chemical free, i rather use the lizard brand.</li>
            <li> Blue Lizard sun screen works well but it states that it may stain some fabrics. I don&#x27;t like sun screens that stain fabrics.</li>
            <li> Came as a recommendation from an Aussie friend who had skin cancer.  Also another friend who is very protective of her skin.  It works great.  I used it my first weekend outside by the pool.  I didn&#x27;t burn at all.  It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t burn - isn&#x27;t greasy.  The cool bottle that turn blue in UVA/UVB light is cool too!</li>
            <li> This is not the Blue Lizard product that you&#x27;re looking for.  The product description right below the product image claims &amp;#34;Contains 10% Zinc Oxide and 5% Titanium Dioxide for superior protection across the full UV spectrum. 100% chemical free formula&amp;#34;  WRONG!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The correct description is way down the page.  You&#x27;ll have to scroll a lot to get there.  It says &amp;#34;Ingredients: Octinoxate 7.5%, Octocrylene 2%, Oxybenzone 3%, Zinc Oxide 6% ...&amp;#34;  So only 6% Zinc, not Titanium Dioxide, and the very chemicals (e.g., Oxybenzone) that the CDC says should be avoided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY.  Buy another Blue Lizard product that does not contain Oxybenzone.  They do make them; this just isn&#x27;t one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon should delist this product until they correct the description to list the correct ingredients at the top.</li>
            <li> We were searching for a brand of sunscreen that didn&#x27;t contain all the ingredients we learned could cause cancer. Because of Australia&#x27;s strict sunscreen standards, we came across Blue Lizard as a brand worth having. Thank you for shipping as quickly as you could! We have been using it all week during our beach vacation and not one of us is sunburned!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product that really works.  I believe this product is also healthier than others which are filled with chemicals.</li>
            <li> I finally found the perfect sunscreen. It does not irritate my sensitive skin, and it does not leave a white cast nor does it leave my face oily. Also, it does not make me sweat more as other oxide sunscreens often do. The sports version of blue lizard is certainly sweat and water resistant, so I would definitely recommend fellow Floridians to choose this version.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to the sun. If I am near water and in the sun for any considerable amount of time without sunscreen  with zinc oxide in it I break out in hives within 24 hours. This is the only sunscreen I have found that works well for me.</li>
            <li> My wife is picky when it comes to sunscreen and the usual residue left behind once applied not to mention the numerous applications that are required of hose greasy formulas. Blue Lizard has been a game changer and made the beach experience wonderful again by not only protecting the skin beyond other products with minimal applications, it also does not leave that greasy feeling on your skin but instead gives you a nice refreshing dry feeling to be comfortable in or out of your clothes.</li>
            <li> Used in Aruba &amp; never got sunburn.</li>
            <li> returned this item.  recently reported zinc oxide causes skin cells to die. also indications skin cells can start cancer to grow.  still waiting for my refund.</li>
            <li> heavier than expected,</li>
            <li> I still got sunburned, and I applied quite a bit. It&#x27;s kind of chalky and does not seem to soak in very well. I will try something else.</li>
            <li> The ONLY sunscreen that has kept my daughter and I from burning.  Fresh, very subtle scent and amazing coverage.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Worked great on my 5 day blue my wife couldn&#x27;t even tell I was on the open sea for allmost a week.  did what it said it would!!</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen hands down with not all the nasty chemicals!!</li>
            <li> Non greasy or smelly! Hope this brand works better than Neutrogena!</li>
            <li> Last summer while using sunblock I got 2 really bad sunburns.  The last October my mom was diagnosed with a rate melanoma cancer and I researched for weeks and weeks to find the beat sunblock for my family.  We like in Texas so we use A LOT of sunblock.  My son has sensitive skin so finding a great SPF 30 sunblock was hard.  I found Lizard and bought this one for us and the kids/baby for my son.  They both work great and the best news for us was my son can use both so going forward I don&#x27;t need to buy the baby one.  We spend a lot of time at the pool and none of us got burned.  It also held up great in the pool.</li>
            <li> I prefer using actual sunscreens, not chemicals. I refer to websites that rate the health safety of suscreens and have been using a zinc sunscreen for a few years that has not rubbed in well and left my kids looking &#x27;white&#x27;. A friend recommended Blue Lizard and we love it !  It goes on CREAMY and rubs in, about the healthiest sun protection you can get with easy application. This will be our go-to product from now on.</li>
            <li> Excellent sunscreen, not an inch of my face/body was sunburned where I applied this. the fact that the bottle turns blue in UV was awesome because it was easier to convince the rest of my family how important it was to use this. Pretty water resistant, went in and out of the water at the beach a few times over a couple of hours and it still kept me protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only slight con is that it is thicker/a bit greasier than some of the others so not the greatest if you&#x27;re going to a formal/semi-formal day time gathering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend - in fact, I bought three more bottles!</li>
            <li> Never disappointed with Blue Lizard.  It&#x27;s the best.  Protects well without the white look!</li>
            <li> This product is great!  I have recommended it to many!  It contains very few chemicals, rates well http://www.ewg.org/2015sunscreen/about-the-sunscreens/?search&#x3D;Blue+lizard&amp;advanced-search-submit&#x3D;Search, stays on, and requires fewer applications!  I use it on our very fair daughter, and I have not had any problems, even with transfer to me, even though I am allergic to most sunscreens.</li>
            <li> My family and I recently spent a week in St. John, USVI and we used Blue Lizard sunscreen exclusively.  We applied prior to leaving our villa in the morning, and no one experienced any sunburn.</li>
            <li> We spent a week in the pool all day in 95 degrees and no sunburns.  Plus, other sunscreens have been burning the kids faces on the second application. Not Blue Lizard. It doesn&#x27;t have the bad chemicals. I researched a lot before ordering it. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Australia makes good wine great women and even better sunscreen! !! This stuff works!</li>
            <li> Great product! My dermatologist recommended it. In Florida for 2 weeks and didn&#x27;t get burned at all. Bought the baby sunscreen for my granddaughter.</li>
            <li> Good stuff and I like the bottle changing colors. I f you get bored put the bottle out in the sun and it will change to blue. Keeps the yungins occupied also. It does offer a lot of good protection. Was recommended by my dermatologist. I had two operations due to melanoma cancer and based on her recommendation I figure she knows what she was talking about. Bought 5 bottles right away. Don&#x27;t take a chance with sun damage. Get it.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my daughter&#x27;s dermatologist.  We live in south Florida and are very careful about protecting ourselves from the sun.  We only use Blue Lizard products.</li>
            <li> This is an Australian sunblock and is one of THE BEST sunblocks I have found in the many years I have&lt;br /&gt;used sunblocks. It does not burn your eyes, moisturizes the skin nicely and WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;Only con is that in certain light it makes your face look ghostly white. In normal light this is not visible, but&lt;br /&gt;in certain lighting conditions the ghost factor seems to appear.&lt;br /&gt;Also it doesn&#x27;t sweat off as easily as most other sunblocks. I only apply it once a day and it protects all day.</li>
            <li> love it!! my wife has sensitive skin and the high end sunscreen she was using started to create a minor reaction.  Bought this and within a few days the irritation went away and works same if not better!!</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen i have ever used for my fair headed red head daughter. We have tried everything and this is the only thing that has ever worked. i never would have thought that an SPF 30 sunscreen would do what this does. I put just a dab on her and we can be out on our boat for 5 hours without her burning. Well worth the money</li>
            <li> Used it for a week in the southern Caribbean and no burn on any of us.  5 Stars for effectiveness but knocked one star off overall because it is very think and difficult to apply.  If possible I would have given it 4.75 probably.</li>
            <li> Great ....works , stay on pretty long, it will be my lotion of choice</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a hypoallergenic sunscreen this is the one,  it is fantastic and the bottle turning blue is a novelty in the sun.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite sunscreen!! We buy it every year!! Goes on thoroughly, no need to reapply a million times! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have had two surgeries to remove malenoma from my nose &amp; face. My doctor recommended a sun screen with zinc to protect my skin. I purchased this as well as other Blue Lizard pruducts and found that they are an outstanding buy. I followed the instructions and applied the sunscreen while I was in Florida on a 10 day fishing trip and the products worked perfectly. I was able to enjoy my time on the water and didn&#x27;t have to worry about being burnt by the sun</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen !! Love it</li>
            <li> Brand new, so just fine.</li>
            <li> Best I have ever used and I stay in the sun most of the day.  Been using this product for 10 years now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a boater  and I spend most of my free time outdoors in Florida. I get lots of sun and I&#x27;m fair skinned so I highly recommend this product.  In addition... this doesn&#x27;t stain the gel coat and boat cushions and will last longer than other sunscreen products I&#x27;ve tried. A little goes a long way and seems to absorb into the skin right away. Costs more but I use less.... so it&#x27;s a wash. Great product and my wife uses it too... and she&#x27;s a whole fussier than me... so it&#x27;s gotta be good!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. If you are looking for more natural sunscreen that works and doesn&#x27;t give you that clown look from zinc oxide I recommend checking this out.</li>
            <li> Of all my friends who rode 400+ miles on bikes this last week, I am the one with the least noticeable tan-lines and without ANY sunburn. We all used our respective sunscreens and reapplied at basically the same times as each other throughout the days, and I definitely came out ahead :-)</li>
            <li> The Sport version does not have any Titanium Dioxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredients are: Oxybenzone 3%, Octinoxate 7.5%, Octocrylene 2% and Zinc Oxide 6%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Blue Lizard Sensitive and Blue Lizard Baby both have active ingredients: Titanium Dioxide 5% and Zinc Oxide 10%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Florida family uses sun block not the \\&quot;O\\&quot; chemical absorbers. What an annoyance to return an item because of an incorrect description! Research items beyond Amazon, Amazon descriptions are inaccurate!</li>
            <li> I used it for my toddler and her friend last weekend and it irritated their eyes. Both of them had red,irritated, teary eyes after 30 min of application. I could not blame heat or pool, because it was not too hot ( and they were in the shade) and they were in the kiddie pool with fresh water. Did anybody have the same issue? Isn&#x27;t  &amp;#34;Blue Lizard Sport&amp;#34; supposed to stay on and not melt away with sweat or water?</li>
            <li> One of the best sunscreens recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I have a 3 year old who, if he had his way, would spend every minute of every day outside, and every minute near any body of water in it/ sprayed by it/ playing with it.  The beginning of this summer we were using Babyganics 50+ sunscreen in the pump bottle, and thought I loved it. Was happy to be using a &#x27;natural&#x27; product. Then noticed that after even an hour outside in partial sun, without water play, we were both getting some sun and it didn&#x27;t seem to be working. I was reapplying &amp; reapplying. Then my husband got some Banana Boat Baby (which horrified my somewhat-granola-y preferences - and furthermore, irritated my son&#x27;s eyes and wouldn&#x27;t stay on for 10 minutes of splashing around in a baby pool). Have previously tried Honest Co. natural sunblock, but found it greasy. So Googling I go, and find Blue Lizard recommended again and again.  Picked the Sport over the Baby version in attempts to avoid excessive applications on a wet wiggly preschooler.  First test was about 2 hours splashing around the baby pool on our deck which gets a good amount of sun. He didn&#x27;t get a bit of color or show any skin irritation, and the block stayed on! (I did reapply once to more exposed areas out of habit). I used it on myself as well, and have always been able to feel that exact moment when sunblock stopped working and didn&#x27;t get that at all.  PROS - Love that it rubs in so quickly and feels nice on your skin. Not chalky, pasty, goopy. More like a nice body lotion. This also makes it quick and easy to apply to wiggly kids. - Excellent water resistance - Nice, very light scent - Has not irritated our eyes  CONS - Zero so far!</li>
            <li> Great product, my entire family used it last year when we were in Mexico.  Go it again for my next vacation.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this.  My husband and I love it.  It&#x27;s the best sunscreen we&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I like this product as it was recommended by my dermatologist many years ago and it has become difficult(impossible) to buy locally anymore.</li>
            <li> Blue Lizard sunscreen is a product I have been using for many, many years.  I am a lap swimmer and I lather it all over my face and neck and docote.  I would not swim without it.  I stay swimming for over an hour and it performs very well.  I keep several bottles in the house at all times.</li>
            <li> Went to Mexico one year with a bottle of this stuff and upon returning back to the US, you should of seen the countless people who either used cheap sun screen or none at all. My wife has a mild skin condition and this stuff has treated us pretty good. I always order 2 bottles at a time. It really blocks UV. If you have any doubts about the UV in the atmosphere just hold the bottle up to the sky and you will know what I mean; the contents will change color in the presence of UV. Stay safe in this sun. I reside in Texas and we use this stuff all through out the year.</li>
            <li> Great product  Limits rays of sun scoring my chest.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. It&#x27;s more fluid than most other zinc based sunscreens, which makes it so easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;I love the bottle that turns blue in the sun. Cute idea.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen on the market.  The sport version goes on much easier than other zinc oxide products.  I highly recommend.  Well worth the price.  Just don&#x27;t use on your dog as zinc oxide isn&#x27;t good for them.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen and got it in a timely fashion.  I can get moisture and coverage in one. It really has saved me from getting any skin cancer and disappears easily.</li>
            <li> Works great! I use it for my tattoo with no issue of irritation.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen around!! its very light and it feels like you are not wearing sunscreen unlike most feel greasy and makes you want to wash your hands after apply.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. I am confident if I have this on, no matter what tropical beach I may be on, or water sport I am doing, I will not get burned.  I&#x27;ve used this product for years!  Last year I was in Maui and forgot my blue lizard and threw on some coppertone instead and it was abysmal! I hopped on Amazon and ordered it to be delivered ASAP so I could finish my vacation without being worried that I&#x27;d keep getting burned.&lt;br /&gt;It does take some effort to get it all rubbed in, but your skin is worth a few extra minutes applying!</li>
            <li> Awesome product, slow delievery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Blue Lizard Australian Sunscreen (Sport) exclusively for about five years. I don&#x27;t know the science behind it. All I know is that it works better than any sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used. Whether hiking in the mountains or working in the yard, I put it on in the morning, and I&#x27;m good for the day. Perspiration (and I&#x27;m a very free perspirer!) never seems to effect it. Two very minor caveats: it will sting your eyes and it&#x27;s a little pricey. Nevertheless, accept no substitute.</li>
            <li> Went on well, stayed on well.  Reef safe. No nasty chemicals.  Great sunscreen for all ages.</li>
            <li> Its dry and long lasting, isint greassey. If applied 20 minutos before sun exposure you get no sunburns at all.</li>
            <li> It simply works.  I have sensitive skin, and often make the comments that I have two colors. pasty white, and lobster red painful burnt.  With this product I never have to worry about the latter.  With others I will still manage to somehow get sunburn, with Blue Lizard it has yet to happen.  As long as I can order this and have it around I will continue to be a loyal customer, and user of Blue Lizard.</li>
            <li> We were told to purchase this brand from my Husbands dermatologist.  It is the best and works and feels great..</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen ever.  I have very fair &amp; sensitive skin.  This went on smooth, did not feel greasy and lasted for hours.  And most important, made in the U.S.A.!!!!  The only sunscreen I will ever buy.  (Yes, the bottle really does turn blue in direct sunlight.)</li>
            <li> Not chemical free as the description claims.  This sunblock contains Octinoxate 7.5%, Octocrylene 2%, Oxybenzone 3%, Zinc Oxide 6%.  As far as I know, the first 3 ingredients are in fact chemical sunblocks.  The blue lizard sensitive has only zinc and titnium but unfortunately, it&#x27;s not water proof.  I think I&#x27;ll go with that one and just re-apply more freq.</li>
            <li> Weeding and Planting in the garden with the sun out. Needed something for the EARs. This is great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You 4youfarm</li>
            <li> An excellent product! I have sensitive skin, and have not had any problems with this product.</li>
            <li> Great sun protection without all the chemicals for all family members.</li>
            <li> I received the Blue Lizard Sports sunscreen for free to test and review, and after researching the ingredients, I&#x27;m very disappointed. I would not use this on myself or my family, even after getting it for free. And obviously, I would not pay for it either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note -- I didn&#x27;t end up using it because of concerns around the ingredients, particularly:&lt;br /&gt;1- OCTINOXATE active ingredient 7.5%&lt;br /&gt;Concerns: Enhanced skin absorption, Biochemical or cellular level changes, Developmental/reproductive toxicity, Endocrine disruption, Allergies/immunotoxicity, Organ system toxicity, Persistence and bioaccumulation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2- OXYBENZONE active ingredient 3%&lt;br /&gt;Concerns: Enhanced skin absorption, Biochemical or cellular level changes, Developmental/reproductive toxicity, Endocrine disruption, Allergies/immunotoxicity, Organ system toxicity, Persistence and bioaccumulation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3- DIAZOLIDINYL UREA (FORMALDEHYDE RELEASER)&lt;br /&gt;Concerns: Cancer, Allergies/immunotoxicity, Contamination concerns&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4- PROPYLPARABEN&lt;br /&gt;Concerns: Developmental/reproductive toxicity, Endocrine disruption, Allergies/immunotoxicity&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This info was taken from the Environmental Working Group website -- http://www.ewg.org/2015sunscreen/about-the-sunscreens/617127/Blue_Lizard_Australian_Sunscreen%2C_Sport%2C_SPF_30%2B/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, I&#x27;m disappointed. I expected more from this brand. There are many other sunscreens out there that are not toxic for either my family nor the environment, work very well, and have a competitive price.</li>
            <li> This is great. My oldest son has very sensitive  skin and with most sunscreen and lotions starts complaining immediately  that &#x27;it burns&amp;#34; but so far this hasn&#x27;t  caused any issues and no sunburn.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, don&#x27;t be fooled by the low spf rating.  The lotion lasts a long time, I don&#x27;t burn from the sun.  Most importantly it doesn&#x27;t have all the harsh chemicals that can irritate your skin and eye&#x27;s god forbid you get the lotion in them.</li>
            <li> I lie in an area with a high iron content in its water. When that water combines with normal sunscreen and my clothes, it oxidizes and produces rust stains on my clothes. This sunscreen prevents that, and ever since using it my clothes are rust free.</li>
            <li> do the job very well under the las vegas sun.better than any sunscreen i brought so far.</li>
            <li> The best!!&lt;br /&gt;So unfortunate that you can&#x27;t find this in the U.S.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m fair skin and just burn - I don&#x27;t tan at all....this stuff was amazing this past summer - bought it specially for our trip to Destin, FL.&lt;br /&gt;DID NOT GET BURNED AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;Love the bottle turns blue when it&#x27;s hit by harmful rays.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on white but it will blend in to the skin. My entire family used it. Bought the sport version becuase of the time spent in the water.&lt;br /&gt;Just wish it came in larger sizes and I guess because of the blend and ingredients they can&#x27;t make this into a spray without loosing the zinc oxide ingredient. I&#x27;m okay with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Won&#x27;t ever go back to the chemical sprays most people use for convenience sake.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Worked very well for me and my granddaughters, ages 3 and 5.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  Very effective, even with my water sports.</li>
            <li> Blue Lizard is the only sunscreen that truly works with my fair skin daughter. Even by or in the water. Recommended to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Thought the price included two bottles not one</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as strong as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin really white, doesn&#x27;t soak in as well as i would have liked.</li>
            <li> I like how light this sunscreen is, as well as how protective it is at the same time. Neat bottle (turns blue when hit with light) that almost acts as a reminder that I should be wearing sunscreen when the color changes.</li>
            <li> The Sport version of this sunblock is just as good as the original and it&#x27;s the best on the market. This actually rubs in a little easier than the regular, but still lasts for hours getting in and out of the water. Can&#x27;t be beat in my opinion and I&#x27;m an easy &amp;#34;burner&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Works really well!  Zinc and titanium oxide are the best ingredients for sun block.</li>
            <li> It was my first time trying it and I really liked it. Vacationed in the Caribbean and never burned. I will defiantly buy this again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a trip to the Caribbean and it was as advertised.  I took it to my dermatologist and they not only highly recommended it, the even sell it!  I paid $5 less online though.  This has been my go to sunscreen ever since.  It applies easily, a little goes a long way and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> My family and I started using Blue Lizard products about 4 years ago when I started getting serious about cycling and triathlons.  I wanted a product that was safe, didn&#x27;t have benzene derivatives, and protected my skin.  While not cheap, this stuff works great and stays on you.  While not as convenient as the spray bottles, it also won&#x27;t potentially kill you like that stuff.  The sprays get in your lungs, on your cars, and in your eyes.  Please stop using the other stuff out there.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best product I have used in a very long time!  I spent hours in the sun (on a boat) - swimming, etc and this worked like a dream! I was disappointed in my previous &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; sunscreen!  I had been using Neutrogena. I don&#x27;t know if they changed what they were doing, my hands broke out in little blisters!  I&#x27;ll gladly stick to Blue Lizard! I am very pleased! 5 stars and for me, well worth the cost!</li>
            <li> It certainly kept the sun from getting through on my face because of the zinc.</li>
            <li> Just used this sunscreen on a week-long beach vacation with lots of sun exposure. Yes, you look like a pale smurf when you first apply it. But it soaks in/fades in a matter of seconds/minutes. I found that if I reapplied when I went inside to use the restroom, I&#x27;d look normal by the time I got back out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also the first time I haven&#x27;t gotten burnt on this annual vacation. This will now be my go-to sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Blue Lizard Sunscreen is a great product. It absorbs well and feels good on skin. Another plus is the fact that there is no annoying scent. I would recommend Blue Lizard without reservation.</li>
            <li> We use this all summer for Junior Lifeguards and no sunburn!</li>
            <li> I am extremely fair and used this on a cruise. I&#x27;ve gotten burnt every summer of my life but very, very little with this product. I spent several days in a tropical sun and just had 3 little sunburn marks! I wish I had known about it sooner.</li>
            <li> Very thin compared  to the tubes I bought at rite aid a while back. Since I can&#x27;t buy this brand locally anymore, I went on amazon. Doesn&#x27;t perform like before, my face gets really hot in a short period of time. Will have to try the tube again next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: So I bought the tube at Walgreens.com and the viscosity of it is thinner than the bottle bought on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe Blue Lizard just changed their formula, I don&#x27;t know. I have two bottles to get through by this summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my Dermatologist recommended this brand, as for now, I&#x27;m just going to use what I have and see if there is anything else that is better.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this brand. Quick ship,and great product. Used on a cruise and very pleased.</li>
            <li> It is a little thin and comes out very fast so watch the kids if you let them use it. It does work well when applied.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my husband&#x27;s dermatologist for keeping melanoma and other skin cancers at bay.  Been using it now for over 10 years.</li>
