            <li>All of the brushes have a protective plastic casing around them, which is nice.</li>

            <li>the brushes are very soft and feel great!!!!</li>
            <li>The brushes (loose)come off the handle VERY easily.</li>
            <li>These were a pretty good deal - despite the (inexpensive) price!</li>
            <li>With good brushes you apply your makeup with a fine hand  </li>
            <li>STUNNING üëèüëèüëèforever loving them and treating them like my babies</li>
            <li>So surprised of how great the quality is !.</li>
            <li>Soft and the perfect amount of stiffness and looseness to the way they glide on your skin...</li>
            <li>the case fits the brushes well, it could be better material but for the price its nice...</li>
            <li>No shedding with soft bristles that pick up powder wonderfully!</li>
            <li>They are soft and just wonderful.</li>
            <li>Love love LOVE these brushes!</li>
            <li>24 brushes might sound too much but trust me when you get it and start performing, it is perfect amount for any girl.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these brushes they are so soft and they work great!</li>
            <li>I quickly found this product and loved the Bobby Brown color.</li>
            <li>She has to brush more (than MAC brushes) to collect and apply make up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that will go away.  </li>
            <li>I tugged on them to make sure they were sturdy, and none of them even budged.</li>
            <li>They were okay.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment and great product</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE THESE BRUSHES.....</li>
            <li>Was able to share some of these.</li>
            <li>Fabulous Bobbi Brown dupes!</li>
            <li>Overall quite happy!</li>
            <li>Would be even better if there wasn&#x27;t branding on the brushes.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe this brushes they are such a good quality for the price use this every day!!!!</li>
            <li>Love the case</li>
            <li>But to many that u dont need.</li>
            <li>Love this set, you have every thing you need and more.</li>
            <li>I think it was mostly the bag, but it doesn&#x27;t make you want to put these things on your face ...</li>
            <li>Love the brushes</li>
            <li>the brushes are okay for the price better then others i have purchase for that price.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I love these make up brushes.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it seems okay.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought these brushes.</li>
            <li>JUST LOVE THEM.</li>
            <li>Love the brushes.</li>
            <li>They feel and look so awesome that I&#x27;ve only used one &amp;</li>
            <li>What a fabulous buy!</li>
            <li>Works perfectly for my needs looks so pretty and brushes are so soft and blends the makeup nicely.</li>
            <li>pretty good quality considering the coast</li>
            <li>but they seem pretty good and they are labeled as well.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a pretty good value and there isn&#x27;t a lot of shedding.</li>
            <li>; I&#x27;m sure it works perfectly fine</li>
            <li>The powder brush is great and soft .</li>
            <li>If there are people out there that are looking to buy a set of brushes or just replace other brushes I would definetely guarantee these they are awesome!!</li>
            <li>Very affordable, quick shipping, high quality, perfect for gift!</li>
            <li>The reviews here are simply too good to be true, unless these brushes perform better with cheaper cosmetic products?!?  </li>
            <li>Fine Brushes.</li>
            <li>But in general they are really smooth and a great quality.</li>
            <li>Got my package quick!</li>
            <li>Very soft, good quality.</li>
            <li>I needed new brushes and these are an excellent replacement for my old set.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge makeup junkie</li>
            <li>However, for this affordable price, I&#x27;m actually quite happy with the quality it is.</li>
            <li>Also they seem cheap .</li>
            <li>Cheaply made in China - hair from brushes was immediately falling out before I even used it.</li>
            <li>What a fantastic bargain.</li>
            <li>but once you wash the brushes before initial use (which you should do anyway lol )</li>
            <li>have used the two largest brushes for make-up and light powder.</li>
            <li>cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Wow wow 24 pcs makeup brush excellent</li>
            <li>i love these brushes and i got them fast :)</li>
            <li>Many brushes for the price, but the whole bag came smelling strongly of chemicals.</li>
            <li>Was happy with the order great deal only thing is brushes at 1st had a smell other</li>
            <li>of the 24 brushes, there&#x27;s only 2-3 that are not as good as the rest.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty decent for the price, i wish they were a little bit more dense though, they eyeshadow brushes were great for blending !!!</li>
            <li>One of my brushes started loosing its hairs but other than that its working great for me</li>
            <li>They did have a light smell when I first opened them, but I believe its just from the bag (it was not unbearable)  </li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t able to really use the large fan brush properly, but it seemed to work nice.</li>
            <li>I had it available for the bridesmaids when they were getting ready and the brushes worked well.</li>
            <li>Brushes have labels which are useful for application.</li>
            <li>I searched the web thinking there has to be a trick to make these absorb more powder, but to my shagrin -- there are no such tricks available.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice economical collection of brushes to start with and try different shapes.  </li>
            <li>worth the money</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>This brush was lovely; it felt soft on the face, no shedding, evenly dispersed the product on my face, and did what it was supposed to do.</li>
            <li>My first impresion: same quality compared to BB or mac, maybe better!</li>
            <li>Other than that great product for starters, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super duper fast.</li>
            <li>was also very pleased that I received them way sooner than the expected delivery date!</li>
            <li>i recommend this product very much.</li>
            <li>really recommend this!</li>
            <li>These are exactly like my Bobbi Brown brushes.  </li>
            <li>I will eventually replace my favorites with higher quality brushes.</li>
            <li>Is exactly how it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li>I first opened the package, I did notice a smell from the case.</li>
            <li>First time I used the eye brush the tip fell off.</li>
            <li>Not like the first set I bought.</li>
            <li>The black roll they came in was a nice quality but did have a bit of a smell.  </li>
            <li>and they are made very well.</li>
            <li>it comes with very neat.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li>They also pick up makeup very well for anyone that was wondering.</li>
            <li>and i really like them.</li>
            <li>It would be very helpful if I can get a picture with what each brush</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re much coarser and stiffer than the rest.</li>
            <li>I recommend them to whoever wants to get brushes</li>
            <li>My own fault for thinking I would save a few bucks by ordering her these brushes.  </li>
            <li>I love the quality look exactly like my Bobbie Brown brushes and half the price.</li>
            <li>Not sure what kind of powder the women are using who are giving this rave reviews.  </li>
            <li>Came with a bunch of different brushes that were cool.</li>
            <li>All  my brushes came earlier than I expected and they were all also labeled which is very helpful for someone if they dont know what kind of brushes they are or what they are used for.</li>
            <li>But overall for the price, these brushes are not bad.</li>
            <li>The smaller brushes may be fine, but they do not feel soft.</li>
            <li>Immediately, they were softer, had less shedding, and more in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But decent.</li>
            <li>I have only used a few of these brushes and they seem to be of good quality.  </li>
            <li>Very soft and gentle to the face.</li>
            <li>As a new in this makeup world, I just would&#x27;ve prefer the brushes to be labeled, so I could use them properly, but other than that I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
            <li>The old adage, you get what you pay for certainly applies</li>
            <li>It feels soft!!</li>
            <li>Plus they&#x27;re soft!!</li>
            <li>&amp; soft!!</li>
            <li>I was impressed with these bad boys</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that will go away in a few days.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe it, so I took her compact and swished the brush for a good 5 minutes, thinking they just needed to be broken in or something.  </li>
            <li>Coming from someone one that gets a new set of brushs about every 6months I decided to see what amazon had to offer and try to save money</li>
            <li>Had to buy a new set</li>
            <li>I was wanting to get a brush set for myself to experience new styles of make up.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone looking to buy new makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve 3 months, I use protector for it and it look new .</li>
            <li>I was very surprised when I got my brushes that they were very soft.</li>
            <li>they are very soft and pick up the make up well.</li>
            <li>And was very surprised with the quality of it.</li>
            <li>I expected something &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; for the price, and instead got a whole, long row of well-made brushes with the most feathery soft bristles.</li>
            <li>Most makeup brush sets, if they come in a large quantity of brushes, you would usually sacrifice the main brushes you&#x27;re looking for such as the foundation brush ,concealor brush, or bronzer brush.</li>
            <li>These brushes met my expectations they are soft and have a variety for the eyes !</li>
            <li>There were a couple of brushes pretty similar.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The bronzer brush wasn&#x27;t too great, but it really wasn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li>,THEY LOOK SO PROFESSIONAL, DONT SHED, MAKE MY MAKE-UP SESSIONS IN THE MORNING EFFORTLESS....</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft, but I don&#x27;t think they are too soft to pick up well.</li>
            <li>Also are still really soft.</li>
            <li>The brushes themselves feel soft.</li>
            <li>The hair of the brush are soft to the skin and does not fray.</li>
            <li>Dragonpad Wisedeal 24 pcs Professional Cosmetic brushes.  </li>
            <li>I like how the brushes are marked for their type.</li>
            <li>They pick up product well, distribute it on the eye lid evenly, and are really soft and gentle.&lt;br /&gt;Overview:&lt;br /&gt;Out</li>
            <li>Bristles are too soft.</li>
            <li>This completely defeats the purpose of the brushes.</li>
            <li>Definitely not too harsh but it was prominent.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no other way to buy all the brushes I want and need without braking the bank</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about how the powder brush actually picks up product, but otherwise, it&#x27;s all fine.</li>
            <li>I like the eyebrow and eye shadow brushes but the larger brushes are too soft.</li>
            <li>Brushes are nice but some of them started shedding the hairs from the very first use which is a bit annoying.</li>
            <li>Some of them very soft, some less, the quality of the product is really high, you can feel it as soon as you touch it.</li>
            <li>The four biggest brushes (Large fan brush, fluffy face brush, bronzer brush, and blush brush) were not as soft as the rest of the brushes.</li>

            <li> These brushes are good quality, but she doesn&#x27;t like them because they don&#x27;t pick up the make up well.  </li>
            <li> Even some brand brush sets are not as good as this one.</li>
            <li> Extremely good buy.</li>
            <li> For the price you pay, this is an extremely good deal.</li>
            <li> These may be a good deal, but the brushes shed.</li>

            <li> The brushes (loose)come off the handle VERY easily.</li>
            <li> These were a pretty good deal - despite the (inexpensive) price!</li>
            <li> With good brushes you apply your makeup with a fine hand  </li>
            <li> STUNNING üëèüëèüëèforever loving them and treating them like my babies</li>
            <li> So surprised of how great the quality is !.</li>
            <li> Soft and the perfect amount of stiffness and looseness to the way they glide on your skin...</li>
            <li> the case fits the brushes well, it could be better material but for the price its nice...</li>
            <li> No shedding with soft bristles that pick up powder wonderfully!</li>
            <li> They are soft and just wonderful.</li>
            <li> Love love LOVE these brushes!</li>
            <li> 24 brushes might sound too much but trust me when you get it and start performing, it is perfect amount for any girl.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes they are so soft and they work great!</li>
            <li> I quickly found this product and loved the Bobby Brown color.</li>
            <li> She has to brush more (than MAC brushes) to collect and apply make up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that will go away.  </li>
            <li> I tugged on them to make sure they were sturdy, and none of them even budged.</li>
            <li> They were okay.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment and great product</li>

            <li> Fabulous Bobbi Brown dupes!</li>
            <li> Overall quite happy!</li>
            <li> Would be even better if there wasn&#x27;t branding on the brushes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this brushes they are such a good quality for the price use this every day!!!!</li>
            <li> Love the case</li>
            <li> But to many that u dont need.</li>
            <li> Love this set, you have every thing you need and more.</li>
            <li> I think it was mostly the bag, but it doesn&#x27;t make you want to put these things on your face ...</li>
            <li> Love the brushes</li>
            <li> the brushes are okay for the price better then others i have purchase for that price.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> I love these make up brushes.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it seems okay.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought these brushes.</li>
            <li> JUST LOVE THEM.</li>
            <li> Love the brushes.</li>
            <li> They feel and look so awesome that I&#x27;ve only used one &amp;</li>
            <li> What a fabulous buy!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for my needs looks so pretty and brushes are so soft and blends the makeup nicely.</li>
            <li> pretty good quality considering the coast</li>
            <li> but they seem pretty good and they are labeled as well.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a pretty good value and there isn&#x27;t a lot of shedding.</li>
            <li> ; I&#x27;m sure it works perfectly fine</li>
            <li> The powder brush is great and soft .</li>
            <li> If there are people out there that are looking to buy a set of brushes or just replace other brushes I would definetely guarantee these they are awesome!!</li>
            <li> Very affordable, quick shipping, high quality, perfect for gift!</li>
            <li> The reviews here are simply too good to be true, unless these brushes perform better with cheaper cosmetic products?!?  </li>
            <li> Fine Brushes.</li>
            <li> But in general they are really smooth and a great quality.</li>
            <li> Got my package quick!</li>
            <li> Very soft, good quality.</li>
            <li> I needed new brushes and these are an excellent replacement for my old set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge makeup junkie</li>
            <li> However, for this affordable price, I&#x27;m actually quite happy with the quality it is.</li>
            <li> Also they seem cheap .</li>
            <li> Cheaply made in China - hair from brushes was immediately falling out before I even used it.</li>
            <li> What a fantastic bargain.</li>
            <li> but once you wash the brushes before initial use (which you should do anyway lol )</li>
            <li> have used the two largest brushes for make-up and light powder.</li>
            <li> cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Wow wow 24 pcs makeup brush excellent</li>
            <li> i love these brushes and i got them fast :)</li>
            <li> Many brushes for the price, but the whole bag came smelling strongly of chemicals.</li>
            <li> Was happy with the order great deal only thing is brushes at 1st had a smell other</li>
            <li> of the 24 brushes, there&#x27;s only 2-3 that are not as good as the rest.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty decent for the price, i wish they were a little bit more dense though, they eyeshadow brushes were great for blending !!!</li>
            <li> One of my brushes started loosing its hairs but other than that its working great for me</li>
            <li> They did have a light smell when I first opened them, but I believe its just from the bag (it was not unbearable)  </li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t able to really use the large fan brush properly, but it seemed to work nice.</li>
            <li> I had it available for the bridesmaids when they were getting ready and the brushes worked well.</li>
            <li> Brushes have labels which are useful for application.</li>
            <li> I searched the web thinking there has to be a trick to make these absorb more powder, but to my shagrin -- there are no such tricks available.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice economical collection of brushes to start with and try different shapes.  </li>
            <li> worth the money</li>
            <li> Worth every penny</li>
            <li> This brush was lovely; it felt soft on the face, no shedding, evenly dispersed the product on my face, and did what it was supposed to do.</li>
            <li> My first impresion: same quality compared to BB or mac, maybe better!</li>
            <li> Other than that great product for starters, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super duper fast.</li>
            <li> was also very pleased that I received them way sooner than the expected delivery date!</li>
            <li> i recommend this product very much.</li>
            <li> really recommend this!</li>
            <li> These are exactly like my Bobbi Brown brushes.  </li>
            <li> I will eventually replace my favorites with higher quality brushes.</li>
            <li> Is exactly how it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li> I first opened the package, I did notice a smell from the case.</li>
            <li> First time I used the eye brush the tip fell off.</li>
            <li> Not like the first set I bought.</li>
            <li> The black roll they came in was a nice quality but did have a bit of a smell.  </li>
            <li> and they are made very well.</li>
            <li> it comes with very neat.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> They also pick up makeup very well for anyone that was wondering.</li>
            <li> and i really like them.</li>
            <li> It would be very helpful if I can get a picture with what each brush</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re much coarser and stiffer than the rest.</li>
            <li> I recommend them to whoever wants to get brushes</li>
            <li> My own fault for thinking I would save a few bucks by ordering her these brushes.  </li>
            <li> I love the quality look exactly like my Bobbie Brown brushes and half the price.</li>
            <li> Not sure what kind of powder the women are using who are giving this rave reviews.  </li>
            <li> Came with a bunch of different brushes that were cool.</li>
            <li> All  my brushes came earlier than I expected and they were all also labeled which is very helpful for someone if they dont know what kind of brushes they are or what they are used for.</li>
            <li> But overall for the price, these brushes are not bad.</li>
            <li> The smaller brushes may be fine, but they do not feel soft.</li>
            <li> Immediately, they were softer, had less shedding, and more in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But decent.</li>
            <li> I have only used a few of these brushes and they seem to be of good quality.  </li>
            <li> Very soft and gentle to the face.</li>
            <li> As a new in this makeup world, I just would&#x27;ve prefer the brushes to be labeled, so I could use them properly, but other than that I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
            <li> The old adage, you get what you pay for certainly applies</li>
            <li> It feels soft!!</li>
            <li> Plus they&#x27;re soft!!</li>
            <li> &amp; soft!!</li>
            <li> I was impressed with these bad boys</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that will go away in a few days.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it, so I took her compact and swished the brush for a good 5 minutes, thinking they just needed to be broken in or something.  </li>
            <li> Coming from someone one that gets a new set of brushs about every 6months I decided to see what amazon had to offer and try to save money</li>
            <li> Had to buy a new set</li>
            <li> I was wanting to get a brush set for myself to experience new styles of make up.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone looking to buy new makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve 3 months, I use protector for it and it look new .</li>
            <li> I was very surprised when I got my brushes that they were very soft.</li>
            <li> they are very soft and pick up the make up well.</li>
            <li> And was very surprised with the quality of it.</li>
            <li> I expected something &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; for the price, and instead got a whole, long row of well-made brushes with the most feathery soft bristles.</li>
            <li> Most makeup brush sets, if they come in a large quantity of brushes, you would usually sacrifice the main brushes you&#x27;re looking for such as the foundation brush ,concealor brush, or bronzer brush.</li>
            <li> These brushes met my expectations they are soft and have a variety for the eyes !</li>
            <li> There were a couple of brushes pretty similar.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The bronzer brush wasn&#x27;t too great, but it really wasn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> ,THEY LOOK SO PROFESSIONAL, DONT SHED, MAKE MY MAKE-UP SESSIONS IN THE MORNING EFFORTLESS....</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft, but I don&#x27;t think they are too soft to pick up well.</li>
            <li> Also are still really soft.</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves feel soft.</li>
            <li> The hair of the brush are soft to the skin and does not fray.</li>
            <li> Dragonpad Wisedeal 24 pcs Professional Cosmetic brushes.  </li>
            <li> I like how the brushes are marked for their type.</li>
            <li> They pick up product well, distribute it on the eye lid evenly, and are really soft and gentle.&lt;br /&gt;Overview:&lt;br /&gt;Out</li>
            <li> Bristles are too soft.</li>
            <li> This completely defeats the purpose of the brushes.</li>
            <li> Definitely not too harsh but it was prominent.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no other way to buy all the brushes I want and need without braking the bank</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about how the powder brush actually picks up product, but otherwise, it&#x27;s all fine.</li>
            <li> I like the eyebrow and eye shadow brushes but the larger brushes are too soft.</li>
            <li> Brushes are nice but some of them started shedding the hairs from the very first use which is a bit annoying.</li>
            <li> Some of them very soft, some less, the quality of the product is really high, you can feel it as soon as you touch it.</li>
            <li> The four biggest brushes (Large fan brush, fluffy face brush, bronzer brush, and blush brush) were not as soft as the rest of the brushes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t plan on sending them back as I feel it took too long to get them to begin with.</li>
            <li> the other set was just blank and smaller.</li>
            <li> but I expected the eye brushes to have the same bristles as the face brushes.</li>
            <li> Not a happy camper right now üò†</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shipping this back today, and VERY angry, because my wife threw away $200 worth of old Bobbi Brown brushes when she received this gift.  </li>
            <li> But I have to admit, the bristles on that brush (as well as on one other eye shadow brush) are different than the rest.</li>
            <li> I swirled them on a towel to dry them, combed through them with an eyebrow/eyelash comb, and also trimmed some of the strands that were longer than the shape of the brush.</li>
            <li> And if the product description wasn&#x27;t specific enough they are made of persian horse hairs and synthetic bristles except for the foundation brush and a select few of the eyeshadow brushes and lip, eyeliner, concealer brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not normally someone who reviews things I buy on Amazon, but for these I had to!</li>
            <li> I thought from the photo this palette would consist of neutral browns and creams but the shadows are pink.</li>
            <li> Next, I used my fluffy powder brush.</li>
            <li> Not really a make up person, but wanted some brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes should be labeled so as to know what each one does because for a normal person that has no knowledge in cosmetology, it can be very confusing to know what to do with each brush.</li>
            <li> but no worries there are plenty of other brushes for The eyes.</li>
            <li> I looked at all kinds of reviews on other make up brushes before buying these.</li>
            <li> like I read on the review of other brushes.</li>
            <li> it Was delivered as advertised, the only bad thing is that there was two items missing, but not a big deal for me as I don&#x27;t really use the two missing brushes (which I think were for eyeshadow)</li>
            <li> I wanted to pick up a few new brushes (fan, etc.), but buying brushes individually can be very expensive.  </li>
            <li> I must say, I&#x27;ve had them for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I use these brushes literally everyday, they do not shed and they pick up the makeup well.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> These brushes shed a lot I was not pleased ..</li>
            <li> Not sure how to deal with that.</li>
            <li> The second set is horrible and I have 2 of the same brushes in the same case.</li>
            <li> Mine hardly lasted 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Wash them before u use them, and the brush roll needs to be wiped down cause of the chemical smell!!!</li>
            <li> The Kingmys Pro 28 color palette is not a good palette at ALL in my opinion.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not good</li>
            <li> It is not what I spected, two brushes was broken and brushes lose hair every time I use it.</li>
            <li> All the bristles break off and stay behind √°tico on skin.</li>
            <li> My brushes weren&#x27;t labeled and I&#x27;m seriously confused as to what each brush is for.</li>
            <li> Two of the brushes were broken on arrival and another brush appears to have what appears to be glue in  the bristles.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all :(</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> Bad quality.</li>
            <li> but I HATE how they smell.</li>
            <li> these brushes work terribly!</li>
            <li> These brushes were terrible.</li>

            <li> Wow wow 24 pcs makeup brush excellent</li>
            <li> perfect, as I was expecting</li>
            <li> The brushes (loose)come off the handle VERY easily. But overall like the brushes after I reinforced them.</li>
            <li> I Love This product, great For the price the brushes are very soft and feel great!!!! it Was delivered as advertised, the only bad thing is that there was two items missing, but not a big deal for me as I don&#x27;t really use the two missing brushes (which I think were for eyeshadow) but no worries there are plenty of other brushes for The eyes. Other than that great product for starters, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> really nice. just missing some brushes i really needed</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time. For the price, the item is good but I expected the eye brushes to have the same bristles as the face brushes.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife because this set has nice reviews.  These brushes are good quality, but she doesn&#x27;t like them because they don&#x27;t pick up the make up well.  She has to brush more (than MAC brushes) to collect and apply make up.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing! I&#x27;m not normally someone who reviews things I buy on Amazon, but for these I had to! My brushes came 2 days before their earliest estimated delivery date. I&#x27;d hears from several reviewers that their brushes were not labelled...mine were however. All of the brushes have a protective plastic casing around them, which is nice. And they are they SOFTEST brush bristles I&#x27;ve ever felt. The black roll they came in was a nice quality but did have a bit of a smell.  I&#x27;m sure that will go away.  The handles are solid. I tugged on them to make sure they were sturdy, and none of them even budged. For the price...great brushes!</li>
            <li> They were okay. You get what you pay for. But decent.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the brushes</li>
            <li> My package was said to arrive on August 13-27. It just arrived now 7/29. Great Product. No shedding. No stench from the case. Just perfect! Although the package I received came with an eyelash brush and a makeup sponge outside the case.  I recommend 100%(:</li>
            <li> Fast shipment and great product</li>
            <li> Coming from someone one that gets a new set of brushs about every 6months I decided to see what amazon had to offer and try to save money I was impressed with these bad boys pretty good quality considering the coast I would totally get them again</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE BRUSHES.....GREAT QUALITY,THEY LOOK SO PROFESSIONAL, DONT SHED, MAKE MY MAKE-UP SESSIONS IN THE MORNING EFFORTLESS.... THEY ALSO ARRIVED IN TIME</li>
            <li> great for the price not complaints at all.</li>
            <li> It is not what I spected, two brushes was broken and brushes lose hair every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Very soft and gentle to the face.</li>
            <li> Got my package quick! It feels soft!! Hope it works as good as they look! Im getting these for my friends bday and hope she loves them!!</li>
            <li> Set as described. Works well with my makeup. Would recommend to friends. Brushes have labels which are useful for application.</li>
            <li> STUNNING üëèüëèüëèforever loving them and treating them like my babies ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòòüòòüëçüëçüëç</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all :( Had to buy a new set</li>
            <li> I buy 2 set of 24 and one of then came with only 22</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes for great value.  There&#x27;s no other way to buy all the brushes I want and need without braking the bank and I&#x27;m a thrifter and don&#x27;t believe insuring retail.</li>
            <li> A lot of brushes! Was able to share some of these.</li>
            <li> If not considering the price, I won&#x27;t give these brushes a 4 star. However, for this affordable price, I&#x27;m actually quite happy with the quality it is.</li>
            <li> Bad quality. They will fall apart. Mine hardly lasted 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> These brushes met my expectations they are soft and have a variety for the eyes ! I would definitely recommend these to anyone that loves makeup. The powder brush is great and soft .</li>
            <li> Fabulous Bobbi Brown dupes! I&#x27;m a huge makeup junkie and I was really happy to see that the brushes were labeled (it just helps, I don&#x27;t care who you are). The bristles are soft, but I don&#x27;t think they are too soft to pick up well. I needed new brushes and these are an excellent replacement for my old set. Overall quite happy!</li>
            <li> Please do not buy! The brushes do not pick up the make up well. Also hairs fall off and then you have to Wipe your face. Please don&#x27;t ... Save your money</li>
            <li> Brushes fell apart as soon as I washed them.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised when I got my brushes that they were very soft. I have used they a lot of times including I washed them in between uses to see how they held up and they are made very well. Also are still really soft. Not to say that they came on time.</li>
            <li> I love the quality look exactly like my Bobbie Brown brushes and half the price. Would be even better if there wasn&#x27;t branding on the brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought them as a gift and they look great. They do have a smell to them (I think its from the plastic case they come in). The brushes themselves feel soft.</li>
            <li> Nice set. I needed to get some makeup for a wedding. I had it available for the bridesmaids when they were getting ready and the brushes worked well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this brushes they are such a good quality for the price use this every day!!!! really recommend this!</li>
            <li> great product, great seller</li>
            <li> The Kingmys Pro 28 color palette is not a good palette at ALL in my opinion. The shades lack pigment.  I thought from the photo this palette would consist of neutral browns and creams but the shadows are pink.</li>
            <li> Not sure what kind of powder the women are using who are giving this rave reviews.  Wife got this for Xmas and tested it for several days using Bobbi Brown powder, and well as Lancome.  To her dismay, the brush wouldn&#x27;t pick up ANY of the powder.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it, so I took her compact and swished the brush for a good 5 minutes, thinking they just needed to be broken in or something.  Same results -- Zero powder adhered to the brush.  I searched the web thinking there has to be a trick to make these absorb more powder, but to my shagrin -- there are no such tricks available.  I&#x27;m shipping this back today, and VERY angry, because my wife threw away $200 worth of old Bobbi Brown brushes when she received this gift.  Now I&#x27;m going to have to shell out big bucks for her to replace those.  My own fault for thinking I would save a few bucks by ordering her these brushes.  The reviews here are simply too good to be true, unless these brushes perform better with cheaper cosmetic products?!?  Thank Gawd for Amazon Prime!</li>
            <li> I was wanting to get a brush set for myself to experience new styles of make up. I quickly found this product and loved the Bobby Brown color. 24 brushes might sound too much but trust me when you get it and start performing, it is perfect amount for any girl. Some of them very soft, some less, the quality of the product is really high, you can feel it as soon as you touch it. Even some brand brush sets are not as good as this one. Very affordable, quick shipping, high quality, perfect for gift! I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> These are exactly like my Bobbi Brown brushes.  Extremely good buy.</li>
            <li> This is a nice economical collection of brushes to start with and try different shapes.  I will eventually replace my favorites with higher quality brushes.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super duper fast. No shedding, i love it great price for great quality. Just bought my sister one! Love the case it comes with very neat.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend love it, i just gave it as a gift for christmas her,  and she loved it! . .</li>
            <li> So surprised of how great the quality is !. amazing ‚Ñ¢.</li>
            <li> Came with a bunch of different brushes that were cool. But to many that u dont need. Also they seem cheap . The heads keep falling off the stck and i literally only used it 3 times. Sorry</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty decent for the price, i wish they were a little bit more dense though, they eyeshadow brushes were great for blending !!!</li>
            <li> Love this set, you have every thing you need and more. Will def buy this again when its time to replace. Soft and the perfect amount of stiffness and looseness to the way they glide on your skin...the case fits the brushes well, it could be better material but for the price its nice...</li>
            <li> Was happy with the order great deal only thing is brushes at 1st had a smell other then that happy with my order</li>
            <li> I just got my brushes, i havent used them as yet but they seem pretty good and they are labeled as well.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like you can get the someone for 13.00&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this for enyone it&#x27;s not good</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes they are so soft and they work great! All  my brushes came earlier than I expected and they were all also labeled which is very helpful for someone if they dont know what kind of brushes they are or what they are used for. If there are people out there that are looking to buy a set of brushes or just replace other brushes I would definetely guarantee these they are awesome!! They also pick up makeup very well for anyone that was wondering. And if the product description wasn&#x27;t specific enough they are made of persian horse hairs and synthetic bristles except for the foundation brush and a select few of the eyeshadow brushes and lip, eyeliner, concealer brushes. ENJOY!!</li>
            <li> Very good! My first impresion: same quality compared to BB or mac, maybe better! I will see how they work!</li>
            <li> I like how the brushes look &amp; I also like the hair but I HATE how they smell.</li>
            <li> Many brushes for the price, but the whole bag came smelling strongly of chemicals. I think it was mostly the bag, but it doesn&#x27;t make you want to put these things on your face ...</li>
            <li> Perfect! Love the brushes</li>
            <li> Love love LOVE these brushes! Very satisfied with this purchase!</li>
            <li> These brushes shed a lot I was not pleased ..</li>
            <li> Bought them for my mom and she LOVES them.&lt;br /&gt;My brother saw them and said &amp;#34;where did you get them? I want them too!&amp;#34; and I said &amp;#34;for your girlfriend right?&amp;#34; LOL it makes a great gift guys! worth the money</li>
            <li> Great brushes , they fit my needs.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made in China - hair from brushes was immediately falling out before I even used it. Send it back</li>
            <li> the brushes are okay for the price better then others i have purchase for that price. but i got sent two different kinds one brush set had the description and what the brush was, which was great the other set was just blank and smaller.</li>
            <li> Brushes are nice but some of them started shedding the hairs from the very first use which is a bit annoying.</li>
            <li> All the bristles break off and stay behind √°tico on skin. Regret buying them.</li>
            <li> these brushes work terribly! The leather case also smells like ass</li>
            <li> These brushes were terrible. The hair falls out and like others have said, they don&#x27;t pick up powder. I don&#x27;t recommend them at all.</li>
            <li> Perfect I loved them!!!</li>
            <li> Great brushes. Happy with the product</li>
            <li> Fine Brushes. The hair of the brush are soft to the skin and does not fray. I am very pleased with the product. 100% recommended üëçüèºüíÑüëàüèº</li>
            <li> Very Impressed with these brushes.</li>
            <li> Great value &amp; quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I was unsure of what I would have received based on the mixed reviews.  I am happy to report that the brushes I got today were fantastic!  No shedding with soft bristles that pick up powder wonderfully! They were even labeled! What a fantastic bargain.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for my needs looks so pretty and brushes are so soft and blends the makeup nicely. Would  definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> There were a couple of brushes pretty similar. But in general they are really smooth and a great quality. I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> One of my brushes started loosing its hairs but other than that its working great for me</li>
            <li> Just got it today, 2 weeks before the estimated date. I haven&#x27;t use them yet but I love it!! Is exactly how it looks in the picture. As a new in this makeup world, I just would&#x27;ve prefer the brushes to be labeled, so I could use them properly, but other than that I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality great buy</li>
            <li> Dragonpad Wisedeal 24 pcs Professional Cosmetic brushes.  Wow!  There are so brushes in this kit.  I wanted to pick up a few new brushes (fan, etc.), but buying brushes individually can be very expensive.  I have only used a few of these brushes and they seem to be of good quality.  I am happy with my purchase and recommend this set of brushes.</li>
            <li> i love these brushes and i got them fast :)</li>
            <li> I love them. Worth every penny and they&#x27;re labeled. Plus they&#x27;re soft!!</li>
            <li> I looked at all kinds of reviews on other make up brushes before buying these. I must say, I&#x27;ve had them for a few weeks now and i really like them. they are very soft and pick up the make up well. I haven&#x27;t had any of them shed or anything, like I read on the review of other brushes. I like how the brushes are marked for their type. Had they not had that, I would not know what to do with so many of them! Great brushes at a good price!</li>
            <li> I read a comment on here saying that the brushes were labeled which is why I purchased them. My brushes weren&#x27;t labeled and I&#x27;m seriously confused as to what each brush is for. It would be very helpful if I can get a picture with what each brush is.&lt;br /&gt;First Impression:&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the package, I did notice a smell from the case. Definitely not too harsh but it was prominent. I&#x27;m sure that will go away in a few days. The four biggest brushes (Large fan brush, fluffy face brush, bronzer brush, and blush brush) were not as soft as the rest of the brushes. They also had some shedding going on.&lt;br /&gt;Care:&lt;br /&gt;So I washed those brushes with a baby shampoo, water, and olive oil mixture. I swirled them on a towel to dry them, combed through them with an eyebrow/eyelash comb, and also trimmed some of the strands that were longer than the shape of the brush. Immediately, they were softer, had less shedding, and more in place.&lt;br /&gt;Application:&lt;br /&gt;I used the foundation brush and wasn&#x27;t really impressed, but this is because I prefer to use a sponge; I&#x27;m sure it works perfectly fine but I just don&#x27;t know how to work with it. Next, I used my fluffy powder brush. This brush was lovely; it felt soft on the face, no shedding, evenly dispersed the product on my face, and did what it was supposed to do. I don&#x27;t necessarily have a highlighter so I wasn&#x27;t able to really use the large fan brush properly, but it seemed to work nice. The bronzer brush wasn&#x27;t too great, but it really wasn&#x27;t too bad. It&#x27;s usable for my standards. Now the blush brush was still a bit damp when I used it, so it didn&#x27;t preform up to standards. But I have to admit, the bristles on that brush (as well as on one other eye shadow brush) are different than the rest. They&#x27;re much coarser and stiffer than the rest. As for the eye shadow brushes, these seem wonderful. Now, I&#x27;ll take into account that I only used three brushes, but they all have the same feel and texture. They pick up product well, distribute it on the eye lid evenly, and are really soft and gentle.&lt;br /&gt;Overview:&lt;br /&gt;Out of the 24 brushes, there&#x27;s only 2-3 that are not as good as the rest. For the price you pay, this is an extremely good deal. Every brush is usable and the eye shadow brushes are amazing. The brushes should be labeled so as to know what each one does because for a normal person that has no knowledge in cosmetology, it can be very confusing to know what to do with each brush.</li>
            <li> Bristles are too soft. No foundation brush.</li>
            <li> I love these make up brushes. They are inexpensive and do their job. My friend recommended them and I was hesitant about ordering them. But I like them alot. Rated them a 9.5</li>
            <li> All brushes are soft.&lt;br /&gt;They are not labeled which I didn&#x27;t like. Two of the brushes were broken on arrival and another brush appears to have what appears to be glue in  the bristles. Not sure how to deal with that. I don&#x27;t plan on sending them back as I feel it took too long to get them to begin with. Otherwise it seems okay.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a  variety of brushes with great quality and these brushes were exactly what I was hoping for and more!!! :) Absolutley great product!!!  Most makeup brush sets, if they come in a large quantity of brushes, you would usually sacrifice the main brushes you&#x27;re looking for such as the foundation brush ,concealor brush, or bronzer brush. But with this set, I didnt have to go without those key brushes and there are a variety of shadow brushes in this set that allows me limitless possibilities with shading. I use these brushes literally everyday, they do not shed and they pick up the makeup well. They did have a light smell when I first opened them, but I believe its just from the bag (it was not unbearable)  but once you wash the brushes before initial use (which you should do anyway lol ) the smell goes away.  Would definately recommend.</li>
            <li> Exceeded expectations. Love them!</li>
            <li> Only one of the brushes sheds it&#x27;s one of the eyeshadow ones.. However this is a great set and amazing quality... Wash them before u use them, and the brush roll needs to be wiped down cause of the chemical smell!!! So happy I got these great addition to my kit</li>
            <li> Awesome quality, and very fast shipping!! My wife is very happy with her set!! And I am very very happy for that to.</li>
            <li> I love them. They are soft and just wonderful. I&#x27;m glad I bought these brushes. I recommend them to whoever wants to get brushes</li>
            <li> I JUST LOVE THESE, THE MATERIAL IS GREAT &amp; THEIR BIG.I WOULD PROBABLY BUY MORE THINGS FROM THIS COMPANY.I JUST LOVE THEM.</li>
            <li> These may be a good deal, but the brushes shed. With good brushes you apply your makeup with a fine hand  and the makeup stays on your face without having to pick minute shreds of brush hair. This completely defeats the purpose of the brushes. When you remove the brush hairs, you remove some of the make up and have to reapply. Does this make sense, no!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the two largest brushes for make-up and light powder. Never again. The smaller brushes may be fine, but they do not feel soft. The old adage, you get what you pay for certainly applies here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not Recommended For Me. 07-05-14</li>
            <li> Love the brushes. Not really a make up person, but wanted some brushes. Great price for the item.</li>
            <li> Great brushes.  I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with these brushes. Very soft, good quality. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price. Would recommend to anyone looking to buy new makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> I like the eyebrow and eye shadow brushes but the larger brushes are too soft. They do not hold powders well. But overall for the price, these brushes are not bad.</li>
            <li> they are the best &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> i recommend this product very much. My wife loved it. And was very surprised with the quality of it. You should try it.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing!! &amp; soft!! They feel and look so awesome that I&#x27;ve only used one &amp; I Dont want to ruin them</li>
            <li> Wow! What a fabulous buy! I expected something &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; for the price, and instead got a whole, long row of well-made brushes with the most feathery soft bristles. They feel so nice when using them. This is a set I would buy again as a gift for a friend.</li>
            <li> When I saw the price and the product is 24 pcs, yes! The review help me to know if I buy it. Now I&#x27;ve my 24 pcs and look great and good product. I&#x27;ve 3 months, I use protector for it and it look new . I recommend it.</li>
            <li> These were a pretty good deal - despite the (inexpensive) price! You never know what the quality is going to be like from a picture so I was very pleased.  The hairs stay in tact after washing- I&#x27;ve had $40 brushes that weren&#x27;t as good as these so I say it&#x27;s an all around great bargain.&lt;br /&gt;I was also very pleased that I received them way sooner than the expected delivery date!</li>
            <li> great product, quick shipment. thank you</li>
            <li> cheaply made. First time I used the eye brush the tip fell off.</li>
            <li> bristles fell out the same day we got it.</li>
            <li> Not like the first set I bought. I was very happy with the first set because it was labeled and worked well. The second set is horrible and I have 2 of the same brushes in the same case. Some of the bristles fell out the eyeshadow brush. Not a happy camper right now üò†</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes. The variety of shapes and textures provided is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for my daughter and when it arrived I knew I had to have a set myself.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a pretty good value and there isn&#x27;t a lot of shedding. I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about how the powder brush actually picks up product, but otherwise, it&#x27;s all fine.</li>
