            <li>It smells absolutely delicious.  </li>
            <li>It was a gift for my wife who wanted it, so she is very happy.</li>
            <li>Just like the body wash and the lotion, the candle smells as beautiful too.</li>
            <li>The glass is beautiful, Id like to save it once the candle is finished.</li>
            <li>Very nice glass cup it comes in.</li>
            <li>Havent burned yet, however - the candle itself smells amazing!</li>
            <li>Got this for my mom for mother&#x27;s day and she loved it.</li>
            <li>I have also loved Thymes Eucalyptus Body Lotion for years.  </li>

            <li>My favorite candle ever!  </li>
            <li>I love this Eucalyptus candle, the scent is divine!</li>
            <li>Nice candle that burns well and smells nice, but it is just a candle.</li>
            <li>Nice detail on the candle too.</li>
            <li>They burn cleanly and make a great gift, as well.</li>
            <li>Purchased this Eucalyptus candle directly from Thymes expecting the wonderful fragrance I get from their lotions.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like being in a spa, beautifully refreshing smell.</li>
            <li>I have been enjoying this candle for almost 20 years.  </li>
            <li>I love this Thymes scent in every product they offer this scent in.  </li>
            <li>send one to all your favorite friends</li>
            <li>I love the scents and the quality of these candles.</li>
            <li>, It just doesn&#x27;t get any better.</li>
            <li>Smells ok, but is much more perfume-y than I was expecting, and doesn&#x27;t really smell like eucalyptus at all to me!</li>
            <li>You almost don&#x27;t even need to light the candle for the smell to fill the room.</li>
            <li>What a clean, fresh smelling candle.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased overall!</li>
            <li>I wish it had the more natural smell I was anticipating.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>clean fresh scent of Eucalyptus greets me and relaxes the core of me.&lt;br /&gt;Making me human again and ready to enjoy my refuge from the storm of life.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>love it, wish it was bigger</li>
            <li>Love that I can smell the fragrance from outside of the box.  </li>
            <li>These products are a cut above and are very special.</li>
            <li>I recently ordered one that was damaged during delivery, and the guys over at \\&quot;fine gifts</li>
            <li>Lovely, lovely aroma, first time to enjoy this specific Thymes candle, and I must share that I&#x27;ve come to love the Thymes aromatic candles, as I have purchased several different ones by now --- can&#x27;t go wrong investing in one of these.</li>
            <li>Super fragrant and fills up my entire 1500 square foot home!</li>
            <li>The candle burns cleanly and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>Have purchased Thymes candles in the past for their lovely frangrance.  </li>
            <li>I light it on my most stressful days and sit in a quiet room and breath deeply as the stress slowly melts</li>
            <li>This is the most delectable fragrance candle I&#x27;ve found lately.  </li>
            <li>A little pricey with my budget but worth it.  </li>

            <li> There are other fragrances in the Thymes collection</li>
            <li> This candle had little frangrance - must be a misfit/throw-away.  </li>

            <li> Just like the body wash and the lotion, the candle smells as beautiful too. You won&#x27;t want to leave your room after this candle. It&#x27;s like being in a spa, beautifully refreshing smell.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom for mother&#x27;s day and she loved it. You almost don&#x27;t even need to light the candle for the smell to fill the room. Great price for it too!</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying this candle for almost 20 years.  It smells absolutely delicious.  My mother loves them too, and I often give it as a present.  I recently ordered one that was damaged during delivery, and the guys over at \\&quot;fine gifts soaps\\&quot; sent us a new one, free of charge, even though I had thrown it away before having taken a photo (my bad).  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Expensive for the size - next time Yankee will get the money for a similar scent - just bigger.  Very nice glass cup it comes in.</li>
            <li> Havent burned yet, however - the candle itself smells amazing! Saving to use in our guest room for house-guests this weekend. The glass is beautiful, Id like to save it once the candle is finished.</li>
            <li> Nice candle that burns well and smells nice, but it is just a candle. It was a gift for my wife who wanted it, so she is very happy. In my frugal humble opinion it is grossly overpriced</li>

            <li> This is the most delectable fragrance candle I&#x27;ve found lately.  There are other fragrances in the Thymes collection but I&#x27;m super-sold on the Eucalyptus.  The candle burns cleanly and lasts a long time.  The price offered through Amazon is also a treat compared to what I&#x27;ve paid in gift stores and boutiques.  I have used this candle as a &amp;#34;just because&amp;#34; gift or hostess gift as well as treating myself too.  I have also loved Thymes Eucalyptus Body Lotion for years.  These products are a cut above and are very special.</li>
            <li> Where have you been all my life??!!!  What a clean, fresh smelling candle. I love (luv!) the smell of eucalyptus. A little pricey with my budget but worth it.  Nice detail on the candle too.</li>
            <li> My favorite candle ever!  It arrived within the designated timeframe.  It was well packed to prevent breakage.  I was very pleased overall!</li>
            <li> The wax didn&#x27;t melt evenly.  A waste of money!</li>
            <li> love it, wish it was bigger</li>

I light it on my most stressful days and sit in a quiet room and breath deeply as the stress slowly melts away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine a candle that brings you peace, It just doesn&#x27;t get any better.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to open my door when I get home.&lt;br /&gt;The clean fresh scent of Eucalyptus greets me and relaxes the core of me.&lt;br /&gt;Making me human again and ready to enjoy my refuge from the storm of life.</li>
            <li> Purchased this Eucalyptus candle directly from Thymes expecting the wonderful fragrance I get from their lotions. I was very disappointed. The candle gives of no aroma at all. Very disappointing.</li>
