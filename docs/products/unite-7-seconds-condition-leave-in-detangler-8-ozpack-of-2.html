            <li>This is a great product and it I got it very fast.</li>
            <li>I have used many of their products (came recommended by my hairstylist).</li>
            <li>But its so great that i don&#x27;t even wanna complain too much haha.</li>
            <li>I love this product and ran out.</li>
            <li>I was completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Glad I now have a way to purchase it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I can not find anything better for both my girls hair and mine.</li>
            <li>Detangles, smooths, and leaves healthy without static.</li>
            <li>And, it&#x27;s cruelty free, which is a must!</li>
            <li>The product I love.</li>
            <li>I bought another product that is excellent that goes with his product for culy hair by the same maker.&lt;br /&gt;The packages was aweful.</li>
            <li>I was given a sample from my hair stylist and when presented with it&#x27;s price for the full size bottle I honestly had sticker shock.</li>
            <li>Pretty good at detangling the hair.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy to know my hair is receiving minimal damage when brushing it out after a shower.  </li>
            <li>I gave the other bottle as a gift to a Loved One and hope this product never gets discontinued!!!</li>
            <li>Works well for fine hair that tangles easily after showering.</li>
            <li>my fine hair curls manageable.</li>
            <li>To make sure my hair hadn&#x27;t just changed, I used some left over Unite product the next day and my hair was perfect.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be better because my hair stylist really hyped it up!</li>
            <li>I have tried all types of detangling products (sprays for kids, special combs and brushes designed for detangling, and on and on....)</li>
            <li>I love that this seller offers a two pack since I go through it so quickly.</li>
            <li>it came in a larger more economical bottle it would rate five stars.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product for my light blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>Unite&#x27;s has a distinctive sweet-floral smell, which drew me to it in the first place.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it really makes your hair softer, smoother and shiny!</li>
            <li>Will purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first leave-in product that tamed my hair of fizziness.</li>
            <li>Just 5 or 6 sprays on wet hair makes it easy to comb and leaves it feeling smooth and</li>
            <li>It all works wonderfully and a VERY little goes a LONG ways!</li>
            <li>Because I have long hair, I have to use more than the directions tell you to use.......</li>
            <li>Possibly not for every hair type but for my long, fine, tangly hair it works better than any other detangler out there if which I have tried many.</li>
            <li>/&gt;According to her, this really deserves 5 stars as a product--</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper then getting at a salon</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair soft and manageable especially since I highlight it once a month:)</li>
            <li>Keeps my daughter&#x27;s extremely long hair easily detangleable.</li>
            <li>Great for me and my teenage daughter who has super thick brown hair!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember exactly how long it took, but I only waited a week at most.</li>
            <li>Reason why it&#x27;s four stars, high in price.</li>
            <li>When I received this package, my first clue that something was wrong was that when I pumped the spray the very first time, there was already product in the tube (as I&#x27;m sure you know, brand new products take a few pumps to get the product to the top).  </li>
            <li>My second clue was that the spray that came out was a directed, watery spray, unlike Unite&#x27;s, which is very very misty.  </li>
            <li>I had never spent that much on a hair de-tangler before...</li>
            <li>I am usually considered a cheapster, but I would pay much more for the relief this product has provided me.  </li>
            <li>It was all over the bottles, making a huge mess.</li>
            <li>It clearly says on the bottles \\&quot;not for resale\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>after using my sample daily I hopped on Amazon.com to see if this product was available and purchased the double pack for almost the same price and 1 bottle.  </li>
            <li>I have never left a review like this before, but THIS IS NOT THE REAL STUFF.  </li>
            <li>With Unite&#x27;s product, I can get my fingers through immediately and my dried hair is silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>After washing all of the lost product off of the bottles, it seemed the caps were not tightly screwed shut.</li>
            <li>mid-life hair is coarse and dry but with 7 Seconds and some Unite Argon Oil, it looks and feels young again!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s like $20 before a small bottle but it really conditions and de tangles her</li>
            <li> I know travel sizes obviously are not very large, but I had no idea</li>
            <li> I have long hair and after I wash it, it takes forever to get all the tangles out!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, when I used this spray, I couldn&#x27;t get my fingers through my damp hair at all, and when it was dry, it was like sticky straw.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything as my hair is very dry and damaged from coloring, etc.  </li>
            <li> I did this test at least three times before drawing this final conclusion, because I was really hoping I was wrong.  </li>

            <li> I wish it had been around when my daughter was little and because it could have saved her (and me)</li>
            <li> A few spritz of 7 Seconds takes away the frizz leaving</li>
            <li> I have long, thin hair</li>
            <li> The water where I live is terrible and my thick hair turns into a knotted mess in the shower, but this makes combing through so much easier.</li>
            <li> My four year old daughter was afraid of the hairbrush until I found this product-</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and curly.</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended it, and put some in my hair after cutting it.</li>
            <li> I was very angry about the packaging</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> If you have struggled (like I have) with horribly tangled hair.....</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for seven years - hope it&#x27;s never discontinued - and if it is, that I have pre-warning so I can buy a case.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample from my hair stylist and when presented with it&#x27;s price for the full size bottle I honestly had sticker shock. I had never spent that much on a hair de-tangler before...after using my sample daily I hopped on Amazon.com to see if this product was available and purchased the double pack for almost the same price and 1 bottle.  I am very happy to know my hair is receiving minimal damage when brushing it out after a shower.  I gave the other bottle as a gift to a Loved One and hope this product never gets discontinued!!! It&#x27;s fantastic....simply marvelous..</li>
            <li> I love their products! It all works wonderfully and a VERY little goes a LONG ways! I have used many of their products (came recommended by my hairstylist). I have long, thin hair and it gives it body and shine and volume.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and provides conditioning all at once.</li>
            <li> My wife swears by this conditioner.  It&#x27;s like $20 before a small bottle but it really conditions and de tangles her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to her, this really deserves 5 stars as a product-- she swears it&#x27;s the best-  just the price per ounce is a little outrageous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it came in a larger more economical bottle it would rate five stars.</li>
            <li> Possibly not for every hair type but for my long, fine, tangly hair it works better than any other detangler out there if which I have tried many. It doesn&#x27;t leave reside on your hair and works in seconds as claimed. Reason why it&#x27;s four stars, high in price.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely wonderful. However, this two pack travel size was a joke. I know travel sizes obviously are not very large, but I had no idea I was PURCHASING samples. It clearly says on the bottles \\&quot;not for resale\\&quot;. So I would go ahead and purchase the regular size unless you want to pay for samples.. haha. But its so great that i don&#x27;t even wanna complain too much haha.</li>
            <li> I love this product and ran out. Keeps my daughter&#x27;s extremely long hair easily detangleable. When I went to the local salon I had bought it from before - they were no longer carrying the product. I ordered 2 from here to save $ and was very impressed with the packaging of this seller.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it I got it very fast. I was completely satisfied. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> If you have struggled (like I have) with horribly tangled hair.....your entire life......YOU WILL LOVE THIS STUFF!!! I have long hair and after I wash it, it takes forever to get all the tangles out! I have tried all types of detangling products (sprays for kids, special combs and brushes designed for detangling, and on and on....) All have been a waist of money.  But this product is incredible.  Because I have long hair, I have to use more than the directions tell you to use.......but then I can just comb through my tangly mess in TRULY 7 SECONDS.  Don&#x27;t worry about the expense, because 1 bottle has lasted me for 4 months.  I am usually considered a cheapster, but I would pay much more for the relief this product has provided me.  I wish it had been around when my daughter was little and because it could have saved her (and me) a lot of tearful comb outs.&lt;br /&gt;Barbara</li>
            <li> 7 seconds is the best !</li>
            <li> I have never left a review like this before, but THIS IS NOT THE REAL STUFF.  I have been using Unite 7 seconds for years.  When I received this package, my first clue that something was wrong was that when I pumped the spray the very first time, there was already product in the tube (as I&#x27;m sure you know, brand new products take a few pumps to get the product to the top).  My second clue was that the spray that came out was a directed, watery spray, unlike Unite&#x27;s, which is very very misty.  My third clue was that the product smelled differently.  Unite&#x27;s has a distinctive sweet-floral smell, which drew me to it in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, when I used this spray, I couldn&#x27;t get my fingers through my damp hair at all, and when it was dry, it was like sticky straw.  With Unite&#x27;s product, I can get my fingers through immediately and my dried hair is silky smooth.  To make sure my hair hadn&#x27;t just changed, I used some left over Unite product the next day and my hair was perfect.  I did this test at least three times before drawing this final conclusion, because I was really hoping I was wrong.  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by my stylist. By far the best leave in conditioner I have ever tried! I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works well for fine hair that tangles easily after showering. Glad I now have a way to purchase it.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product for my light blonde hair.  It does not weigh it down or affect the color.  Great for me and my teenage daughter who has super thick brown hair!</li>
            <li> My four year old daughter was afraid of the hairbrush until I found this product- now she brings the detangler spray with the brush and asks for me to fix her hair!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product but pricey.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Only thing I use to detangle my hair.</li>
            <li> Pretty good at detangling the hair.  I thought it would be better because my hair stylist really hyped it up!</li>
            <li> I can not find anything better for both my girls hair and mine. Detangles, smooths, and leaves healthy without static. I order on line because I can not find locally.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST leave in conditioner I have ever used.  I have tried everything as my hair is very dry and damaged from coloring, etc.  This conditioner works wonders. You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> So much cheaper then getting at a salon and it really makes your hair softer, smoother and shiny! Will purchase more in the future. Great deal.</li>
            <li> My stylist at the salon used this and I could not wait to have this great product at home. I used to dread brushing my hair after the shower, but it&#x27;s now a breeze. The water where I live is terrible and my thick hair turns into a knotted mess in the shower, but this makes combing through so much easier. And, it&#x27;s cruelty free, which is a must!</li>
            <li> I swear by this product, but it is pricey for what it is. I love that this seller offers a two pack since I go through it so quickly. It also came with great timing. I can&#x27;t remember exactly how long it took, but I only waited a week at most.</li>
            <li> The product I love. I plan on purchasing it again. My hair is very thick and curly. My hairdresser recommended it, and put some in my hair after cutting it. I bought two bottles without hesitation. And I&#x27;m very happy with it. It&#x27;s the first leave-in product that tamed my hair of fizziness. I bought another product that is excellent that goes with his product for culy hair by the same maker.&lt;br /&gt;The packages was aweful. When i opened the box, the two bottles were wrapped in a plastic bag. Inside the plastic bag, both bottles had leaked about 10%of the product. It was all over the bottles, making a huge mess. I thought one of the bottles was cracked. After washing all of the lost product off of the bottles, it seemed the caps were not tightly screwed shut. I was very angry about the packaging, I&#x27;ll probably not purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair which can get frizzy in Oregon rainy climate.  A few spritz of 7 Seconds takes away the frizz leaving my fine hair curls manageable.</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well!!!!!! It keeps my hair soft and manageable especially since I highlight it once a month:)</li>
            <li> Just 5 or 6 sprays on wet hair makes it easy to comb and leaves it feeling smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;My mid-life hair is coarse and dry but with 7 Seconds and some Unite Argon Oil, it looks and feels young again!</li>
