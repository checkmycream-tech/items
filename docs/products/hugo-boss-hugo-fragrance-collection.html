            <li> The difference in intensity is so wide that one might think of it as a different perfume.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered as expected.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering or harsh, and just a couple sprays lasts for just about the entire day.</li>
            <li> Wanted one after TSA took my other one ☺&lt;br /&gt;Fits</li>
            <li> This is my travel size and it is as usual</li>
            <li> It is not more than a joke</li>
            <li> The item is fake.</li>
            <li> It is so fake that even if you spray all over like 10 12 times you have to try to figure out if you are wearing perfume or not after just an hour or</li>
            <li> I compared one at Ulta store  and was so disappointed with the quality i bought.</li>

            <li> You gotta get this.. it&#x27;s really amazing.. for afternoon and evening. . Must have item for sure.. lots of complements from the ladies.. ;)</li>
            <li> The item is fake. It is so fake that even if you spray all over like 10 12 times you have to try to figure out if you are wearing perfume or not after just an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;There is a HUGE difference that one can clearly notice. It is not more than a joke but the thing bothered me more was that why not they let me know it at start. At lest i could be aware of what i am paying for. The difference in intensity is so wide that one might think of it as a different perfume. I compared one at Ulta store  and was so disappointed with the quality i bought.</li>
            <li> mild and pleasant fragrance for everyday use</li>
            <li> I had this item in my wish list for me and ended up purchasing it for my grand dad for Father&#x27;s Day. I guess I gotta me a bottle for myself</li>
            <li> Product was delivered as expected. Great fragrance!</li>
            <li> I love this scent and when I found it for such a great deal I had to buy it. I would definitely recommend this scent for men. It would be a great cologne to add to anyones collection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Hugo for almost twelve years now and I never grow tired of the wonderful smell. My wife enjoys the cologne, as do most of the people that I encounter during a day. The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering or harsh, and just a couple sprays lasts for just about the entire day. I can&#x27;t recommend this cologne enough and expect that if you give it a chance you&#x27;ll love it just as much as I do!</li>
            <li> It has a strong scent so you won&#x27;t need to use much. It reminds me of spices, mostly cinnamon, and it lasts a good part of the day. It&#x27;s quite a different smell, unlike anything anybody else wears. I like it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the scent</li>
            <li> Present for my boyfriend, he loves it!  Wears it every day :)</li>
            <li> The smell is definitely different from the one I smelled at store.</li>
            <li> What can be said about a product you are familiar with? No surprises. I bought it because I love it, so I knew what I was going to get. It came on timely manner, very well wrapped and a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Brand new and sealed 100% satisfied</li>
            <li> as described. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great product, great service!</li>
            <li> Wanted one after TSA took my other one ☺&lt;br /&gt;Fits TSA carry on size and amount. Live this fragrance!</li>
