            <li>Deciding to try the authentic shampoo first with this hair treatment and loved the way the my hair looks and feels!  </li>
            <li>Shampoo as normal (with WEN shampoo, of course, and it leaves your hair feeling softer, gives it more body, and results in a wonderful, healthy shine.  </li>
            <li>Well, I disagree - it is the real deal and works beautifully.</li>
            <li>I thought the price was too good to be true</li>
            <li>my hair was super silky!!</li>
            <li>If you have very light colored hair like me, you will see it change to a brassy tone.  </li>

            <li>I tried many products.</li>
            <li>From people in the bakery to my friends nonstop touching it.</li>
            <li>Of all the Wen products, this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>You have to leave it on longer than off the shelf conditioner, so it&#x27;s probably better to enjoy a nice bath when using it.</li>

            <li>love it...</li>
            <li>If not you&#x27;ll use quite a bit of the container which isn&#x27;t too enjoyable when you are paying $30 for 4 oz.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Simply love it :))</li>
            <li>Need to get more of this.</li>
            <li>love this hair treatment</li>
            <li>I started using Wen products about 3 years ago and my hair looks better than ever.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner, keeps my hair shiny and conditioned.</li>
            <li>I use all Wen products and so does my husband and we love them all.</li>

            <li>Love this stuff my daughter told me to try this</li>
            <li>I love this product for a hair mask.  </li>
            <li>and the end results were ok.</li>
            <li>and I know for sure it is also from the hairdryer .</li>
            <li>Click the \\&quot;How to Use\\&quot; tab on top.  </li>
            <li>Wish I could afford it more often.</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair reacts to my curling iron.</li>
            <li>I add a splash of water to my hand and them rubb the product briskly before applying, better distribution that way.</li>
            <li>It says to leave it on for 20 or more minutes</li>
            <li>Deciding not to use it again when I washed my hair again with WEN, I had more shedding than I have had before I started using WEN or when I just used the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Love the WEN products.  </li>
            <li>My hair is in love with it.</li>
            <li>Love the the  remoist treatment.</li>

            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>Because it makes hair more elastic, it also causes hair to curl more as it dries.  </li>
            <li>Wen cleansing conditioner is nothing more than a conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It is an excellent conditioner, but with no cleansing properties which are essential for shiny and healthy looking hair.  </li>
            <li>Re Moist Treatment with the Wen system and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>This product is FABULOUS!</li>

            <li>Have used this product for over a year and my hair is better than it has ever been.  </li>
            <li>this works magic on those curls.</li>
            <li>for the wife but love the way her hair feeld</li>
            <li>The more you use it the more manageable your hair becomes.</li>
            <li>LOVE THE SMELL</li>
            <li>AND IT LEAVES MY HAIR WITH MORE VOLUME AND SOFTNESS</li>
            <li>I would order again for sure.  </li>
            <li>The end result is outstanding hair.</li>
            <li>and my hair never felt better.</li>
            <li>and I love how it feels on my hair.</li>
            <li>And when you use it with the wen shampoo, your hair looks so healthy.</li>
            <li>I think the shampoo is more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>but I do love this hair treatment.</li>
            <li>You may get better results if your hair is not chemically treated in any way.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>My hair is much more manageable with WEN.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>I love this product and swear by the results.</li>
            <li>LOVE ALL THE WEN  PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair feels after a wash with the cleansing conditioner and after applying this product.  </li>
            <li>It may be my favorite of all the Wen products</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Love all Wen Products.</li>
            <li>I tried it by using it more as a leaving in conditioner rather than washing it out.  </li>
            <li>Instead, I was able to save money and get what I wanted, with</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>Love it ...</li>
            <li>I have tried so many things</li>
            <li>AS MUCH AS I LOVE WEN.</li>
            <li>I think I will not buying any more of it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very rich and creamy.</li>
            <li>I love this product you do need to leave it on for a long time but it works great!</li>
            <li>It does not have an overwhelming smell like most do and washes out easily.</li>
            <li>I first used Wen cleansing conditioner and absolutely loved the way my hair felt.</li>
            <li>I have been using Wen for about a month and \\&quot;I love it\\&quot; my hair is shiny and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>My other WEN products are awesome also, and this just adds to the list :))</li>
            <li>It works best on wet hair, leave on for hours, even overnite.</li>
            <li>My hair feels absolutely FABULOUS after use :))</li>
            <li>I left it in overnight for full effect, and I was very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>I will never again buy any of his products because money is more important to Chaz Dean than his customers.  </li>
            <li>I bought this after reading all the great reviews of this making your hair soft and silky...</li>
            <li>It creates great soft hair without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>It was soft to the touch and smelled great.  </li>
            <li>smells good but really haven&#x27;t used it like I want to</li>
            <li>Thanks to all on Amazon who have this product a good rating.</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and loved, it helps my hair a great deal, I had been out for a while and was pleased to find the 4oz size for such a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.  </li>
            <li>Keeping long hair healthy and beautiful - this is the product.  </li>
            <li>I use this product once a week and it makes my hair healthier and stronger, it is also easy to use</li>
            <li>Its easy to use.</li>
            <li>this makes my hair look like I can&#x27;t even explain it my hair looks better than it has ever looked before so manageable and clean</li>
            <li>I had better outcome with more economical options</li>
            <li>Use of the product is easy, a treatment does take an hour.</li>
            <li>a very quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So I am 99.9% happy with the WEN products overall, a bit pricey, but worth every penny for the Cleansing Conditioner for sure! :</li>
            <li>I liked it very much</li>
            <li>opening the product for the first time it smelled amazing.  </li>
            <li>The product does add moisture to your hair and it smells fine</li>
            <li>I have fine, bleached hair and was amazed at my results.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE MY NEW WEN FIND!!!!</li>
            <li>so when I saw this product I thought &amp;#34;Ok, let give it a try&amp;#34; I love this product, ladies this really works!!</li>
            <li>I love the richness but this product is for certain hair, it is excellent in straightening the hair, but you must be careful</li>
            <li>my hair today is shine and silky smooth</li>
            <li>I enjoy the light scent and</li>
            <li>this product is fantastic..</li>
            <li>its the genuine wen product.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li>A great deep conditioner to use.</li>
            <li>Well, while it is acceptable conditioner I am not convinced it is a genuine Wen product.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>Great for extra conditioning</li>
            <li>Definitely spendy, but was great for hair repair.</li>
            <li>I was expecting somthing fabulous---</li>
            <li>Chaz Dean is a Genius for making such great products  </li>
            <li>My hair is smooth, not oily.</li>
            <li>My hair has never smelled so good or been so soft.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair healthy and very soft!</li>
            <li>This is a great way to soften and restore your hair after a week of blow drying, flat iron and the winter elements.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Official Wen Site\\&quot; prices are high, so I shopped the net and found the best price on Amazon - - almost 50%</li>
            <li>i salso great for long hair if you barde your hair to keep it smooth and well conditioned all day.</li>
            <li>The smell is SUPER strong.</li>
            <li>My hair looks real good all day ,And it takes very little to do the job.</li>
            <li>WEN is such an amazing product!</li>
            <li>It did not smell, or feel like the original wen.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to try it</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t pay more for one product, when you can get their whole bundle for $30!</li>
            <li>This product is rich and creamy and I like that.</li>
            <li>It is a very oily product, but if your hair is damaged, then it makes your hair more manageable and its made mine almost as smooth as it used to be before I damaged it.</li>
            <li>Helps with making hair look more healthy and soft.</li>
            <li>Great for dry hair.</li>
            <li>The smell is really mild and not overwhelming, and it&#x27;s the perfect weight for my hair</li>
            <li>It really makes a huge difference in the quality of my hair!</li>
            <li>This has worked pretty good so far.  </li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>Moist Intensive Hair Treatment in Sweet Almond]]</li>
            <li>After getting a sample of the Sweet Almond Mint treatment I do not want to try anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The winter dries out my hair so much and leaves it with lots of static.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m throwing mine away and going to Wen&#x27;s website and paying full price.</li>
            <li>used a lot of deep conditioners.biolage balm being my fav.this wasn&#x27;t good at all gave it away ...and that person also didn&#x27;t care for it either ....</li>
            <li>Used to see it for $50, but now I&#x27;m finding it for $30, which is a tad more reasonable.</li>
            <li>If not, just get the Fig cleansing conditioner and the Six Thirteen, its more intense and does not take as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Moist Intensive Hair Treatment in Sweet Almond has been a blessing for my hair.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and wanted better control and manageability.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t pick up the sweet almond, just the mint.</li>
            <li>I used the Wen product called Moist Intensive Hair Treatment In Sweet Almond.</li>
            <li>I have never been sensitive to smells, even strong ones, but when using this the mint smell was so overwhelming</li>
            <li>my hair is soft easy to manage and its getting a healthy.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and soft and this makes my hair nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>The smell is fresh and clean and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used WEN, I saw the difference it made on my hair; it was soft, manageable, and felt very healthy.  </li>
            <li>I only used this product once and My hair felt really nice and smooth afterwards.    </li>
            <li>After only one use, not only did my hair feel wonderfully moisturized, but it took care of my scalp which had been itchy.</li>
            <li>I probably would not be able to get much volume after treatment, so if you have fine, straight hair, you may want to apply this at night.</li>
            <li>After my first use there was a huge possitive improvement on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this once so far, but my hair loved it!</li>
            <li>This product tends to keep my hair less fly away and just feeling healthier.</li>
            <li>This worked the best when you could leave it on your hair as long as possible after washing with Wen cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I could tell the difference when i applied it to my tresses the first time i used it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty excited</li>
            <li>LOVE WEN MAKES MY HAIR SO SOFT AND SHINEY!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says!</li>
            <li>They make my hair look and feel great but a little to pricey for me.</li>
            <li>I am now using it as a daily conditioner, and both my hair and my extensions are in amazing shape.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is worth every Penny.</li>
            <li>I Love how soft it makes hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always getting compliments on how soft and healthy my hair looks.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t be totally sure O did not It especially did not have the smooth product ?</li>
            <li>so I had to wash my hair more frequently which hurt my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price if you don&#x27;t use it ALL the time.</li>
            <li>I always apply it to my hair wet, so that might be part of the reason why I get such great results with this product!</li>
            <li>I love the way that this leaves your hair soft and managable.</li>
            <li>She had to leave it in overnight in a shower cap, but the results were worth the time and inconvenience.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money...</li>
            <li>Made my hair so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>Well I will admit it did make my hair somewhat softer but was it worth it?</li>
            <li>Living in a dry, dry climate and having curly hair, the cleanser and this moist treatment are excellent for my needs.  </li>
            <li>It was heavenly right after I used it.</li>
            <li>Best moisturizer in the market, leaves your hair healthy, moist and full of renewed life to dull or dry hair!!!</li>
            <li>This conditioner is really good, my hair responds to Mint, so the sweet almond mint is on point, I give my hair a deep conditioning weekly with a heat cap and this conditioner, it is really thick, healthy and growing, which is really good for my age, especially since a lot of my counterparts are losing their hair</li>
            <li>I like that it does not have all those chemicals and it gives by dry brittle hair a nice shine and moisture.  </li>
            <li>I was able to purchase as few or as many of this product that I wanted.</li>
            <li>It leave my hair very soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li>I have natural curly coarse hair and this is the best conditioner I have found in a long time.</li>
            <li>very fast shipment.</li>
            <li>I AM VERY MUCH</li>
            <li>so this is not just for the ladies, this really makes your hair feel nice and soft, I live in Florida</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this and the sweet almond mint cleanser as well.</li>
            <li>What I can say is that I find it hard to believe the product I received and used generated great reviews</li>
            <li>My hair has huge waves and curls naturally.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much better than regular shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Replenishes your hair leaving soft and frizz free</li>
            <li>I am also surrounded by Florida&#x27;s hot and humid weather..</li>
            <li>Although this is my first Wen product ever, that container nor the product met my expectations.</li>
            <li>The container looked used as well when I first got it.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This was the first time buy this product.</li>
            <li>I get the same outstanding results and use it each time I cleanse my hair - twice per week.</li>
            <li>This has ZERO of the real Wen product benefits!</li>
            <li>For the first time in over 40 years, my hair is longer than my shoulders and is a lot stronger and thicker.  </li>
            <li>SHIPS FAST!</li>
            <li>so I would tell potential buyers to be much more concerned about the accuracy of some reviews than the quality and effectiveness of this product.  </li>
            <li>My regular conditioner conditions better then this stuff does.</li>
            <li>By using this product I see a big difference in the dryness in my hair, it&#x27;s more manageable.</li>
            <li>It amazed me when I first used it.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Intense hair loss!</li>
            <li>My hair is better now that I been using the cleanser and moisturizer, I also just starting to use the oil treatment .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through all the testing and the only thing they were able to tell me</li>
            <li>Usually I pair it with the WEN Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner, but even when I don&#x27;t have both available, this stuff alone can keep my hair under control (used with any kind of normal shampoo/conditioner combo).</li>
            <li>Wen is the best but ridiculously expensive.</li>
            <li>I just love this stuff just wished it came in a bigger container.</li>
            <li>This product is a trteat when I have the extra time to leave in hair for a hour or more,  </li>
            <li>I am already on my second container of this stuff and plan to get more.</li>
            <li>i totally suggest this product ladies you will love it too</li>
            <li>I probably have thee most coarse hair in the world even though I&#x27;m relaxed.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m actually keeping more hair on my head instead of pulling it out.</li>
            <li>Came in the mail fast!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>when I wet my hair and put some on it looks so nice and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I quit using Wen as a whole, but I can not give up the Intensive Hair Treatment!  </li>
            <li>Ten more words required, ten more words required, ten more words required.</li>
            <li>Mine looks almost exactly like the picture but</li>
            <li>I Love this sweet almond mint hair treatment I&#x27;ve only used it three times so far once a week on just my tips because they are very dry and damaged and my tips look like brand new hair, their soft and just look live and beautiful, must buy!</li>
            <li>Wen moist intensive hair treatment is a great product especially for curly hair when it is dry and misbehaving.  </li>
            <li>I have other wen products that I really like and am excited in trying this product, it was very fast shipping and am really pleased with it</li>
            <li>I love the other WEN products &amp; assumed I would get the same great results with the Re Moist, but not for me personally.</li>
            <li>It really does leave hair smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love the results that I get with my long hair.  </li>
            <li>the shaded areas around the circle are more grey than brown which could be just the camera that was used to take the image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have Very Long hair and makes it feel Fantastic!</li>
            <li>I have dry curly hair, not any more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice product, but you can get something that works just as well as the drugstore for a lot less.</li>
            <li>When I rinse it out, my hair is super soft, silky and the dryness is gone.</li>
            <li>I get much better results in assisting with my dry hair with this product</li>
            <li>I use this mostly on my ends in the shower when my ends feel dry and brittle and this fixes my problem.</li>
            <li>just love it, revived my dry hair into a shining miraclej</li>
            <li>so I did it left my hair soft and smooth and my hair was minty cool</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many other conditioners and even things like hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li>After only one treatment with this product you will notice a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I like, but to much hype</li>
            <li>This is not the real thing</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>I have curly african-american hair and get compliments daily on my healthy, hyrdrated and unbelievably soft hair (thanks to remoist).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting a whole lot of compliments.</li>
            <li>The product was pricey and did not do much for my hair.</li>
            <li>Very nourishing</li>
            <li>I still enjoy the product with almost the same results.</li>
            <li>so the sun really dries your hair out.</li>
            <li>but it is not the real deal.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t care how much it costs--I&#x27;ve always just wanted something that WORKS.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I do not watch much TV.</li>
            <li>was that my scalp was very irritated.</li>
            <li>It looks much healthier.</li>
            <li>It builds up fast s</li>
            <li>and it is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>(very upset)</li>
            <li>My hair is so much softer and not as frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li>It is a deep conditioner that smells fantastic and works wonders.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Wen</li>
            <li>Really helped restore vitality to my hair.</li>
            <li>hair is very processed, I get highlights all over and hair color</li>
            <li>Delivery of this product was exceptionally fast.  </li>
            <li>I can use that whole jar in one session.</li>
            <li>This is not the real Wen product.</li>
            <li>THANKS AGAIN</li>
            <li>products are very pricey</li>
            <li>It really seems to help.</li>
            <li>I expected better results.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I am very please with everything</li>
            <li>This product really helps to give my hair the moisture it needs to regain it softness and shine.  </li>
            <li>I had read in your reviews that this isn&#x27;t the real deal.</li>
            <li>My hair is silky, soft, UNTANGLED...!!!</li>
            <li>I swim every day and live in a hot climate</li>
            <li>I literally can&#x27;t live without this stuff since i first use this like 5 years ago.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other similar products that aren&#x27;t quite as good.</li>
            <li>This is good if you just need a little extra conditioning and are willing to leave it on overnight.</li>
            <li>It did not  do the same job as the original when.</li>
            <li>However, I purchased because we use many other WEN products on our hair.</li>
            <li>Could be that I&#x27;m getting older, to much sun and salty water from the beach</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product, but it did absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to buy it again for regular use, but if I had a special event coming up</li>
            <li>After using it my frizzy, fuzzy, unruly, dry, permed, colored hair is lovely, shiny, soft, tangle, fuzz &amp; frizz-free &amp; manageable.</li>
            <li>It is super thick and really does a great job on my super thick hair.</li>
            <li>In fact, it is so light to make the weight of 4oz, the bottle is twice the size of the real Wen product, which is smooth, thick and dense.</li>
            <li>I love the feel and smell and my hair is shinier and less frizzy than it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
            <li>Use it often to see quick results in a short period of time.</li>
            <li>You could definitely spend more at your local salon.</li>
            <li>The only reason I wouldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because if I use it daily, it kinda stops being magic for my hair</li>
            <li>However, if you do not use a clarifying shampoo the next time you wash, to wash it all out, it will quickly turn into buildup.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner and some reviews said it was not a true Wen product</li>
            <li>It made my hair very soft all the way to the tips... and no frizzyness!  </li>
            <li>It is highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>Had high expectations but will stick to my garnier products.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Wen Products.</li>
            <li>I had to cancel my deliveries because I find the benefits do not justify the high price I have been paying for the product.  </li>
            <li>Great on dry or wet hair when you want to deep condition your hair.</li>
            <li>Now knowing that little trick, I feel better reordering this product.</li>
            <li>No heavy, greasy residue left behind like many other deep conditioners I&#x27;ve used, which is awesome!</li>
            <li>It works very well on my natural blond hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say that I am totally wrong.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions, used it after my normal WEN cleansing, etc...left it on overnight</li>
            <li>I am just a normal shopper.</li>
            <li>I have been using Wen Product for a few year now and love it.  </li>
            <li>Always makes mine and my daughter&#x27;s hair feel so much better and healthier after spending a few days a week in a pool.</li>
            <li>Every time I washed my hair with Wen, my hair felt heavy with product; waxy is a better word.  </li>
            <li>It looked so much better:  healthier, shinier, and a lot less frizzy!  </li>
            <li>When blowing drying, it did not dry out my hair and left it silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>My Wen arrived last Saturday and I tried it right away.</li>
            <li>Though I used Wen cleansing conditioners and a couple other Wen products (which I know are genuine), I admit I&#x27;ve never used this treatment before</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, my hair dried soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>As a once every couple of weeks deep conditioner my hair stays in tip top shape even using hot tools on it everyday.  </li>
            <li>Wen products live up to the advertising.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found a new hair system with WEN.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li>Definitely recommended for anyone who wants to take the shine of their hair up to a whole new level.</li>
            <li>(I moved from a &amp;#34;dry heat state&amp;#34; to Michigan where it&#x27;s super dry in the winter.  </li>
            <li>Best if product is left in for 30 minutes and washed with cold water</li>
            <li>I wet my hair, put in some regular WEN and then used the Remoist on top of it.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Intensive Hair Treatment in Sweet Almond on the recommendation from a friend to use on my very dry hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very soft when I  used this one.</li>
            <li>and it made my hair very soft.  </li>
            <li>This product makes my hair very soft and it eliminates tangles</li>
            <li>Yes, I look silly, but when it is all over my hair looks amazing!  </li>
            <li>makes my hair really soft!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I knew it was different.  </li>
            <li>I bought this with a WEN &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; from the website and tried it for the first time today and left it on for about 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li>No more static in my hair...</li>
            <li>my hair has never been this soft!</li>
            <li>I use Wen pretty regularly and I could not believe the price I got on these.  </li>
            <li>This makes it feel soft!</li>
            <li>My first Wen product and it won&#x27;t be my last.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this product is authentic or not, but it worked well on my chemically damaged hair.</li>
            <li>Most of those had little or no effect, plus many of them left my fine hair feeling weighed down and heavy.</li>
            <li>Again the appearance of the product inside as clumpy and again I this left my ends dry very unusual for the fresh Wen product</li>
            <li>it felt conditioned initially, but within a couple hours, it was fly away and dry dry dry.  </li>
            <li>I have natural course hair and this is the first product that actually moisturizes my hair without making it greasy.</li>
            <li>It only makes your hair soft and pretty at the moment.</li>
            <li>This worked great on her hair (which is thick, dark, and lustrous thanks to her Italian heritage).  </li>
            <li>(right in the middle of fine and thick, but a lot of it).</li>
            <li>I use it about once a week, and it is really nice, it works really well on my hair, it just smells kinda weird</li>
            <li>I am now going natural ( person of color) and this product helps.</li>
            <li>errors which are made taking to much out of your account and getting it back.</li>
            <li>My co-workers asked me what I have put on my hair that it was so shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>my over dyed hair so soft and shiny</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and no longer crunchy.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>My hair is now so soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>my hair doesn&#x27;t feel soft and shiny after i use it.</li>
            <li>but once it was washed out my hair seemed to return to its old condition.  </li>
            <li>It rehydrates your hair making it soft, silky, shiny and manageable.  </li>
            <li>the soft feel it leaves in my hair.  </li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>Just WOW.</li>
            <li>I actually feel like I have twice as much hair as before using Wen.</li>
            <li>This makes you hair so soft and shiny</li>
            <li>The intensive moisturizer made my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>This leaves my hair sooo soft.</li>
            <li>Make your hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I makes your hair incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s hair is as soft and glossy as before</li>
            <li>and I am in my 60&#x27;s and young women</li>
            <li>I like the mostly natural ingredients</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, it keeps my hair in place and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>I am waaay too busy.</li>
            <li>For deep moisturizing I&#x27;ve been much happier with jojoba oil</li>
            <li>Wow...</li>
            <li>My medical problems have caused my hair to be very brittle.  </li>
            <li>Faith tells me that her hair has never been softer and she was pleasantly surprised at the amount of product that she recieved...</li>
            <li>It makes your hair feel so soft and thicker.</li>
            <li>It made my hair soft to the touch</li>
            <li>My hair has been completely changed by this product.</li>
            <li>Wen offers scented products for people who prefer a scent.</li>
            <li>Does wonders for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>Love Wen and use this at least once every 10 days</li>
            <li>My Granddaughter is 2 years old and has a head of curly hair.....</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s over-bleached and damaged blond hair comes out silky soft after treatment with this.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped promptly and is as was advertised.</li>
            <li>I know this is for conditioning, but it detangles at the same time very well.  </li>
            <li>This product has done wonders ... feeling soft, shiny, and ringlets!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only straight from WEN or QVC</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking my hair would be really soft and manageable after using it...</li>
            <li>I use it once a week on my streaked blonde hair and I have noticed a real difference.  </li>
            <li>I have shoulder length highligted hair with a naturally course texture.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair shine and keeps it soft .</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel young again, with body.  </li>
            <li>made my hair so soft...</li>
            <li>Coming out of a long, cold, dry winter my hair needed this, the price was right, a very good value</li>
            <li>Every time I get my hair trimmed (which I don&#x27;t do as much as when I used shampoo because I no longer get split ends), the stylist remarks first on how odd it is that I don&#x27;t want her to shampoo my hair</li>
            <li>I will definitely continue to use the Re Moist Intensive Hair Treatment, can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents available.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish I knew the first round is to have you hair a bit more wet,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a hairstylist, and I have been only using Wen for the past year and just love it</li>
            <li>I have thick, coarse Italian hair and it really helps with making my hair softer and much more manageable.</li>
            <li>I only had to use a small amount because I have such fine, thinning hair, so it will last me awhile, so it will be economical for me as well.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use my normal WEN shampoo, but definitely not the Re Moist.</li>
            <li>That night, I showered, rinsed and used the regular WEN again as I normally would in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair</li>
            <li>Plenty of other conditioners out there that do a better a job for less $$$.</li>
            <li>Very helpful for dry, color treated hair.</li>
            <li>This product really helped my dry hair.  </li>
            <li>The product worked immediately and made my blonde, dried out, frizzy, hair smooth and supple.  </li>
            <li>My guess is that other websites are selling it at the \\&quot;suggested retail\\&quot; price of $58 because there are buyers out there willing to pay.  </li>
            <li>Hyped products so rarely seem to live up to their claims for me, and purchases I&#x27;ve made in the past based on beauty-blog raves (Clarisonic</li>
            <li>back to the old.</li>
            <li>I can actually just use the cleansing cream with no conditioner and my hair is manageable and soft</li>
            <li>It actually stripped the natural oils, and the smell is a bit off.</li>
            <li>I find it left my hair feeling soft and silky</li>
            <li>I typically use once every few weeks (too pricey to use more than that).</li>
            <li>i have very thin hair and its amazing</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers, I tend to think it&#x27;s not the real stuff</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it has a very slight nice scent.</li>
            <li>It is naturally wavy, but after rinsing this out my hair dried straight.</li>
            <li>I am African American, and my hair is all natural.  </li>
            <li>My hair is never dry.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my hair shiny and not dry</li>
            <li>I let my hair dry and then styled and also noticed the dry ends that I am usually coating with stuff to make them look healthy looked that way without anything.</li>
            <li>makes my VERY dry hair silky soft, but you do have to be careful to not use too much and fully rinse or can get a bit greasy looking.</li>
            <li>It came the other day and it looks and feels and smells the same as the real deal I was replacing.</li>
            <li>At 78 years old my hair my long hair still flows.</li>
            <li>First I shampooed, rinsed - towel dried my hair - applied the mask and sat for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it is worth it though, even for the amazon price.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this and other Wen products after seeing the info-mercial on TV.</li>
            <li>I have natural 4c type hair (dry)</li>
            <li>I have frizzy, fine, thin curly hair.</li>

            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it !!!</li>
            <li> My hair is in wonderful shape, and the Re Moist Intensive Hair Treatment is one of the main reasons.  </li>
            <li> Great product with very mild scent, which I need because most scents I have an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> I have used almost every top brand hair care product on the market over the years and was very pleased with my Pureology,</li>

            <li> I think this product is ok, however, the Six Thirteen by Wen kind of surpasses this.</li>
            <li> by far the best hair product i have ever used!!!!</li>
            <li> Does wonders for my hair that is very fine.  </li>
            <li> Deciding to try the authentic shampoo first with this hair treatment and loved the way the my hair looks and feels!  </li>
            <li> Shampoo as normal (with WEN shampoo, of course, and it leaves your hair feeling softer, gives it more body, and results in a wonderful, healthy shine.  </li>
            <li> Well, I disagree - it is the real deal and works beautifully.</li>
            <li> I thought the price was too good to be true</li>
            <li> my hair was super silky!!</li>
            <li> If you have very light colored hair like me, you will see it change to a brassy tone.  </li>

            <li> Best deep condition ever, I can depend on this product to so the job.</li>
            <li> I tried many products.</li>
            <li> From people in the bakery to my friends nonstop touching it.</li>
            <li> Of all the Wen products, this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> You have to leave it on longer than off the shelf conditioner, so it&#x27;s probably better to enjoy a nice bath when using it.</li>
            <li> I love using this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;ll love your hair</li>

            <li> Love the product but it is a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> love it...</li>
            <li> If not you&#x27;ll use quite a bit of the container which isn&#x27;t too enjoyable when you are paying $30 for 4 oz.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Simply love it :))</li>
            <li> Need to get more of this.</li>
            <li> love this hair treatment</li>
            <li> I started using Wen products about 3 years ago and my hair looks better than ever.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner, keeps my hair shiny and conditioned.</li>
            <li> I use all Wen products and so does my husband and we love them all.</li>
            <li> love it ...  </li>
            <li> love</li>
            <li> love ittt</li>
            <li> Love this stuff my daughter told me to try this</li>
            <li> I love this product for a hair mask.  </li>
            <li> and the end results were ok.</li>
            <li> and I know for sure it is also from the hairdryer .</li>
            <li> Click the \\&quot;How to Use\\&quot; tab on top.  </li>
            <li> Wish I could afford it more often.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair reacts to my curling iron.</li>
            <li> I add a splash of water to my hand and them rubb the product briskly before applying, better distribution that way.</li>
            <li> It says to leave it on for 20 or more minutes</li>
            <li> Deciding not to use it again when I washed my hair again with WEN, I had more shedding than I have had before I started using WEN or when I just used the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Love the WEN products.  </li>
            <li> My hair is in love with it.</li>
            <li> Love the the  remoist treatment.</li>
            <li> It appears to be authentic.  </li>
            <li> This frizzed my hair, and made it feel even more dry/damaged...</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>

            <li> I am of mixed race, and this product is the Best ever.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> Because it makes hair more elastic, it also causes hair to curl more as it dries.  </li>
            <li> Wen cleansing conditioner is nothing more than a conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It is an excellent conditioner, but with no cleansing properties which are essential for shiny and healthy looking hair.  </li>
            <li> Re Moist Treatment with the Wen system and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This product is FABULOUS!</li>
            <li> I get compliments all the time and my hair feels and looks better than ever.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for over a year and my hair is better than it has ever been.  </li>
            <li> this works magic on those curls.</li>
            <li> for the wife but love the way her hair feeld</li>
            <li> The more you use it the more manageable your hair becomes.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE SMELL</li>
            <li> AND IT LEAVES MY HAIR WITH MORE VOLUME AND SOFTNESS</li>
            <li> I would order again for sure.  </li>
            <li> The end result is outstanding hair.</li>
            <li> and my hair never felt better.</li>
            <li> and I love how it feels on my hair.</li>
            <li> And when you use it with the wen shampoo, your hair looks so healthy.</li>
            <li> I think the shampoo is more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I love this.  </li>
            <li> but I do love this hair treatment.</li>
            <li> You may get better results if your hair is not chemically treated in any way.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> My hair is much more manageable with WEN.</li>

            <li> I love the way my hair feels after a wash with the cleansing conditioner and after applying this product.  </li>
            <li> It may be my favorite of all the Wen products</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> Love all Wen Products.</li>
            <li> I tried it by using it more as a leaving in conditioner rather than washing it out.  </li>
            <li> Instead, I was able to save money and get what I wanted, with</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.</li>

            <li> My other WEN products are awesome also, and this just adds to the list :))</li>
            <li> It works best on wet hair, leave on for hours, even overnite.</li>
            <li> My hair feels absolutely FABULOUS after use :))</li>
            <li> I left it in overnight for full effect, and I was very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> I will never again buy any of his products because money is more important to Chaz Dean than his customers.  </li>
            <li> I bought this after reading all the great reviews of this making your hair soft and silky...</li>
            <li> It creates great soft hair without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> It was soft to the touch and smelled great.  </li>
            <li> smells good but really haven&#x27;t used it like I want to</li>
            <li> Thanks to all on Amazon who have this product a good rating.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and loved, it helps my hair a great deal, I had been out for a while and was pleased to find the 4oz size for such a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.  </li>

            <li> So I am 99.9% happy with the WEN products overall, a bit pricey, but worth every penny for the Cleansing Conditioner for sure! :</li>
            <li> I liked it very much</li>
            <li> opening the product for the first time it smelled amazing.  </li>
            <li> The product does add moisture to your hair and it smells fine</li>
            <li> I have fine, bleached hair and was amazed at my results.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE MY NEW WEN FIND!!!!</li>
            <li> so when I saw this product I thought &amp;#34;Ok, let give it a try&amp;#34; I love this product, ladies this really works!!</li>
            <li> I love the richness but this product is for certain hair, it is excellent in straightening the hair, but you must be careful</li>
            <li> my hair today is shine and silky smooth</li>
            <li> I enjoy the light scent and</li>
            <li> this product is fantastic..</li>
            <li> its the genuine wen product.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li> A great deep conditioner to use.</li>
            <li> Well, while it is acceptable conditioner I am not convinced it is a genuine Wen product.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> Great for extra conditioning</li>
            <li> Definitely spendy, but was great for hair repair.</li>
            <li> I was expecting somthing fabulous---</li>
            <li> Chaz Dean is a Genius for making such great products  </li>
            <li> My hair is smooth, not oily.</li>
            <li> My hair has never smelled so good or been so soft.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair healthy and very soft!</li>
            <li> This is a great way to soften and restore your hair after a week of blow drying, flat iron and the winter elements.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Official Wen Site\\&quot; prices are high, so I shopped the net and found the best price on Amazon - - almost 50%</li>
            <li> i salso great for long hair if you barde your hair to keep it smooth and well conditioned all day.</li>
            <li> The smell is SUPER strong.</li>
            <li> My hair looks real good all day ,And it takes very little to do the job.</li>
            <li> WEN is such an amazing product!</li>
            <li> It did not smell, or feel like the original wen.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to try it</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t pay more for one product, when you can get their whole bundle for $30!</li>
            <li> This product is rich and creamy and I like that.</li>
            <li> It is a very oily product, but if your hair is damaged, then it makes your hair more manageable and its made mine almost as smooth as it used to be before I damaged it.</li>
            <li> Helps with making hair look more healthy and soft.</li>
            <li> Great for dry hair.</li>
            <li> The smell is really mild and not overwhelming, and it&#x27;s the perfect weight for my hair</li>
            <li> It really makes a huge difference in the quality of my hair!</li>
            <li> This has worked pretty good so far.  </li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> Moist Intensive Hair Treatment in Sweet Almond]]</li>
            <li> After getting a sample of the Sweet Almond Mint treatment I do not want to try anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The winter dries out my hair so much and leaves it with lots of static.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m throwing mine away and going to Wen&#x27;s website and paying full price.</li>
            <li> used a lot of deep conditioners.biolage balm being my fav.this wasn&#x27;t good at all gave it away ...and that person also didn&#x27;t care for it either ....</li>
            <li> Used to see it for $50, but now I&#x27;m finding it for $30, which is a tad more reasonable.</li>
            <li> If not, just get the Fig cleansing conditioner and the Six Thirteen, its more intense and does not take as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Moist Intensive Hair Treatment in Sweet Almond has been a blessing for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and wanted better control and manageability.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t pick up the sweet almond, just the mint.</li>
            <li> I used the Wen product called Moist Intensive Hair Treatment In Sweet Almond.</li>
            <li> I have never been sensitive to smells, even strong ones, but when using this the mint smell was so overwhelming</li>
            <li> my hair is soft easy to manage and its getting a healthy.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and soft and this makes my hair nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> The smell is fresh and clean and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used WEN, I saw the difference it made on my hair; it was soft, manageable, and felt very healthy.  </li>
            <li> I only used this product once and My hair felt really nice and smooth afterwards.    </li>
            <li> After only one use, not only did my hair feel wonderfully moisturized, but it took care of my scalp which had been itchy.</li>
            <li> I probably would not be able to get much volume after treatment, so if you have fine, straight hair, you may want to apply this at night.</li>
            <li> After my first use there was a huge possitive improvement on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so far, but my hair loved it!</li>
            <li> This product tends to keep my hair less fly away and just feeling healthier.</li>
            <li> This worked the best when you could leave it on your hair as long as possible after washing with Wen cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I could tell the difference when i applied it to my tresses the first time i used it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty excited</li>
            <li> LOVE WEN MAKES MY HAIR SO SOFT AND SHINEY!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says!</li>
            <li> They make my hair look and feel great but a little to pricey for me.</li>
            <li> I am now using it as a daily conditioner, and both my hair and my extensions are in amazing shape.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is worth every Penny.</li>
            <li> I Love how soft it makes hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always getting compliments on how soft and healthy my hair looks.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t be totally sure O did not It especially did not have the smooth product ?</li>
            <li> so I had to wash my hair more frequently which hurt my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price if you don&#x27;t use it ALL the time.</li>
            <li> I always apply it to my hair wet, so that might be part of the reason why I get such great results with this product!</li>
            <li> I love the way that this leaves your hair soft and managable.</li>
            <li> She had to leave it in overnight in a shower cap, but the results were worth the time and inconvenience.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money...</li>
            <li> Made my hair so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> Well I will admit it did make my hair somewhat softer but was it worth it?</li>
            <li> Living in a dry, dry climate and having curly hair, the cleanser and this moist treatment are excellent for my needs.  </li>
            <li> It was heavenly right after I used it.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer in the market, leaves your hair healthy, moist and full of renewed life to dull or dry hair!!!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is really good, my hair responds to Mint, so the sweet almond mint is on point, I give my hair a deep conditioning weekly with a heat cap and this conditioner, it is really thick, healthy and growing, which is really good for my age, especially since a lot of my counterparts are losing their hair</li>
            <li> I like that it does not have all those chemicals and it gives by dry brittle hair a nice shine and moisture.  </li>
            <li> I was able to purchase as few or as many of this product that I wanted.</li>
            <li> It leave my hair very soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly coarse hair and this is the best conditioner I have found in a long time.</li>
            <li> very fast shipment.</li>
            <li> I AM VERY MUCH</li>
            <li> so this is not just for the ladies, this really makes your hair feel nice and soft, I live in Florida</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this and the sweet almond mint cleanser as well.</li>
            <li> What I can say is that I find it hard to believe the product I received and used generated great reviews</li>
            <li> My hair has huge waves and curls naturally.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much better than regular shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Replenishes your hair leaving soft and frizz free</li>
            <li> I am also surrounded by Florida&#x27;s hot and humid weather..</li>
            <li> Although this is my first Wen product ever, that container nor the product met my expectations.</li>
            <li> The container looked used as well when I first got it.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This was the first time buy this product.</li>
            <li> I get the same outstanding results and use it each time I cleanse my hair - twice per week.</li>
            <li> This has ZERO of the real Wen product benefits!</li>
            <li> For the first time in over 40 years, my hair is longer than my shoulders and is a lot stronger and thicker.  </li>
            <li> SHIPS FAST!</li>
            <li> so I would tell potential buyers to be much more concerned about the accuracy of some reviews than the quality and effectiveness of this product.  </li>
            <li> My regular conditioner conditions better then this stuff does.</li>
            <li> By using this product I see a big difference in the dryness in my hair, it&#x27;s more manageable.</li>
            <li> It amazed me when I first used it.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Intense hair loss!</li>
            <li> My hair is better now that I been using the cleanser and moisturizer, I also just starting to use the oil treatment .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through all the testing and the only thing they were able to tell me</li>
            <li> Usually I pair it with the WEN Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner, but even when I don&#x27;t have both available, this stuff alone can keep my hair under control (used with any kind of normal shampoo/conditioner combo).</li>
            <li> Wen is the best but ridiculously expensive.</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff just wished it came in a bigger container.</li>
            <li> This product is a trteat when I have the extra time to leave in hair for a hour or more,  </li>
            <li> I am already on my second container of this stuff and plan to get more.</li>
            <li> i totally suggest this product ladies you will love it too</li>
            <li> I probably have thee most coarse hair in the world even though I&#x27;m relaxed.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m actually keeping more hair on my head instead of pulling it out.</li>
            <li> Came in the mail fast!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> when I wet my hair and put some on it looks so nice and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I quit using Wen as a whole, but I can not give up the Intensive Hair Treatment!  </li>
            <li> Ten more words required, ten more words required, ten more words required.</li>
            <li> Mine looks almost exactly like the picture but</li>
            <li> I Love this sweet almond mint hair treatment I&#x27;ve only used it three times so far once a week on just my tips because they are very dry and damaged and my tips look like brand new hair, their soft and just look live and beautiful, must buy!</li>
            <li> Wen moist intensive hair treatment is a great product especially for curly hair when it is dry and misbehaving.  </li>
            <li> I have other wen products that I really like and am excited in trying this product, it was very fast shipping and am really pleased with it</li>
            <li> I love the other WEN products &amp; assumed I would get the same great results with the Re Moist, but not for me personally.</li>
            <li> It really does leave hair smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love the results that I get with my long hair.  </li>
            <li> the shaded areas around the circle are more grey than brown which could be just the camera that was used to take the image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have Very Long hair and makes it feel Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I have dry curly hair, not any more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product, but you can get something that works just as well as the drugstore for a lot less.</li>
            <li> When I rinse it out, my hair is super soft, silky and the dryness is gone.</li>
            <li> I get much better results in assisting with my dry hair with this product</li>
            <li> I use this mostly on my ends in the shower when my ends feel dry and brittle and this fixes my problem.</li>
            <li> just love it, revived my dry hair into a shining miraclej</li>
            <li> so I did it left my hair soft and smooth and my hair was minty cool</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many other conditioners and even things like hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li> After only one treatment with this product you will notice a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> I like, but to much hype</li>
            <li> This is not the real thing</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> I have curly african-american hair and get compliments daily on my healthy, hyrdrated and unbelievably soft hair (thanks to remoist).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting a whole lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> The product was pricey and did not do much for my hair.</li>
            <li> Very nourishing</li>
            <li> I still enjoy the product with almost the same results.</li>
            <li> so the sun really dries your hair out.</li>
            <li> but it is not the real deal.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t care how much it costs--I&#x27;ve always just wanted something that WORKS.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I do not watch much TV.</li>
            <li> was that my scalp was very irritated.</li>
            <li> It looks much healthier.</li>
            <li> It builds up fast s</li>
            <li> and it is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> (very upset)</li>
            <li> My hair is so much softer and not as frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> It is a deep conditioner that smells fantastic and works wonders.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Wen</li>
            <li> Really helped restore vitality to my hair.</li>
            <li> hair is very processed, I get highlights all over and hair color</li>
            <li> Delivery of this product was exceptionally fast.  </li>
            <li> I can use that whole jar in one session.</li>
            <li> This is not the real Wen product.</li>
            <li> THANKS AGAIN</li>
            <li> products are very pricey</li>
            <li> It really seems to help.</li>
            <li> I expected better results.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I am very please with everything</li>
            <li> This product really helps to give my hair the moisture it needs to regain it softness and shine.  </li>
            <li> I had read in your reviews that this isn&#x27;t the real deal.</li>
            <li> My hair is silky, soft, UNTANGLED...!!!</li>
            <li> I swim every day and live in a hot climate</li>
            <li> I literally can&#x27;t live without this stuff since i first use this like 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other similar products that aren&#x27;t quite as good.</li>
            <li> This is good if you just need a little extra conditioning and are willing to leave it on overnight.</li>
            <li> It did not  do the same job as the original when.</li>
            <li> However, I purchased because we use many other WEN products on our hair.</li>
            <li> Could be that I&#x27;m getting older, to much sun and salty water from the beach</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, but it did absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to buy it again for regular use, but if I had a special event coming up</li>
            <li> After using it my frizzy, fuzzy, unruly, dry, permed, colored hair is lovely, shiny, soft, tangle, fuzz &amp; frizz-free &amp; manageable.</li>
            <li> It is super thick and really does a great job on my super thick hair.</li>
            <li> In fact, it is so light to make the weight of 4oz, the bottle is twice the size of the real Wen product, which is smooth, thick and dense.</li>
            <li> I love the feel and smell and my hair is shinier and less frizzy than it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
            <li> Use it often to see quick results in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> You could definitely spend more at your local salon.</li>
            <li> The only reason I wouldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because if I use it daily, it kinda stops being magic for my hair</li>
            <li> However, if you do not use a clarifying shampoo the next time you wash, to wash it all out, it will quickly turn into buildup.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner and some reviews said it was not a true Wen product</li>
            <li> It made my hair very soft all the way to the tips... and no frizzyness!  </li>
            <li> It is highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> Had high expectations but will stick to my garnier products.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Wen Products.</li>
            <li> I had to cancel my deliveries because I find the benefits do not justify the high price I have been paying for the product.  </li>
            <li> Great on dry or wet hair when you want to deep condition your hair.</li>
            <li> Now knowing that little trick, I feel better reordering this product.</li>
            <li> No heavy, greasy residue left behind like many other deep conditioners I&#x27;ve used, which is awesome!</li>
            <li> It works very well on my natural blond hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say that I am totally wrong.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions, used it after my normal WEN cleansing, etc...left it on overnight</li>
            <li> I am just a normal shopper.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen Product for a few year now and love it.  </li>
            <li> Always makes mine and my daughter&#x27;s hair feel so much better and healthier after spending a few days a week in a pool.</li>
            <li> Every time I washed my hair with Wen, my hair felt heavy with product; waxy is a better word.  </li>
            <li> It looked so much better:  healthier, shinier, and a lot less frizzy!  </li>
            <li> When blowing drying, it did not dry out my hair and left it silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> My Wen arrived last Saturday and I tried it right away.</li>
            <li> Though I used Wen cleansing conditioners and a couple other Wen products (which I know are genuine), I admit I&#x27;ve never used this treatment before</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, my hair dried soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> As a once every couple of weeks deep conditioner my hair stays in tip top shape even using hot tools on it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Wen products live up to the advertising.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found a new hair system with WEN.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> Definitely recommended for anyone who wants to take the shine of their hair up to a whole new level.</li>
            <li> (I moved from a &amp;#34;dry heat state&amp;#34; to Michigan where it&#x27;s super dry in the winter.  </li>
            <li> Best if product is left in for 30 minutes and washed with cold water</li>
            <li> I wet my hair, put in some regular WEN and then used the Remoist on top of it.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the Intensive Hair Treatment in Sweet Almond on the recommendation from a friend to use on my very dry hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very soft when I  used this one.</li>
            <li> and it made my hair very soft.  </li>
            <li> This product makes my hair very soft and it eliminates tangles</li>
            <li> Yes, I look silly, but when it is all over my hair looks amazing!  </li>
            <li> makes my hair really soft!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I knew it was different.  </li>
            <li> I bought this with a WEN &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; from the website and tried it for the first time today and left it on for about 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li> No more static in my hair...</li>
            <li> my hair has never been this soft!</li>
            <li> I use Wen pretty regularly and I could not believe the price I got on these.  </li>
            <li> This makes it feel soft!</li>
            <li> My first Wen product and it won&#x27;t be my last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product is authentic or not, but it worked well on my chemically damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Most of those had little or no effect, plus many of them left my fine hair feeling weighed down and heavy.</li>
            <li> Again the appearance of the product inside as clumpy and again I this left my ends dry very unusual for the fresh Wen product</li>
            <li> it felt conditioned initially, but within a couple hours, it was fly away and dry dry dry.  </li>
            <li> I have natural course hair and this is the first product that actually moisturizes my hair without making it greasy.</li>
            <li> It only makes your hair soft and pretty at the moment.</li>
            <li> This worked great on her hair (which is thick, dark, and lustrous thanks to her Italian heritage).  </li>
            <li> (right in the middle of fine and thick, but a lot of it).</li>
            <li> I use it about once a week, and it is really nice, it works really well on my hair, it just smells kinda weird</li>
            <li> I am now going natural ( person of color) and this product helps.</li>
            <li> errors which are made taking to much out of your account and getting it back.</li>
            <li> My co-workers asked me what I have put on my hair that it was so shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> my over dyed hair so soft and shiny</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and no longer crunchy.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> My hair is now so soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> my hair doesn&#x27;t feel soft and shiny after i use it.</li>
            <li> but once it was washed out my hair seemed to return to its old condition.  </li>
            <li> It rehydrates your hair making it soft, silky, shiny and manageable.  </li>
            <li> the soft feel it leaves in my hair.  </li>
            <li> WOW.</li>

            <li> I am waaay too busy.</li>
            <li> For deep moisturizing I&#x27;ve been much happier with jojoba oil</li>

            <li> This product has done wonders ... feeling soft, shiny, and ringlets!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only straight from WEN or QVC</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking my hair would be really soft and manageable after using it...</li>
            <li> I use it once a week on my streaked blonde hair and I have noticed a real difference.  </li>
            <li> I have shoulder length highligted hair with a naturally course texture.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shine and keeps it soft .</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel young again, with body.  </li>
            <li> made my hair so soft...</li>
            <li> Coming out of a long, cold, dry winter my hair needed this, the price was right, a very good value</li>
            <li> Every time I get my hair trimmed (which I don&#x27;t do as much as when I used shampoo because I no longer get split ends), the stylist remarks first on how odd it is that I don&#x27;t want her to shampoo my hair</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue to use the Re Moist Intensive Hair Treatment, can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents available.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish I knew the first round is to have you hair a bit more wet,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist, and I have been only using Wen for the past year and just love it</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse Italian hair and it really helps with making my hair softer and much more manageable.</li>
            <li> I only had to use a small amount because I have such fine, thinning hair, so it will last me awhile, so it will be economical for me as well.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use my normal WEN shampoo, but definitely not the Re Moist.</li>
            <li> That night, I showered, rinsed and used the regular WEN again as I normally would in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair</li>
            <li> Plenty of other conditioners out there that do a better a job for less $$$.</li>
            <li> Very helpful for dry, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> This product really helped my dry hair.  </li>
            <li> The product worked immediately and made my blonde, dried out, frizzy, hair smooth and supple.  </li>
            <li> My guess is that other websites are selling it at the \\&quot;suggested retail\\&quot; price of $58 because there are buyers out there willing to pay.  </li>
            <li> Hyped products so rarely seem to live up to their claims for me, and purchases I&#x27;ve made in the past based on beauty-blog raves (Clarisonic</li>
            <li> back to the old.</li>
            <li> I can actually just use the cleansing cream with no conditioner and my hair is manageable and soft</li>
            <li> It actually stripped the natural oils, and the smell is a bit off.</li>
            <li> I find it left my hair feeling soft and silky</li>
            <li> I typically use once every few weeks (too pricey to use more than that).</li>
            <li> i have very thin hair and its amazing</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I tend to think it&#x27;s not the real stuff</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it has a very slight nice scent.</li>
            <li> It is naturally wavy, but after rinsing this out my hair dried straight.</li>
            <li> I am African American, and my hair is all natural.  </li>
            <li> My hair is never dry.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my hair shiny and not dry</li>
            <li> I let my hair dry and then styled and also noticed the dry ends that I am usually coating with stuff to make them look healthy looked that way without anything.</li>
            <li> makes my VERY dry hair silky soft, but you do have to be careful to not use too much and fully rinse or can get a bit greasy looking.</li>
            <li> It came the other day and it looks and feels and smells the same as the real deal I was replacing.</li>
            <li> At 78 years old my hair my long hair still flows.</li>
            <li> First I shampooed, rinsed - towel dried my hair - applied the mask and sat for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is worth it though, even for the amazon price.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this and other Wen products after seeing the info-mercial on TV.</li>
            <li> I have natural 4c type hair (dry)</li>
            <li> I have frizzy, fine, thin curly hair.</li>
            <li> I tried home remedies (not pleasant at all) to expensive shampoo and contitioners, in the beauty salons I got some treatments that left my hair moist and beautiful for a day or two and then...</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used this product and by coloring my hair and using a curling iron everyday, my ends would get really dry.</li>
            <li> I barely need to blow dry and the frizzies are all gone.</li>
            <li> i thought at first made hair really soft but can&#x27;t use much at all too heavy of a conditioner for my thin hair</li>
            <li> I gave this 5 stars, my hair is soft and hydrated, my thick hair took the whole 4oz jar, after coloring my hair, it was very soft, as it dried it was so-so.</li>
            <li> Because the curliness was out of control and some of the curls were flat.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy, crunchy, or flat like some products do to mine.</li>
            <li> I use no other hair cleansing/conditioning products other than Wen.</li>
            <li> I have double processed hair (color and highlighting) which tends to dry out and damage my hair.  </li>
            <li> I used the mask just recently to help with my dry ends</li>
            <li> It never flaked and hasn&#x27;t appeared dry but its red and itchy.</li>
            <li> I have dry hair and the moist treatment is bringing it back to life.</li>
            <li> I find that typical treatments make hair soft when the product is in, but once you wash it out your hair feels like straw again.  </li>
            <li> but when I tried to air dry it, it was a different story.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry hair and use this as a daily leave in conditioner for my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried expensive and cheap.</li>
            <li> Also I try to leave it on as long as posssible like the directions</li>
            <li> Wish I discovered this product a long time ago.</li>
            <li> manageable.&lt;br /&gt;Best to keep on your hair for as long as you can.</li>
            <li> I have waited for a long time to try this mask for the hair.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair and do not have to use alot of it either.</li>
            <li> After it dried, it was soft, shiny, and had lots of body.  </li>
            <li> I left it on wet hair for about 15 min before rinsing out.</li>
            <li> I just wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to order it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with long hair</li>
            <li> Wen has taken away the shine I had on my long curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long, wavy hair</li>
            <li> I have long hair (past my shoulder blades) and was a little worried this wouldn&#x27;t last very long, but it took me about two months to get through it, which I think is reasonable for the price (I was using it once or twice a week as a masque and every other day or so in the shower as general conditioner).</li>
            <li> I alternate every other day with the styling creme.  </li>
            <li> (my hair is very long, about to my waist)  </li>
            <li> My hair is normally extremely dry with tons of split ends.</li>
            <li> It does wonders for dry damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because I had dry ends</li>
            <li> I have lupus and the medications dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> My hair feels like I didn&#x27;t put any type of conditioner in it when I rinse it out, dry, tangled, and stringy.</li>
            <li> I will use it again in a couple of weeks to combat the dry weather out here in California.  </li>
            <li> Then I rinse it out and dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair became brittle, dry, and frizzier.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry &amp; this solved that problem.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift, she loves it on her dry ethnic hair.</li>
            <li> My hair still dry even though I do not use heating tools to style my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is quite damaged &amp; dry.</li>
            <li> or whenever my hair starts feeling dry again.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry</li>
            <li> so I was hoping this would help with that dry brittle look...</li>
            <li> but not when it dried...felt sticky and dry</li>
            <li> and sometimes it tends to get dry.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I just put this on and air dry during the day.</li>
            <li> My hair is still dry.</li>
            <li> My hair was so dry</li>
            <li> I have two girls with long hair and we have a cabinet full of products that are lousy at detangling.  </li>
            <li> I have spent the last few years trying different products.</li>
            <li> I also tended to loose hair when brushing &amp; washing with Pantene.</li>
            <li> I can leave on overnight as stated and wash out the next day without the greasy weighed down feeling.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I had to use was some spray due to all my baby hairs!</li>
            <li> Got double the product for about half the price.</li>
            <li> I was running out of this product that I had purchased at Sephora, a store that is pretty expensive at our local mall.  </li>
            <li> This is a bonus since my hair is color treated it is difficult to find a product that actually moisturizes after just the first use.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I could get the same results for less money.</li>
            <li> My hair used to be very dry on the ends but greasy by the roots.</li>
            <li> I have colored, permed and thus very dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hair, which is only bob length, was a tangled mess after I rinsed it out, not at all Wen-like.  </li>
            <li> My hair is down to the middle of my back, thin, mixed African American/Caucasian.</li>
            <li> I needed a deep treatment that I can use as often as once a week or as little as once a month.</li>
            <li> I am still wearing the wigs to complete regrowing my hair but using this product saved me from cutting my whole head of hair.</li>
            <li> but I feel if the product was fake, they did a terrific job making a knock off and in the end all that really matters</li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive but is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I carefully followed the directions but it does not bring results.</li>
            <li> so I have only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> I put the product on and then comb it through with the Wet Brush comb.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on the authenticity of the hair product itself, but the packaging is not what i would have expected for a list price of $72 (inexpensive container, sticker not centered, etc).  </li>
            <li> for the money I spent.  </li>
            <li> It didnt work as well as I expected it to.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It did not really smooth or de frizz my hair even though I left it on for 2 hrs each time.  </li>
            <li> Expected visible change in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Not really seeing that.</li>
            <li> My hair became so heavy in the back and felt like I had product in it when I did not.</li>
            <li> did not really add shine or improve my hair texture at all.  </li>
            <li> (I go there having just cleansed my hair and with it still wet) but the minute she gets her hands on my hair</li>
            <li> I let my hair sit for an entire day -- it sort of dried looking wet.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick, coarse hair that is dry.  </li>
            <li> I was a huge skeptic because i have thick, dry curly hair that I have had to use expensive products and lots of them, for years.</li>
            <li> My hair is a lot softer and manageable since using this product a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have a terrible problem with my hair falling out in handfuls due to medication, and i was thrilled that barely a strand came out in the shower, or when I combed it out.</li>
            <li> I have stop using the product for a while to see if in fact the breakage of my hair is due to WEN</li>
            <li> I use it as a deep conditioner and a small amount when styling my hair.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t compare to the performance of other Wen products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Google Wen Hair Loss to see all the other complaints.</li>
            <li> I usually do this treatment at night, so I cannot speak to how well your hair would style after such treatment.  </li>
            <li> I will say in the past I used this product different option (Lavender)</li>
            <li> My hair needs moisture due to</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the jar is so small.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this product to supplement her other Wen products that she uses.  </li>
            <li> I love the shampoo and was really disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> It does not surpass any other product on my shelf.</li>
            <li> I can see how it might be a bit expensive for someone who has really thick or long hair, who would have to use a lot of product to adequately cover their scalp/hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very careful to \\&quot;massage it in\\&quot; and I rinse well.</li>
            <li> My guess is that this seller is selling legitimate Wen products that were the rejects from the manufacturer due to the label being slightly discolored.</li>
            <li> even though the jar is small it lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I reccommend this to anyone, especially those with thick or damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I watched for a few minutes and became curious about the products.</li>
            <li> Helpful for my coarse and thick mane.</li>
            <li> and it helps to keep the frizz down.</li>
            <li> and it works wonders without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I feel like the price is coming down a bit on this.</li>
            <li> It does help keep the frizzies down too.  </li>
            <li> Some reviewers also stated that the product leaves a residue and leaves the hair weighed down.</li>
            <li> I half damaged, curly/thick/frizzy/coarse hair..</li>
            <li> I disagree with a previous, uninformed reviewer, the product is not counterfeit.  </li>
            <li> I am black and had cancer with treatment of chemo and radiation.</li>
            <li> I found this 4 oz pot sold by Brands For Less at $15 not counting shipping.  </li>
            <li> Never the less trust me this works.  </li>
            <li> Just like the Wen I order from Wen - but at half the price.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that this was not a true Wen product until after it was delivered.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is a mess</li>
            <li> I leave it on for a half hour to even a few hours if I have the time.</li>
            <li> all I lost is a little in the front and part of my hairline (this using products for lace wigs).</li>
            <li> When i just use the cleansing cream I leave it in for the duration of my shower and then put a little of the cleansing cream in my hair as a leave in conditioner</li>
            <li> A little picey</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do as promised and has little to no effect.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this before been using Wen products for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> I get a delivery every few months.  </li>
            <li> I dried my hair and styled it.  </li>
            <li> I started using Wen a few years ago</li>
            <li> I use it when I feel like my hair is too fluffy</li>
            <li> I purchased a few Wen products since they were on sale.</li>
            <li> This is not genuine Wen product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Please, please don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> I have wasted my money because I will not be using this product again.</li>
            <li> however, this made my hair feel worse (which I didn&#x27;t think that was possible since I damaged my hair with bleach)!!</li>
            <li> It dried on my hair making it look and feel like a cotton ball.  </li>
            <li> My hair has been dried out and frizzy from shampooing and blow drying.</li>
            <li> GOT A FEW PRODUCTS OF WEN N</li>
            <li> But no, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried squite a few.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Since I had already washed and dried my hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually made my hair feel worse than ever.</li>
            <li> It will weigh thin hair down if it is not completely rinsed out.</li>
            <li> the price was half the usual cost.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have unruly curly hair and it made my hair not frizzy and helped tame the curl</li>
            <li> I bought it with the original kit and hated all the other stuff but this.</li>
            <li> After fixing my bad color job that my last colorist did, I needed to find something to get my hair back from crunchy.</li>
            <li> It is a thick cream consistency and slightly greasy to the touch.  </li>
            <li> very little hair breakage.</li>
            <li> I am anxious to see if my reduction in hair lose continuesand if I maintain the results.</li>
            <li> the earring backs holes are to small.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t think they mention it, you can use a small amount as a leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I did check the pricing and I pay no more on Amazon and with Prime</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the remoist in the past</li>
            <li> not sure why</li>
            <li> I am getting gray hairs and they tend to be hard to tame.  </li>
            <li> I color my hair a lot and yes over time it has become very dull, frizzy and dry, I have try other products that have stated it will take care of my hair problem but fail to do so...</li>
            <li> It does not weigh my thin hair down at all</li>
            <li> but it is hard to find time to spoil myself with it</li>
            <li> but lately I notice my hair is falling out.</li>
            <li> This is it; for me at least.</li>
            <li> I have been using wen products for at least a year now.</li>
            <li> this is the only paste that I have tried that does not leave hair feeling dirty</li>
            <li> I have thick course hair</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried because this Wen Re Moist Intensive Treatment was so much less expensive than on the competitors website that I feared it may be fake as like one other reviewer.  </li>
            <li> I usually have dry easily broken crazy frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> so it weighs it down so my curls are so crazy.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;shipping was very slow</li>
            <li> but you must rinse out thoroughly if you have thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen for approximately a year now.  </li>
            <li> The smell of medicine it leaves on your hair is not attractive at all.  </li>
            <li> HAVE THE WORLDS WORST HAIR REALLY</li>
            <li> This is not a genuine Wen, rather it&#x27;s a bad copy.</li>
            <li> but I believe that its fake.</li>
            <li> The formula leaves your hair feeling terrible, and is lumpy and reminiscent of a drugstore conditioner.</li>
            <li> Even the packaging looks fake.</li>
            <li> I have had a terrible time the last 5 years with my hair thinning.</li>
            <li> So is the Sephora one fake?  </li>
            <li> So, Wen&#x27;s claim that Wen is all you need has proven wrong with me.</li>
            <li> This is a useless product.</li>
            <li> but it was still bothering me that the product could be fake</li>
            <li> Not that the label couldn&#x27;t be fake too</li>
            <li> Is not a great product :(</li>
            <li> Conditions like crazy</li>
            <li> I just slather this cream on my dirty hair and leave it in for about an hour.  </li>
            <li> I just know that the results were disappointing for me.</li>
            <li> Sad!</li>
            <li> the smell didn&#x27;t smell bad..</li>
            <li> have generally disappointed me, or just been so-so.</li>
            <li> I ordered a bunch of wen products and for me, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product I thought it would improve the conditions of my hair.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product and help restore the Simone to my hair</li>
            <li> Great product, great price.</li>
            <li> Is not a great product :(</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I have been using it for 5 months now.  I like that it does not have all those chemicals and it gives by dry brittle hair a nice shine and moisture.  Also I try to leave it on as long as posssible like the directions says it really comes out great.  My hair is just recovering from abuse of perms, dyes and blow dryers.  I am now going natural ( person of color) and this product helps.</li>
            <li> Very helpful for dry, color treated hair. I leave it on overnight for best results.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is great! I have thick, coarse Italian hair and it really helps with making my hair softer and much more manageable. I highly recommend this and the sweet almond mint cleanser as well.</li>
            <li> I love this product and always use Wen for my hair! I love the way it makes my hair healthy and very soft! Never dries it out. It helps keep the color in longer and helps protect it from getting damaged. Great product and would recommend Wen to everyone! It&#x27;s so much better than regular shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> love this stuff. Replenishes your hair leaving soft and frizz free</li>
            <li> Coming out of a long, cold, dry winter my hair needed this, the price was right, a very good value</li>
            <li> I am getting gray hairs and they tend to be hard to tame.  If I leave this on all night it does seem to help.</li>
            <li> Buying it from Amazon you don&#x27;t have to daal with Wen with monthly withdrawals from your checking account. And the. errors which are made taking to much out of your account and getting it back. The product is excellent with routine use, you will notice the difference.</li>
            <li> This product has been a miracle for my hair! I have natural course hair and this is the first product that actually moisturizes my hair without making it greasy. My hair is a lot softer and manageable since using this product a little bit goes a long way. I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Best product ever for beautiful manageable hair!A lilittle goes a long way</li>
            <li> This is truly the best deep conditioner I have used in my life. I half damaged, curly/thick/frizzy/coarse hair.. Basically every woman&#x27;s nightmare. I use Japanese thermal straightening every 5-6 months, which adds to the damage. My hair is normally extremely dry with tons of split ends. I am also surrounded by Florida&#x27;s hot and humid weather.. This product turns my hair around. Smells lovely.. Zero build up. Eliminated my dandruff. Softened and moisturized the hair follicle. I barely need to blow dry and the frizzies are all gone. What a deal!! I reccommend this to anyone, especially those with thick or damaged hair. Thank god for WEN!</li>
            <li> It is okay but I believe that its fake. Although this is my first Wen product ever, that container nor the product met my expectations. The container looked used as well when I first got it. Never buying it again</li>
            <li> I love love love it.  I love being able to buy this from Amazon so I don&#x27;t have to go through all the sales pitch from Wen.</li>
            <li> It was OK for a while but lately I notice my hair is falling out. I have stop using the product for a while to see if in fact the breakage of my hair is due to WEN</li>
            <li> It works very well on my natural blond hair. (Ha Ha)</li>
            <li> I have had a wonderful experience with the regular WEN Cleansing Conditioner. LOVE it! I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. After using it my frizzy, fuzzy, unruly, dry, permed, colored hair is lovely, shiny, soft, tangle, fuzz &amp; frizz-free &amp; manageable. I get constant compliments.   Then...yesterday...I decided to try the Re Moist treatment that came with my kit. I followed the directions, used it after my normal WEN cleansing, etc...left it on overnight and wow...I am a ball of FUZZ &amp; FRIZZ. Hum...I am boggled. I love the other WEN products &amp; assumed I would get the same great results with the Re Moist, but not for me personally. I will continue to use my normal WEN shampoo, but definitely not the Re Moist. So I am 99.9% happy with the WEN products overall, a bit pricey, but worth every penny for the Cleansing Conditioner for sure! :</li>
            <li> A friend gave me this product but there are no instructions (I guess they were thrown away with the box??). Can someone please tell me the directions? Thanks!</li>
            <li> I gave this 5 stars, my hair is soft and hydrated, my thick hair took the whole 4oz jar, after coloring my hair, it was very soft, as it dried it was so-so.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever tried. It leave my hair very soft and tangle free. My co-workers asked me what I have put on my hair that it was so shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I like, but to much hype</li>
            <li> It does what it claims to say.   I have thick course hair and it sure helps me control the frizz.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This was the first time buy this product. It was recommended to me and i wont use anything else now. Amazon need to display the ingredients better and to continueto get the real product for the best price.</li>
            <li> smells good but really haven&#x27;t used it like I want to</li>
            <li> My hair used to be very dry on the ends but greasy by the roots. I tried home remedies (not pleasant at all) to expensive shampoo and contitioners, in the beauty salons I got some treatments that left my hair moist and beautiful for a day or two and then...back to the old. I have been using Wen for about a month and \\&quot;I love it\\&quot; my hair is shiny and easy to handle. I read some reviews about hair been greasy after use but I discovered after a week or so that the problem is that you must follow the instructions correctly. It is a bit expensive but is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the hair types for Women of Color!It is very easy to use and the results are great!</li>
            <li> Excellent product  I had ordered this before been using Wen products for a few years now.  I will be ordering again and again love the fullness of hair.</li>
            <li> I love the Wen hair treatment mask. I use the Wen product every day. Since I have been using the product, I can tell the difference in my hair. Just love it.</li>
            <li> To expensive have used a better hair product</li>
            <li> This is a great product to keep your hair beautiful!  Keeping long hair healthy and beautiful - this is the product.  This i salso great for long hair if you barde your hair to keep it smooth and well conditioned all day.</li>
            <li> very fast shipment. makes my hair really soft!</li>
            <li> This is not the real thing</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t rave enough about this conditioner&lt;br /&gt;Makes my over dyed hair so soft and shiny&lt;br /&gt;Best ever&lt;br /&gt;Believe me&lt;br /&gt;Tried them all&lt;br /&gt;I buy nothing else now !</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. After fixing my bad color job that my last colorist did, I needed to find something to get my hair back from crunchy. This was it!  My hair is soft and no longer crunchy.</li>
            <li> This product works well and I have had wonderful results with it.  I have found that keeping it in overnight works the best and leave my hair soft and silky.  I have naturally curly hair and it helps to keep the frizz down.</li>
            <li> Great price. I will order it again.</li>
            <li> I was happy with a product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a wen girl for life!  Wen has the best hair products.  I get a delivery every few months.  I ran out and ordered this too hold me over.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> makes my VERY dry hair silky soft, but you do have to be careful to not use too much and fully rinse or can get a bit greasy looking.</li>
            <li> I am currently using all of the WEN products.  My hair is now so soft and manageable.  Wish I discovered this product a long time ago.</li>
            <li> TRY THIS! You will be amazed! I am a believer now in WEN. It didn&#x27;t take much. The longer you leave it on the better.</li>
            <li> Eh, I don&#x27;t see what all the fuss is about.  This conditioner still left my hair dry/ it felt conditioned initially, but within a couple hours, it was fly away and dry dry dry.  Plenty of other conditioners out there that do a better a job for less $$$.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work for me. my hair doesn&#x27;t feel soft and shiny after i use it. i&#x27;m going back to my pantene.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product. I&#x27;m purchasing another two today. I disagree with a previous, uninformed reviewer, the product is not counterfeit.  I&#x27;ve used the version purchased from QVC for 3 yrs and needed a lower cost option. Visited the Amazon website. I did some research on remoist hydrating mask vs. remoist intensive hair treatment. That&#x27;s when I learned, remoist intensive hair treatment is the version customers get who order WEN through online/TV commercial ads with Melissa Milano, etc.  I can attest the product smells, feels and works the same. I noted no material differences. I get the same outstanding results and use it each time I cleanse my hair - twice per week. I have curly african-american hair and get compliments daily on my healthy, hyrdrated and unbelievably soft hair (thanks to remoist).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish everyone good luck on their journey with WEN - outstanding product line!</li>
            <li> Smells great --don&#x27;t want to have to wash my hair for a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I liked it, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I liked it very much but once it was washed out my hair seemed to return to its old condition.  Only used once, will try again.  It was heavenly right after I used it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It does wonders for dry damaged hair.  It is highly recommended.  It is a great buy.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Official Wen Site\\&quot; prices are high, so I shopped the net and found the best price on Amazon - - almost 50% cheaper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a diehard Wen product user for over 5 years.  Wen products live up to the advertising.  Once you try them you will never use anything else.  I have double processed hair (color and highlighting) which tends to dry out and damage my hair.  After only one treatment with this product you will notice a huge difference.  It rehydrates your hair making it soft, silky, shiny and manageable.  Try it and expect people to ask what you use to make your hair so healthy and luxurious looking.[[ASIN:B003ZBL820 Wen Re Moist Intensive Hair Treatment in Sweet Almond]]</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE! This has ZERO of the real Wen product benefits! This is not a genuine Wen, rather it&#x27;s a bad copy. The formula leaves your hair feeling terrible, and is lumpy and reminiscent of a drugstore conditioner. In fact, it is so light to make the weight of 4oz, the bottle is twice the size of the real Wen product, which is smooth, thick and dense. Also note that to return the product, you cannot use the traditional amazon online returns center, however, if you email amazon directly they will accept the return.</li>
            <li> I bought this treatment since week I used it yesterday my hair today is shine and silky smooth I will buy again thank you wen</li>
            <li> i have short hair. i thought at first made hair really soft but can&#x27;t use much at all too heavy of a conditioner for my thin hair</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, coarse hair that is dry.  I recently began using Wen products and found this one on www.amazon.com.  I ordered this product to try.  The first time I used it, I knew it was different.  After cleaning my hair, I applied the hair treatment and waited 30 minutes and then washed the product out.  I loved the way my hair felt!  I dried my hair and styled it.  My co-workers thought I&#x27;d been to the salon.  I will be using this product again.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for hair repair and restoration of moisture and shine I have been using it for years</li>
            <li> An absolutely Great Product! I This product is absolutely amazingly awesome!  I could tell the difference when i applied it to my tresses the first time i used it! love this amazing product</li>
            <li> I wanted to see if this product worked on my hair. I am black and had cancer with treatment of chemo and radiation. I decided to try to save my hair and washed/conditioned with wen throughout my cancer treatment. I braided my hair and wore wigs. After my 6 week (radiation 5 days a week and chemo 1 day a week) all I lost is a little in the front and part of my hairline (this using products for lace wigs). I am still wearing the wigs to complete regrowing my hair but using this product saved me from cutting my whole head of hair. Thank you</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have unruly curly hair and it made my hair not frizzy and helped tame the curl</li>
            <li> After getting a sample of the Sweet Almond Mint treatment I do not want to try anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I really love the Wen products but just can&#x27;t afford them. They make my hair look and feel great but a little to pricey for me.</li>
            <li> Purchase was exceptional value. Will refer friends. Got double the product for about half the price. Will order more. Satistied!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve used!!&lt;br /&gt;Makes your hair shiny and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;Best to keep on your hair for as long as you can. Conditions like crazy</li>
            <li> I use this product once a week and it makes my hair healthier and stronger, it is also easy to use</li>
            <li> I started using Wen a few years ago and I am still using it.  I love this conditioner and some reviews said it was not a true Wen product but I did not notice any difference in this and the product I order from Wen that was more expensive.  I love this conditioner and will order again</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product as an addition to his hair to keep his wavy hair in check.</li>
            <li> This has worked pretty good so far.  I use it as a deep conditioner and a small amount when styling my hair.  I have natural 4c type hair (dry) that needs lots of moisture.  I still have to use with leave in conditioner.  The scent is very nice.</li>
            <li> I use this after I shampoo.  I enjoy the light scent and the soft feel it leaves in my hair.  The winter dries out my hair so much and leaves it with lots of static.  This product tends to keep my hair less fly away and just feeling healthier.</li>
            <li> Ya it did the job. I use it when I feel like my hair is too fluffy so it weighs it down so my curls are so crazy.</li>
            <li> I have waited for a long time to try this mask for the hair. Its easy to use. Great on dry or wet hair when you want to deep condition your hair. Use it often to see quick results in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> I bought this with a WEN &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; from the website and tried it for the first time today and left it on for about 3-4 hours. WOW. Just WOW. This stuff made my hair feel amazing. It is naturally wavy, but after rinsing this out my hair dried straight. It&#x27;s a miracle! I am not kidding. My hair is silky, soft, UNTANGLED...!!! It&#x27;s amazing. The only cons I can think of are 1) The smell is SUPER strong. I have never been sensitive to smells, even strong ones, but when using this the mint smell was so overwhelming, I got a migrane from it. And I had a shower cap over it to partly help with that, but it was STILL almost unbearable, 2) It&#x27;s in a tub, so you have to scoop it out and it gets water in it. I still will continue to buy this though, as the results outweigh the cons.</li>
            <li> I love all of Wen products! I have been using Wen for 3 years now and love the results.  For the first time in over 40 years, my hair is longer than my shoulders and is a lot stronger and thicker.  I actually feel like I have twice as much hair as before using Wen.</li>
            <li> Best deep condition ever, I can depend on this product to so the job. I have dry curly hair, not any more.</li>
            <li> This makes you hair so soft and shiny</li>
            <li> This is a great way to soften and restore your hair after a week of blow drying, flat iron and the winter elements.  I would recommend this for everyone especially ladies over 50!  I get so many compliments on the healthy look of my hair!</li>
            <li> Exceptional product, great value</li>
            <li> Yes!!! Finally a product that works miracles! I use to call my hair a beast. Because the curliness was out of control and some of the curls were flat. Like a disfigured S. I tried many products. from salon to store products. None worked, When I saw that Amazon carried Wen i immediately made an order. I bought the styling creme and the hair treatment. I&#x27;m getting a whole lot of compliments. From people in the bakery to my friends nonstop touching it. Recommend this product to people who have the disfigured S. Now my hair is spiraling and beautiful.  Hey the cost is pricy but come on! This is worth every Penny.</li>
            <li> I am African American, and my hair is all natural.  I had doubts that the product would work for my hair.  The intensive moisturizer made my hair soft and manageable.  When blowing drying, it did not dry out my hair and left it silky smooth.  The product is excellent and I will be using it from now on.</li>
            <li> I carefully followed the directions but it does not bring results. The product was pricey and did not do much for my hair. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Of all the Wen products, this is my favorite.  My hair is curly and tangles a lot.  I use this product as a conditioner and love, love it!</li>
            <li> good product.. definately will go for another purchase of this product..the smell didn&#x27;t smell bad.. would definately recommend  to others..</li>
            <li> Hyped products so rarely seem to live up to their claims for me, and purchases I&#x27;ve made in the past based on beauty-blog raves (Clarisonic, I&#x27;m looking at you) have generally disappointed me, or just been so-so. This is one thing I&#x27;d actually buy again. The smell is really mild and not overwhelming, and it&#x27;s the perfect weight for my hair (right in the middle of fine and thick, but a lot of it). I have long hair (past my shoulder blades) and was a little worried this wouldn&#x27;t last very long, but it took me about two months to get through it, which I think is reasonable for the price (I was using it once or twice a week as a masque and every other day or so in the shower as general conditioner). I probably wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to buy it again for regular use, but if I had a special event coming up I&#x27;d probably repurchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I had dry ends (I moved from a &amp;#34;dry heat state&amp;#34; to Michigan where it&#x27;s super dry in the winter.  The product does add moisture to your hair and it smells fine but it is hard to find time to spoil myself with it so I have only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is really good, my hair responds to Mint, so the sweet almond mint is on point, I give my hair a deep conditioning weekly with a heat cap and this conditioner, it is really thick, healthy and growing, which is really good for my age, especially since a lot of my counterparts are losing their hair</li>
            <li> For those who want the occassional hair treatment, this stuff is amazing. You have to leave it on longer than off the shelf conditioner, so it&#x27;s probably better to enjoy a nice bath when using it.</li>
            <li> I ordered a bunch of wen products and for me, I was disappointed. Had high expectations but will stick to my garnier products. Sad!</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair sooo soft. I love using this. I have really long hair and do not have to use alot of it either. So I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great product ! It works best on wet hair, leave on for hours, even overnite. Price on Amazon is affordable.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on all the awesome reviews and it&#x27;s reputation and the great price.  Though I used Wen cleansing conditioners and a couple other Wen products (which I know are genuine), I admit I&#x27;ve never used this treatment before so I can&#x27;t compare it to the product bought from a different seller.  What I can say is that I find it hard to believe the product I received and used generated great reviews and it doesn&#x27;t compare to the performance of other Wen products I&#x27;ve used.  My hair, which is only bob length, was a tangled mess after I rinsed it out, not at all Wen-like.  Like other reviewers, I tend to think it&#x27;s not the real stuff and I wouldn&#x27;t order it or use it again.</li>
            <li> Use this product with Wen Hair Care Products&lt;br /&gt;Shinny, Healthy, Beautiful Hair&lt;br /&gt;Did I say Beautiful?&lt;br /&gt;Yes I did&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll love your hair</li>
            <li> I love this product you do need to leave it on for a long time but it works great! Make your hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> AFTER USING THE PRODUCT MY HAIR WAS SILKY SMOOTH!! EXCELLENT PRODUCT WITH AN AMAZING PRICE. SHIPS FAST! DEFINTIELY WILL BE ORDERING AGAIN.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good. My hair is very soft when I  used this one. I like it. The smell also good. The price inexpensive ,u can try it</li>
            <li> When I apply the Intensive Hair Treatment, I leave it in my hair without rinsing.  I Love how soft it makes hair.</li>
            <li> I love Wen period. and this does a nice job for a mask. Very nourishing</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. The first time I used WEN, I saw the difference it made on my hair; it was soft, manageable, and felt very healthy.  I still enjoy the product with almost the same results.</li>
            <li> I usually have dry easily broken crazy frizzy hair.  I put this product on after washing my hair and leave it in.  I&#x27;m always getting compliments on how soft and healthy my hair looks.  My friends can&#x27;t keep their hands out of it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so far, but my hair loved it! I left it on for about 35 minutes. I could already tell a difference while rinsing it out. I have a terrible problem with my hair falling out in handfuls due to medication, and i was thrilled that barely a strand came out in the shower, or when I combed it out. After it dried, it was soft, shiny, and had lots of body.  I only had to use a small amount because I have such fine, thinning hair, so it will last me awhile, so it will be economical for me as well. I can see how it might be a bit expensive for someone who has really thick or long hair, who would have to use a lot of product to adequately cover their scalp/hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased a few Wen products since they were on sale. This is the only one that I actually like, that seems to make a different in my hair. I left it on wet hair for about 15 min before rinsing out. Softer, easier to style hair after use. I would recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> I have used wen for a year now and I love it. I was a huge skeptic because i have thick, dry curly hair that I have had to use expensive products and lots of them, for years. I can actually just use the cleansing cream with no conditioner and my hair is manageable and soft which is unheard of. I use this treatment once a week so even though the jar is small it lasts me a long time. It smells so good and works great. When i just use the cleansing cream I leave it in for the duration of my shower and then put a little of the cleansing cream in my hair as a leave in conditioner but when I use this too I rinse the cleansing cream out and then keep this in for the duration of my shower. I makes your hair incredibly soft. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> this product is fantastic.. smooth silky hair is what I found when I used this prodcut!</li>
            <li> The products are so nourishing without build up.  I have very fine, thin hair and it works wonders without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent  product! My hair feels great after each use. It does a great job of adding moisture to you hair.</li>
            <li> Love the product but it is a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair masque, and this was a good value through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for the winter. ..No more static in my hair... love it... hope to get all of these products.</li>
            <li> I was running out of this product that I had purchased at Sephora, a store that is pretty expensive at our local mall.  I found this 4 oz pot sold by Brands For Less at $15 not counting shipping.  I called the Sephora store and they wanted $58 for the same size. It came the other day and it looks and feels and smells the same as the real deal I was replacing. People are reviewing this as being counterfeit and I disagree.  My wife&#x27;s hair is as soft and glossy as before so I would tell potential buyers to be much more concerned about the accuracy of some reviews than the quality and effectiveness of this product.  We are very pleased.</li>
            <li> great conditioner which I use weekly.  My hair is like silk!</li>
            <li> I use this product so I look for the best price, an this was a good price. The product is excellent.</li>
            <li> I love the richness but this product is for certain hair, it is excellent in straightening the hair, but you must be careful</li>
            <li> I have lupus and the medications dry my hair out. This works great. I recommend it to anyone of any age or gender.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen hair products for 5 years.  Absolutely love the results that I get with my long hair.  My hair is never dry.  Always managable.  If your are a cancer survivor definitely order the ReMoist Treatment when you hair starts growing back.. Use the cleaning conditioner too.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy, fine, thin curly hair. Wore this overnight and my hair was noticeable healthier the next day. The only thing I wish I knew the first round is to have you hair a bit more wet, If not you&#x27;ll use quite a bit of the container which isn&#x27;t too enjoyable when you are paying $30 for 4 oz. Now knowing that little trick, I feel better reordering this product.</li>
            <li> The Re Moist Intensive Hair Treatment is a gift sent from heaven.  After my first use there was a huge possitive improvement on my hair.  This is a bonus since my hair is color treated it is difficult to find a product that actually moisturizes after just the first use.  I will definitely continue to use the Re Moist Intensive Hair Treatment, can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents available.</li>
            <li> WEN is an awesome product, I have curly hair and this conditioner define my curls and strengthens my hair! amazon rocks it at this price!</li>
            <li> This is not genuine Wen product. I thought the price was too good to be true and it is. Don&#x27;t pay attention to all those 5 star ratings, I guarantee you they either got paid to write those reviews or they don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. I&#x27;m throwing mine away and going to Wen&#x27;s website and paying full price. This stuff is crap. My regular conditioner conditions better then this stuff does. My hair feels like I didn&#x27;t put any type of conditioner in it when I rinse it out, dry, tangled, and stringy. Please, please don&#x27;t waste your money on this. Even the packaging looks fake.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used this product and by coloring my hair and using a curling iron everyday, my ends would get really dry. By using this product I see a big difference in the dryness in my hair, it&#x27;s more manageable.</li>
            <li> its the genuine wen product.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It amazed me when I first used it. I just wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to order it. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> This product works very well for my hair and the cost was superb and  I will be ordering several&lt;br /&gt;more jars of this product on my next pay day.</li>
            <li> Simply love it :)) My other WEN products are awesome also, and this just adds to the list :)) My hair feels absolutely FABULOUS after use :))</li>
            <li> Need to get more of this.</li>
            <li> Best introduction to the products. I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> love this hair treatment</li>
            <li> I started using Wen products about 3 years ago and my hair looks better than ever. I love this conditioner, keeps my hair shiny and conditioned. I swim every day and live in a hot climate and I am in my 60&#x27;s and young women compliment me on my hair. I use all Wen products and so does my husband and we love them all.</li>
            <li> Again the appearance of the product inside as clumpy and again I this left my ends dry very unusual for the fresh Wen product I:m use to I even thought I might have received a bogus product and I can&#x27;t be totally sure O did not It especially did not have the smooth product ?nor also the finish product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy with long hair so this is not just for the ladies, this really makes your hair feel nice and soft, I live in Florida so the sun really dries your hair out. My girlfriend is a hair stylist and uses this product all the time so she turned me on to it, it is pricy but that is the cost of beauty.....LOL</li>
            <li> love it ...  love itt..... love ittt</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Made my hair greasy and oily so I had to wash my hair more frequently which hurt my hair. Not buying it again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t deep condition my hair .ive used a lot of deep conditioners.biolage balm being my fav.this wasn&#x27;t good at all gave it away ...and that person also didn&#x27;t care for it either ....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this on Amazon several times for the price. I&#x27;ve never been disappointed. I have very dry hair and use this as a daily leave in conditioner for my hair. It leaves my hair silky smooth. I never go without it.</li>
            <li> Intense hair loss! Google Wen Hair Loss to see all the other complaints. For sure, do not risk it!  Awful!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing conditioner. It is super thick and really does a great job on my super thick hair. I will order over and over again. A little goes a long way and it has a very slight nice scent. The container is generous in size.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen for just over a month now and I have found it to be an exceptional product.  I used the mask just recently to help with my dry ends (my hair is very long, about to my waist)  I left it in overnight for full effect, and I was very happy with the results.  I will use it again in a couple of weeks to combat the dry weather out here in California.  It made my hair very soft all the way to the tips... and no frizzyness!  YAY</li>
            <li> A great deep conditioner to use.</li>
            <li> By far the best in hair treatments!!!! I will only buy this from now on. I kid you not my hair has never been this soft! It&#x27;s a freakin miracle!</li>
            <li> After doing my homework I have found out that this product may have Chaz Dean&#x27;s name on it with his permission but the ingredients are not the same as his products sold by Chaz Dean.com and QVC.  I actually like this product but it is not the real deal.  Chaz Dean is making money for his name being used and this product would not be considered a knock but it is.  I will never again buy any of his products because money is more important to Chaz Dean than his customers.  Check it out for yourself don&#x27;t take my word for it.  NEVER AGAIN!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff my daughter told me to try this so I did it left my hair soft and smooth and my hair was minty cool</li>
            <li> I love this product for a hair mask.  I use it once a week and it makes my hair shiny and sleek.  I put the product on and then comb it through with the Wet Brush comb.  I then put a shower cap on my head and place a heating pad on low on my head as well.  Then I rinse it out and dry my hair.  Yes, I look silly, but when it is all over my hair looks amazing!  I have not used this on a daily basis.  I usually do this treatment at night, so I cannot speak to how well your hair would style after such treatment.  My hair is very fine and soft and this makes my hair nice and soft.  I probably would not be able to get much volume after treatment, so if you have fine, straight hair, you may want to apply this at night.</li>
            <li> I did not believe the infomercial. I just thought it was another scam. no shampoo could make this big of a difference I&#x27;m happy to say that I am totally wrong. I will never go back to using regular shampoo ever again this makes my hair look like I can&#x27;t even explain it my hair looks better than it has ever looked before so manageable and clean and I could go on and on forever but if you have the means to keep this stuff you should</li>
            <li> I have read some reviews and decided to try it. Left it overnight and the end results were ok. I had better outcome with more economical options so I would not buy it again</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. First I shampooed, rinsed - towel dried my hair - applied the mask and sat for 20 minutes. Rinsed again in the shower. Perfect !</li>
            <li> I been using this product for a while now. It makes my hair softer, detangles hair, and makes it  feel lighter ,bouncy. It also makes my hair shiny too. People at work even noticed the difference of texture in my hair. My hair became brittle, dry, and frizzier. Could be that I&#x27;m getting older, to much sun and salty water from the beach and I know for sure it is also from the hairdryer . My hair is better now that I been using the cleanser and moisturizer, I also just starting to use the oil treatment . I stop using the hairdryer, I &#x27;m also experiencing thinning hair and Chaz says the oils are beneficial for thinning hair so I&#x27;m keeping my fingers cross.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to give some big convoluted review. I&#x27;m a guy who uses this and all I can say is \\&quot;good gawd man\\&quot;...BEST hair products I know of at this point in time. I really don&#x27;t care how much it costs--I&#x27;ve always just wanted something that WORKS. This is it; for me at least. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this Wen product so I must like it! I&#x27;ve tried other similar products that aren&#x27;t quite as good. I like the mostly natural ingredients and it&#x27;s very rich and creamy. I typically use once every few weeks (too pricey to use more than that). The good news...I feel like the price is coming down a bit on this. Used to see it for $50, but now I&#x27;m finding it for $30, which is a tad more reasonable. I would recommend trying this if you are considering. It&#x27;s worth the price if you don&#x27;t use it ALL the time.</li>
            <li> I only used this product once and My hair felt really nice and smooth afterwards.    Someone was asking for instructions.  You can find it here.  Click the \\&quot;How to Use\\&quot; tab on top.  wenhaircare.com</li>
            <li> The product is alright. It only makes your hair soft and pretty at the moment. Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Wish I could afford it more often.</li>
            <li> This is truly the best hair moisturizer I&#x27;ve used on my hair. It is not greasy at all. As a matter of fact, it keeps my hair in place and soft to the touch. I love the way my hair reacts to my curling iron. My hair curls perfectly and the product keeps my hair from frizzing.  I definitely would recommend this product to both sexes.</li>
            <li> I LOVE MY NEW WEN FIND!!!! I do not watch much TV. I am waaay too busy. I managed to catch the Wen commerical one morning. I watched for a few minutes and became curious about the products. I started to research them online and read mixed reviews. I decided to go ahead and take the plunge I ordered the Lavender. I spend ALOT of money on hair care and products and I do not think Wen is out of the norm. You could definitely spend more at your local salon. I have had a terrible time the last 5 years with my hair thinning. I&#x27;ve gone through all the testing and the only thing they were able to tell me was that my scalp was very irritated. It never flaked and hasn&#x27;t appeared dry but its red and itchy. My doctor told me that I was probably allergic to something. I have spent the last few years trying different products. I&#x27;ve tried organic and sulfate-free..I&#x27;ve tried expensive and cheap. Nothing seemed to help. I stopped coloring and hightlighting and it didn&#x27;t help. My Wen arrived last Saturday and I tried it right away. I followed the directions with two washes and even used the Six-Thirteen afterward. I loved the way it made my scalp feel!!! It was amazing. The mint immediately soothed the irritation. Ahhhh!! I left my hair up all day Sunday since we were doing yardwork. I ran Monday morning and did my bootcamp class that night. On Tuesday morning, I washed my hair again using the Wen Conditioning Cleanser as directed. I noticed immediately that while I was rinsing I only had THREE hairs in the tub...ONLY THREE!! I let my hair dry and then styled and also noticed the dry ends that I am usually coating with stuff to make them look healthy looked that way without anything. The only thing I had to use was some spray due to all my baby hairs! I washed again this morning and I had very similar results. I&#x27;m very careful to \\&quot;massage it in\\&quot; and I rinse well. My hair does not look greasy at all. It looks much healthier. I am anxious to see if my reduction in hair lose continuesand if I maintain the results. I&#x27;m pretty excited and I had to share!!!</li>
            <li> Good product, I have course hair and this helps taim it. It builds up fast s a little goes a long way. I add a splash of water to my hand and them rubb the product briskly before applying, better distribution that way.</li>
            <li> This stuff is irreplaceable! It says to leave it on for 20 or more minutes but I have found that the instant it makes contact with my hair, my hair is instantly smoother. Just two quarter sized scoops is sufficient. My hair is down to the middle of my back, thin, mixed African American/Caucasian. My hair is dry &amp; this solved that problem. It does not leave a residue. I use it once per week. It does not weigh my thin hair down at all but you must rinse out thoroughly if you have thin hair. It will weigh thin hair down if it is not completely rinsed out. This may be different for thicker hair. I use no other hair cleansing/conditioning products other than Wen. This stuff is a must have. I stopped using Pantene when I found Wen. I ran out of Wen &amp; used Pantene I had left over. I saw my hair deteriorate in every way within 2 weeks. I also tended to loose hair when brushing &amp; washing with Pantene. I have virtually no hair loss with Wen.</li>
            <li> My hair looks real good all day ,And it takes very little to do the job.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that this was not a true Wen product until after it was delivered.  Deciding to try the authentic shampoo first with this hair treatment and loved the way the my hair looks and feels!  So I decided to use the hair treatment.  Big difference!  my hair did not feel the same as when just using WEN shampoo nor was it as manageable.  Deciding not to use it again when I washed my hair again with WEN, I had more shedding than I have had before I started using WEN or when I just used the shampoo.  I have wasted my money because I will not be using this product again.</li>
            <li> This product does wonders for my curly, lion&#x27;s mane hair! Usually I pair it with the WEN Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner, but even when I don&#x27;t have both available, this stuff alone can keep my hair under control (used with any kind of normal shampoo/conditioner combo). It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy, crunchy, or flat like some products do to mine. It gives my roots the lift they need and keeps my curls together, almost to the point where it looks like I curled them with a curling iron. I always apply it to my hair wet, so that might be part of the reason why I get such great results with this product! It&#x27;s a must try!</li>
            <li> Chaz Dean what would I do without YOU!</li>
            <li> Love the WEN products.  My hair is in wonderful shape, and the Re Moist Intensive Hair Treatment is one of the main reasons.  These products are great for all types of hair, and is the best I&#x27;ve ever found for colored and permed hair.  I just slather this cream on my dirty hair and leave it in for about an hour.  Shampoo as normal (with WEN shampoo, of course, and it leaves your hair feeling softer, gives it more body, and results in a wonderful, healthy shine.  HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Wen is the best but ridiculously expensive. This was a real bargain and it works great!</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen for years and think they are great. At 78 years old my hair my long hair still flows.</li>
            <li> I have used wen for several years.. I should have know the price was too good.  It did not smell, or feel like the original wen.  It did not  do the same job as the original when.</li>
            <li> I use Wen pretty regularly and I could not believe the price I got on these.  Well, while it is acceptable conditioner I am not convinced it is a genuine Wen product.</li>
            <li> WEN is such an amazing product! I don&#x27;t know what hasn&#x27;t already been said about it. My hair is in love with it. This generous item was promptly received in excellent condition. :o)&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> brings back all my hairs body!</li>
            <li> Great in summer after a camping vacation.  It helps to put everything back in place.</li>
            <li> the price was half the usual cost.</li>
            <li> Love the the  remoist treatment. I have dry hair and the moist treatment is bringing it back to life.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift, she loves it on her dry ethnic hair.</li>
            <li> This product works.  It appears to be authentic.  I believe there is confusion between the Gunthy Ranker (spelling??) version and the WEN sold for example at Sephora or on the WEN site.  The naming and packaging for this and ingredients are the same as the one sold at Sephora.  So is the Sephora one fake?  I douibt it.  The one at QVC has a different naming and ingredients display.  Never the less trust me this works.  I have fine, bleached hair and was amazed at my results.  I will say in the past I used this product different option (Lavender) didnt get the same results.  This one worked.  For this size and this price anyone who didnt get this missed out.  This is a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; comment.  I am just a normal shopper. LOL</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading all the great reviews of this making your hair soft and silky... however, this made my hair feel worse (which I didn&#x27;t think that was possible since I damaged my hair with bleach)!! This frizzed my hair, and made it feel even more dry/damaged... I guess it&#x27;s not for everyone. I do recommend buying CHI Keratin silk infusion. It is a very oily product, but if your hair is damaged, then it makes your hair more manageable and its made mine almost as smooth as it used to be before I damaged it. Once it dries on your hair, then your hair won&#x27;t feel oily, just softer! If your hair is healthy than I don&#x27;t know what kind of results you will have. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> My hair needs moisture due to it&#x27;s curlyfrizzy nature. This makes it feel soft! Never had that before! Love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product, but you can get something that works just as well as the drugstore for a lot less.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of posts on here about this being a counterfeit version.  I have never tried Wen products before so I can&#x27;t comment on the authenticity of the hair product itself, but the packaging is not what i would have expected for a list price of $72 (inexpensive container, sticker not centered, etc).  It does smell nice.  Not sure if it is worth it though, even for the amazon price.  For deep moisturizing I&#x27;ve been much happier with jojoba oil and it is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Re Moist for about two years.  I was using it every two weeks but now I use it&lt;br /&gt;every week because I am transitioning from a perm.  I  haven&#x27;t had a perm in five months and I have&lt;br /&gt;experienced very little hair breakage. I am an African American.</li>
            <li> the earring backs holes are to small. so my earring cannot get in it. Love the D.E53 Bootie pumps-shoe fix perfect</li>
            <li> I color my hair a lot and yes over time it has become very dull, frizzy and dry, I have try other products that have stated it will take care of my hair problem but fail to do so... (very upset) so when I saw this product I thought &amp;#34;Ok, let give it a try&amp;#34; I love this product, ladies this really works!! Wow... my hair is soft easy to manage and its getting a healthy.  Very good for your hair &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love this product and have reordered many times. The only reason I wouldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because if I use it daily, it kinda stops being magic for my hair and I have to cycle out to something else before I go back to it. It creates great soft hair without feeling greasy. I love this and will keep ordering. :)</li>
            <li> Perfect and came fast. Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Will buy from again soon. Best if product is left in for 30 minutes and washed with cold water</li>
            <li> I have everything Wen. I think this product is ok, however, the Six Thirteen by Wen kind of surpasses this. This is good if you just need a little extra conditioning and are willing to leave it on overnight. If not, just get the Fig cleansing conditioner and the Six Thirteen, its more intense and does not take as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holly Nicole, Glamour Couture</li>
            <li> Wen has the best hair products I have ever used, works great on dry, over-processed hair, also smells awesome. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Wen Re Moist Intensive Hair Treatment in Sweet Almond has been a blessing for my hair. My medical problems have caused my hair to be very brittle.  Using this twice a week has helped.  I highly recommend Wen Products.</li>
            <li> My first Wen product and it won&#x27;t be my last. I love the feel and smell and my hair is shinier and less frizzy than it&#x27;s ever been. It works just as good as they say it does.</li>
            <li> work on 1st attempt, but left hair with product in ti</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this line of products by my hair stylist and especially love the hair treatment and styling creme.  My hair is just not the same!</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  However, the cleansing conditioner is quite good.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this. It makes your hair fall out.</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo.......... this I can take it or leave it. I feel like I could get the same results for less money.</li>
            <li> I will not repurchase this item again.  I did not see any changes in my hair in regards to moisture.  My hair still dry even though I do not use heating tools to style my hair.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product, so moisturizing for your hair.  Although I don&#x27;t think they mention it, you can use a small amount as a leave-in conditioner.  It can work wonders even with over-processed hair.</li>
            <li> Faith tells me that her hair has never been softer and she was pleasantly surprised at the amount of product that she recieved...you know...for the money I spent.  She has used this product before but was buying smaller packages for an increased price.  Keep up the good work Amazon - product arrived in just a couple days!!!!</li>
            <li> The DC it&#x27;s ok I wish it was a bigger bottle not enough to get two use out of it. But you do feel the mint and your hair  is soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!! Keeps my hair frizz-free and gorgeous! Great experience ordering this, too. Wonderful product. I used it last night and will order again when needed.</li>
            <li> Broke my hair in the crown area</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff just wished it came in a bigger container.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen Product for a few year now and love it.  My hair is so much softer and not as frizzy.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is fantastic.  It is a deep conditioner that smells fantastic and works wonders.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Living in a dry, dry climate and having curly hair, the cleanser and this moist treatment are excellent for my needs.  Thanks, Wen</li>
            <li> Another wonderful Wen product. Really helped restore vitality to my hair.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair shiny and not dry</li>
            <li> Great product. Wonderful deal.</li>
            <li> LOVE WEN MAKES MY HAIR SO SOFT AND SHINEY!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try but am so happy I did.  This is great conditioning mask.  I used it and let it sit overnight as per instructions and it made my hair very soft.  I find that typical treatments make hair soft when the product is in, but once you wash it out your hair feels like straw again.  Not this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very processed, I get highlights all over and hair color every 4- 6 weeks.  I will definitely keep this as part of my hair routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed.  Also smells great!</li>
            <li> I am of mixed race, and this product is the Best ever. My hair has huge waves and curls naturally. I never comb or brush it and Wen works Perfectly for my hair type.</li>
            <li> This product is a trteat when I have the extra time to leave in hair for a hour or more,  It makes your hair feel so soft and thicker. I use with the Wen cleansing conditioner.  I alternate every other day with the styling creme.  People have already remarked my hair looks different even though I have only been using for about a month on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. I always have it on hand for the winter months especially. Always makes mine and my daughter&#x27;s hair feel so much better and healthier after spending a few days a week in a pool.</li>
            <li> I love the way that this leaves your hair soft and managable.I have been using Wen hair care produts for about 9 months and all of my  friends have noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> Hydrates well. My hair is quite damaged &amp; dry. This did wonders for it. I&#x27;ve found a new hair system with WEN. I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> It didnt work as well as I expected it to.&lt;br /&gt;I even used it overnight and it didnt moisturize as well as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I Love this sweet almond mint hair treatment I&#x27;ve only used it three times so far once a week on just my tips because they are very dry and damaged and my tips look like brand new hair, their soft and just look live and beautiful, must buy!</li>
            <li> This treatment is amazing, a must have!</li>
            <li> This is awful. It made my hair so ruff. I was so excited to try it and it did nothing.</li>
            <li> Wen products do not always meet the company&#x27;s claims. I have been using Wen for approximately a year now.  I had to cancel my deliveries because I find the benefits do not justify the high price I have been paying for the product.  Wen has taken away the shine I had on my long curly hair.  Every time I washed my hair with Wen, my hair felt heavy with product; waxy is a better word.  It made my hair soft to the touch but when I tried to air dry it, it was a different story.  It made my curls tighter.  The smell of medicine it leaves on your hair is not attractive at all.  It dried on my hair making it look and feel like a cotton ball.  Because it makes hair more elastic, it also causes hair to curl more as it dries.  Wen also changes the color of your hair.  If you have very light colored hair like me, you will see it change to a brassy tone.  I will be using a good clarifying shampoo to remove the residues of Wen products.  I washed it off with Matrix Shampoo yesterday and it is already looking shinier than when I used Wen.  Wen cleansing conditioner is nothing more than a conditioner.  It is an excellent conditioner, but with no cleansing properties which are essential for shiny and healthy looking hair.  So, Wen&#x27;s claim that Wen is all you need has proven wrong with me.</li>
            <li> My hair has been dried out and frizzy from shampooing and blow drying. I&#x27;ve tried so many other conditioners and even things like hot oil treatments. Most of those had little or no effect, plus many of them left my fine hair feeling weighed down and heavy. I got this Wen Re Moist Treatment with the Wen system and absolutely love it. My hair has been completely changed by this product. I shampoo my hair, put the conditioner on and a plastic hair bonnet over it. I leave it on for a half hour to even a few hours if I have the time. When I rinse it out, my hair is super soft, silky and the dryness is gone. No heavy, greasy residue left behind like many other deep conditioners I&#x27;ve used, which is awesome! I try to use it about once a week or whenever my hair starts feeling dry again. I am already on my second container of this stuff and plan to get more. Great product!</li>
            <li> Delivery of this product was exceptionally fast.  The price was a lot cheaper than what I could buy it from on the Wen site.  The product works great.  It really does leave hair smooth and soft.  It does help keep the frizzies down too.  The smell is fresh and clean and not overpowering.  I didn&#x27;t want to like this product but I love it!!</li>
            <li> I literally can&#x27;t live without this stuff since i first use this like 5 years ago. i have very thin hair and its amazing i totally suggest this product ladies you will love it too</li>
            <li> My hair is dry so I was hoping this would help with that dry brittle look...but it didn&#x27;t.  It made my hair feel soft while wet but not when it dried...felt sticky and dry</li>
            <li> THIS HAIR TREATMENT IS AWESOME. :-D&lt;br /&gt;I GOT A FEW PRODUCTS OF WEN N IT FEELS ON MY HAIR FANTASTIC. :-D&lt;br /&gt;I M A ONE HAPPY CAMPER. :-D&lt;br /&gt;THANK U.</li>
            <li> Helps with making hair look more healthy and soft. Great product with very mild scent, which I need because most scents I have an allergic reaction. Wen offers scented products for people who prefer a scent. All their product are great.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner! It really makes a huge difference in the quality of my hair!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t moisturize my hair at all. I have long, wavy hair and sometimes it tends to get dry. I had high hopes for this product, but it did absolutely nothing for my hair. It actually stripped the natural oils, and the smell is a bit off.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer in the market, leaves your hair healthy, moist and full of renewed life to dull or dry hair!!!</li>
            <li> I think this is counterfeit.  I plan on returning it.</li>
            <li> This product is FABULOUS! I bought it with the original kit and hated all the other stuff but this. Does wonders for my naturally curly hair. Wen will charge you $42 to have it separately!!!! Buy it from here so you don&#x27;t pay more for one product, when you can get their whole bundle for $30!</li>
            <li> NOT a knock off! love this!</li>
            <li> I probably have thee most coarse hair in the world even though I&#x27;m relaxed. This product makes my hair very soft and it eliminates tangles so I&#x27;m actually keeping more hair on my head instead of pulling it out. This product is rich and creamy and I like that. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the jar is so small. I can use that whole jar in one session.</li>
            <li> After treatment with this  product my hair was softer and my hair still look as if it was just permed( after 4 weeks).</li>
            <li> Great product. Came in the mail fast! Would Recommend to others. Makes my hair soft and smooth. Great for dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using wen products for at least a year now. I have not used this product yet but know i will like it.</li>
            <li> When I got hair extensions, I noticed the extension hair was drier and frizzier than my own silky hair.  I&#x27;m a die hards WEN addict, and I tried a bunch of WEN on the extensions, even the 613, and nothing else works as well as Remoist. I am now using it as a daily conditioner, and both my hair and my extensions are in amazing shape. I get compliments all the time and my hair feels and looks better than ever.</li>
            <li> Best leave in conditioner. I always put mousse on when I leave my curly hair out. Sometimes I just put this on and air dry during the day. It make my curls look good.</li>
            <li> This is not the real Wen product. Smells awful. Feels awful. And it definitely does not work the way it should</li>
            <li> Great price excellent product..</li>
            <li> I use it about once a week, and it is really nice, it works really well on my hair, it just smells kinda weird</li>
            <li> I have other wen products that I really like and am excited in trying this product, it was very fast shipping and am really pleased with it</li>
            <li> Love Wen and use this at least once every 10 days</li>
            <li> Have used this product for over a year and my hair is better than it has ever been.  My Granddaughter is 2 years old and has a head of curly hair.....this works magic on those curls.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product! I have Very Long hair and makes it feel Fantastic!</li>
            <li> for the wife but love the way her hair feeld</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of this conditioner. A couple times a week minimizes the damage that styling does to my hair.</li>
            <li> I literally finished the entire treatment and saw no difference. I was disappointed in this product I thought it would improve the conditions of my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great rich conditioner that leaves your hair feeling silky and healthy. The more you use it the more manageable your hair becomes.</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT WAS WONDERFUL I HAD BEEN WANTING TO TRY IT FOR AWHILE. LOVE THE SMELL AND IT LEAVES MY HAIR WITH MORE VOLUME AND SOFTNESS THANKS AGAIN</li>
            <li> Take it from me honestly this is the best treatment for your hair ... when I wet my hair and put some on it looks so nice and shiny.  Tri it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  A little picey but it&#x27;s worth it !!!</li>
            <li> I have colored, permed and thus very dry hair. The Re Moist Intensive Hair Treatment/Sweet Almond is a great product.  I actually mixed it with the Cleansing Conditioner and leave it in for 5 mins and several times a week I will leave it in for approx. and hour. The smell of the product does not linger on the hair after it is rinsed, but my hair does smell good. I get much better results in assisting with my dry hair with this product then I do with traditional shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br /&gt; Some reviewers also stated that the product leaves a residue and leaves the hair weighed down. I did not find this to be the case.&lt;br /&gt;The products are very pricey but they do produce the results. I purchase on Amazon as I do not want to get locked into the WEN auto ship program. I did check the pricing and I pay no more on Amazon and with Prime I pay no shipping.</li>
            <li> Nothing feels like it nourishes my hair from the inside out like Wen by Chaz Dean Intensive Hair Treatment. Nothing.</li>
            <li> This works great for my fiances hair and it is priced fairly. Great price and shipping. The product came undamaged and I&#x27;m very happy.  I would order again for sure.  Thank You Amazon!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product I purchased.  I have used the hair treatment and it works great. I would recommend this product to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I quit using Wen as a whole, but I can not give up the Intensive Hair Treatment!  It makes my hair feel so healthy and look so beautiful!</li>
            <li> If you dont buy another Wen products, buy this one. It makes your hair like silk, and it smells really great.</li>
            <li> If your hair is a mess and you don&#x27;t know what to do, this is the product for you. Use of the product is easy, a treatment does take an hour. The end result is outstanding hair. Amazon has the best price on this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s over-bleached and damaged blond hair comes out silky soft after treatment with this.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped promptly and is as was advertised.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this product to supplement her other Wen products that she uses.  This worked great on her hair (which is thick, dark, and lustrous thanks to her Italian heritage).  She had to leave it in overnight in a shower cap, but the results were worth the time and inconvenience.  Definitely recommended for anyone who wants to take the shine of their hair up to a whole new level.</li>
            <li> Love Wen!!  This worked the best when you could leave it on your hair as long as possible after washing with Wen cleansing conditioner.  I left on all night once and my hair never felt better.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and stuff</li>
            <li> I have two girls with long hair and we have a cabinet full of products that are lousy at detangling.  I know this is for conditioning, but it detangles at the same time very well.  We work this in with fingers then comb it through with a detangling comb in the shower.  It really seems to help.</li>
            <li> Best Product Ever!!!!!#####</li>
            <li> Thought I would try this product as an extra &#x27;frizz tamer&#x27; that would work well with WEN cleanser and it does.</li>
            <li> Worked great. 1st time and hair felt softer.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. It did not really smooth or de frizz my hair even though I left it on for 2 hrs each time.  My hair is still dry. I expected better results.</li>
            <li> My friend suggested this conditioner some time ago.  I love the wonderful smell and I love how it feels on my hair.</li>
            <li> Great for extra conditioning</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel moist and silky.</li>
            <li> Expected visible change in my hair.  Not really seeing that. Ten more words required, ten more words required, ten more words required.</li>
            <li> I got this for my hair and I am happy with this product, works great, great quality and competitive price</li>
            <li> After watching the info on television I thought this was a miracle worker. But no, don&#x27;t waste your money. You can get the same results with over the counter purchases from a salon or beauty store.</li>
            <li> Is a good conditioner to help moisture &amp; soften your hair. And when you use it with the wen shampoo, your hair looks so healthy.</li>
            <li> I believe this is one of the best hair treatments there is.  I&#x27;ve tried squite a few.  My hair is curly/long/frizzy/dry.  This product has done wonders ... feeling soft, shiny, and ringlets!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it ... you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I love the shampoo and was really disappointed in this product. I think the shampoo is more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, my hair dried soft and smooth. However, if you do not use a clarifying shampoo the next time you wash, to wash it all out, it will quickly turn into buildup. My hair became so heavy in the back and felt like I had product in it when I did not. It was disgusting. This product obviously does not moisturize the follicle, but adds a coat of product around the strands to give the appearance of moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have not used it yet.  This was given to my daughter and have not idea if she has used the product.  However, I purchased because we use many other WEN products on our hair.</li>
            <li> My hair looks great after using this product</li>
            <li> This stuff I bought off Amazon is garbage. I am a dedicated WEN user so I know what their products do for hair. I&#x27;ve used the remoist in the past so I knew what to expect. This stuff didn&#x27;t deliver at all. I will never buy off Amazon again. Only straight from WEN or QVC</li>
            <li> Great product.  I love this.  I have not continued to use the shampoo but I do love this hair treatment.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this and other Wen products after seeing the info-mercial on TV. It did not meet that expectation. Perhaps it is because I color treat my hair to cover the gray. I have very curly hair and wanted better control and manageability. It does not surpass any other product on my shelf. It doesn&#x27;t harm my hair either so I will continue to use it up. You may get better results if your hair is not chemically treated in any way. I don&#x27;t know. I just know that the results were disappointing for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking my hair would be really soft and manageable after using it...didn&#x27;t make a bit of difference and I left it on for over 45 minutes every time I used it.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Wen moist intensive hair treatment is a great product especially for curly hair when it is dry and misbehaving.  I love it and I will totally order this product again.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair treatment.  It doesn&#x27;t build up and you can use it every time you wash your hair.</li>
            <li> Seems different than one purchased from &amp;#34;Wen&amp;#34;.  Thicker, kind of goopy.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly coarse hair and this is the best conditioner I have found in a long time. My hair is much more manageable with WEN. Thanks to all on Amazon who have this product a good rating. That&#x27;s what made me try it!</li>
            <li> just as it should have been</li>
            <li> Gives my hair the moisture it needs</li>
            <li> this is the only paste that I have tried that does not leave hair feeling dirty</li>
            <li> All the Wen products over-produce. Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Smells so good . My hair was so dry and it didn&#x27;t help. I used the cleansing conditioner and styling cream along with it, all I got was an oily head of hair</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Definitely spendy, but was great for hair repair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it has stop my hair from breaking!</li>
            <li> I have used almost every top brand hair care product on the market over the years and was very pleased with my Pureology, that is, until I tried Wen! I purchased the Intensive Hair Treatment in Sweet Almond on the recommendation from a friend to use on my very dry hair.  After only one use, not only did my hair feel wonderfully moisturized, but it took care of my scalp which had been itchy. I absolutely love this product and will be buying it again and again!  Also love the Amazon price!!</li>
            <li> I have no complains&lt;br /&gt;I am very please with everything</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> This is a useless product. It doesn&#x27;t do as promised and has little to no effect. I don&#x27;t approve. done</li>
            <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;shipping was very slow</li>
            <li> This mask for the hair from Wen is incredible leave your hair smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> I would suggest everyone switch to this product. My hair has never smelled so good or been so soft. I love this product and swear by the results.</li>
            <li> I can leave on overnight as stated and wash out the next day without the greasy weighed down feeling.  Great compliment to the Wen cleansing system.</li>
            <li> This product really helped my dry hair.  I color regularly so I use all the Wen products, they saved my hair!</li>
            <li> LOVE ALL THE WEN  PRODUCTS. HAVE USED THEM ALL FOR A YEAR NOW AND WILL NEVER SHAMPOO AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE THE WORLDS WORST HAIR REALLY, CORSE CURLY FRIZZ WEN IS THE ONLY PRODUCT I HAVE FOUND THAT CONTROLS&lt;br /&gt;EVERYTHING...</li>
            <li> This is a great hydrating treatment!</li>
            <li> This is a great product that delivers as promised.  I love the way my hair feels after a wash with the cleansing conditioner and after applying this product.  The only reason I haven&#x27;t given it 5 stars is the smell.  It reminds me of Vick&#x27;s Vapor Rub.</li>
            <li> This product really helps to give my hair the moisture it needs to regain it softness and shine.  I use it once a week on my streaked blonde hair and I have noticed a real difference.  It may be my favorite of all the Wen products and I think I will always use it.</li>
            <li> Great Product, Perfect Seller A+</li>
            <li> I love this. It does exactly what it says! Re-moist! I use this mostly on my ends in the shower when my ends feel dry and brittle and this fixes my problem. I also use it as a deep conditioning hair mask when i feel that my hair is in need of intensive treatment. All in all, a great product! Worth the money...yes!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and loved, it helps my hair a great deal, I had been out for a while and was pleased to find the 4oz size for such a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.  Magenta</li>
            <li> I was expecting somthing fabulous--- this isn&#x27;t it.  did not really add shine or improve my hair texture at all.  I have shoulder length highligted hair with a naturally course texture.</li>
            <li> Love all Wen Products. Moisturizing!!!!!</li>
            <li> Does wonders for my hair that is very fine.  It gives my hair body.  I use it once a week.</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried because this Wen Re Moist Intensive Treatment was so much less expensive than on the competitors website that I feared it may be fake as like one other reviewer.  If you pull up images on Google of the container and label, you will notice slightly different \\&quot;shades\\&quot; of yellow/cream on the label.  Mine looks almost exactly like the picture but the shaded areas around the circle are more grey than brown which could be just the camera that was used to take the image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When opening the product for the first time it smelled amazing.  It is a thick cream consistency and slightly greasy to the touch.  Since I had already washed and dried my hair I tried it by using it more as a leaving in conditioner rather than washing it out.  The product worked immediately and made my blonde, dried out, frizzy, hair smooth and supple.  That alone gives it a five star review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why but it was still bothering me that the product could be fake so I took the ingredients label and compared it to the ingredients on the real Wen website and they were a perfect match.  Not that the label couldn&#x27;t be fake too but I feel if the product was fake, they did a terrific job making a knock off and in the end all that really matters is that I have a product that smells wonderful and corrects the horrible damage that&#x27;s been done to my hair.  My guess is that other websites are selling it at the \\&quot;suggested retail\\&quot; price of $58 because there are buyers out there willing to pay.  My guess is that this seller is selling legitimate Wen products that were the rejects from the manufacturer due to the label being slightly discolored. (think Ross or TJ Maxx).  That&#x27;s just my opinion.</li>
            <li> I am a WEN girl now for life</li>
            <li> Works great my hair was super silky!!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shine and keeps it soft .</li>
            <li> I find it left my hair feeling soft and silky</li>
            <li> I was able to purchase as few or as many of this product that I wanted. I was under no obligation this way. I have been in the WEN club for 2 years and wanted to change my ordering. Instead, I was able to save money and get what I wanted, with a very quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> Just like the Wen I order from Wen - but at half the price. I had read in your reviews that this isn&#x27;t the real deal. Well, I disagree - it is the real deal and works beautifully.</li>
            <li> A great product for hair ...  Love it ...</li>
            <li> Chaz Dean is a Genius for making such great products  Awesome !!!!!!</li>
            <li> Best hair product that I&#x27;d ever purchase.  I recommend to everybody who wants beautiful hair :)</li>
            <li> I use this once a week for about an hour.  Makes my hair feel young again, with body.  I would recommend it for anyone</li>
            <li> The best most awesome product for your hair...the sweet almond MINT is Best</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product is authentic or not, but it worked well on my chemically damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I feel the difference</li>
            <li> I wet my hair, put in some regular WEN and then used the Remoist on top of it.  I let my hair sit for an entire day -- it sort of dried looking wet.  That night, I showered, rinsed and used the regular WEN again as I normally would in the shower.  My hair was amazing!  It looked so much better:  healthier, shinier, and a lot less frizzy!  It was soft to the touch and smelled great.  I have tried so many things and this is the only thing that I&#x27;ve ever found to make an immediate difference.  And it stayed that way for quite a while.  I continued using the regular WEN and just do this treatment every couple of months (I&#x27;d do it every week if I could afford it though!)  Every time I get my hair trimmed (which I don&#x27;t do as much as when I used shampoo because I no longer get split ends), the stylist remarks first on how odd it is that I don&#x27;t want her to shampoo my hair (I go there having just cleansed my hair and with it still wet) but the minute she gets her hands on my hair she starts commenting and asking what I use.  She was stunned that I color and use heat to style and have no breakage, split ends or frizz.  This product is fantasic!</li>
            <li> just love it, revived my dry hair into a shining miraclej</li>
            <li> Now that I have let my hair go gray (or in my case silver) I needed a deep treatment that I can use as often as once a week or as little as once a month. My hair is smooth, not oily. It does not have an overwhelming smell like most do and washes out easily. I&#x27;m using this once a month right now and very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Best hair product ever!!! Made my hair so soft and smooth! Love it!</li>
            <li> I first used Wen cleansing conditioner and absolutely loved the way my hair felt. So I thought I would try this and am extremely disappointed. It&#x27;s actually made my hair feel worse than ever. I&#x27;m wondering if this is a counterfeit product?!</li>
            <li> This stuff might work for someone else, but it didn&#x27;t work well for me.  Actually made my hair seem dirty and kind of frizzy.  I don&#x27;t care for the smell either- I can&#x27;t pick up the sweet almond, just the mint.</li>
            <li> Caused me to break out in hives on my face and neck - everywhere the product touched so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone with sensitivity to products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist, and I have been only using Wen for the past year and just love it (once I obeyed the directions!) My hair has never been better! This helps for all the bleaching and dying I do to my hair!</li>
            <li> Love it, makes hair feel great!</li>
            <li> by far the best hair product i have ever used!!!!</li>
            <li> I didnt care for this at all.. I would not rebuy it</li>
            <li> AS MUCH AS I LOVE WEN. I FIND WEN EXPENSIVE&lt;br /&gt;I NO LONGER USE WEN ...I AM VERY MUCH&lt;br /&gt;SATISIFED .WITH  THE&amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60; HAIR ONE PRODUCT LINE&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> As a once every couple of weeks deep conditioner my hair stays in tip top shape even using hot tools on it everyday.  Thank you Chaz!</li>
            <li> made my hair so soft...</li>
            <li> I purchased wen because of all of the hoopla on&lt;br /&gt;T.V. Well I will admit it did make my hair somewhat softer but was it worth it? I don&#x27;t think so. I used the Wen product called Moist Intensive Hair Treatment In Sweet Almond. As I had stated earlier my hair was some what softer but, When I use it my hair always looks as if I didn&#x27;t even shampooed it. My hair looked oily. I think I will not buying any more of it.</li>
