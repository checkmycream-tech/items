            <li>this is the perfect set</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the time to perfect the use of hair rollers, I just wanted them to work.</li>

            <li>Best investment I ever made.</li>
            <li>They are the perfect solution for me.</li>
            <li>my daughter&#x27;s curls were perfect for her pageant and we look forward to using them for her dance competition.</li>

            <li>They work great!!!</li>
            <li>they are awesome.</li>
            <li>I went online to order the Conair Ceramic Jelly Roller sticks from Target, and these work great!</li>
            <li>Years of use &amp; one of Conair&#x27;s best products!</li>
            <li>These are the best things I have found for curling my hair.</li>
            <li>but they have been durable and perfect.</li>
            <li>so I got them and very happy</li>
            <li>AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li>I have had a set of these for probobly 15 years, and mine still work great too!</li>
            <li>My mom loved it!</li>
            <li>They rolled up in my hair beautifully; my hair is shoulder length.</li>
            <li>You can achieve beautiful multiple&lt;br</li>
            <li>As always, Amazon.com customer service is great - but these curlers are anything</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I think they would be great.</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>These rollers are probably great for fine/easy to curl hair, but the curl didn&#x27;t stay for me.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t work great on my hair</li>
            <li>These are great and give great curl.</li>
            <li>Very good for updo&#x27;s and sexy lock.  </li>
            <li>I loved them then . . .</li>
            <li>and I am good to go all day.</li>
            <li>and I loved using it.</li>
            <li>Best curls will result if you allow the rollers to cool thoroughly.</li>
            <li>It came right on time and was in perfect condition when she opened the package.</li>
            <li>This is better than any she has ever had!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything to curl my hair and these work better than anything else!</li>
            <li>I do hair for film and television (mostly Westerns) and I just can&#x27;t function without these sticks!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>I can buy THREE more sets at Walmart and it would still be cheaper than buying one set here!  </li>
            <li>If you use too many, you will have frizz, frizz, frizz!  </li>
            <li>I purchased these rollers because of the amazing reviews it has.  </li>
            <li>You cannot roll your hair effectively without burning your fingers.  </li>
            <li>Leave in overnight at your own risk</li>
            <li>It is kind of tricky, and if they are not put on correctly, your ends will look funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everyone was so nice</li>
            <li>Any kind of movement will dislodge it.</li>
            <li>Nice way to get lots of curls</li>
            <li>Nice set, but burns your fingers.</li>
            <li>Bought it hoping to make nice spiral curls.  </li>
            <li>I ordered it and she could not be more pleased!</li>
            <li>I do love these curlers but have to be honest...</li>
            <li>great for use with on girls with long hair, makes beautiful spiral curls.  </li>
            <li>The Conair Hot Sticks are great.</li>
            <li>They gave me gorgeous curls quickly every mornging.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I think anyone who buys them will love them too.</li>
            <li>Getting the hair onto the roller is tricky and I&#x27;ve burned my fingers many times.  </li>
            <li>I would use them so much more often if I didn&#x27;t dread it.  </li>
            <li>and I still love them.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>They are much better that those I get from a curling iron.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments on my hairstyle after using this product.</li>
            <li>The style holds for hours and my hair still feels healthy after I use them.</li>
            <li>These sticks work really well in creating great curls.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have them to my mom and they work better for her hair type.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll end up with a great set that really holds up to heat and humidity.  </li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>Also, the longer you leave them in, the better.</li>
            <li>but, it is better than burning our fingers for beauty.</li>
            <li>Love the product and the outcome.  </li>
            <li>I  think thicker curlers would work better.</li>
            <li>way better results.</li>
            <li>and I have been burned so many times</li>
            <li>And, as another reviewer said, it may take some practice time to be able to create a style you like.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps I need to practice with it more.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll try to work with it some more and</li>
            <li>but right now, I am not convinced that this was a good purchase for me.</li>
            <li>They work great and heat up pretty quick!</li>
            <li>This product is totally easy to use and makes the best possible curls.</li>
            <li>They work amazing, i have super straight hair and these now make my hair have nice lasting curls, perfect heat and easy to put on!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about these!</li>
            <li>I bought these after reading the reviews and was hoping for something easy I could throw in my hair in the morning and go.</li>
            <li>They are so easy to use.</li>
            <li>It heats very quickly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>They heat up very quickly and set even quicker.</li>
            <li>These are easy to use, but I would recommend for medium to longer hair.</li>
            <li>easy to use.</li>
            <li>But, I think they are not too easy to put on.  </li>
            <li>My hair rolls up easily and stays curly all day.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, with parent supervision of course.</li>
            <li>There is a learning curve to use them, so you might want to practice with it a few times to get a better feel for the best setting pattern for you.  </li>
            <li>(If your hair curls easily these would be great)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is all you need right here! :-)</li>
            <li>I think they are very good: they heat fast, the rollers are pretty cool looking, they are not too bulky, etc.  </li>
            <li>LOVE these    tip; to set curls (with any heated product) for an even longer amount of time, blowdry hair while curlers are still in on a cool setting.</li>
            <li>I love the Hot Sticks, they create the perfect curls, in a short period of time, the curls last (always use a finishing spray!) and look great.</li>
            <li>i use two containers, even with my fine hair, and so after having both sets in you&#x27;re hair, theyre rather heavy,being rubber and all.</li>
            <li>In Australia, we have 240 volt electricity, so I have purchased an adapter, but they work just fine.</li>
            <li>so my hair could be super curly!</li>
            <li>It was a great last minute xmas gift that fit my budget and made shopping easy.</li>
            <li>I love these hot sticks!</li>
            <li>They just don&#x27;t seem to get very hot!...</li>
            <li>I needed a compact set of rollers and these definitely fit the bill.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li>But I liked them so much I bought two sets....</li>
            <li>These rollers are easy to clean if you put hairspray or mouse in your hair (before rolling it or during or after) after use.</li>
            <li>My five year old loved how curly her pony tails got.  </li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s not broke, why fix the good old style curlers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad I found out right away while I still had a chance to return them.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to use, quick, and give me the Marilyn Monroe waves I was dying for.</li>
            <li>wont say that they heat up quickly, easy to put in and secure,and quick</li>
            <li>They take a few minutes to heat to full temperature but work just great!!</li>
            <li>These are very handy, and much easier to use than the older version.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite thing for my hair!</li>
            <li>The heathing unit in mine just burnt out so I am buying a new set but after 12 years I am more than okay with that.</li>
            <li>Rollers got real hot and burned the fingers.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find them on Amazon, and so I ordered two sets.</li>
            <li>I love my Hot Sticks...</li>
            <li>My original unit had 20 sticks...</li>
            <li>It was great when I had long hair, and still when it&#x27;s shorter (shoulder length).  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to try these, but when I plugged the unit in, nothing happened.</li>
            <li>Sometimes they get tangled in my hair because my hair is so long however they do a great job to curl.</li>
            <li>I had these a long time ago and my hair always looked great until they burned out.  </li>
            <li>When I first used them years ago, I wasn&#x27;t so pleased with the results, but trying using fewer rollers was my answer.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been this happy with curlers in a long time!  </li>
            <li>I coach cheerleading and every year I use them to set my girls hair and they are blown away by how comfortable they are, how quick the curls set, and how well it works with every hair type.</li>
            <li>but they actually work very nicely and fast!!</li>
            <li>They certainly aren&#x27;t good for layered hair of any kind, unless your hair is extremely long!</li>
            <li>The advertisements say that it is good for long hair, but it is easy to use on the 1 1/2\\&quot; bottom-ends of my less-than-shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a wedding photographer and have been to many &#x27;getting ready&#x27; sessions.</li>
            <li>the heat of the product conforms it to take shape and the cool blast shocks the hairs to keep it that way</li>
            <li>I love these things.&lt;br /&gt;The power of these flimsy sticks is very underestimated.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and left my hair with a nice bounce.</li>
            <li>the curlers don&#x27;t consistently stay in your hair &amp; they can be very hot to handle - they do heat up very quickly</li>
            <li>A BIG YES to this item for sure :)</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick too</li>
            <li>After watching the video, I was able to replicate these pretty curls on the first try.  </li>
            <li>they heat up fast, they curl fast, and most importantly for me, they KEEP the curl.</li>
            <li>They cool off pretty quickly and don&#x27;t work for my super stubborn hair.  </li>
            <li>These curling rods are so fast and easy compared to a curling iron.</li>
            <li>If your looking for something fun, fast and easy, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>With practice, these are easy to use and remarkable in keeping a curl all day with no more product than hairspray after styling.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, straight, and waist-length.</li>
            <li>The girl also had fine straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I have used them on myself and my daughter, and have not found the trick yet on how to effectively put them on (especially for layared</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t worth your time if you have curl resistant hair.</li>
            <li>I love it and now don&#x27;t have to worry about using my old one anymore.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like the clear plastic top though as it doesn&#x27;t snap on but just rests in place.</li>
            <li>I will never go back to another kind again.</li>
            <li>I removed the hairs from the rollers &amp; got a wet cloth &amp; cleaned up the box (which I think the seller should have done) &amp; the my daughter-in-law loved them.</li>
            <li>No matter how perfectly I wrap and unwrap my hair the curls are always sloppy and frizzy.</li>
            <li>No one in their right mind would buy something for their hair that was used.  </li>
            <li>I was over joyed and bought one right away.</li>
            <li>As for the shipper, I got them right away.</li>
            <li>These are very cool (hot actually) but they wrap easy and make lots of curls.  </li>
            <li>They do heat up pretty quick and they stay in pretty well.</li>
            <li>Easy enough but the good &#x27;ol flat iron may be the way to go</li>
            <li>/&gt;Wrapping your hair from the top of your head down will create a cute wavy look to your hair (you will need clips to hold the reverse roll) or if you roll it bottom to top you get the traditional curl.</li>
            <li>Does produce a nice curl if you  leave them in for a very long time...</li>
            <li>out\\&quot; and then spray it with hairspray..and even when i don&#x27;t the curl still (amazingly) holds for a pretty long time.     </li>
            <li>They heat extremely fast, and get very hot . . .</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>If my set of hot sticks wears out, I will definitely be trying to find more right away.  </li>
            <li>I have never seen curls as tight, or that lasted as long and perfect on a bride before.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re super easy to fix back up again.</li>
            <li>These work pretty well.</li>
            <li>see that this model has 14.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to search to see if hot sticks were still around</li>
            <li>My wife had been using this type of hairsetter for many years and the one she had finally wore out.</li>
            <li>I first used a friends hot sticks about 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li>They also last more than 2 days.</li>
            <li>For some many of my later years I went to the beauty parlor for a perm to give me kinky hair for some volume.  </li>
            <li>This \\&quot;Hot Sticks\\</li>
            <li>I have had Hot Sticks for over 20 years, and it still works.  </li>
            <li>They stay hot and slides away from your hair when you remove them.  </li>
            <li>just wish conair sold this as a bigger and more put together package.</li>
            <li>I paid $12-14 dollars for this exact product about 6-8 months ago</li>
            <li>Great long lasting product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Hot Sticks on and off for over 20 years.</li>
            <li>and they are exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I have used these Hot Sticks for over thirty years.  </li>
            <li>I have had my HOT STICKS* for 12 years</li>
            <li>Great for long or short hair.</li>
            <li>Hot Sticks did not work for me.  </li>
            <li>These hot sticks are exactly what they are called &amp;#34;Hot Sticks&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Almost too hot to hold in your hands when trying to wrap your hair.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I have been using hot sticks now for about 25 years.  </li>
            <li>Was looking to replace with something more modern, perhaps bigger rollers.</li>
            <li>Love the flexability of being able to have soft waves or tight curls, depending on how I roll it.  </li>
            <li>size of this set should be fine for most hair, but as one reviewer said, you can take out some earlier, put them back into their space and reheat a bit and use somewhere else on your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I agree with the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>By the time you&#x27;ve wrapped the whole head of hair, the side you started on is set and ready to unwrap already!</li>
            <li>You need about three sets of these to be able to do your hair or you will be at this for a long time to get your hair curled.</li>
            <li>If you like different hairstyles then you will love the new look you can achieve with these sticks!</li>
            <li>they are really way too hot to handle once they are ready</li>
            <li>She has long very straight fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have an older set, and they tended to get too hot and burn my scalp, these do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use and curls fine hair that won&#x27;t usually hold a curl.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take up much space either.  </li>
            <li>She looked in many stores and could not find anything that remotely resembled what she wanted.</li>
            <li>I get really bouncy curls that hold all day.</li>
            <li>My hair comes very curly with lots of body.</li>
            <li>VERY EAST TO USE AND WORKS</li>
            <li>VERY WELL.</li>
            <li>Priced reasonably too...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you can get burned by these rollers unless you really try.</li>
            <li>If you have straight hair, do NOT buy this set of curlers.  </li>
            <li>careful, be sure to get the edges of your hair curled in</li>
            <li>(Fishhooks are when the hair gets straight in the bottom and everything else is curly).</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I would say if you are looking for what I wanted, and have straight hair, get a Bed Head curling rod...</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really trun out like I had envisioned.  </li>
            <li>By far, the most lasting curls!</li>
            <li>However, over time my thick gorgeous curls became thinner and thinner....</li>
            <li>Within only a few minutes my six year old daughter&#x27;s straight hair was beautifully curly.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and does not hold a curl for very long--the hot sticks give a curl that actually lasts ALL day long with almost no styling products.  </li>
            <li>The curlers are not so hot that they would pose a burning risk my daughter, but are hot enough to make curls without applying hair products first.  </li>
            <li>It does produce a tighter curl with the thinner sticks, so I got two sets, which you will need anyway if you have long hair, to distribute the sticks and produce a more natural look.  </li>
            <li>Again, these work great and the curls are smaller (but way longer lasting) than your typical hot roller styles.</li>
            <li>The brides hair &#x27;never holds curl&#x27; and she looked fabulous all day long.</li>
            <li>i had been looking everywhere around town for these hot sticks (had even young people look at me and say they do not make those anymore)  </li>
            <li>and I think lose their heat much slower, therefore setting the curl a little better.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and the curl does not last long</li>
            <li>Curls seem more of a tangled mess to me.  </li>
            <li>The Conair HS18W hot sticks are just hollow rubber with coiled wires and lose their heat too quickly to make curls.  </li>
            <li>I had a friend in high school who had these</li>
            <li>Most people would release these rollers after a few seconds, but for those who have a more difficult time with motor skills, even if you held them for more than 10 seconds, the burn would not be severe -- if at all.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>BUT, this item is WAY too high here, since Walmart has them for $12.  </li>
            <li>Since I have waist length hair now, I need a few more sets.</li>
            <li>The curls are pretty tight but that can be a good thing if curls tend to fall out in your hair after a few hours.</li>
            <li>She loves it and when I went to buy her a new set I couldn&#x27;t find them in the stores.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a new product.  </li>
            <li>I guess I got a dud, but even if it had worked, the product felt really cheap; these are definitely not built to last.</li>
            <li>Using these sticks I can get her hair really curly and the curls last so much longer.</li>
            <li>The middle of the stick gets hot, so handle them by holding the ends.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably just stick to my regular hot rollers.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The conair hot sticks is the only hair curlers that have ever attempted to even curl my hair.</li>
            <li>they get so hot they sometimes burn my scalp or the back of my ears.</li>
            <li>My 10 year old loves it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had very fine, long (middle of back)</li>
            <li>This set is easy to use, no pins needed, and your hair is curly in just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>Only con is I wish it came with more then just 14 rollers, I have to buy a whole other kit to get enough for my hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter has stick straight hair and using the curling iron only created loose curls that quickly fell out.</li>
            <li>I can do my hair many different ways with hot sticks, and it only takes a few minutes to set.  </li>
            <li>If you have fine baby hair to thick straight hair and want to add body and curl to your hair</li>
            <li>It is hard to keep them shut, much better just to use the old fashioned curlers.  </li>
            <li>The finished product looks great, but the sticks kept slipping out after they were placed, which was extremely frustrating.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to use them yet because I get frustrated with them and just pull out the one or two that I have been able to get in.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll get these for myself and my young neice.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t even aware they still existed until I found them on Amazon; I&#x27;ve had a beat-up set from my childhood for a long time.</li>
            <li>It was over 10 years old</li>
            <li>but these things heat up fast and actually leave a curl patter</li>
            <li>The only problem is you need two sets of these to cover your whole head.</li>
            <li>soft grip doesn&#x27;t pull and they don&#x27;t fry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Often when I curl her hair using a curling iron, it is back to straight within 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I can appreciate the fact that it actually curls my straight hair, but I don&#x27;t want unruly curls, I wanted them to add wave/soft spirals.  </li>
            <li>The ends of your hair don&#x27;t curl smoothly so looks messy to me.  </li>
            <li>the new set barely gives my hair a wave.</li>
            <li>When I don&#x27;t feel like blow drying my hair, I just let it air dry and then put these hot sticks in for just a minute or so.</li>
            <li>My hair is baby fine, and it is a bit longer than halfway down my back.  </li>
            <li>(I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the jelly rollers, which are a little harder to roll, but they are made from solid rubber</li>
            <li>They are much faster to use than a curling iron and you can leave them in as long as you need to so that you can ensure curls that hang around all night or day.</li>
            <li>It takes some practice, but even when I mess up putting them in I still get great looking little spiral curls and they last so long!</li>
            <li>Now, years later, I ended up getting my refund when I purchased a new set.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and these hot sticks not only curled my hair but the curl stay in all day!</li>
            <li>They absolutely create curls that will last all day long....and even to the next day.  </li>
            <li>No other curling device can do that.</li>
            <li>These work really well and hold the curls for a very long time with no hairspray needed!</li>
            <li>I went as long as 4 days without the curls falling straight, nor did i have to use rollers on subsequent nights)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have gone back to my old rollers just for ease of operation.</li>
            <li>and I fix my hair with a different tool or have to completely soak my hair with water.  </li>
            <li>The hot sticks heat up fast but they are pretty difficult to use and pop off sometimes.</li>
            <li>My oldest daughter has hair down to mid-thigh length, and she uses hot sticks to curl her hair.  </li>
            <li>I love them for my cheer curls but they&#x27;re a little to tight to work well for daily curls.</li>
            <li>The units are as slim as they can be, but the top covers arent secure and seem to fall off anychance they get (quite noisy and annoying</li>
            <li>if you run out of hot sticks mid-curling you can take some \\&quot;done\\&quot; ones out of your hair and they&#x27;ll be heated back up in less then 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>I do burn my fingers putting them on and if my hair was any thicker I would need two sets because I barely have enough to put all over my head as it is.  </li>
            <li>I should have returned the first set, it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li>I have hair down to my waist and it is 100% straight.</li>
            <li>think this set is ideal for someone with hair that is at least shoulder length, because I got my hair cut in an angled bob (above shoulder length), and have since been unable to use these (the hair slips out, because too short).</li>
            <li>I had one of these hair setters previously but it was worn out from so much use.</li>
            <li>and lastly, as i said, sometimes the curls are just too tight    pros- heat fast.</li>

            <li> Years of use &amp; one of Conair&#x27;s best products!</li>
            <li> These are the best things I have found for curling my hair.</li>

            <li> AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li> I have had a set of these for probobly 15 years, and mine still work great too!</li>
            <li> My mom loved it!</li>
            <li> They rolled up in my hair beautifully; my hair is shoulder length.</li>
            <li> You can achieve beautiful multiple&lt;br</li>
            <li> As always, Amazon.com customer service is great - but these curlers are anything</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I think they would be great.</li>
            <li> LOL</li>
            <li> Great product</li>
            <li> These rollers are probably great for fine/easy to curl hair, but the curl didn&#x27;t stay for me.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work great on my hair</li>
            <li> These are great and give great curl.</li>
            <li> Very good for updo&#x27;s and sexy lock.  </li>
            <li> I loved them then . . .</li>
            <li> and I am good to go all day.</li>
            <li> and I loved using it.</li>
            <li> Best curls will result if you allow the rollers to cool thoroughly.</li>
            <li> It came right on time and was in perfect condition when she opened the package.</li>
            <li> This is better than any she has ever had!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to curl my hair and these work better than anything else!</li>
            <li> I do hair for film and television (mostly Westerns) and I just can&#x27;t function without these sticks!</li>
            <li> Love them!</li>
            <li> I can buy THREE more sets at Walmart and it would still be cheaper than buying one set here!  </li>
            <li> If you use too many, you will have frizz, frizz, frizz!  </li>
            <li> I purchased these rollers because of the amazing reviews it has.  </li>
            <li> You cannot roll your hair effectively without burning your fingers.  </li>
            <li> Leave in overnight at your own risk</li>
            <li> It is kind of tricky, and if they are not put on correctly, your ends will look funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everyone was so nice</li>
            <li> Any kind of movement will dislodge it.</li>
            <li> Nice way to get lots of curls</li>
            <li> Nice set, but burns your fingers.</li>
            <li> Bought it hoping to make nice spiral curls.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it and she could not be more pleased!</li>
            <li> I do love these curlers but have to be honest...</li>
            <li> great for use with on girls with long hair, makes beautiful spiral curls.  </li>
            <li> The Conair Hot Sticks are great.</li>
            <li> They gave me gorgeous curls quickly every mornging.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I think anyone who buys them will love them too.</li>
            <li> Getting the hair onto the roller is tricky and I&#x27;ve burned my fingers many times.  </li>
            <li> I would use them so much more often if I didn&#x27;t dread it.  </li>
            <li> and I still love them.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> They are much better that those I get from a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I get many compliments on my hairstyle after using this product.</li>
            <li> The style holds for hours and my hair still feels healthy after I use them.</li>
            <li> These sticks work really well in creating great curls.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have them to my mom and they work better for her hair type.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll end up with a great set that really holds up to heat and humidity.  </li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> Also, the longer you leave them in, the better.</li>
            <li> but, it is better than burning our fingers for beauty.</li>
            <li> Love the product and the outcome.  </li>
            <li> I  think thicker curlers would work better.</li>
            <li> way better results.</li>
            <li> and I have been burned so many times</li>
            <li> And, as another reviewer said, it may take some practice time to be able to create a style you like.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I need to practice with it more.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll try to work with it some more and</li>
            <li> but right now, I am not convinced that this was a good purchase for me.</li>
            <li> They work great and heat up pretty quick!</li>
            <li> This product is totally easy to use and makes the best possible curls.</li>
            <li> They work amazing, i have super straight hair and these now make my hair have nice lasting curls, perfect heat and easy to put on!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about these!</li>
            <li> I bought these after reading the reviews and was hoping for something easy I could throw in my hair in the morning and go.</li>
            <li> They are so easy to use.</li>
            <li> It heats very quickly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> They heat up very quickly and set even quicker.</li>
            <li> These are easy to use, but I would recommend for medium to longer hair.</li>
            <li> easy to use.</li>
            <li> But, I think they are not too easy to put on.  </li>
            <li> My hair rolls up easily and stays curly all day.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, with parent supervision of course.</li>
            <li> There is a learning curve to use them, so you might want to practice with it a few times to get a better feel for the best setting pattern for you.  </li>
            <li> (If your hair curls easily these would be great)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is all you need right here! :-)</li>
            <li> I think they are very good: they heat fast, the rollers are pretty cool looking, they are not too bulky, etc.  </li>
            <li> LOVE these    tip; to set curls (with any heated product) for an even longer amount of time, blowdry hair while curlers are still in on a cool setting.</li>
            <li> I love the Hot Sticks, they create the perfect curls, in a short period of time, the curls last (always use a finishing spray!) and look great.</li>
            <li> i use two containers, even with my fine hair, and so after having both sets in you&#x27;re hair, theyre rather heavy,being rubber and all.</li>
            <li> In Australia, we have 240 volt electricity, so I have purchased an adapter, but they work just fine.</li>
            <li> so my hair could be super curly!</li>
            <li> It was a great last minute xmas gift that fit my budget and made shopping easy.</li>
            <li> I love these hot sticks!</li>
            <li> They just don&#x27;t seem to get very hot!...</li>
            <li> I needed a compact set of rollers and these definitely fit the bill.</li>
            <li> They are comfortable to sleep in.</li>
            <li> But I liked them so much I bought two sets....</li>
            <li> These rollers are easy to clean if you put hairspray or mouse in your hair (before rolling it or during or after) after use.</li>
            <li> My five year old loved how curly her pony tails got.  </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s not broke, why fix the good old style curlers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad I found out right away while I still had a chance to return them.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to use, quick, and give me the Marilyn Monroe waves I was dying for.</li>
            <li> wont say that they heat up quickly, easy to put in and secure,and quick</li>
            <li> They take a few minutes to heat to full temperature but work just great!!</li>
            <li> These are very handy, and much easier to use than the older version.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite thing for my hair!</li>
            <li> The heathing unit in mine just burnt out so I am buying a new set but after 12 years I am more than okay with that.</li>
            <li> Rollers got real hot and burned the fingers.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find them on Amazon, and so I ordered two sets.</li>
            <li> I love my Hot Sticks...</li>
            <li> My original unit had 20 sticks...</li>
            <li> It was great when I had long hair, and still when it&#x27;s shorter (shoulder length).  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to try these, but when I plugged the unit in, nothing happened.</li>
            <li> Sometimes they get tangled in my hair because my hair is so long however they do a great job to curl.</li>
            <li> I had these a long time ago and my hair always looked great until they burned out.  </li>
            <li> When I first used them years ago, I wasn&#x27;t so pleased with the results, but trying using fewer rollers was my answer.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been this happy with curlers in a long time!  </li>
            <li> I coach cheerleading and every year I use them to set my girls hair and they are blown away by how comfortable they are, how quick the curls set, and how well it works with every hair type.</li>
            <li> but they actually work very nicely and fast!!</li>
            <li> They certainly aren&#x27;t good for layered hair of any kind, unless your hair is extremely long!</li>
            <li> The advertisements say that it is good for long hair, but it is easy to use on the 1 1/2\\&quot; bottom-ends of my less-than-shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a wedding photographer and have been to many &#x27;getting ready&#x27; sessions.</li>
            <li> the heat of the product conforms it to take shape and the cool blast shocks the hairs to keep it that way</li>
            <li> I love these things.&lt;br /&gt;The power of these flimsy sticks is very underestimated.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and left my hair with a nice bounce.</li>
            <li> the curlers don&#x27;t consistently stay in your hair &amp; they can be very hot to handle - they do heat up very quickly</li>
            <li> A BIG YES to this item for sure :)</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick too</li>
            <li> After watching the video, I was able to replicate these pretty curls on the first try.  </li>
            <li> they heat up fast, they curl fast, and most importantly for me, they KEEP the curl.</li>
            <li> They cool off pretty quickly and don&#x27;t work for my super stubborn hair.  </li>
            <li> These curling rods are so fast and easy compared to a curling iron.</li>
            <li> If your looking for something fun, fast and easy, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> With practice, these are easy to use and remarkable in keeping a curl all day with no more product than hairspray after styling.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, straight, and waist-length.</li>
            <li> The girl also had fine straight hair.  </li>
            <li> I have used them on myself and my daughter, and have not found the trick yet on how to effectively put them on (especially for layared</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t worth your time if you have curl resistant hair.</li>
            <li> I love it and now don&#x27;t have to worry about using my old one anymore.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the clear plastic top though as it doesn&#x27;t snap on but just rests in place.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to another kind again.</li>
            <li> I removed the hairs from the rollers &amp; got a wet cloth &amp; cleaned up the box (which I think the seller should have done) &amp; the my daughter-in-law loved them.</li>
            <li> No matter how perfectly I wrap and unwrap my hair the curls are always sloppy and frizzy.</li>
            <li> No one in their right mind would buy something for their hair that was used.  </li>
            <li> I was over joyed and bought one right away.</li>
            <li> As for the shipper, I got them right away.</li>
            <li> These are very cool (hot actually) but they wrap easy and make lots of curls.  </li>
            <li> They do heat up pretty quick and they stay in pretty well.</li>
            <li> Easy enough but the good &#x27;ol flat iron may be the way to go</li>
            <li> /&gt;Wrapping your hair from the top of your head down will create a cute wavy look to your hair (you will need clips to hold the reverse roll) or if you roll it bottom to top you get the traditional curl.</li>
            <li> Does produce a nice curl if you  leave them in for a very long time...</li>
            <li> out\\&quot; and then spray it with hairspray..and even when i don&#x27;t the curl still (amazingly) holds for a pretty long time.     </li>
            <li> They heat extremely fast, and get very hot . . .</li>
            <li> The price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> If my set of hot sticks wears out, I will definitely be trying to find more right away.  </li>
            <li> I have never seen curls as tight, or that lasted as long and perfect on a bride before.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re super easy to fix back up again.</li>
            <li> These work pretty well.</li>
            <li> see that this model has 14.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to search to see if hot sticks were still around</li>
            <li> My wife had been using this type of hairsetter for many years and the one she had finally wore out.</li>
            <li> I first used a friends hot sticks about 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li> They also last more than 2 days.</li>
            <li> For some many of my later years I went to the beauty parlor for a perm to give me kinky hair for some volume.  </li>
            <li> This \\&quot;Hot Sticks\\</li>
            <li> I have had Hot Sticks for over 20 years, and it still works.  </li>
            <li> They stay hot and slides away from your hair when you remove them.  </li>
            <li> just wish conair sold this as a bigger and more put together package.</li>
            <li> I paid $12-14 dollars for this exact product about 6-8 months ago</li>
            <li> Great long lasting product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Hot Sticks on and off for over 20 years.</li>
            <li> and they are exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have used these Hot Sticks for over thirty years.  </li>
            <li> I have had my HOT STICKS* for 12 years</li>
            <li> Great for long or short hair.</li>
            <li> Hot Sticks did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> These hot sticks are exactly what they are called &amp;#34;Hot Sticks&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Almost too hot to hold in your hands when trying to wrap your hair.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have been using hot sticks now for about 25 years.  </li>
            <li> Was looking to replace with something more modern, perhaps bigger rollers.</li>
            <li> Love the flexability of being able to have soft waves or tight curls, depending on how I roll it.  </li>
            <li> size of this set should be fine for most hair, but as one reviewer said, you can take out some earlier, put them back into their space and reheat a bit and use somewhere else on your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I agree with the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> By the time you&#x27;ve wrapped the whole head of hair, the side you started on is set and ready to unwrap already!</li>
            <li> You need about three sets of these to be able to do your hair or you will be at this for a long time to get your hair curled.</li>
            <li> If you like different hairstyles then you will love the new look you can achieve with these sticks!</li>
            <li> they are really way too hot to handle once they are ready</li>
            <li> She has long very straight fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have an older set, and they tended to get too hot and burn my scalp, these do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use and curls fine hair that won&#x27;t usually hold a curl.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take up much space either.  </li>
            <li> She looked in many stores and could not find anything that remotely resembled what she wanted.</li>
            <li> I get really bouncy curls that hold all day.</li>
            <li> My hair comes very curly with lots of body.</li>
            <li> VERY EAST TO USE AND WORKS</li>
            <li> VERY WELL.</li>
            <li> Priced reasonably too...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you can get burned by these rollers unless you really try.</li>
            <li> If you have straight hair, do NOT buy this set of curlers.  </li>
            <li> careful, be sure to get the edges of your hair curled in</li>
            <li> (Fishhooks are when the hair gets straight in the bottom and everything else is curly).</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> I would say if you are looking for what I wanted, and have straight hair, get a Bed Head curling rod...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really trun out like I had envisioned.  </li>
            <li> By far, the most lasting curls!</li>
            <li> However, over time my thick gorgeous curls became thinner and thinner....</li>
            <li> Within only a few minutes my six year old daughter&#x27;s straight hair was beautifully curly.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and does not hold a curl for very long--the hot sticks give a curl that actually lasts ALL day long with almost no styling products.  </li>
            <li> The curlers are not so hot that they would pose a burning risk my daughter, but are hot enough to make curls without applying hair products first.  </li>
            <li> It does produce a tighter curl with the thinner sticks, so I got two sets, which you will need anyway if you have long hair, to distribute the sticks and produce a more natural look.  </li>
            <li> Again, these work great and the curls are smaller (but way longer lasting) than your typical hot roller styles.</li>
            <li> The brides hair &#x27;never holds curl&#x27; and she looked fabulous all day long.</li>
            <li> i had been looking everywhere around town for these hot sticks (had even young people look at me and say they do not make those anymore)  </li>
            <li> and I think lose their heat much slower, therefore setting the curl a little better.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and the curl does not last long</li>
            <li> Curls seem more of a tangled mess to me.  </li>
            <li> The Conair HS18W hot sticks are just hollow rubber with coiled wires and lose their heat too quickly to make curls.  </li>
            <li> I had a friend in high school who had these</li>
            <li> Most people would release these rollers after a few seconds, but for those who have a more difficult time with motor skills, even if you held them for more than 10 seconds, the burn would not be severe -- if at all.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> BUT, this item is WAY too high here, since Walmart has them for $12.  </li>
            <li> Since I have waist length hair now, I need a few more sets.</li>
            <li> The curls are pretty tight but that can be a good thing if curls tend to fall out in your hair after a few hours.</li>
            <li> She loves it and when I went to buy her a new set I couldn&#x27;t find them in the stores.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a new product.  </li>
            <li> I guess I got a dud, but even if it had worked, the product felt really cheap; these are definitely not built to last.</li>
            <li> Using these sticks I can get her hair really curly and the curls last so much longer.</li>
            <li> The middle of the stick gets hot, so handle them by holding the ends.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably just stick to my regular hot rollers.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The conair hot sticks is the only hair curlers that have ever attempted to even curl my hair.</li>
            <li> they get so hot they sometimes burn my scalp or the back of my ears.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old loves it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had very fine, long (middle of back)</li>
            <li> This set is easy to use, no pins needed, and your hair is curly in just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Only con is I wish it came with more then just 14 rollers, I have to buy a whole other kit to get enough for my hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has stick straight hair and using the curling iron only created loose curls that quickly fell out.</li>
            <li> I can do my hair many different ways with hot sticks, and it only takes a few minutes to set.  </li>
            <li> If you have fine baby hair to thick straight hair and want to add body and curl to your hair</li>
            <li> It is hard to keep them shut, much better just to use the old fashioned curlers.  </li>
            <li> The finished product looks great, but the sticks kept slipping out after they were placed, which was extremely frustrating.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to use them yet because I get frustrated with them and just pull out the one or two that I have been able to get in.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll get these for myself and my young neice.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t even aware they still existed until I found them on Amazon; I&#x27;ve had a beat-up set from my childhood for a long time.</li>
            <li> It was over 10 years old</li>
            <li> but these things heat up fast and actually leave a curl patter</li>
            <li> The only problem is you need two sets of these to cover your whole head.</li>
            <li> soft grip doesn&#x27;t pull and they don&#x27;t fry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Often when I curl her hair using a curling iron, it is back to straight within 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I can appreciate the fact that it actually curls my straight hair, but I don&#x27;t want unruly curls, I wanted them to add wave/soft spirals.  </li>
            <li> The ends of your hair don&#x27;t curl smoothly so looks messy to me.  </li>
            <li> the new set barely gives my hair a wave.</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t feel like blow drying my hair, I just let it air dry and then put these hot sticks in for just a minute or so.</li>
            <li> My hair is baby fine, and it is a bit longer than halfway down my back.  </li>
            <li> (I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the jelly rollers, which are a little harder to roll, but they are made from solid rubber</li>
            <li> They are much faster to use than a curling iron and you can leave them in as long as you need to so that you can ensure curls that hang around all night or day.</li>
            <li> It takes some practice, but even when I mess up putting them in I still get great looking little spiral curls and they last so long!</li>
            <li> Now, years later, I ended up getting my refund when I purchased a new set.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and these hot sticks not only curled my hair but the curl stay in all day!</li>
            <li> They absolutely create curls that will last all day long....and even to the next day.  </li>
            <li> No other curling device can do that.</li>
            <li> These work really well and hold the curls for a very long time with no hairspray needed!</li>
            <li> I went as long as 4 days without the curls falling straight, nor did i have to use rollers on subsequent nights)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have gone back to my old rollers just for ease of operation.</li>
            <li> and I fix my hair with a different tool or have to completely soak my hair with water.  </li>
            <li> The hot sticks heat up fast but they are pretty difficult to use and pop off sometimes.</li>
            <li> My oldest daughter has hair down to mid-thigh length, and she uses hot sticks to curl her hair.  </li>
            <li> I love them for my cheer curls but they&#x27;re a little to tight to work well for daily curls.</li>
            <li> The units are as slim as they can be, but the top covers arent secure and seem to fall off anychance they get (quite noisy and annoying</li>
            <li> if you run out of hot sticks mid-curling you can take some \\&quot;done\\&quot; ones out of your hair and they&#x27;ll be heated back up in less then 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> I do burn my fingers putting them on and if my hair was any thicker I would need two sets because I barely have enough to put all over my head as it is.  </li>
            <li> I should have returned the first set, it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have hair down to my waist and it is 100% straight.</li>
            <li> think this set is ideal for someone with hair that is at least shoulder length, because I got my hair cut in an angled bob (above shoulder length), and have since been unable to use these (the hair slips out, because too short).</li>
            <li> I had one of these hair setters previously but it was worn out from so much use.</li>
            <li> and lastly, as i said, sometimes the curls are just too tight    pros- heat fast.</li>
            <li> The description said this was a new item with a slightly damaged box.  </li>
            <li> Her only complaint about them is that they sometimes hurt when you remove them, but you can minimize that by simply being extra gentle.</li>
            <li> Have had my set of hot sticks for at least 20 years.  </li>
            <li> product and results last long.</li>
            <li> but I do think maybe my hair is \\&quot;not quite\\&quot; long enough</li>
            <li> A definite must-have if you have long hair.  </li>
            <li> The only way to give it any body is to blow dry it with lots of gel.</li>
            <li> Maybe it takes more practice, but so far I think they make my very straight hair, do insane, untamed, poodle curls.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair though</li>
            <li> how long you leave it in, and change the type of curl by the way your wrap the hair.  </li>
            <li> These I was lookiing for over a long period of time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thick, wavy, long, dyed hair.</li>
            <li> after several tries I gave up and ended up donating to Goodwill.  </li>
            <li> I had a recent wedding where the stylist actually came to the hotel room and all she brought was a can of rave, some bobby pins and other small things and a whole mess of these curlers.</li>
            <li> only complaint is the set is a little small, I often have to use both my old and new sets together in order to have enough curlers.</li>
            <li> Once they heat up I just take small sections of hair and roll it up as far as I want them to go.</li>
            <li> There are warning about burning your self which were scary, but in fact the heated part of the curler is in the very middle, and it&#x27;s not that hot.  </li>
            <li> I usually wear my hair in an up-do, and I simply use six of the larger rollers, and I roll it up about chin length.  </li>
            <li> The tight curl doesn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> If I were really smart, I would ask the manufacturer to make a video of me and my scrappy thin hair turned into a voluminous do.</li>
            <li> They heat up fast and have always given my very, very thick hair lots of curl and bounce.</li>
            <li> I have had straight thin hair all of my 71 years.  </li>
            <li> &quot; thing makes curls (and volume)in a few minutes that last all day.</li>
            <li> and they are heavy enough that they droop and pull out of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Then I just take my hands an run them through my hair to fluff and its all done.</li>
            <li> Nothing like I expected.</li>
            <li> My thin straight hair found some life...</li>
            <li> It really is not practical to wear gloves to use them.</li>
            <li> Just be careful.</li>
            <li> dont waste your money on curling irons or other curling products just buy this one and its probally going to be the last one you&#x27;ll ever have to buy!!!</li>
            <li> The surface of the roller is sticky/grippy, and because my hair is so long, it can create a tangled mess and sometimes pulls out my hair when removing the roller.</li>
            <li> I Had difficult time rolling hair because of how hot  they got</li>
            <li> Stop looking for any other curler b/c</li>
            <li> I was losing hair due to heat damage.</li>
            <li> They make any style work from big curls to small curls.</li>
            <li> and I have found curling my hair pretty difficult.  </li>
            <li> You will usually get a spiral like curl without further fixing.</li>
            <li> I have tried these three times so far, and every time I feel like they are a total fail</li>
            <li> They can make a tight curl if you roll your hair tightly around it, or softer curls if you loosely roll it around the rollers.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, thick and wavy.  </li>
            <li> Must have long, thick hair for the curlers to hold well.  </li>
            <li> I would have to say that they do curl well if you want a tight curl look.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Can produce a tight and curly look.</li>
            <li> sometimes the curl turns out a too tight for my liking</li>
            <li> They are flexible so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it pulling your scalp too tight and giving you a headache along the way.</li>
            <li> The sticks were hard to put in and even harder to take out.  </li>
            <li> When they did work the curls were too unruly and messy anyway.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them in a few years now</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> At this point, seems like a wasted purchase</li>
            <li> The ends get hot when you&#x27;re wrapping, but I started using it when I was 12 with waist-length hair, so it can&#x27;t be that bad.</li>
            <li> These curlers make very tight, springy curls.  </li>
            <li> My hair was bushy in some spots and kinky looking in other areas so it was not a good look for me.  </li>
            <li> They do work on natural Afro type hair as well; but again I&#x27;d be afraid of heat damage.</li>
            <li> I try to leave mine in for at least 20 minutes, but usually aim for 30.</li>
            <li> These are hard for me to use</li>
            <li> She leaves them in for about an hour because her hair is VERY thick and heavy.  </li>
            <li> They work so well with my daughter&#x27;s thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> I have thin hair, and these even gave my hair a body-filled look.  </li>
            <li> The process, however, is really difficult.  </li>
            <li> These are difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> Well the box was filthy &amp; there were a few hairs on some of the rollers, so I almost returned them.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> very difficult to use .I</li>
            <li> the curlers were impossible to get your hair around.</li>
            <li> She swears by these bad boys and refuses to use anything else.</li>
            <li> I have used and been disappointed by every curling device there ever was.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> When the sticks come out, the quality of the curl is bad!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with these hotsticks.  </li>
            <li> or you&#x27;ll end up with some nasty fishhooks....</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Rollers got real hot and burned the fingers. I Had difficult time rolling hair because of how hot  they got</li>
            <li> They work great and heat up pretty quick! I have long hair though so I should have gotten 2 of them so my hair could be super curly!</li>
            <li> If you have fine baby hair to thick straight hair and want to add body and curl to your hair this is the perfect set and it can stand the test of time I have had my for aleast twenty years and it still works just as well as day 1! Love it Love it nothing else compares so dont waste your money on curling irons or other curling products just buy this one and its probally going to be the last one you&#x27;ll ever have to buy!!!</li>
            <li> I bought these after reading the reviews and was hoping for something easy I could throw in my hair in the morning and go. Unfortunately I was disappointed. They kept falling out of my hair and yanking out strands. They certainly aren&#x27;t good for layered hair of any kind, unless your hair is extremely long! When they did work the curls were too unruly and messy anyway. I don&#x27;t have the time to perfect the use of hair rollers, I just wanted them to work. If your looking for something fun, fast and easy, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Got this to use on my daughters&#x27; hair, ages 5 and 9.  My five year old loved how curly her pony tails got.  These curlers make very tight, springy curls.  The curlers are not so hot that they would pose a burning risk my daughter, but are hot enough to make curls without applying hair products first.  Doesn&#x27;t take up much space either.  Would recommend to others!</li>
            <li> These work pretty well. The curls are pretty tight but that can be a good thing if curls tend to fall out in your hair after a few hours. I do burn my fingers putting them on and if my hair was any thicker I would need two sets because I barely have enough to put all over my head as it is.  They do heat up pretty quick and they stay in pretty well.</li>
            <li> I had a friend in high school who had these and they were awesome! I was so excited to find them on Amazon, and so I ordered two sets. I love my Hot Sticks...They work so well with my daughter&#x27;s thick hair. I think anyone who buys them will love them too. They are so easy to use. Sometimes the sticks fall out of their holes but they&#x27;re super easy to fix back up again. A BIG YES to this item for sure :)</li>
            <li> I received these curlers as a gift 2 Christmas&#x27; ago.  I would have to say that they do curl well if you want a tight curl look.  The process, however, is really difficult.  Getting the hair onto the roller is tricky and I&#x27;ve burned my fingers many times.  The problem is in the design.  You cannot roll your hair effectively without burning your fingers.  I would use them so much more often if I didn&#x27;t dread it.  I have gone back to my old rollers just for ease of operation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different roller sets until I found this set. This set is easy to use, no pins needed, and your hair is curly in just a few minutes.  And the curl stays in all day.  It does produce a tighter curl with the thinner sticks, so I got two sets, which you will need anyway if you have long hair, to distribute the sticks and produce a more natural look.  The middle of the stick gets hot, so handle them by holding the ends.  I have thin hair, and these even gave my hair a body-filled look.  Best investment I ever made.</li>
            <li> These are very handy, and much easier to use than the older version. I have an older set, and they tended to get too hot and burn my scalp, these do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the set is a little small, I often have to use both my old and new sets together in order to have enough curlers.</li>
            <li> Have had my set of hot sticks for at least 20 years.  Was looking to replace with something more modern, perhaps bigger rollers. My original unit had 20 sticks...see that this model has 14.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to search to see if hot sticks were still around and I agree with the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size of this set should be fine for most hair, but as one reviewer said, you can take out some earlier, put them back into their space and reheat a bit and use somewhere else on your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can produce a tight and curly look.</li>
            <li> These make you look like a poodle.</li>
            <li> My wife had been using this type of hairsetter for many years and the one she had finally wore out. She looked in many stores and could not find anything that remotely resembled what she wanted. I told her that I believed if it could be found anywhere it could be found at Amazon.com. I ordered it and she could not be more pleased! This is better than any she has ever had! It heats very quickly and is easy to use. The price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I first used a friends hot sticks about 10 years ago.  I loved them then . . . and I still love them.  I can do my hair many different ways with hot sticks, and it only takes a few minutes to set.  Very good for updo&#x27;s and sexy lock.  They heat extremely fast, and get very hot . . . the only thing is there aren&#x27;t enough in one set, so I got 2 sets . . . now I can set both my girls hair at the same time.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have thick hair so I bought 2 sets. I get really bouncy curls that hold all day. I love them.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair. The only way to give it any body is to blow dry it with lots of gel. When I don&#x27;t feel like blow drying my hair, I just let it air dry and then put these hot sticks in for just a minute or so. My hair comes very curly with lots of body. They are the perfect solution for me.</li>
            <li> Picked up a set of these for $15 at Wal-Mart. The finished product looks great, but the sticks kept slipping out after they were placed, which was extremely frustrating. I&#x27;ll probably just stick to my regular hot rollers.</li>
            <li> This product is totally easy to use and makes the best possible curls. They are much better that those I get from a curling iron. They also last more than 2 days. The tight curl doesn&#x27;t last but you get curl anyway the next two days.    I get many compliments on my hairstyle after using this product. People ask me if I did my hair myself!</li>
            <li> I have had straight thin hair all of my 71 years.  For some many of my later years I went to the beauty parlor for a perm to give me kinky hair for some volume.  I have used and been disappointed by every curling device there ever was.  This \\&quot;Hot Sticks\\&quot; thing makes curls (and volume)in a few minutes that last all day. There are warning about burning your self which were scary, but in fact the heated part of the curler is in the very middle, and it&#x27;s not that hot.  The advertisements say that it is good for long hair, but it is easy to use on the 1 1/2\\&quot; bottom-ends of my less-than-shoulder length hair. If I were really smart, I would ask the manufacturer to make a video of me and my scrappy thin hair turned into a voluminous do.</li>
            <li> I needed a compact set of rollers and these definitely fit the bill. They rolled up in my hair beautifully; my hair is shoulder length. They are easy to use and left my hair with a nice bounce.</li>
            <li> great for use with on girls with long hair, makes beautiful spiral curls.  my daughter&#x27;s curls were perfect for her pageant and we look forward to using them for her dance competition.</li>
            <li> I have had Hot Sticks for over 20 years, and it still works.  It was great when I had long hair, and still when it&#x27;s shorter (shoulder length).  You can change the size of curl by the amount of hair you use on each one and how long you leave it in, and change the type of curl by the way your wrap the hair.  The ends get hot when you&#x27;re wrapping, but I started using it when I was 12 with waist-length hair, so it can&#x27;t be that bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to curl my hair and these work better than anything else! They&#x27;re easy to use, quick, and give me the Marilyn Monroe waves I was dying for. The style holds for hours and my hair still feels healthy after I use them. Like others have mentioned, the only downside is that they do take a bit to heat up.</li>
            <li> VERY EAST TO USE AND WORKS VERY WELL. IT JUST TAKES SOME TIME AND PRACTICE TO GET IT PERFECT.</li>
            <li> I do hair for film and television (mostly Westerns) and I just can&#x27;t function without these sticks! I have multiple sets of these and use them constantly. They heat up very quickly and set even quicker. By the time you&#x27;ve wrapped the whole head of hair, the side you started on is set and ready to unwrap already! The most speedy &amp; efficient tool I have to assist with complicated updos. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about these!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try these, but when I plugged the unit in, nothing happened. I tried a different outlet, I waited HOURS for this thing to heat up, I read the instructions over and over to make sure I wasn&#x27;t doing anything wrong, but still, no heat at all. I guess I got a dud, but even if it had worked, the product felt really cheap; these are definitely not built to last. I&#x27;m just glad I found out right away while I still had a chance to return them. As always, Amazon.com customer service is great - but these curlers are anything but.</li>
            <li> Wow! I&#x27;m a wedding photographer and have been to many &#x27;getting ready&#x27; sessions. I had a recent wedding where the stylist actually came to the hotel room and all she brought was a can of rave, some bobby pins and other small things and a whole mess of these curlers. Wow! I have never seen curls as tight, or that lasted as long and perfect on a bride before. I think I&#x27;ll get these for myself and my young neice. The brides hair &#x27;never holds curl&#x27; and she looked fabulous all day long.</li>
            <li> These sticks work really well in creating great curls. They are much faster to use than a curling iron and you can leave them in as long as you need to so that you can ensure curls that hang around all night or day. My daughter has stick straight hair and using the curling iron only created loose curls that quickly fell out. Using these sticks I can get her hair really curly and the curls last so much longer. Her only complaint about them is that they sometimes hurt when you remove them, but you can minimize that by simply being extra gentle.</li>
            <li> These are easy to use, but I would recommend for medium to longer hair. I think my hair is just too short and they are heavy enough that they droop and pull out of my hair.  Otherwise, I think they would be great.</li>
            <li> I have hair down to my waist and it is 100% straight. The conair hot sticks is the only hair curlers that have ever attempted to even curl my hair. They work great!!! Once they heat up I just take small sections of hair and roll it up as far as I want them to go. Then I leave them in for about 20 to 25 minutes, because I like it curly. Then I just take my hands an run them through my hair to fluff and its all done. It&#x27;s that simple. I would recommend these to anyone and everyone. they are awesome.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using the same 2 sets for 12 to 15 years now and i would never buy anything else. they heat up fast, they curl fast, and most importantly for me, they KEEP the curl. I&#x27;ve always had very fine, long (middle of back) hair and these are the only curlers that work for me. sometimes the curl turns out a too tight for my liking so i just tossle it a bit with my hands to \\&quot;shake it out\\&quot; and then spray it with hairspray..and even when i don&#x27;t the curl still (amazingly) holds for a pretty long time.     cons- i use two containers, even with my fine hair, and so after having both sets in you&#x27;re hair, theyre rather heavy,being rubber and all. they get so hot they sometimes burn my scalp or the back of my ears. and lastly, as i said, sometimes the curls are just too tight    pros- heat fast. product and results last long. easy to use. if you run out of hot sticks mid-curling you can take some \\&quot;done\\&quot; ones out of your hair and they&#x27;ll be heated back up in less then 3 minutes. LOVE these    tip; to set curls (with any heated product) for an even longer amount of time, blowdry hair while curlers are still in on a cool setting. the heat of the product conforms it to take shape and the cool blast shocks the hairs to keep it that way</li>
            <li> The Conair HS18W hot sticks are just hollow rubber with coiled wires and lose their heat too quickly to make curls.  And the rubber pulls out your hair when you unroll the sticks. I went online to order the Conair Ceramic Jelly Roller sticks from Target, and these work great! They stay hot and slides away from your hair when you remove them.  I should have returned the first set, it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I love these things.&lt;br /&gt;The power of these flimsy sticks is very underestimated.&lt;br /&gt;I wont say that they heat up quickly, easy to put in and secure,and quick setting.&lt;br /&gt;The longer you keep them in, the stronger the curl. They are comfortable to sleep in. Leave in overnight at your own risk you will wake up with the tightest curls and will be sporting them for days. I went as long as 4 days without the curls falling straight, nor did i have to use rollers on subsequent nights)&lt;br /&gt;I just wish conair sold this as a bigger and more put together package. The units are as slim as they can be, but the top covers arent secure and seem to fall off anychance they get (quite noisy and annoying once they hit the floor.&lt;br /&gt;Depending on the thickness of your hair, you may want to buy two units. One unit does nothing for my entire head.&lt;br /&gt;Im contemplating buying a 3rd or maybe buying extra replacement sticks if possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;btw shoppers, i would definatly price hunt on this item, $34 i way too steep. I paid $12-14 dollars for this exact product about 6-8 months ago</li>
            <li> Great long lasting product! Years of use &amp; one of Conair&#x27;s best products! The last one we had lasted 39 years.</li>
            <li> They work amazing, i have super straight hair and these now make my hair have nice lasting curls, perfect heat and easy to put on!</li>
            <li> I purchased these rollers because of the amazing reviews it has.  I think they are very good: they heat fast, the rollers are pretty cool looking, they are not too bulky, etc.  But, I think they are not too easy to put on.  It is kind of tricky, and if they are not put on correctly, your ends will look funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it take practice...  I have used them on myself and my daughter, and have not found the trick yet on how to effectively put them on (especially for layared hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product, but takes practice...</li>
            <li> I gave my grandmother a set of these almost 6 years ago. She loves it and when I went to buy her a new set I couldn&#x27;t find them in the stores. Thankfully I found them here!! She swears by these bad boys and refuses to use anything else. It came right on time and was in perfect condition when she opened the package. We will order from here again!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and the curl does not last long but with this product it is like I just had a perm  Everyone was so nice and I had no problems getting my product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Hot Sticks on and off for over 20 years. I wasn&#x27;t even aware they still existed until I found them on Amazon; I&#x27;ve had a beat-up set from my childhood for a long time. They heat up fast and have always given my very, very thick hair lots of curl and bounce. There is a trick to using them, though, for people who complain about the rubber material pulling on their hair and ripping it out: when you&#x27;re removing the curlers, unhook the end, hold your hair by the root and let the curler just fall out of your hair. Don&#x27;t try to uncurl it yourself or pull your hair off of the curler. I haven&#x27;t used them in a few years now but when I used them often this was the trick that worked. You can&#x27;t force your hair off of the curler or it will yank out some strands.</li>
            <li> I purchased these from Walmart for about $15. These are the best things I have found for curling my hair. My hair rolls up easily and stays curly all day. I have what would be considered short hair(above shoulder, mid neck) and I roll these up in the morning, taking about ten minutes and I am good to go all day. Please Conair don&#x27;t quit making this. With practice, these are easy to use and remarkable in keeping a curl all day with no more product than hairspray after styling.</li>
            <li> i had these years ago, and they created a spiral curl that was fab! Now, years later, I ended up getting my refund when I purchased a new set. the new set barely gives my hair a wave. i was severely saddened by this change in the product. These aren&#x27;t worth your time if you have curl resistant hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a new product.  No one in their right mind would buy something for their hair that was used.  That being said, this didnt come in a box no paperwork or warranty.  I paid like $9.00 for shipping and they rolled it up in bubble wrap and sent it to me.  The price on the shipping lable said something like $4.00.  Now I ask you how cheep can you get????  LOL</li>
            <li> I had one of these hair setters previously but it was worn out from so much use. It was over 10 years old and I loved using it. Just out of curiosity I decided to see if I could find a replacement and to my surprise, found it on Amazon. I was over joyed and bought one right away. I love it and now don&#x27;t have to worry about using my old one anymore. Yay for Amazon! I guess you can find just about anything on Amazon. Love it.</li>
            <li> Not enough roller to do what I wanted to do. Did not care for the shape of them as well. Nothing like I expected.</li>
            <li> The hot sticks heat up fast but they are pretty difficult to use and pop off sometimes. They also tend to create frizzy hair. I will still use them sometimes, but only when I have extra time to shape my hair after.</li>
            <li> These do not work well for me!  What a waste of money.  It is hard to keep them shut, much better just to use the old fashioned curlers.  If it&#x27;s not broke, why fix the good old style curlers.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t hold to well with my hair and got tangled. I have them to my mom and they work better for her hair type.</li>
            <li> Within only a few minutes my six year old daughter&#x27;s straight hair was beautifully curly. Easy to use, with parent supervision of course. Don&#x27;t like the clear plastic top though as it doesn&#x27;t snap on but just rests in place. Any kind of movement will dislodge it.</li>
            <li> Sometimes they get tangled in my hair because my hair is so long however they do a great job to curl.</li>
            <li> My thin straight hair found some life...only thing is sometimes I cannot get them to &amp;#34;stay put&amp;#34; close to the scalp.  Espacially beneficial when using leave-in Keratin with the heated product!</li>
            <li> I got this product for my birthday, it looked like something that popped out of the 80&#x27;s. It takes some practice, but even when I mess up putting them in I still get great looking little spiral curls and they last so long! This is my new favorite thing for my hair! Only con is I wish it came with more then just 14 rollers, I have to buy a whole other kit to get enough for my hair. Stop looking for any other curler b/c this is all you need right here! :-)</li>
            <li> Nice way to get lots of curls</li>
            <li> i had been looking everywhere around town for these hot sticks (had even young people look at me and say they do not make those anymore)  Well found them on amazon.com and they are exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and curls fine hair that won&#x27;t usually hold a curl.  My 10 year old loves it!</li>
            <li> These are difficult to use.  I haven&#x27;t been able to use them yet because I get frustrated with them and just pull out the one or two that I have been able to get in.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and does not hold a curl for very long--the hot sticks give a curl that actually lasts ALL day long with almost no styling products.  There is a learning curve to use them, so you might want to practice with it a few times to get a better feel for the best setting pattern for you.  Don&#x27;t panic if you get some frizzing after you start brushing out the curls.  Just take sections of hair and brush it against your hand; the frizz will go away and you&#x27;ll end up with a great set that really holds up to heat and humidity.  Priced reasonably too...</li>
            <li> I used these 20 years ago. They gave me gorgeous curls quickly every mornging. However, over time my thick gorgeous curls became thinner and thinner....I was losing hair due to heat damage. In all fairness, my hair was relaxed, and daily use might have just been overdoing it. They do work on natural Afro type hair as well; but again I&#x27;d be afraid of heat damage. PROCEED WITH CAUTION!</li>
            <li> I love these hot sticks! If you like different hairstyles then you will love the new look you can achieve with these sticks!</li>
            <li> I have used these Hot Sticks for over thirty years.  Great product</li>
            <li> I have had my HOT STICKS* for 12 years and I use them several times a week. I admit I sometimes leave them plugged in but they have been durable and perfect. They make any style work from big curls to small curls. I coach cheerleading and every year I use them to set my girls hair and they are blown away by how comfortable they are, how quick the curls set, and how well it works with every hair type. The heathing unit in mine just burnt out so I am buying a new set but after 12 years I am more than okay with that. YAY!!!</li>
            <li> It was a great last minute xmas gift that fit my budget and made shopping easy. My mom loved it!</li>
            <li> I have very coarse hair but do not like a lot of heat on my head but these things heat up fast and actually leave a curl patter I wish they had some bigger sizes as well. But I liked them so much I bought two sets....I pulled these out yesterday had not used them in a minute because of how I have been wearing my hair they still work they have been working for about 10 years now with no problems.</li>
            <li> I love the Hot Sticks, they create the perfect curls, in a short period of time, the curls last (always use a finishing spray!) and look great. I bought this set so I can curl my hair to make  vintage inspired curls, and succeeded!&lt;br /&gt;I think this set is ideal for someone with hair that is at least shoulder length, because I got my hair cut in an angled bob (above shoulder length), and have since been unable to use these (the hair slips out, because too short). I am growing my hair out, and looking forward to using these again, soon!</li>
            <li> I bought these curlers AFTER I purchased the Conair jelly rollers, simply because I wanted to see how they worked. MY hair changed after I had a baby and I have found curling my hair pretty difficult.  These rollers are probably great for fine/easy to curl hair, but the curl didn&#x27;t stay for me.  (I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the jelly rollers, which are a little harder to roll, but they are made from solid rubber and I think lose their heat much slower, therefore setting the curl a little better. I don&#x27;t even need hairspray!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These rods are hallow metal springs wrapped in a rubber coating.  They cool off pretty quickly and don&#x27;t work for my super stubborn hair.  (If your hair curls easily these would be great)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrapping your hair from the top of your head down will create a cute wavy look to your hair (you will need clips to hold the reverse roll) or if you roll it bottom to top you get the traditional curl.</li>
            <li> These scream 80&#x27;s but they actually work very nicely and fast!! I will never go back to another kind again.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work great on my hair but my daughter loves them</li>
            <li> These I was lookiing for over a long period of time. They take a few minutes to heat to full temperature but work just great!! Love them!</li>
            <li> I like this set for the sheer fact that I can have curls and not have to sleep in rollers to get the same effect.</li>
            <li> I love these. By far, the most lasting curls! My hair is fine, straight, and waist-length. I use these with a styling product, like a cream gel, so there&#x27;s no crunchiness. The surface of the roller is sticky/grippy, and because my hair is so long, it can create a tangled mess and sometimes pulls out my hair when removing the roller. So, I just wrap the rollers in square pieces of foil as I go along and this helps a lot. No biggie! Again, these work great and the curls are smaller (but way longer lasting) than your typical hot roller styles. Also, the longer you leave them in, the better. I try to leave mine in for at least 20 minutes, but usually aim for 30.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these rollers for years. They can make a tight curl if you roll your hair tightly around it, or softer curls if you loosely roll it around the rollers. They are flexible so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it pulling your scalp too tight and giving you a headache along the way. You can lay your head back on a pillow and they won&#x27;t hurt your head or screw up the curl. These rollers are easy to clean if you put hairspray or mouse in your hair (before rolling it or during or after) after use. I don&#x27;t think you can get burned by these rollers unless you really try. Most people would release these rollers after a few seconds, but for those who have a more difficult time with motor skills, even if you held them for more than 10 seconds, the burn would not be severe -- if at all. I would trust a preteen child with these. Great for long or short hair. You will usually get a spiral like curl without further fixing. Best curls will result if you allow the rollers to cool thoroughly.</li>
            <li> My wife did not like it at all and we we missed the return day and now we have to send it to Housing Works</li>
            <li> The Conair Hot Sticks are great. I have long hair and these hot sticks not only curled my hair but the curl stay in all day! No other curling device can do that.</li>
            <li> No matter how perfectly I wrap and unwrap my hair the curls are always sloppy and frizzy. Easy enough but the good &#x27;ol flat iron may be the way to go</li>
            <li> If you have straight hair, do NOT buy this set of curlers.  The curlers do NOT &amp;#34;hold on to hair,&amp;#34; so even the smallest amount of hair refuses to go around these tiny curlers.  If someone has curly hair or wavy hair, however, it might work.  But, watch out for lots of burned fingers, and the curlers also pop forward.  I am returning this immediately.</li>
            <li> Hot Sticks did not work for me.  My hair is long, thick and wavy.  The sticks were hard to put in and even harder to take out.  When I was taking them out it felt like I was pulling some hair out along with the stick.  My hair was bushy in some spots and kinky looking in other areas so it was not a good look for me.  This set is going to the thrift store tomorrow.</li>
            <li> This item is double the price in Australia to what I paid on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Item as described and works beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging and postage was well done and within the specified time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NB... to all residents outside the USA, considering purchasing this item, you may need to purchase an adapter for the plug. They are also a 110 volt system, so check the voltage requirements in your country. In Australia, we have 240 volt electricity, so I have purchased an adapter, but they work just fine.</li>
            <li> These curling rods are so fast and easy compared to a curling iron. You can achieve beautiful multiple&lt;br /&gt; curls at one time!</li>
            <li> I bought these for a Christmas gift.  The description said this was a new item with a slightly damaged box.  Well the box was filthy &amp; there were a few hairs on some of the rollers, so I almost returned them.  I removed the hairs from the rollers &amp; got a wet cloth &amp; cleaned up the box (which I think the seller should have done) &amp; the my daughter-in-law loved them.</li>
            <li> They just don&#x27;t seem to get very hot!...but, it is better than burning our fingers for beauty. Does produce a nice curl if you  leave them in for a very long time...careful, be sure to get the edges of your hair curled in or you&#x27;ll end up with some nasty fishhooks....(Fishhooks are when the hair gets straight in the bottom and everything else is curly).</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with these hotsticks.  Upon unrolling my hair, every hotstick pulled my hair out.  You need about three sets of these to be able to do your hair or you will be at this for a long time to get your hair curled.</li>
            <li> The curls don&#x27;t turn out correctly as the directions would have you believe. Perhaps that&#x27;s why its no longer sold in stores.</li>
            <li> These are great and give great curl. The only problem is you need two sets of these to cover your whole head.</li>
            <li> Nice set, but burns your fingers.</li>
            <li> These are hard for me to use but I do think maybe my hair is \\&quot;not quite\\&quot; long enough and that might be part of the problem.  I will try them again in about a month and hopefully that will do the trick but right now, I am not convinced that this was a good purchase for me.</li>
            <li> the curlers don&#x27;t consistently stay in your hair &amp; they can be very hot to handle - they do heat up very quickly</li>
            <li> These hot sticks are exactly what they are called &amp;#34;Hot Sticks&amp;#34;.  Almost too hot to hold in your hands when trying to wrap your hair.  Must have long, thick hair for the curlers to hold well.  When the sticks come out, the quality of the curl is bad!</li>
            <li> Needed these for extra so I got them and very happy I did especially in purple my fav color yeah</li>
            <li> These work really well and hold the curls for a very long time with no hairspray needed! I love them for my cheer curls but they&#x27;re a little to tight to work well for daily curls. I wish they came in one size larger!&lt;br /&gt;The soft grip doesn&#x27;t pull and they don&#x27;t fry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thick, wavy, long, dyed hair. Works very well. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> These are very cool (hot actually) but they wrap easy and make lots of curls.  Love the product and the outcome.  Shipping was quick too</li>
            <li> I received these yesterday and decided to try them out on my daughter.  She has long very straight fine hair. Often when I curl her hair using a curling iron, it is back to straight within 30 minutes.  I did a web search for the product and found 2 sisters who did a video showing how to create spiral curls with this product.  The girl also had fine straight hair.  After watching the video, I was able to replicate these pretty curls on the first try.  Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I had these a long time ago and my hair always looked great until they burned out.  I thought I would never find these in a zillion years and I decided to look for them.  OMG, my hair curled and the curl lasted. I use curl papers to help my hair grab on and I don&#x27;t get fried ends. my hair curled up like I got a perm and I comb or brush out depending on my mood.  I haven&#x27;t been this happy with curlers in a long time!  Thank you Conair.  As for the shipper, I got them right away. AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li> very difficult to use .I sent it back.because the curlers were impossible to get your hair around. I  think thicker curlers would work better.</li>
            <li> I have tried these three times so far, and every time I feel like they are a total fail and I fix my hair with a different tool or have to completely soak my hair with water.  Maybe it takes more practice, but so far I think they make my very straight hair, do insane, untamed, poodle curls.  I can appreciate the fact that it actually curls my straight hair, but I don&#x27;t want unruly curls, I wanted them to add wave/soft spirals.  I&#x27;ll keep trying, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.  I would say if you are looking for what I wanted, and have straight hair, get a Bed Head curling rod... way better results.</li>
            <li> I do love these curlers but have to be honest...they are really way too hot to handle once they are ready and I have been burned so many times I cannot count. It really is not practical to wear gloves to use them. I have looked for YouTube videos and have watched them on how others do it but no one has any tricks. Just be careful. The middle of the curler is where the heat is and you simply cannot avoid that area and install them properly in your hair.</li>
            <li> I have had a set of these for probobly 15 years, and mine still work great too! Love the flexability of being able to have soft waves or tight curls, depending on how I roll it.  BUT, this item is WAY too high here, since Walmart has them for $12.  Since I have waist length hair now, I need a few more sets. I can buy THREE more sets at Walmart and it would still be cheaper than buying one set here!  Oh, and BTW, they have them online at Walmart too!</li>
            <li> I have been using hot sticks now for about 25 years.  My hair is baby fine, and it is a bit longer than halfway down my back.  I usually wear my hair in an up-do, and I simply use six of the larger rollers, and I roll it up about chin length.  If you use too many, you will have frizz, frizz, frizz!  When I remove the rollers, I never brush or comb through my hair. I simply rake through it with my fingers.  Helps to reduce any frizz and tangles.  If my set of hot sticks wears out, I will definitely be trying to find more right away.  They absolutely create curls that will last all day long....and even to the next day.  My oldest daughter has hair down to mid-thigh length, and she uses hot sticks to curl her hair.  She leaves them in for about an hour because her hair is VERY thick and heavy.  The curls last longer the longer you leave them in. A definite must-have if you have long hair.  And, as another reviewer said, it may take some practice time to be able to create a style you like.  When I first used them years ago, I wasn&#x27;t so pleased with the results, but trying using fewer rollers was my answer.</li>
            <li> Bought it hoping to make nice spiral curls.  Doesn&#x27;t really trun out like I had envisioned.  Curls seem more of a tangled mess to me.  Perhaps I need to practice with it more.  At this point, seems like a wasted purchase but I&#x27;ll try to work with it some more and see if I can get it worked out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update- after several tries I gave up and ended up donating to Goodwill.  Just didn&#x27;t like the outcome.  The ends of your hair don&#x27;t curl smoothly so looks messy to me.  Disappointed.</li>
