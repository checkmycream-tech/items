            <li>I have had a mag.mirror that was fine for years, but my eyes aren&#x27;t what they used to be, this magnification is perfect to apply makeup</li>
            <li>I needed a desktop swivel mirror with good magnifying power.</li>
            <li>I was looking a good while at all of the vanity mirrors here on Amazon &amp; their reviews.</li>
            <li>So I decided against getting one with a light inside &amp; I also do not think a cord hanging out is very attractive.</li>
            <li>Good buy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>

            <li>Love the 8x magnification.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a mirror - you should be able to get a pretty good one for under $40</li>
            <li>Perfect for these semi-old eyes, and the mirror looks good too and has enough weight to be steady.</li>
            <li>I love the matte metallic finish that does not stain easily of finger prints.</li>
            <li>I am extremely nearsighted and I am thrilled!!!</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t slide or tip over easily.</li>
            <li>Cleans up perfect from fingerprints with a little dish washing liquid and a rinse.</li>
            <li>should also mention that I have ample light at my desk, so I did not want nor did I need a lighted mirror.</li>

            <li>A lot of the vanity mirrors with the lights in them had reviews regarding problems with the light.</li>
            <li>Works great with magnifying side and regular mirror side.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s shipping box were lined with bubble buffers to snugly hold the merchant&#x27;s original package inside; both packaging designs hold the mirror securely in its place during transit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted one that would fit nicely on my desk, be sturdy,  not be easy to tip over, &amp; one that would be at eye level especially using the magnification side to put in my earrings easily.</li>
            <li>I loved how large the mirror was but the 10x was just too much.</li>
            <li>This mirror is so great that I&#x27;ve bought a few more as gifts .</li>
            <li>(unlike those in the department store) I love the fact that the Zadro is a large 7\\&quot; diameter mirror.</li>

            <li>This is a good combo for me:  a good sized mirror with one side normal and the other 8x.  </li>
            <li>I did get a second identical mirror and it is perfect in every way, displaying the fine build quality &amp; overall sturdiness that makes these mirrors so</li>

            <li>13.5\\&quot; high (which is perfectly at eye level for me sitting at my desk).&lt;br /&gt;The entire mirror excudes quality, from the smooth swiveling mirror to the fine optics, as the 8x side (like the 1x side) is completely clear &amp; distortion free.</li>

            <li>High quality glass mirror – excellent weight in the base – beautiful finish!</li>
            <li>Excellent product, looks and feels more expensive that it cost.</li>
            <li>was quick.</li>
            <li>It is very well-made and has an attractive brushed silver finish; the bottom is weighted and is covered with a rubber-like material</li>
            <li>I have had it for a year and love it as much as when I first received it.  </li>

            <li>The 8x is distorted of course unless you are up close, but I think it is just right as well.</li>
            <li>8x magnification, exactly what I use in my bathroom</li>
            <li>8x magnification, exactly what I use in my bathroom</li>
            <li>Not too light &amp; not heavy.</li>
            <li>The first time I looked into it, I could have passed for an HD mirror.  </li>
            <li>Not real heavy to hold which is important to me.</li>
            <li>8x magnification is pretty intense though.</li>
            <li>No regrets that is doesn&#x27;t have a light.</li>
            <li>The bathroom fixtures shop nearby my flat had one with 3X magnifying power and cost about the same as the one in Taipei; I didn&#x27;t settle for it.&lt;br /&gt;I am delighted with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I tend to think this is an exception &amp; not the rule in a mirror of such fine quality.</li>

            <li>Very good quality, sturdy built and looks expensive.</li>
            <li>very durable and well made.  </li>
            <li>Some were plastic, some were metal, none seem to be made very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since I have six piercings in each ear a mirror with 8x magnification makes the job much easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The mirror arrived today and much to my delight when I opened the box</li>

            <li>high recommend this mirror, even if you don&#x27;t have six piercings in each ear.</li>
            <li>(Not so thrilled with seeing the wrinkles) and the other side for checking the overall look.</li>
            <li>Only useful for tweezing or obsessing about every pore.</li>
            <li>looked at some at discount &amp; department stores, and was surprised to find out that a major retailer had no stand mirrors higher than 3x magnification.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Functional and clear view on both sides.</li>
            <li>In most of the mirrors I have purchased in the past, the magnifying side has been too weak (3x or 5x) or too strong (10x and up).  </li>

            <li> very durable and well made.  got what i expected.</li>
            <li> I loved how large the mirror was but the 10x was just too much. Wish Zadro made one this size in a 3x-8x.</li>
            <li> Great product. Nice and solid, stable. 8x magnification is pretty intense though. Only useful for tweezing or obsessing about every pore.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, looks and feels more expensive that it cost. Highly recommend this vanity mirror to anyone looking for one.</li>
            <li> Great mirror for a great price! I use mine every day. Love the magnification on it too.... Recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great Mirror, great price. I have had a mag.mirror that was fine for years, but my eyes aren&#x27;t what they used to be, this magnification is perfect to apply makeup/do brows without glasses on.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B004J0YHVA Zadro VAN48 Two-Sided Vanity Swivel Mirror, Satin Nickel, 1X and 8X]]&lt;br /&gt;I began shopping for a two-sided vanity mirror a few weeks ago. I wanted one that would fit nicely on my desk, be sturdy,  not be easy to tip over, &amp; one that would be at eye level especially using the magnification side to put in my earrings easily. I have an 8x mirror affixed to the mirror on my medicine cabinet in my bathroom for the same purpose, but I am very short of counter space &amp; was growing tired of losing an earring or more likely an earring back down the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at some at discount &amp; department stores, and was surprised to find out that a major retailer had no stand mirrors higher than 3x magnification.&lt;br /&gt;I looked at a major department store and found that they had a few choices either 5x or 7x magnification. Some were plastic, some were metal, none seem to be made very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s when I took to searching on Amazon &amp; I must say I was not surprised in reading reviews that the brand I looked at in the major department store had a few complaints about there quality (or lack thereof) particularly regarding the mirrors coming apart &amp; finding out that they weren&#x27;t screwed together, but glued together, and others saying the base was broken on arrival. In any case I crossed that brand off my list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also mention that I have ample light at my desk, so I did not want nor did I need a lighted mirror. While looking at all of the choices of mirrors, I was surprised that some very very expensive. I have no idea who would spend hundreds of dollars for a vanity mirror, after all it&#x27;s a mirror - you should be able to get a pretty good one for under $40 shouldn&#x27;t you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well the answer is you can &amp; I did, but not for under $40, actually under $30!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started reading reviews on Zadro Vanity mirrors and came away quite impressed with what I read. Then I found the Zadro VAN48 Two-Sided Vanity Swivel Mirror, with a Satin Nickel Finish,  with 1X and 8X magnification. 8x magnification, exactly what I use in my bathroom and at this magnification I am able to insert my earrings without wearing my glasses. Since I have six piercings in each ear a mirror with 8x magnification makes the job much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case I ordered this mirror through Amazon Prime for $27.69 (which included free 2 day shipping). The mirror arrived today and much to my delight when I opened the box I found the mirror came fully assembled! (unlike those in the department store) I love the fact that the Zadro is a large 7\\&quot; diameter mirror. It is very sturdy &amp; hefty. It has a large non-slip base. It looks great in the satin-nickle finish &amp; stands 13.5\\&quot; high (which is perfectly at eye level for me sitting at my desk).&lt;br /&gt;The entire mirror excudes quality, from the smooth swiveling mirror to the fine optics, as the 8x side (like the 1x side) is completely clear &amp; distortion free. One issue that I noticed is that there is a pebble-sized chip in the glass on the 8x magnification side of the mirror. I tend to think this is an exception &amp; not the rule in a mirror of such fine quality. I did get a second identical mirror and it is perfect in every way, displaying the fine build quality &amp; overall sturdiness that makes these mirrors so impressive.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I am happy with my purchase and also happy to see that you can still find quality items at very reasonable prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I high recommend this mirror, even if you don&#x27;t have six piercings in each ear. :o)Satin Nickel Finish,  with 1X and 8X magnification. 8x magnification, exactly what I use in my bathroom and at this magnification I am able to insert my earrings without wearing my glasses.

            <li> Functional and clear view on both sides. Great swivel option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product.  Use to tweeze my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> This is a good combo for me:  a good sized mirror with one side normal and the other 8x.  Perfect for these semi-old eyes, and the mirror looks good too and has enough weight to be steady.</li>
            <li> I needed a desktop swivel mirror with good magnifying power. During my trip to Taipei, I saw one with 5X magnifying power, noted the price and upon return to Singapore, set off to find a similar one. The bathroom fixtures shop nearby my flat had one with 3X magnifying power and cost about the same as the one in Taipei; I didn&#x27;t settle for it.&lt;br /&gt;I am delighted with my purchase. The item arrived on time. Amazon&#x27;s shipping box were lined with bubble buffers to snugly hold the merchant&#x27;s original package inside; both packaging designs hold the mirror securely in its place during transit.&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is very well-made with a clear reflection surface, the heavy base stands squarely on my countertop. I love the matte metallic finish that does not stain easily of finger prints. The 8X magnifying power does the job, in good light, I do my grooming effortlessly in front of this mirror! I&#x27;m happy to have paid this price for this quality.</li>
            <li> It looks great and is very sturdy.  I like the magnified side for applying make-up and tweezing eye brows. (Not so thrilled with seeing the wrinkles) and the other side for checking the overall look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a mirror where I could see without my glasses and this is perfect.  It seems very well made and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am happy with both sides of the mirror.  It is very sturdy!!!!!!!!  I am extremely nearsighted and I am thrilled!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this mirror, I couldn&#x27;t believe what I wasn&#x27;t seeing before.  I feel better knowing my makeup looks good all the time now.</li>
            <li> Great magnification for tweezing eye brows. No regrets that is doesn&#x27;t have a light.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, sturdy built and looks expensive. Mirrors are of a good quality, clear and magnifies perfect! Have always wanted to get one</li>
            <li> IMPERFECTIONS PERSONIFIED. MAYBE A 2X WOULD BE KINDER.</li>
            <li> To much distoration on side</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and beautiful to look at. Perfectly sized and the x8 size is the perfect magnification for tweezing brows or doing eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Nice two sided mirror one side is  regular and one side  mag for applying makeup, distortion free glass, attractive, sturdy  pedestal base.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with my purchase of the Zadro VAN48 two-sided vanity mirror! I was looking a good while at all of the vanity mirrors here on Amazon &amp; their reviews. A lot of the vanity mirrors with the lights in them had reviews regarding problems with the light. So I decided against getting one with a light inside &amp; I also do not think a cord hanging out is very attractive. I love the design! The weight feels just right. Not too light &amp; not heavy. Feels and looks of great quality. The 8x is distorted of course unless you are up close, but I think it is just right as well.</li>
            <li> I use the 1x side for applying most of my makeup, and the 8x for eye makeup and lipstick. In most of the mirrors I have purchased in the past, the magnifying side has been too weak (3x or 5x) or too strong (10x and up).  The 8x works perfectly for me. It is very well-made and has an attractive brushed silver finish; the bottom is weighted and is covered with a rubber-like material so it doesn&#x27;t slide or tip over easily. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The 8x magnifying side is amazing. This mirror is so great that I&#x27;ve bought a few more as gifts .</li>
            <li> I use this mirror every day. I didn&#x27;t realized that at my age 8X could make such a difference in viewing. The first time I looked into it, I could have passed for an HD mirror.  The base is very good with great stability.</li>
            <li> This mirror is perfect. The 8x magnification side works for me when plucking eyebrows as my eyesight isn&#x27;t perfect anymore. It&#x27;s a very attractive mirror and handy for when you need a mirror for hairstyles, curling iron etc. Cleans up perfect from fingerprints with a little dish washing liquid and a rinse. Not real heavy to hold which is important to me.</li>
            <li> My old mirror became loose and rickety long ago.  This is a perfect replacement mirror for me, no lights, which is exactly what I like. Works great with magnifying side and regular mirror side. I use one for makeup and the regular side for back view of my hair each day. Great product, great price.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter says this the best. Good buy</li>
            <li> got it for my sister she loves this mirror,i also have one great price,you can see your face really well without wearing your glasses</li>
            <li> It is not brushed nichel &amp; the mirror magnification is distorted.  I am shipping it back.  Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Great mirror.  Nothing like this in the local stores.  I have had it for a year and love it as much as when I first received it.  Love the 8x magnification.</li>
            <li> High quality glass mirror – excellent weight in the base – beautiful finish!</li>
