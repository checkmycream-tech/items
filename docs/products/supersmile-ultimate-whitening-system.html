            <li>Great products works just like described</li>
            <li>This is a great advancement, and even a dentist cleaning couldn&#x27;t touch this level of whitening.</li>
            <li>My teeth look great, and they feel great.</li>

            <li>I can do the something with peroxide on a cotton swab then use a good whitening toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Good luck,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using the rinse &amp; the whitening system (including the rods) and am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>best, consistent product i have used without damaging enamel.</li>
            <li>I honestly have not seen a difference in the color of my teeth after using this system.</li>
            <li>I am being honest here for those in my position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a great taste &amp; leaves my teeth squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>There is a polished smooth feel on my teeth  and a pleasant minty taste.</li>
            <li>This is a very easy to use &amp; proficient whitening system.  </li>
            <li>No sensitivity,  loving this new smile!!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use it and probably buy some more...</li>
            <li>Maybe one shade better after a month of use ??</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like wasting money or having to order more.</li>
            <li>Do I consider it worthwhile?</li>
            <li>I will order more after I use up the pastes.</li>
            <li>I like that this appears to be a safe whitening process, without the gum pain and irritation that sometimes accompanies the peroxide gels and trays.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just ok for removing stains and whitening.&lt;br /&gt;first</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>So I bought the Supersmile hoping it would make a dent in my dingy teeth made tan by years of drinking tea (herbal and decaffeinated for the most part) on an hourly basis for years.</li>
            <li>I am sure the Zoom treatment would have made my teeth</li>
            <li>I love supersmile.  </li>
            <li>Loved the idea, but I never saw much difference if any.</li>
            <li>It does clean my teeth better</li>
            <li>The price is high,Fairly easy to use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine as toothpaste, but I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable whitening.</li>
            <li>Simple and easy to use, great product.</li>
            <li>Great product simple to use and my teeth look and feel cleaner and whiter.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great system.</li>
            <li>The Original Mint flavor is just fine.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes your teeth feel clean and fresh though.</li>
            <li>I love Supersmile because every time I brush my teeth with Super-smile I get a super super clean and confident mouth and smile.</li>
            <li>your on the fence, or are hoping for someone to give an honest assessment of this product used in real life with real positive results to give you a boost to press the trigger, then don&#x27;t hesitate with Supersmile at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very pleased so far.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t write reviews much anymore except when I feel a product has far surpassed my expectations and has added greatly to my quality of life.</li>
            <li>$15-20 is more reasonable.</li>
            <li>The product has a nice peppermint flavor and seems to be living up to its name so far.</li>
            <li>I bought it and it did not make my teeth any whiter next time I will buy Crest or just try and find a good deal for a dentist that has zoom.</li>
            <li>Great system, easy to use with little time.</li>
            <li>I have been using the system for about two weeks now, and I noticed a huge difference after the first day.</li>
            <li>I am currently still using the product and have been very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>Super Smile did not work for me.  </li>
            <li>This is actually good for people who aren&#x27;t willing to give up their coffee, red wine or</li>
            <li>Super Smile met and exceeded all my expectations. .</li>
            <li>people ALWAYS tell me I have amazing white teeth.  </li>
            <li>Recommend it to anyone that is looking to improve their smile</li>
            <li>Kind of works, but not enough for the cost.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s overpriced for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, I will just conclude by saying that I personally satisfied beyond my wildest dreams, and this product is on a short list of things that I can&#x27;t live without, a true necessity that gives me a great smile and a real daily boost of confidence when dealing with people.</li>
            <li>The product is very easy to use, and only takes a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>I go to the dentist twice a year, and I pretty good teeth except for the extreme sensitivity--and staining of course.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for a whiter, brighter smile!</li>
            <li>I get better and faster results with crest white strips.  </li>
            <li>I could see a difference with the first use, and a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Have seen real results!</li>
            <li>I used 2 accelerating rods, one on the first day and one on the following day, because of the more immediate whitening results.</li>
            <li>It makes sense, no reason not to because of consistent improvement with no downside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I can only imagine that adding that step will make the whitening process that much better.  </li>
            <li>Results are noticable just about from the first use.</li>
            <li>In the past I have always used the whitening strips, which work a little better as far as the whitening factor, but Supersmile is so much more pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Easy enough to use, could see results in whiteness over the course of the order.  </li>
            <li>the results are not dramatic but I can tell the difference.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a whitening but not dramatic</li>
            <li>this product did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a difference, but not as much as I had hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it because I do see my crowns getting whiter.</li>
            <li>I could really see a difference in my bottom teeth.</li>
            <li>Thanks Dr. Smigel</li>
            <li>This product really whitened my teeth 4 shades lighter.  </li>
            <li>I have so much confidence when I speak with people now.</li>
            <li>the toothpaste in the sysytem lasts a REALLY loknd time...about 2 months.</li>
            <li>This whitening system is much easier to maintain than &#x27;strips.&#x27;</li>
            <li>I did buy the dental floss, but have no way of really knowing whether it works better than any other floss.  </li>
            <li>I recieved the package on time so service was good, product is not good..</li>
            <li>The Rembrandt didn&#x27;t do much for me, and my teeth are much too sensitive for any Zoom system (or even Crest strips or take home zoom systems with custom mouth pieces</li>
            <li>I have two full full bridges..one on the top and one on the bottom that I had to get when I was 21 due to juvenile peridontosis.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, I find the cost marginally on the high side.</li>
            <li>I am at a complete loss as to why it worked so well with me, while others seem to not have noticed much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I plan on using this product for a long time, as I feel like a renewed member of the human race with my teeth so clean looking!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t expect drastic change over night, but moderate consistent whiteness over time.</li>
            <li>Big difference after first use.</li>
            <li>I like that my mouth feels clean after using this rather than hurting from all of the flavoring in the other toothpastes.</li>
            <li>my 17 year old son, my 23 year old daughter, and my 80 year old mother.  </li>
            <li>My natural teeth and veneers are uniform in color.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only way I can describe it because it doesn&#x27;t bleach, but it really does whiten and enhance the brightness of your teeth in a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; way.</li>
            <li>The daily product was not irritating at all.  </li>
            <li>Only if the company sees fit to make it less affordable.</li>
            <li>Works very well, doesn&#x27;t take long to notice whiter teeth.</li>
            <li>The reason I only gave it 3 stars is that I did not get anywhere near a 3-7 shade improvement in the whiteness of my natural teeth.  </li>
            <li>you have to use the rods, the design doesn&#x27;t work very well, the gel in the rods is clear and there is much a small amount you can&#x27;t really tell when it it&#x27;s the teeth</li>
            <li>I am content with the results, and I can tell with my interactions with other people who know me and who don&#x27;t that they hold me in higher esteem and no longer &amp;#34;notice&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I definitely notice that my teeth appear to be whiter without having them be sensitive.</li>
            <li>several factors whiter, but I couldn&#x27;t bear the pain if I can barely stand a normal cleaning at the dentist without a double dose of advil!</li>
            <li>I have never seen a whitening system that says it will improve not only the whiteness of natural teeth, but also whiten dental work such as crowns, and/or caps.  </li>
            <li>I approached the Supersmile system pessimistically but with no other choices left.</li>
            <li>Improvement is not dramatic but there is slow and steady whitening.</li>

            <li> Unfortunately even using the whitening rods with the toothpaste and accelerator this time I have not seen much improvement.  </li>
            <li> and I hope this helps you just a little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started to use it when I have the supersmile toothpaste still on my teeth, but it&#x27;s a little messy that way.  </li>
            <li> but my teeth are tough to get white</li>
            <li> A waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I noticed whiter teeth within a few days.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> My dentist says that tooth whiteners do not  work on veneers but this product does whiten my veneers and the teeth behind them when used on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I still have to show her how to use the q-tip thing; I wasted one application figuring it out.</li>
            <li> I have 2 caps on my 2 front teeth that weren&#x27;t badly stained, but using this product I can really tell a difference!</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>

            <li> no matter how slowly you do it.  </li>
            <li> The activator vials are ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> but I was not very impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> I thought after about a week, the changes would be dramatic...</li>
            <li> Sorry I had to give it one star</li>

            <li> this is a complicated system if you use all the products correctly and at then end</li>
            <li> A lot of work for mediocre results and</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it had artificial sweetener added.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing to follow all the steps</li>

            <li> so I was given tetracycline as a child when I was sick</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this product did absolutely nothing.  I get better and faster results with crest white strips.  The activator vials are ridiculous.  The give you a q tip to spread the product on the teeth but when you inset it into the vial...all the gel squirts out all over  the place...no matter how slowly you do it.  A waste of money.  Sorry I had to give it one star..wish there could be a no star rating</li>
            <li> Great system, easy to use with little time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine as toothpaste, but I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable whitening.</li>
            <li> Great product simple to use and my teeth look and feel cleaner and whiter. Simple and easy to use, great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the rinse &amp; the whitening system (including the rods) and am very pleased.  I could see a difference with the first use, and a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; difference by the third or fourth use.  I have a few veneers, and this works really well in lifting some of the yellow staining around the gum line.  I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks, and will continue to use it.  I now use my regular toothpaste in the morning (because of taste/cleaner feeling), but then use the supersmile once or twice a day.  I did buy the dental floss, but have no way of really knowing whether it works better than any other floss.  I&#x27;ve started to use it when I have the supersmile toothpaste still on my teeth, but it&#x27;s a little messy that way.  Having benefited from the system, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a week.  I have noticed a difference, but not as much as I had hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it because I do see my crowns getting whiter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used supersmile for about 3 weeks.. I can see the difference in those 3 weeks.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it and probably buy some more... the results are not dramatic but I can tell the difference.  Recommend it to anyone that is looking to improve their smile</li>
            <li> This is a very easy to use &amp; proficient whitening system.  In the past I have always used the whitening strips, which work a little better as far as the whitening factor, but Supersmile is so much more pleasant.  It has a great taste &amp; leaves my teeth squeaky clean.  I would use it again.</li>
            <li> I honestly have not seen a difference in the color of my teeth after using this system. I am not a coffee drinker either. I will likely try a drugstore brand next time for whitening.</li>
            <li> best, consistent product i have used without damaging enamel. don&#x27;t expect drastic change over night, but moderate consistent whiteness over time.</li>
            <li> Kind of works, but not enough for the cost.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product to me but I was not very impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> I tried this for 2 or 3 weeks and my teeth weren&#x27;t any whiter at all...read all the reviews so I thought it would work....for whatever reason it didn&#x27;t work at all for me so I gave it to my Grandaughter....</li>
            <li> I have never seen a whitening system that says it will improve not only the whiteness of natural teeth, but also whiten dental work such as crowns, and/or caps.  This system claimed that it would, and that was the reason I purchased it.  This product worked quite well on my crowns. I&#x27;m really happy about that part.  The reason I only gave it 3 stars is that I did not get anywhere near a 3-7 shade improvement in the whiteness of my natural teeth.  Maybe one shade better after a month of use ??</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all!! Company also didn&#x27;t stand behind their product! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> You have to follow directions and use it often.&lt;br /&gt;I do notice a difference in the color of my teeth,&lt;br /&gt;so I will use this product again and recommend this&lt;br /&gt;to family and friends.</li>
            <li> Great product would not use anything else</li>
            <li> I can do the something with peroxide on a cotton swab then use a good whitening toothpaste. Not worth the money</li>
            <li> Works very well, doesn&#x27;t take long to notice whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> Worked well for me! I read a lot of reviews saying it had no whitening effect but it helped my teeth go up a couple shades. I would give four star but I think it&#x27;s overpriced for what it&#x27;s worth. $15-20 is more reasonable.</li>
            <li> I love Supersmile because every time I brush my teeth with Super-smile I get a super super clean and confident mouth and smile.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it had artificial sweetener added.  The taste is so disgusting.  I never would have bought it had I known.</li>
            <li> This product taste great, but it didn&#x27;t change the color of my teeth at all. I love the way it makes your teeth feel clean and fresh though.</li>
            <li> I noticed whiter teeth within a few days.  I also felt my mouth &amp; teeth were cleaner than with ordinary tooth paste.</li>
            <li> I just bought this product a week ago. I have 2 caps on my 2 front teeth that weren&#x27;t badly stained, but using this product I can really tell a difference! Especially after using the applicator!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions used daily twice per day and it just did not work at all.  Very disappointing product.</li>
            <li> I noticed a whitening but not dramatic It does not whiten bonding like they claim it will.</li>
            <li> This is a great whitening kit that doesn&#x27;t make teeth feel sinsitive.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t supersede my expectations at all... I thought after about a week, the changes would be dramatic... Still using it and it&#x27;s not that noticeable.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. See the difference in 1 week.</li>
            <li> I could really see a difference in my bottom teeth. I would buy this again. I was told by my dentist that my teeth are now white enough.</li>
            <li> This kit delivers the goods!  Have seen real results!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product..I bought it for myself, my 17 year old son, my 23 year old daughter, and my 80 year old mother.  It gives me a feeling of &amp;#34;just left the dentist office clean&amp;#34;.  I have two full full bridges..one on the top and one on the bottom that I had to get when I was 21 due to juvenile peridontosis.  They were very white then, and now at 52, they look white again.  Thanks Dr. Smigel</li>
            <li> Loved the idea, but I never saw much difference if any. I would not recommend this product and will not be buying it again.</li>
            <li> In one week, the whiteness changed by 7 shades on the whiteness chart. I used 2 accelerating rods, one on the first day and one on the following day, because of the more immediate whitening results. I plan to continue this on week 2. There is a polished smooth feel on my teeth  and a pleasant minty taste. As a result of this smoothness, I could feel the difference on my back molars where my Sonicare toothbrush wasn&#x27;t quite reaching. I am now the proud owner of an Oral B and Sonicare toothbrush. I am very happy with the results. The reason for the 4 star is the activating rod is problematic in application and loss of fluid in rod to cotton swap. I don&#x27;t like wasting money or having to order more. Additionally, I find the cost marginally on the high side. Do I consider it worthwhile? Yes. Will I be looking elsewhere? Only if the company sees fit to make it less affordable.</li>
            <li> Easy enough to use, could see results in whiteness over the course of the order.  I will order more after I use up the pastes.</li>
            <li> I have been using the system for a week. Improvement is not dramatic but there is slow and steady whitening. I like that this appears to be a safe whitening process, without the gum pain and irritation that sometimes accompanies the peroxide gels and trays.</li>
            <li> I am currently still using the product and have been very pleased with the result. Big difference after first use. I have sensitive teeth, so I was anxious to try something that would not cause discomfort. It didn&#x27;t. The product is very easy to use, and only takes a couple of minutes. I think you will be happy with your results.</li>
            <li> I used this producdt as instructed and saw absolutely no change in the color of my teeth. Not worth my time or money.</li>
            <li> This product really whitened my teeth 4 shades lighter.  I am a 4 cup a day coffee drinker and my coffee stains are gone.  I have 8 veneers on my upper teeth and they were also whitened . My natural teeth and veneers are uniform in color.  You can&#x27;t even tell that I have veneers because of the whitening of SuperSmile.  I have no sensitivity whatsoever as compared to whitening strips of other brands. The only con is the price. But you pay a price for beauty and perfection.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 3 weeks now and have not noticed any changes.  Would not recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. My teeth are not only getting whiter but they are also feeling healthier. I like that my mouth feels clean after using this rather than hurting from all of the flavoring in the other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. It didn&#x27;t do a thing. You can buy the Rembrandt whitening kit for about 1/2 the cost &amp; actually have whiter teeth in a couple hours.</li>
            <li> I definitely notice that my teeth appear to be whiter without having them be sensitive. The product has a nice peppermint flavor and seems to be living up to its name so far.</li>
            <li> this is a complicated system if you use all the products correctly and at then end it&#x27;s just ok for removing stains and whitening.&lt;br /&gt;first you have to use the rods, the design doesn&#x27;t work very well, the gel in the rods is clear and there is much a small amount you can&#x27;t really tell when it it&#x27;s the teeth therefore you run out before you&#x27;ve covered your entire mouth.  Then you use the pre-rinse,&lt;br /&gt;then you put the paste and excelerator on the brush at the same time and brush.  A lot of work for mediocre results and it&#x27;s super expensive.  I still have the paste and excelerator left after I&#x27;m done, I won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> Did not do as promised. Can not tell any difference. Will not recommend product to anyone. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> BEST product of its kind that I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO gum irritation &amp; noticeable results at a far less expensive cost than via professional dentist visits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I intend to continue use.  It makes sense, no reason not to because of consistent improvement with no downside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sales and/or coupons would be helpful.</li>
            <li> this product does not work I tied it all and it does not do what it says it will do</li>
            <li> I have tried tooth whitening toothpastes as well as whitening strips over the years. Nothing works as well as Supersmile toothpaste and their whitening accelerator. I have porcelain veneers on some of my teeth due to tooth discoloration from extensive use of tetracycline antibiotics when I was a child and teenager. (I am allergic to Penicillin so I was given tetracycline as a child when I was sick and I was also prescribed tetracycline for acne as a teenager.) My dentist says that tooth whiteners do not  work on veneers but this product does whiten my veneers and the teeth behind them when used on a regular basis. So far, I have not found any other product that works as well as this. I highly recommend it for a whiter, brighter smile!</li>
            <li> Great products works just like described</li>
            <li> IT DID WHITEN MY TEETH AND WILL NOT STOP USING. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I recieved the package on time so service was good, product is not good.. There has been absolutely no change in color of my teeth so I do not recommened buying this product.</li>
            <li> I approached the Supersmile system pessimistically but with no other choices left. The Rembrandt didn&#x27;t do much for me, and my teeth are much too sensitive for any Zoom system (or even Crest strips or take home zoom systems with custom mouth pieces etc.). So I bought the Supersmile hoping it would make a dent in my dingy teeth made tan by years of drinking tea (herbal and decaffeinated for the most part) on an hourly basis for years. I go to the dentist twice a year, and I pretty good teeth except for the extreme sensitivity--and staining of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a miracle the Supersmile system is! I have so much confidence when I speak with people now. No one stares at my teeth and is in a hurry to leave anymore. I have been using the system for about two weeks now, and I noticed a huge difference after the first day. There is no sensitivity issues at all, except for having to use my Sensodyne once after day five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how white are my teeth? Let me make no bones about the fact that my teeth are not pearly white like a movie star etc.. They are &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; looking. They are not dingy anymore. I am sure the Zoom treatment would have made my teeth several factors whiter, but I couldn&#x27;t bear the pain if I can barely stand a normal cleaning at the dentist without a double dose of advil! I am content with the results, and I can tell with my interactions with other people who know me and who don&#x27;t that they hold me in higher esteem and no longer &amp;#34;notice&amp;#34; my teeth. This is a great advancement, and even a dentist cleaning couldn&#x27;t touch this level of whitening. I am being honest here for those in my position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t write reviews much anymore except when I feel a product has far surpassed my expectations and has added greatly to my quality of life. The Supersmile system has done that. If I had really white teeth, I&#x27;d still use this to keep them pearly white. I plan on using this product for a long time, as I feel like a renewed member of the human race with my teeth so clean looking! My teeth look great, and they feel great. Oh, and the tartar that use to be an eyesore between the gaps of my lower front teeth: GONE! I am at a complete loss as to why it worked so well with me, while others seem to not have noticed much of a difference. Genetics? Following the directions (like not using water when brushing using both toothpastes)? Bad Luck? Who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your on the fence, or are hoping for someone to give an honest assessment of this product used in real life with real positive results to give you a boost to press the trigger, then don&#x27;t hesitate with Supersmile at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife noticed immediately, and she made me buy her a set! I still have to show her how to use the q-tip thing; I wasted one application figuring it out. Now I feel like a dunce. Just using the two part toothpaste system has made her teeth &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; looking. It&#x27;s the only way I can describe it because it doesn&#x27;t bleach, but it really does whiten and enhance the brightness of your teeth in a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; way. Perhaps those who were dissatisfied already had relatively white teeth and were hoping for a Zoom type boost?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I will just conclude by saying that I personally satisfied beyond my wildest dreams, and this product is on a short list of things that I can&#x27;t live without, a true necessity that gives me a great smile and a real daily boost of confidence when dealing with people. Good luck, and I hope this helps you just a little.</li>
            <li> Disappointing to follow all the steps and then It simply did not work at all.  Plus, I ordered the kit, and later saw infomercials on TV with additional products for less money than I paid on Amazon.  Use Crest Strips.</li>
            <li> Followed the directions but did not see the improvement in whitening that I expected from the advertisements on the web. Maybe my fault b/c when i checked my teeth color on the chart they provided, I was already at the whitest level on the chart.</li>
            <li> Super Smile did not work for me.  There was no difference in the shades.  I will not be purchasing this product anymore.</li>
            <li> OMG... I love supersmile.  Everywhere I go people ALWAYS tell me I have amazing white teeth.  And it&#x27;s because if supermsile.... I use the toothpaste alternating with other brands so that I can take a brake from  whitening; but this ultimate whitening system ROCKS... the toothpaste in the sysytem lasts a REALLY loknd time...about 2 months.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it seemed easier than the whitening strips that I never seem to end up using.  I have only used the toothpaste for the past week or so but I personally believe it is making a difference.  I am hopeful that it is working as advertised.  I have not used the activator rods yet but I can only imagine that adding that step will make the whitening process that much better.  I am very pleased so far.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible. After 2 rod uses my teeth look great.</li>
            <li> I am on my second round of the Supersmile.  I only bought the toothpaste and accelerator the first time around and only had a small improvement in getting rid of the yellow.  Unfortunately even using the whitening rods with the toothpaste and accelerator this time I have not seen much improvement.  It does clean my teeth better and I notice very little plaque in between cleanings but my teeth are tough to get white and I only notice a slight change.</li>
            <li> Did not work. A total waste of money...</li>
            <li> This whitening system is much easier to maintain than &#x27;strips.&#x27; Make it part of your daily toothbrushing regime and that&#x27;s all there is to it. Of course, you&#x27;re supposed to use it for the rest of your life! This is actually good for people who aren&#x27;t willing to give up their coffee, red wine or whatever else is staining their teeth, which includes me......The Original Mint flavor is just fine. If you hate strips, this system is for you.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised</li>
            <li> The price is high,Fairly easy to use but it didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product. I will not re-purchase.</li>
            <li> I decided to give yet another whitening system a try.  This one did work.  I got a couple of shades difference immediately and further whitening with repeated use.  The daily product was not irritating at all.  I did get some&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; of the gums or roof of my mouth with the rods.  It lasted a short time and was not enough to make me&lt;br /&gt;stop using it.  Overall this is a great system.</li>
            <li> Super Smile met and exceeded all my expectations. . No sensitivity,  loving this new smile!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is an incrediable product. Results are noticable just about from the first use. The best thing is NO SENSITIVITY!&lt;br /&gt; I had used strips in the past and actually had to have a root canal because of the damage. As a smoker and coffee drinker damage done ,but what a difference!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t whiten my teeth.  Works on my sisters teeth.</li>
            <li> very happy of both purchases</li>
            <li> I bought it and it did not make my teeth any whiter next time I will buy Crest or just try and find a good deal for a dentist that has zoom.</li>
