            <li>Do get many compliments on this scent.</li>
            <li>I get more compliments from people who HAVE to know what perfume I wear.</li>
            <li>I tried my favorite store, Target and none of the stores in my area had it.</li>
            <li>I sure hope it does not get discontinued.</li>
            <li>I checked by Walgreens, and while they have it they were much more</li>
            <li>Loved the fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Great purchase I have no clue as to why DOVE would discontinue this smell, it leaves you smelling fresh and clean just as you step out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very clean, fresh, pleasant, and not too strong.</li>
            <li>Love the light scent.</li>
            <li>It has a nice fresh scent for those not-so-fresh moments.  </li>
            <li>The bottle can be easily carried in your purse or in your car or even truck, The fragrance is not girly</li>
            <li>It is the perfect &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; fragrance for everyday, not over powering or strong, just a nice fresh, clean smell.</li>
            <li>I also love the fresh scent</li>
            <li>All of the scents I&#x27;ve used are great (burst, rebalance and the scent pictured above).</li>
            <li>so I believe men could use it also as it is more citris and fresh smelling.</li>
            <li>why is this no longer available in stores??</li>
            <li>Nice clean smell..not too much..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pleasant, fresh kind of scent, not overpowering at all and not very floral, so it doesn&#x27;t run the risk of making you smell like your grandma.</li>
            <li>I love it so very much</li>
            <li>:) The only body splash that I have enjoyed for 2 years or more now.</li>
            <li>SO THAT I SMELL GREAT ALL DAY LONG.</li>
            <li>IT IS NOT TO LIGHT OR STRONG; JUST RIGHT</li>
            <li>I use the Dove Go Fresh deodorant stick of the same fragrance and find that the mist is a great compliment to the freshness after a shower or on the go.</li>
            <li>Will continue to purchase this light fresh scent since I&#x27;m allergic</li>
            <li>Light , fresh not greasy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why this essence doesn&#x27;t come in larger bottles, but it smells sooo good.</li>
            <li>On hot days it is great to just spray on legs or arms and even upper body for a quick freshning.</li>
            <li>Got here quickly.</li>
            <li>I can understand people paying more if they live in areas where the product is scarce or nonexistent, but please do not allow marketplace sellers to price gouge you.</li>
            <li>fresh crisp summer in the winter scent!</li>
            <li>has an amazing smell, but the bottle is different than the one on site.</li>
            <li>I always get compliments on how fresh I smell when I wear this.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>so I can get a fresh spritz any time I need one.</li>
            <li>, I purchased this for my 19 year old daughter as well we both love it and share it when we had one of them.</li>
            <li>Go Fresh Body Mist.</li>
            <li>Great smell, easy to carry in your purse for a  quick refresher, just wish the scent last a little longer.</li>
            <li>As usual, dove is great.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>The last 5 times I tried to buy it at markets, I could not find it any more.</li>
            <li>Should have looked there first.</li>
            <li>but I was willing to shovel out the money for it.</li>
            <li>I use to be able to find locally, but none of the stores seem to carry it anymore.</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so lucky next time.</li>
            <li>I guess any product that has a high demand will get discontinued.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very sensitive to heat.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to smell like a 13 year old or a 70 year old, and you don&#x27;t want to pay $85 for a bottle of Viva La Juicy</li>
            <li>light scent which is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Sorry I can&#x27;t buy in the store, but glad I can here!</li>
            <li>FOR AN EVERYDAY JUST RIGHT SMELL.</li>
            <li>Use the bar soap in the same scent in the shower and the spray everyday to keep me feeling fresh.</li>

            <li> It has a nice fresh scent for those not-so-fresh moments.  It&#x27;s a little expensive for such a small bottle though.</li>
            <li> its part of a set of this &#x27;scent&#x27; i am giving as birthday present, in OCTOBER.  she will love it, but i have not used it nor will i</li>
            <li> Wish it was still manufactured</li>
            <li> I always get compliments on how fresh I smell when I wear this.&lt;br /&gt;Nice light scent which is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Will continue to purchase this light fresh scent since I&#x27;m allergic&lt;br /&gt;to many perfumes.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing! Both men and women like it. I can&#x27;t stop using it and can no longer find it in stores.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore</li>
            <li> I was happy to order and receive this. The last 5 times I tried to buy it at markets, I could not find it any more. It is my favorite. It&#x27;s very clean, fresh, pleasant, and not too strong. It&#x27;s perfect for any outing. :) The only body splash that I have enjoyed for 2 years or more now.</li>
            <li> This is especially nice to use after any exertion when you can&#x27;t take time to shower.  It feels good and smells good and is a convenient size.  You can carry it with you if needed.</li>
            <li> I love this body spray - it smells just like the soap so no conflicting fragrances.  I used to be able to buy this at Target, but they do not stock it any more.</li>
            <li> this is perfect size to carry in a purse so I can get a fresh spritz any time I need one. I also love the fresh scent</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s over 90 degrees out and I&#x27;m very sensitive to heat. I put this in my purse or car to spray on when I&#x27;m running errands, or when I&#x27;m feeling sweaty. Great clean scent!</li>
            <li> I love this product and keep it on hand all the time. I was given it for a gift and have not been without it since.</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful I love it so very much, I purchased this for my 19 year old daughter as well we both love it and share it when we had one of them. fresh crisp summer in the winter scent!</li>
            <li> Great deodorant. Light , fresh not greasy. This is not an anti transpiration. For sweat one need to use something specific to transpiration. Otherwise for light touch of sent, this works great.</li>
            <li> I love Dove Go Fresh Body Mist. I have been using it for years. I see that some of the sellers on the marketplace are grossly overcharging for it. Do not overpay for this product! A 3 oz. bottle should cost you $4-5 max, not twice that price. I can understand people paying more if they live in areas where the product is scarce or nonexistent, but please do not allow marketplace sellers to price gouge you. All of the scents I&#x27;ve used are great (burst, rebalance and the scent pictured above).</li>
            <li> I use it all over me and the rooms in my home.</li>
            <li> Great purchase I have no clue as to why DOVE would discontinue this smell, it leaves you smelling fresh and clean just as you step out of the shower.  I guess any product that has a high demand will get discontinued. outrageous!</li>
            <li> I use this for after shave every day and love it. Feels good and light scent. I got it on Amazon as \\&quot;stocking stuffers\\&quot; for my dad and brother.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this stuff. Its very hard to find. I had to search everywhere to find it. I finally found it at Amazon. Should have looked there first.</li>
            <li> Love the light scent.</li>
            <li> I use the Dove Go Fresh deodorant stick of the same fragrance and find that the mist is a great compliment to the freshness after a shower or on the go.

It&#x27;s a bit hard to find nowadays, and a little pricey but I was willing to shovel out the money for it. If you don&#x27;t want to smell like a 13 year old or a 70 year old, and you don&#x27;t want to pay $85 for a bottle of Viva La Juicy, this is your best bet. Though I admit, it doesn&#x27;t smell at all like cucumbers to me..</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple of years. It has a very nice pleasant scent that is not overbearing. I receive compliments often. I use to be able to find locally, but none of the stores seem to carry it anymore. It&#x27;s nice that I was able to find the product again. Since it&#x27;s an add on item though, you have to order something else to get it.</li>
            <li> THIS DOVE BODY MIST HAS A WONDERFUL SMELL. IT IS NOT TO LIGHT OR STRONG; JUST RIGHT FOR AN EVERYDAY JUST RIGHT SMELL. I USUALLY MIX IT WITH MY BODY LOTION SO THAT I SMELL GREAT ALL DAY LONG.</li>
            <li> I am using this every day and I realy like the smell. I does not last for hours but it works for me.</li>
            <li> Great smell, easy to carry in your purse for a  quick refresher, just wish the scent last a little longer.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as advertised. Got here quickly.</li>
            <li> My favorite.... why is this no longer available in stores??</li>
            <li> LOVE IT...SOOO HAPPY I FOUND THE MISTS!!! Actually relieved! !!! Can&#x27;t find in the stores anymore! ! This works for me!!!</li>
            <li> Love this Dove spray.Use the bar soap in the same scent in the shower and the spray everyday to keep me feeling fresh.Do get many compliments on this scent.It&#x27;s perfect as a lighter alternative to my favorite perfume which I save for special occasions.</li>
            <li> I get more compliments from people who HAVE to know what perfume I wear. When I tell them its DOVE...they are shocked. Great combination with the deoderant and body wash..Nice clean smell..not too much..just enough for people to want it for themselves.</li>
            <li> I could no longer find this product in stores. I tried my favorite store, Target and none of the stores in my area had it. Neither did Walmart or Walgreen&#x27;s. I thought it had simply been discontinued by the company. I decided to try online and found it here. I ordered 2 just in case I&#x27;m not so lucky next time. It is the perfect &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; fragrance for everyday, not over powering or strong, just a nice fresh, clean smell. It does not take a lot and lasts a long time. I sure hope it does not get discontinued.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this in Walmart or Target but they&#x27;ve stopped carrying it. I checked by Walgreens, and while they have it they were much more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I find the scent to be fresh and pleasant. Perfect for confidence.</li>
            <li> The size of the bottle was much too small for the price which I can get at the supermarket for much less</li>
            <li> As usual, dove is great. I definetely will buy more! Loved the fresh scent. Happy with my purchase, this idea one of my favourite dove scents</li>
            <li> Great smell. Wonderful</li>
            <li> Strong unpleasant fragrance</li>
            <li> has an amazing smell, but the bottle is different than the one on site.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product but couldn&#x27;t find it in stores any longer.</li>
