    <ol>
            <li> Love this soap. A little bit goes a long way. Especially loving it for some tough hand dishwashing duty. Have used in my laundry, in my bath, dishwasher. The lavender scent is beautiful. My only problem will be to use it sparingly, the hype is real!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for washing dishes, washing clothes, and greasy stove tops. It smells wonderful and really gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Smells great without having that sweet smell. Cleans fantastic. I use it to clean my stainless steel sink, my granite countertops, have used in in the dishwasher and washing machine. Cleans grease and grime.</li>
            <li> This is a soap that I have used in the kitchen, laundry - in the machine and hand washing, and the bathroom - shower and sink. It is fantastic. I have also used it in a diluted strength spray bottle for my flowers in the garden (keeps bugs from eating the leaves and petals). I think it is versatile and smells great. I highly recommend it. It is used daily somewhere in our home!</li>
            <li> Love the EO line of products.</li>
            <li> We have looked for other soaps but this is best one we have found. It smells nice and does not have any junk in it.</li>
            <li> The scent (lavender) is amazing--strong enough, yet \\&quot;pure\\&quot;-smelling. Unlike most scented liquid soaps/ detergents this one actually smells like pure lavender, not like cheap perfume (because it&#x27;s made with essential oil). Inhaling it while doing the dishes with dimmed lights and a candle or two burning is a meditative experience. Don&#x27;t expect a lot of foam; but then foam quantity is not proportional to cleaning power. This stuff does the job, and makes it an enjoyable and relaxing experience. I have been using this for years, and am beyond pleased.</li>
            <li> THIS HAS SO MANY USES AND IT HAS A GREAT SMELL.  I LOVE THAT IT IS ALL NATURAL ..GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I use many EO products.  I love that they are all natural and still do the job, whether it is cleaning hands, dishes, counters or dogs! This is truly an all purpose soap that I use in every room of my house. I add tea tree essential oil to it and it even makes a great bathroom cleanser.</li>
            <li> I was totally convinced the minute I opened the bottle! The smell was refreshing and CLEAN! Not overpowering. Smells just like my lavender garden! There is one empty cabinet in my home now because all you need is this fantastic product. I really think I could do a commercial for them! I am all about savings but not when it will create more work than necessary. NOT with this product. I use it for everything from laundry to dishes! Mixed with a little good old vinegar and you will remove grease and grime! Just purchased two more bottles so that my husband can have one on hand in the garage. Mixed with warm water a little bit goes a long way to wash 3 vehicles! You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> The lavender scent is a bit harsh, a bit chemical to the nose. Will use it but not buy again.</li>
            <li> Smells good. Kind of expensive.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  I use it for hand washing clothes; hand soap; almost anything.  I keep it in the bathroom so I don&#x27;t have to go to the kitchen to get soap.</li>
            <li> I use it for everything - dishes, laundry, surface cleanser, hand soap.  Works well, smells amazing, good value, easy on your skin.</li>
            <li> love using this as shampoo.</li>
            <li> I almost always love EO products, and I especially love this product; however, I am afraid that it is no longer being made. I hope I am wrong about that!</li>
            <li> This soap works well to clean about anything. I have used it on vacation to do small quantities of laundry in the sink. Also, the soap works well to bring out the shine in metal finishes.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite liquid soaps.  I appreciate the very economical 32 oz size and use it for a hand soap in the kitchen and bathrooms.  It has a nice, fresh smell and nontoxic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I just received this today my house smells wonderful!!!! It cleans dirt off of everything! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy any other cleaning Supply after using this!</li>
            <li> I call it the &amp;#34;Do Everything!&amp;#34; soap because I have used it on everything... laundry, cars, dishes, bathtubs, floors...  the list of possibilities are endless I&#x27;m sure..  the price was rght when I bought it and it does the job..</li>
