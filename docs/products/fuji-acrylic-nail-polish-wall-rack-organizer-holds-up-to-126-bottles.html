            <li>This product was okay</li>
            <li>but nothing great... when it came it was scratched in a lot of places which was very disapointing.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with my purchase.</li>

            <li>and I appreciate being able to utilize wall space for things that would otherwise take up space in drawers, cabinets etc.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love my nail Polish rack, but I think I need another one :-)</li>

            <li>It came early and it has been a great relief for my daughter.</li>
            <li>The edges are rough and you can see where it was glued together, but if this were to be painted it would be perfect.</li>
            <li>Good quality and a reasonable price.</li>

            <li>So easy to install on my wall.</li>
            <li>Its super easy and holds up more then what you think.</li>
            <li>It is also great for any decor, and the clear look makes your polish colours show true because there&#x27;s no reflection from the rack.</li>
            <li>I will say this rack looks fine</li>
            <li>Its functional and works fine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best way to keep those little bottles organized and out of the way.</li>

            <li>I haven&#x27;t put them up yet, I&#x27;m still waiting for an available room just for my nail stuff</li>
            <li>It comes with screws to screw into your wall and it looks fabulous.</li>
            <li>This rack was received in great condition with the holes and proper screws for hanging.  </li>
            <li>Fits my polishes and looks great mounted next to my manicure station. . . . . . .</li>
            <li>do wish there was one more taller shelf to allow for taller bottle of polish (like stripers) and it would also be good to have an additional 2 screws at the bottom just for extra security.</li>
            <li>and SHE ABSOLUTELY loves it!!!</li>
            <li>So easy to find the polish with one quick glance</li>

            <li>Now she has a very organized place for her many nail polish colors.</li>
            <li>Overall this was a good purchase....</li>
            <li>Nice clear acrylic shelf for my nail polish collection.</li>
            <li>Posted a photo on facebook, several people have loved it and asked where I git it.</li>
            <li>Instead of having to look through a box full.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use the brackets that came with it, but hanging it up with a hammer, level, and pencil was pretty quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Other than it its great</li>
            <li>Other than that it is great.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the quick ship.</li>

            <li>It got here super quickly.</li>
            <li>For the price, I highly recommend this to anyone with more than a dozen polishes.</li>
            <li>You can see the glue where it oozed out from all the connecting joints on the shelves and its pretty cheap looking.</li>
            <li>Especially online it can be hard to find good customer service, so I was impressed and would certainly purchase items from them again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to find the polish she wants without digging into the plastic container they&lt;br</li>
            <li>I LOVE this rack so much that i&#x27;m ready to purchase another one and soon!</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t even express enough how much I love this nail rack!</li>
            <li>The first one that I purchased has survived THREE moves (i&#x27;m a gypsy!)</li>
            <li>This rack really does fit about 96 bottles of nail polish.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that i can see all my polishes at once and just grab the ones I need without having to lug around my old storage caddy.</li>
            <li>This is really fun too for when you have friends over</li>
            <li>but I love them so far.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I can see all my polishes to match up with my clothes right there.</li>
            <li>The price is right and it does its job...</li>
            <li>Pulled it right out of the box and hung it right up.</li>
            <li>She put it right on her wall as soon as it arrived.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone who wants to be a bit more organized and doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on a higher quality shelf.</li>
            <li>I lay inside the shelves which can be seen easily thru the clear plexiglass..</li>
            <li>Came in mail super fast.</li>
            <li>The wall rack is sturdy and since it is clear fit right in with her room decor.</li>
            <li>the clear finish of the plastic makes it easy to see exactly what each color truly looks like, and allows the rack to be placed on any color wall without clashing.  </li>
            <li>The nail polish rack came very fast.</li>
            <li>So far, holding up just fine.</li>
            <li>It takes no space in my small closet and looks so nice!</li>
            <li>The edge was higher with the rack I got in December.</li>
            <li>This item was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>It looked exactly like the picture, exactly like what I imagined.</li>
            <li>, this rack can hold upto 90 OPI bottles, or 120 Sally H&#x27;s D.S. or more, if you&#x27;re using a thinner bottle like the petites or french manicure bottles...</li>
            <li>I bought this for my  daughter and it is pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li>and after seeing how many I have, I may not buy anymore polishes, but this definitely makes it easier to figure out what not to buy</li>
            <li>Seems pretty sturdy and durable and everyone that sees it loves it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to open a salon up and get more of theses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really neat for a &amp;#34;tween&amp;#34; to keep all her polish organized!  </li>
            <li>When I opened it up, the top \\&quot;Polish Rack\\&quot; sign did not properly line up and the corners of the acrylic were already separating.</li>
            <li>Decent quality, shipped quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t stop buy nail Polish, I would definitely buy another one, any discount out there .....:-)</li>
            <li>I order another one exactly like it and mistakenly order it from another vendor here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Kind of what I expected.  </li>
            <li>I can see most of my polishes right away and will be purchasing a second one very soon.</li>
            <li>There was no cracks or any other kind of damage.</li>
            <li>My husband secured it on studs, so it&#x27;s very stable and sturdy, and holds my bottles prettily.</li>
            <li>I did have to drill two more holes into the rack for extra support and use different hardware because of where I hung mine but the original hardware should be okay.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>I also ordered the 48 piece rainbow colors glitter nail polish, which has very vibrant colors.  </li>
            <li>Pure Ice/Essie&lt;br /&gt;20</li>
            <li>thank you so much for such an easy internet shopping experience.</li>
            <li>I bought this nail polish shelf mainly to keep my obsession for nail polish under control (first world problems, I know).</li>
            <li>the plastic is hard, does not chip, and can be mounted very easily!</li>
            <li>This was everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li>I have a smaller polish rack where the polish can be moved along the shelf smoothly.</li>
            <li>so I found a spice rack that didn&#x27;t hold that much polish.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>And it hangs on the wall very sturdily.</li>
            <li>It holds a ton of nail polishes and is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Very durable</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Looks like pic, ships fast, packaged well.</li>
            <li>it was gonna be very sturdy</li>
            <li>You guys have a very sturdy, reliable and well built rack</li>
            <li>it s much</li>
            <li>It was very well protected when shipped and arrived undamaged.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty sturdy and not hard to install.</li>
            <li>They fit odd shaped bottles and it supports a full rack (even if it&#x27;s not drilled into studs).</li>
            <li>She she also received a trampoline during her party and I thought well she won&#x27;t get too excited about my gift until maybe later.</li>
            <li>They will get all my polishes out of the way &amp; more room for other items I need to find homes for.</li>
            <li>LOVED IT, very usefull, now i now where to put all my nailpolish, small, so it doesnt take much space on my wall, but it fits about 100 bottles, so yes it is pretty big</li>
            <li>Hopefully they have good customer service and will either replace it at no cost or refund everything including the ridiculous shipping.</li>
            <li>Getting my third rack right now!</li>
            <li>It was not hard to hang and it is made very well.</li>
            <li>I found this one for 21.00 and ordered it THE SHIPPING WAS 15.00 more than half of what the rack cost.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shelf.</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It is plexi glass-like (expected) and very cheaply put together (NOT expected considering the cost</li>
            <li>It is clear plastic but very sturdy.</li>
            <li>But I was able to squeeze quite a few on there.</li>
            <li>just need to get a few more</li>
            <li>As for the holder itself, it is made of hard cheap plastic and does not seem strong enough to hold all of my nail polish</li>
            <li>The front stop on several of the shelves is not properly attached and lean inward or outward, diminishing the space available on the shelf or allowing bottles to fall off the shelf as the case may be.</li>
            <li>I own a lot of different brands and didn&#x27;t have any trouble with any sitting in the space well.  </li>
            <li>Looks very professional and does its job</li>
            <li>Now, I need to get more nail polish, since what I have only fills up two rows, so they don&#x27;t look so lonely!</li>
            <li>whatever color you want or hot glue fabric to the back side of the shelf.</li>
            <li>When I received it I was pleasantly surprised that it looked just like the picture!</li>
            <li>The clear wall rack will allow the vibrant nailpolish to clearly show and definately will provide interest to any wall she chooses to hang it on.</li>
            <li>I loaded this shelf down with so many different colors.</li>
            <li>I have less than 60 on it now and only haver room for maybe 10 more.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried since it only had holes for the top</li>
            <li>Can see every item clearly.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like the clear shelves, you can always spray point it</li>
            <li>arrived early.</li>
            <li>My nail polish doesn&#x27;t fill up the whole thing and it also works well for my nail stripers, polish remover, and various art pens, etc.</li>
            <li>It seems somewhat flimsy but is holding up so far after 4 months.</li>
            <li>Holds all my polishes and so professional looking.</li>
            <li>She is only 11 years old,but keeps a very orderly</li>
            <li>Very Sturdy, and holds nail polishes of different sizes.</li>
            <li>My 16 year old daughter loves this.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my 7 year old and she loves it.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need the top plaque, and thought I ordered it without it, but at least it wasn&#x27;t attached so I had the option of not using it.</li>
            <li>The shipping, however, is a complete rip off...</li>
            <li>I ordered this as part of a Christmas gift for my 15-year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s barely half full.</li>
            <li>and I am actually scared that it will break and create a huge mess.</li>
            <li>This polish wall rack was just as I expected and exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>I had tried a few other nail polish holders before, but most just took too much space or didn&#x27;t hold enough polish.</li>
            <li>The quality was exactly what I had expected.</li>
            <li>Okay it is very hard plastic</li>
            <li>I was so tired of having all my polish in a basket and not being able to see all the colors I already had.</li>
            <li>it looks great:()</li>
            <li>and it doesnt seem to put too much preasure where I would be worried about it falling down from weight.</li>

            <li> love that i didnt have to find a place for it.</li>
            <li> dont know how many nail polish it fits</li>
            <li> but i just love this rack.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love all the color on the wall :)</li>
            <li> polish rack is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Adds much more storage space to my house by taking the polish out of my cabinets and placing it out of the way.  </li>
            <li> Hurray for vertical storage :)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Daughter has so many bottles of nail polish that she needed something to put them on and</li>
            <li> Love it a lot.</li>
            <li> I love this Nail polish Nails Rack</li>
            <li> I might have to purchase another one since I have so many nail polish still waiting for a home display &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I bought these because I have so many nail polishes</li>
            <li> I love these They hang in my bedroom.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> The price was great and they really hold a lot of polish.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend&#x27;s many nail polishes.</li>
            <li> I love this rack.</li>
            <li> IT LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Love, love,love this product.</li>
            <li> I love and I recomand</li>
            <li> I LOVE this nail polish rack :)</li>
            <li> I am thinking of purchasing 2 more since these hold many bottles.</li>
            <li> Many people compliment me on it.</li>
            <li> To display the many colors I have on the wall, makes choosing the color for the week a breeze.</li>
            <li> This product was okay</li>
            <li> but nothing great... when it came it was scratched in a lot of places which was very disapointing.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> you dont need the bottom to be screwed into the wall like the top...</li>
            <li> so ok.</li>
            <li> The shipping itself is highway robbery, but I figured this product was going to be good and worth the money to get my polishes standing up and all in one place.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate being able to utilize wall space for things that would otherwise take up space in drawers, cabinets etc.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my nail Polish rack, but I think I need another one :-)</li>
            <li> Bought 2 of these and had to order 2 more...</li>
            <li> I will probably be ordering more</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and I was able to hang it up in seconds.  </li>
            <li> love this rack.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my granddaughter who has so many nail</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> It also came with a cute sign that reads, \\&quot;Polish Station\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Now bottles with colors can be seen much better for selection by her clients.</li>
            <li> my wife loves being able to organize all her polish now.</li>
            <li> does what its supposed to, i love it.</li>
            <li> an holds many bottles...</li>
            <li> I love this item.</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> Fabulous!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice rack and works very well at the shop.</li>
            <li> I was able to fit about 100 bottles of nail polish and it was very easy to install.</li>
            <li> It is sturdy and works great, I just wish you could get it more than just clear.</li>
            <li> It was more than easy to hang</li>
            <li> This is a great home rack for any bathroom and was pretty easy to install and holds well even when completely full.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase, since I got it, I&#x27;ve been buying nail polish left and right!</li>
            <li> This rack looks ok when filled</li>
            <li> Since it is clear, it looks great anywhere.</li>
            <li> I will be going to home depot to buy more secure holders though.</li>
            <li> Doesnt fit too many nail polishes but does the job for someone who doesnt have a million bottles.&lt;br /&gt;Looks</li>
            <li> It came early and it has been a great relief for my daughter.</li>
            <li> The edges are rough and you can see where it was glued together, but if this were to be painted it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> Good quality and a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> display all the polishes for easy access.</li>
            <li> installation was really easy</li>
            <li> It hangs up easily.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the rack to anyone who needs convient storage and easily viewed nail polish storage.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it, and it is easy to keep up with her nail polish.  </li>
            <li> so they are neat and displayed for easy finding.</li>
            <li> easy to install on wall.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy plastic and easy to hang.</li>
            <li> I can organize my polish&#x27;s by color (for my ocd tendency) which makes it really easy to pick the colors I need.</li>
            <li> well so it was safe upon arrival, and it&#x27;s just overall a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Easy to mount</li>
            <li> So easy to install on my wall.</li>
            <li> Its super easy and holds up more then what you think.</li>
            <li> It is also great for any decor, and the clear look makes your polish colours show true because there&#x27;s no reflection from the rack.</li>
            <li> I will say this rack looks fine</li>
            <li> Its functional and works fine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best way to keep those little bottles organized and out of the way.</li>
            <li> Bought this to free up some drawer space</li>
            <li> you can fit 14 per row</li>
            <li> and NOW THEY ARE CHeap cheap</li>
            <li> I bought awhile ago and have already filled it up.</li>
            <li> If you have a nailpolish addiction and a free wall on which to hang this, you need this nail polish rack.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t put them up yet, I&#x27;m still waiting for an available room just for my nail stuff</li>
            <li> It comes with screws to screw into your wall and it looks fabulous.</li>
            <li> This rack was received in great condition with the holes and proper screws for hanging.  </li>
            <li> Fits my polishes and looks great mounted next to my manicure station. . . . . . .</li>
            <li> do wish there was one more taller shelf to allow for taller bottle of polish (like stripers) and it would also be good to have an additional 2 screws at the bottom just for extra security.</li>
            <li> and SHE ABSOLUTELY loves it!!!</li>
            <li> So easy to find the polish with one quick glance</li>
            <li> This rack is super strong and would go with any room.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Installation was super easy.  </li>
            <li> It has worked out perfectly; it takes up so little space, I recommend!</li>
            <li> It helps me to keep all of my nail polish organized and easily accessible.</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying this, its worth it!</li>
            <li> This is not necessary, but it makes me feel better! :)</li>
            <li> nicely packed, new, no scraches.</li>
            <li> and I filled it up quick.</li>
            <li> It was so easy to install and came with the right screws &amp; anchors for hanging.</li>
            <li> I have tons of nail polish and really needed something to be able to see/</li>
            <li> I love it so much I bought 2 -</li>
            <li> Now she has a very organized place for her many nail polish colors.</li>
            <li> Overall this was a good purchase....</li>
            <li> Nice clear acrylic shelf for my nail polish collection.</li>
            <li> Posted a photo on facebook, several people have loved it and asked where I git it.</li>
            <li> Instead of having to look through a box full.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the brackets that came with it, but hanging it up with a hammer, level, and pencil was pretty quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Other than it its great</li>
            <li> Other than that it is great.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the quick ship.</li>
            <li> It holds 96 total (I don&#x27;t quite have that many yet, but I have the room if I happen to buy more).</li>
            <li> It got here super quickly.</li>
            <li> For the price, I highly recommend this to anyone with more than a dozen polishes.</li>
            <li> You can see the glue where it oozed out from all the connecting joints on the shelves and its pretty cheap looking.</li>
            <li> Especially online it can be hard to find good customer service, so I was impressed and would certainly purchase items from them again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to find the polish she wants without digging into the plastic container they&lt;br</li>
            <li> I LOVE this rack so much that i&#x27;m ready to purchase another one and soon!</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t even express enough how much I love this nail rack!</li>
            <li> The first one that I purchased has survived THREE moves (i&#x27;m a gypsy!)</li>
            <li> This rack really does fit about 96 bottles of nail polish.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that i can see all my polishes at once and just grab the ones I need without having to lug around my old storage caddy.</li>
            <li> This is really fun too for when you have friends over</li>
            <li> but I love them so far.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I can see all my polishes to match up with my clothes right there.</li>
            <li> The price is right and it does its job...</li>
            <li> Pulled it right out of the box and hung it right up.</li>
            <li> She put it right on her wall as soon as it arrived.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone who wants to be a bit more organized and doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on a higher quality shelf.</li>
            <li> I lay inside the shelves which can be seen easily thru the clear plexiglass..</li>
            <li> Came in mail super fast.</li>
            <li> The wall rack is sturdy and since it is clear fit right in with her room decor.</li>
            <li> the clear finish of the plastic makes it easy to see exactly what each color truly looks like, and allows the rack to be placed on any color wall without clashing.  </li>
            <li> The nail polish rack came very fast.</li>
            <li> So far, holding up just fine.</li>
            <li> It takes no space in my small closet and looks so nice!</li>
            <li> The edge was higher with the rack I got in December.</li>
            <li> This item was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> It looked exactly like the picture, exactly like what I imagined.</li>
            <li> , this rack can hold upto 90 OPI bottles, or 120 Sally H&#x27;s D.S. or more, if you&#x27;re using a thinner bottle like the petites or french manicure bottles...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my  daughter and it is pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> and after seeing how many I have, I may not buy anymore polishes, but this definitely makes it easier to figure out what not to buy</li>
            <li> Seems pretty sturdy and durable and everyone that sees it loves it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to open a salon up and get more of theses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really neat for a &amp;#34;tween&amp;#34; to keep all her polish organized!  </li>
            <li> When I opened it up, the top \\&quot;Polish Rack\\&quot; sign did not properly line up and the corners of the acrylic were already separating.</li>
            <li> Decent quality, shipped quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t stop buy nail Polish, I would definitely buy another one, any discount out there .....:-)</li>
            <li> I order another one exactly like it and mistakenly order it from another vendor here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Kind of what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I can see most of my polishes right away and will be purchasing a second one very soon.</li>
            <li> There was no cracks or any other kind of damage.</li>
            <li> My husband secured it on studs, so it&#x27;s very stable and sturdy, and holds my bottles prettily.</li>
            <li> I did have to drill two more holes into the rack for extra support and use different hardware because of where I hung mine but the original hardware should be okay.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> I also ordered the 48 piece rainbow colors glitter nail polish, which has very vibrant colors.  </li>
            <li> Pure Ice/Essie&lt;br /&gt;20</li>
            <li> thank you so much for such an easy internet shopping experience.</li>
            <li> I bought this nail polish shelf mainly to keep my obsession for nail polish under control (first world problems, I know).</li>
            <li> the plastic is hard, does not chip, and can be mounted very easily!</li>
            <li> This was everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li> I have a smaller polish rack where the polish can be moved along the shelf smoothly.</li>
            <li> so I found a spice rack that didn&#x27;t hold that much polish.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> And it hangs on the wall very sturdily.</li>
            <li> It holds a ton of nail polishes and is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Very durable</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Looks like pic, ships fast, packaged well.</li>
            <li> it was gonna be very sturdy</li>
            <li> You guys have a very sturdy, reliable and well built rack</li>
            <li> it s much</li>
            <li> It was very well protected when shipped and arrived undamaged.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty sturdy and not hard to install.</li>
            <li> They fit odd shaped bottles and it supports a full rack (even if it&#x27;s not drilled into studs).</li>
            <li> She she also received a trampoline during her party and I thought well she won&#x27;t get too excited about my gift until maybe later.</li>
            <li> They will get all my polishes out of the way &amp; more room for other items I need to find homes for.</li>
            <li> LOVED IT, very usefull, now i now where to put all my nailpolish, small, so it doesnt take much space on my wall, but it fits about 100 bottles, so yes it is pretty big</li>
            <li> Hopefully they have good customer service and will either replace it at no cost or refund everything including the ridiculous shipping.</li>
            <li> Getting my third rack right now!</li>
            <li> It was not hard to hang and it is made very well.</li>
            <li> I found this one for 21.00 and ordered it THE SHIPPING WAS 15.00 more than half of what the rack cost.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shelf.</li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It is plexi glass-like (expected) and very cheaply put together (NOT expected considering the cost</li>
            <li> It is clear plastic but very sturdy.</li>
            <li> But I was able to squeeze quite a few on there.</li>
            <li> just need to get a few more</li>
            <li> As for the holder itself, it is made of hard cheap plastic and does not seem strong enough to hold all of my nail polish</li>
            <li> The front stop on several of the shelves is not properly attached and lean inward or outward, diminishing the space available on the shelf or allowing bottles to fall off the shelf as the case may be.</li>
            <li> I own a lot of different brands and didn&#x27;t have any trouble with any sitting in the space well.  </li>
            <li> Looks very professional and does its job</li>
            <li> Now, I need to get more nail polish, since what I have only fills up two rows, so they don&#x27;t look so lonely!</li>
            <li> whatever color you want or hot glue fabric to the back side of the shelf.</li>
            <li> When I received it I was pleasantly surprised that it looked just like the picture!</li>
            <li> The clear wall rack will allow the vibrant nailpolish to clearly show and definately will provide interest to any wall she chooses to hang it on.</li>
            <li> I loaded this shelf down with so many different colors.</li>
            <li> I have less than 60 on it now and only haver room for maybe 10 more.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried since it only had holes for the top</li>
            <li> Can see every item clearly.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like the clear shelves, you can always spray point it</li>
            <li> arrived early.</li>
            <li> My nail polish doesn&#x27;t fill up the whole thing and it also works well for my nail stripers, polish remover, and various art pens, etc.</li>
            <li> It seems somewhat flimsy but is holding up so far after 4 months.</li>
            <li> Holds all my polishes and so professional looking.</li>
            <li> She is only 11 years old,but keeps a very orderly</li>
            <li> Very Sturdy, and holds nail polishes of different sizes.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old daughter loves this.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my 7 year old and she loves it.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need the top plaque, and thought I ordered it without it, but at least it wasn&#x27;t attached so I had the option of not using it.</li>
            <li> The shipping, however, is a complete rip off...</li>
            <li> I ordered this as part of a Christmas gift for my 15-year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s barely half full.</li>
            <li> and I am actually scared that it will break and create a huge mess.</li>
            <li> This polish wall rack was just as I expected and exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> I had tried a few other nail polish holders before, but most just took too much space or didn&#x27;t hold enough polish.</li>
            <li> The quality was exactly what I had expected.</li>
            <li> Okay it is very hard plastic</li>
            <li> I was so tired of having all my polish in a basket and not being able to see all the colors I already had.</li>
            <li> it looks great:()</li>
            <li> and it doesnt seem to put too much preasure where I would be worried about it falling down from weight.</li>
            <li> Big enough to be a decent size, but small enough to not be a burden.</li>
            <li> I strongly dislike the cheesy sign that you are supposed to hang above it.</li>
            <li> Bigger than I personally need for polishes, but I use some areas of the rack for other decorative things, like my crystal collection and tiny silk flowers.</li>
            <li> There is tons of room to fit polish and it looks expensive on the wall.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how I lived so long without this rack.</li>
            <li> The item is bigger than expected and thats a PLUS for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I subsisted on a drawer for so long.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even use what It came to avoid big wholes on my wall, I just used regular nails (typically rod-shaped rigid piece of metal) to mount in on my wall.</li>
            <li> I think it should be white or black because red doesnt match all rooms</li>
            <li> and they were all kept in a big box along with my other nail art supplies.</li>
            <li> The product overall, isn&#x27;t that great, nor horrible.  </li>
            <li> This item did NOT live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter and came broken the first time, but the company responded the same day and shipped another one out at no cost to me of what I received a few days later.</li>
            <li> it kind of looks weak to me, you can also see the cuts of the acrylic being a little bit whiter than the rest of the parts, I hope it makes sense, over all I like it, but I still think it-s a little expensive for what you really get.</li>
            <li> When I received the nail polish holder, it was already broken and had been super glued previously.</li>
            <li> figured it would take a few weeks to deliver, wow came in less than 5.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it is not worth the money I paid for it!</li>
            <li> The only down side is that you can see the glue, but once the polishes are up you don&#x27;t even see any of it!</li>
            <li> Sometimes my nails would be wet from one polish when I realize I needed another color and had to dig through the box with a nail file to find the color I wanted.</li>
            <li> I have over 60 polishes and the bottom row of the shelf is still empty.</li>
            <li> I received my package faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> The delivery did come as expected and it was a box within a box.</li>
            <li> Over all I like it, but the installation has to be done carefully, as the plastic seems a bit brittle.  </li>
            <li> Be careful.  </li>
            <li> Keep in mind this shelf is not a $200 shelf, it is not perfect, but it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> She just told me the other day that all her friends want one like hers</li>
            <li> THE OTHER RACK HAS NO SIGN.</li>
            <li> You do have you use a power drill to screw it into the wall but other than that it already comes assembled.</li>
            <li> So, I keep my dotting tools, clippers, and other nail items on it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pertect, not to big not to small.</li>
            <li> After further inspection, the entire corner was broken in pieces.</li>
            <li> the same one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shelf itself can be hung on the wall if you want (I currently just have mine sitting against the  wall behind a door or in my closet</li>
            <li> The bottom had cracks all along it, enough that I would have sent it back however my daughter wanted it hung so badly that I just clear taped it</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my only complaint</li>
            <li> This is not just for nail salons but a must-have for any nail polish fanatic such as I am!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I received a new one and actually probably got the remnants of an previous unhappy customer&#x27;s order.</li>
            <li> I received this rack on time, but slightly damaged.</li>
            <li> so I opted for the slight refund.</li>
            <li> it was black friday</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the rack for a week and a half now</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I can say is that it&#x27;s a little messy looking.</li>
            <li> I cracked mine a little when I put it up.  </li>
            <li> They did not come with the polish center attachment and the edge that holds the polish in, hardly does the job.</li>
            <li> I bought a narrow drawer divider with a lip on it and hung it on the bottom shelf for my tools and nail stickers.</li>
            <li> and it does not fit 96 bottles of nail polish</li>
            <li> If your having trouble hop on Youtube and search up:</li>
            <li> (read that in a few reviews), it is not flimsy once it is on your wall.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t to heavy</li>
            <li> Once you fill it up it  doesn&#x27;t look so bad, but for the price plus shipping I was imagining something higher quality</li>
            <li> no more polishes misplaced.</li>
            <li> It is presentable, but the little screws are hard to stick in the wall.</li>
            <li> the past and son of the shelf front bars kept breaking off.</li>
            <li> (A LOT) and moved past it.</li>
            <li> No more bottles laying on the floor.</li>
            <li> I never enjoyed my nail polishes so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is not very good.</li>
            <li> It is a durable hard plastic frame</li>
            <li> This item came a few days after I ordered it!!</li>
            <li> It holds a ridiculous amount of nail polish and</li>
            <li> Seriously?  </li>
            <li> I was a little bit afraid of the shelves being unstable since there were not wholes at the bottom of the shelf to attach it to a wall.</li>
            <li> Not so for this product - the surface is almost scratchly &amp; the plastic is quite thin.</li>
            <li> Recently: poorer condition and packaged in a horrible fashion.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> and they were expensive</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> cause I thought it looked cheesy.</li>
            <li> I am so sorry I did not do this sooner.</li>
            <li> And nothing was wrong with it.</li>
            <li> The craftmanship isn&#x27;t bad at all you can&#x27;t see glue anywhere</li>
            <li> I was slightly disappointed with the quality of the rack though.</li>
            <li> I have been very ill with my diabete but this product so Rocks!  </li>
            <li> but when I pulled it out of the box I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> very disappointing!</li>
            <li> This is a horrible rack.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Absolutely love this! Getting my third rack right now!</li>
            <li> Nice display. Should have bought a second one for the over flow. It&#x27;s very nice to not have to dig through to find what your looking for. I bought a narrow drawer divider with a lip on it and hung it on the bottom shelf for my tools and nail stickers. My daughter and both granddaughters now have one each.</li>
            <li> Great product, exactly what I thought it would be.  Very satisfied. So easy to find the polish with one quick glance</li>
            <li> This rack looks ok when filled but when I pulled it out of the box I was very disappointed. You can see the glue where it oozed out from all the connecting joints on the shelves and its pretty cheap looking. Once you fill it up it  doesn&#x27;t look so bad, but for the price plus shipping I was imagining something higher quality</li>
            <li> My wife has a beauty salon. we ordered these for that purpose. They seem to really good, and the price was great.</li>
            <li> This polish wall rack was just as I expected and exactly what I needed but I needed 2 because I have sooo many bottles of polish.  They were a great price and I would order them again if I needed more.</li>
            <li> I love the addition to my nail accessories. I have tons of nail polish and really needed something to be able to see/display all the polishes for easy access. This is a great home rack for any bathroom and was pretty easy to install and holds well even when completely full.</li>
            <li> I received this rack on time, but slightly damaged. I contacted the seller and got an immediate response saying I can either return the item or they can refund me a percentage of my purchase price. I liked the rack and the damage did not affect my ability to use it so I opted for the slight refund. They proceeded my request immediately with no hassle. Especially online it can be hard to find good customer service, so I was impressed and would certainly purchase items from them again.</li>
            <li> The title says it all!!! Definite Buy Again Product!! Great Quality Shipment was fast and packaging was great as well</li>
            <li> When I received the nail polish holder, it was already broken and had been super glued previously. As for the holder itself, it is made of hard cheap plastic and does not seem strong enough to hold all of my nail polish and I am actually scared that it will break and create a huge mess. Overall, it is not worth the money I paid for it!</li>
            <li> This was everything I expected and more. I was able to fit about 100 bottles of nail polish and it was very easy to install. I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me for Christmas and I can&#x27;t even express enough how much I love this nail rack!</li>
            <li> Nice product, would use seller again</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is not very good. I have a smaller polish rack where the polish can be moved along the shelf smoothly. Not so for this product - the surface is almost scratchly &amp; the plastic is quite thin. you can do better.</li>
            <li> Love this item.  I am using it as an essential oil and nail polish rack.  It has worked out perfectly; it takes up so little space, I recommend!</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase for me! I hung it in my closet and it holds all my nail polishes along with all my earrings and bracelets. I hang my earrings on the edge of the shelves and my bracelets fit nicely inside the rows.Post earrings I lay inside the shelves which can be seen easily thru the clear plexiglass.. I can see all my polishes to match up with my clothes right there. It takes no space in my small closet and looks so nice! I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> 4 months ago-pleased with shipment and product. Recently: poorer condition and packaged in a horrible fashion. They did not come with the polish center attachment and the edge that holds the polish in, hardly does the job. The edge was higher with the rack I got in December. You can not trust the quality of this product from one order to the next, let alone the same order.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> i was looking for a while for a nail polish shelf/rack. and found this one. love that i didnt have to find a place for it. you just hang it on the wall. dont know how many nail polish it fits but i just love this rack. arrived early. nicely packed, new, no scraches.</li>
            <li> it was black friday and I was trying to finish up, figured it would take a few weeks to deliver, wow came in less than 5.  Product was perfect and my daughter was so excited christmas morning with it...thank you so much for such an easy internet shopping experience.</li>
            <li> Came in perfect condition, easy to hang and fits OPI polish perfectly. \\&quot;Nicole\\&quot; by OPI fits if you turn it sideways. I am VERY pleased with this purchase. Since it is clear, it looks great anywhere. I might get another one someday to organize jewelry &amp; perfume on.</li>
            <li> Holds lots of polishes, feels sturdy, even though it&#x27;s probably for a salon wall, my daughter uses it in her bedroom.</li>
            <li> The quality of the rack is sturdy and the size is perfect. I think I am going to purchase another for my niece.</li>
            <li> I got this knowing it would help me a LOT! I have around a hundred or so bottles of polish, and it fits most of them! the plastic is hard, does not chip, and can be mounted very easily! i still have lots of polish i have to store in a container, but i have a but load of kleancolors, so i put all of them on the rack first, and then all my others second!&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased to have this in my possession!</li>
            <li> LOVED IT, very usefull, now i now where to put all my nailpolish, small, so it doesnt take much space on my wall, but it fits about 100 bottles, so yes it is pretty big</li>
            <li> This item was exactly what I needed. It looked exactly like the picture, exactly like what I imagined. Very easy to mount on the wall and looks very nice.</li>
            <li> This is SO convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First - the seller did great - it got here safe and went up easily.  We put it in studs, so it is well supported.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can hold:&lt;br /&gt;15 bottles of OPI, Claire&#x27;s or similar shape on a shelf or-&lt;br /&gt;17 Pure Ice/Essie&lt;br /&gt;20 Sally Hensen Diamond Strength (sideways)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this rack can hold upto 90 OPI bottles, or 120 Sally H&#x27;s D.S. or more, if you&#x27;re using a thinner bottle like the petites or french manicure bottles...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love all the color on the wall :)</li>
            <li> Okay it is very hard plastic and it does not fit 96 bottles of nail polish instead they ship you two of them which holds about 46 each. Other than it its great I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my niece&#x27;s birthday. She loves doing nails. She she also received a trampoline during her party and I thought well she won&#x27;t get too excited about my gift until maybe later. Boy was I wrong. YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HER FACE when I presented her with this gift. I didn&#x27;t want to give it to her empty because I wanted the WOW effect. So what I did was ask all my friends for some of their unwanted polish and then I went and bought every neon color I could find. I loaded this shelf down with so many different colors. Her and all the cousins were off the trampoline and in her room doing nails as soon as she got this gift. She just told me the other day that all her friends want one like hers and SHE ABSOLUTELY loves it!!!</li>
            <li> The package got here very quick!  I was happy there was no damage, considering what a flimsey plastic thing it is!!</li>
            <li> I love it so much I bought 2 - and I keep recommending this to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;This polish rack is fantastic!  It holds a ridiculous amount of nail polish and the clear finish of the plastic makes it easy to see exactly what each color truly looks like, and allows the rack to be placed on any color wall without clashing.  Adds much more storage space to my house by taking the polish out of my cabinets and placing it out of the way.  Hurray for vertical storage :)&lt;br /&gt;I do wish there was one more taller shelf to allow for taller bottle of polish (like stripers) and it would also be good to have an additional 2 screws at the bottom just for extra security.</li>
            <li> Daughter has so many bottles of nail polish that she needed something to put them on and this was perfect..</li>
            <li> I bought this gift for my girlfriend and she loved it! It held all the bottles of her nail polish well!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my  daughter and it is pretty sturdy. We have moved twice since I bought it and it has survived both moves.</li>
            <li> very nice to display your nail polish</li>
            <li> This item came a few days after I ordered it!! It holds lots of polish, so easy to find the perfect color &amp; looks strong!!!</li>
            <li> My nail polish doesn&#x27;t fill up the whole thing and it also works well for my nail stripers, polish remover, and various art pens, etc. I would definitely recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> bought it for my wife for her makeup room she loves it holds a lot of nail polish</li>
            <li> Good quality and a reasonable price. Very satisfied with the nail polish rack. Totally recommend this product!!!!! Love it a lot.</li>
            <li> It was great for my polishes. I put them up with 2 tacks in the screw holes provided and 2 extra tacks beneath. I will be going to home depot to buy more secure holders though. I have about 100 polishes so this fit the perfect for me... and after seeing how many I have, I may not buy anymore polishes, but this definitely makes it easier to figure out what not to buy</li>
            <li> I love this Nail polish Nails Rack It has made my Nail polish life easier to select any color, the fact that its all acrylic makes it very easy for the eye to catch the color for your nails, very Easy to install I didn&#x27;t even use what It came to avoid big wholes on my wall, I just used regular nails (typically rod-shaped rigid piece of metal) to mount in on my wall. I might have to purchase another one since I have so many nail polish still waiting for a home display &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This nail polish rack fits my nail polishes well. Looks good on the wall. It&#x27;s pretty sturdy and not hard to install.</li>
            <li> I recently received a nail polish desk with a lamp and everything. It was perfect for tools and everything but no nail polish storing. So I went and looked up some racks and they were expensive so I found a spice rack that didn&#x27;t hold that much polish. I found this one for 21.00 and ordered it THE SHIPPING WAS 15.00 more than half of what the rack cost. That&#x27;s my only complaint It came the next day installation was really easy it holds all my polish perfectly looks great above my nail desk. Over all really satisfied!</li>
            <li> This is a good rack!!! (Teehee)&lt;br /&gt;Now as to whether it holds 96 bottles is iffy. It depends on the size of the bottles. But I was able to squeeze quite a few on there. It looks good and very professional, looks good in my room, imho. Sturdy.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I have so many nail polishes I started keeping them in shoes boxes. I love these They hang in my bedroom. It looks like I have a nail salon in my house!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this rack! There is tons of room to fit polish and it looks expensive on the wall. It was so easy to install and came with the right screws &amp; anchors for hanging. If your having trouble hop on Youtube and search up: Nail Polish Rack Installment. Easy as pie!</li>
            <li> also purchased this item as a gift, I will let you all know how that person liked it when they receive it.</li>
            <li> This definitely does what I needed it to do. My husband secured it on studs, so it&#x27;s very stable and sturdy, and holds my bottles prettily. Now, I need to get more nail polish, since what I have only fills up two rows, so they don&#x27;t look so lonely!</li>
            <li> this rack is very strong. I&#x27;ve used ! that looks like it it the past and son of the shelf front bars kept breaking off. It is also great for any decor, and the clear look makes your polish colours show true because there&#x27;s no reflection from the rack. I highly recommend this shelf.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. I had over 80 polishes and they were all kept in a big box along with my other nail art supplies. Every time I wanted to paint my nails I had to dig through this box. Sometimes my nails would be wet from one polish when I realize I needed another color and had to dig through the box with a nail file to find the color I wanted. Now I can just look at all of the polishes in the display, pick what I want to use, use it, and put it back. I love it! Now my box is just for my nail art tools and accessories.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Doesnt fit too many nail polishes but does the job for someone who doesnt have a million bottles.&lt;br /&gt;Looks beautiful when its set up.</li>
            <li> I am using this to hold my essential oils. I love it. Can see every item clearly. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how I lived so long without this rack. It is AMAZING! I love the fact that i can see all my polishes at once and just grab the ones I need without having to lug around my old storage caddy. This is really fun too for when you have friends over and you are doing nails. It was not hard to hang and it is made very well.</li>
            <li> Bought this to free up some drawer space and i love it. Seems pretty sturdy and durable and everyone that sees it loves it.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this item within 3 days of ordering it, but that&#x27;s where the joy ended. This item did NOT live up to my expectations. It is plexi glass-like (expected) and very cheaply put together (NOT expected considering the cost and this is supposed to be a display piece). The front stop on several of the shelves is not properly attached and lean inward or outward, diminishing the space available on the shelf or allowing bottles to fall off the shelf as the case may be.</li>
            <li> I have lots of nail polish, so I mounted this on the wall in my bedroom.  It&#x27;s the best way to keep those little bottles organized and out of the way.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my teenager and she loves it! Very easy to hang on wall, durable, and stylish.</li>
            <li> Gave this nail polish rack to my daughter for a Christmas gift.  She loves it! Thank you for the quick ship.</li>
            <li> 1. The \\&quot;polish station\\&quot; piece is optional which was good because I wasn&#x27;t too into it for my bedroom but it is still cute.&lt;br /&gt;2. The craftmanship isn&#x27;t bad at all you can&#x27;t see glue anywhere (read that in a few reviews), it is not flimsy once it is on your wall. I did have to drill two more holes into the rack for extra support and use different hardware because of where I hung mine but the original hardware should be okay.&lt;br /&gt;3. Depending on your nail polish collection the actual amount it holds will vary.&lt;br /&gt;China Glaze, Finger Paints, Nicole, and OPI you can fit 14 per row&lt;br /&gt;Cult and Essie is 16 per row&lt;br /&gt;Julep and striper polishes is about 30 per row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it I can see most of my polishes right away and will be purchasing a second one very soon.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t to heavy and it hold all of my nail polish i am really happy with the rack! exceeded my expectations</li>
            <li> I love this!  It was more than easy to hang (all you need is a hammer and 2 nails!) and holds/displays nail polish perfectly.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of having all my polish in a basket and not being able to see all the colors I already had. Easy to install !!</li>
            <li> I am a nail technician and have two of these racks.  The price was great and they really hold a lot of polish.  I&#x27;ve owned them for about 4 or 5 years and they still look the same as when I bought them, and they&#x27;ve been moved twice.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend&#x27;s many nail polishes. It holds a lot and then some! I was slightly disappointed with the quality of the rack though. It seems somewhat flimsy but is holding up so far after 4 months.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my e- liquid display.</li>
            <li> This rack really does fit about 96 bottles of nail polish. I didn&#x27;t use the brackets that came with it, but hanging it up with a hammer, level, and pencil was pretty quick and easy. It comes with a removable triangle-shaped sign that says &amp;#34;Polish Station&amp;#34;. I will be ordering a second one so I can expand my nail polish collection.</li>
            <li> The nail polish rack came very fast. It was in perfect condition when it came. I love the nail polish rack , it holds my polished perfectly and is the perfect size.</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend for her birthday and she LOVEEEEEEEEEEEs it. It looks just like one you&#x27;d find in a salon, was easy to put up and looks wonderful. It holds a LOT of nail polish - including the ones I got her plus some she already had. Big enough to be a decent size, but small enough to not be a burden. Perfect. Thank you so much</li>
            <li> I love this rack. It holds all my nail polish nicely so I can see them all. And it hangs on the wall very sturdily.</li>
            <li> great for storage-fast shipping</li>
            <li> I HAVE TWO RACKS THIS RACK THAT JUST CAME IN HAD A SIGN WITH IT LOVE IT. THE OTHER RACK HAS NO SIGN.</li>
            <li> I bought one two years ago. It&#x27;s beautiful and sturdy and worth every penny. Then my boyfriend bought me two this Christmas and NOW THEY ARE CHeap cheap not even acrylic just plastic junk</li>
            <li> Love, love,love this product. Holds all my polishes and so professional looking. I want to buy another for my growing collection of polishes.</li>
            <li> It came early and it has been a great relief for my daughter. Now she has a very organized place for her many nail polish colors.</li>
            <li> I put this up in my bedroom. It is already stocked with all of my nail polish and I am considering purchasing a second one! This is not just for nail salons but a must-have for any nail polish fanatic such as I am! It helps me to keep all of my nail polish organized and easily accessible. I love it! It came in perfect condition with screws. You do have you use a power drill to screw it into the wall but other than that it already comes assembled.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and great packaging. The item is bigger than expected and thats a PLUS for me.</li>
            <li> I love and I recomand</li>
            <li> So nice that I need another one</li>
            <li> I LOVE this nail polish rack :) It holds a ton of nail polishes and is very sturdy. Looks very professional and does its job well. I would recommend buying this, its worth it!</li>
            <li> This product is great. I strongly dislike the cheesy sign that you are supposed to hang above it. When my husband was hanging the shelf up he asked me if we could &amp;#34;Please throw it out.&amp;#34; I agreed. It hangs up easily. I was a little bit afraid of the shelves being unstable since there were not wholes at the bottom of the shelf to attach it to a wall. I was wrong. The screw wholes at the top and the screws provided give it a great amount of stability. For the price, I highly recommend this to anyone with more than a dozen polishes. This helps keep you organized. This has helped me to know what polishes I already have so I am not buying the same colors over again. I do not feel the need to order another shelf. I have over 60 polishes and the bottom row of the shelf is still empty. So, I keep my dotting tools, clippers, and other nail items on it. If you don&#x27;t like the clear shelves, you can always spray point it whatever color you want or hot glue fabric to the back side of the shelf. Buy this! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I am a nail polish addict and this is one of the best organizers I have found! I am thinking of purchasing 2 more since these hold many bottles.</li>
            <li> Finally enough space for all my polish.  I have two.</li>
            <li> This rack is super strong and would go with any room. I personally love the clean look of acrylic, great price as well.</li>
            <li> The bottom had cracks all along it, enough that I would have sent it back however my daughter wanted it hung so badly that I just clear taped it (A LOT) and moved past it.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the rack and it looks really nice hanging on my wall.  It provides good visability of all my nail polish and get it out of my drqwers and is very handy when choosing the color polish I want to use. I would recommend the rack to anyone who needs convient storage and easily viewed nail polish storage.</li>
            <li> This was an excellent way to jazz up my bathroom! It looks nice and hangs easily on the wall. Many people compliment me on it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Very durable and it holds all shapes and size nail polish bottles. My daughter loves it, and it is easy to keep up with her nail polish.  No more bottles laying on the floor.</li>
            <li> I got the nail polish rack, because I have tons of nail polishes, so I needed something to house them all and this worked great!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a stand to hold all of my polish so they are neat and displayed for easy finding. It is sturdy and works great, I just wish you could get it more than just clear.</li>
            <li> Overall this was a good purchase.... The only problem I have with it is the \\&quot;nailpolish\\&quot; sign I think it should be white or black because red doesnt match all rooms</li>
            <li> I am one of the people that review something before I buy it. When it was ship it was all together and intact. My uncle put mine up and its doing great. I might even have to order another one.</li>
            <li> I received my package faster than I expected. It&#x27;s good for the price. I had my boyfriend put it up on my wall and I filled it up quick. So I might need another soon. I didn&#x27;t put the the polish station sign though cause I thought it looked cheesy. Love my product though! Thanks</li>
            <li> This worked like a charm and it not so big that it is an eye sore in the room. It came with anchors screws and a polish station sign(which I didn&#x27;t use but was nice to have)</li>
            <li> The edges are rough and you can see where it was glued together, but if this were to be painted it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> This is a very good investment.  Now all of my polishes are well protected and out of the way.  Thank you Amazon&lt;br /&gt;Fuji!</li>
            <li> Looks like pic, ships fast, packaged well. Comes with mounting screws, but will set on a shelf or table fairly well on its own. It sits on my table against the wall and its hasn&#x27;t fallen over yet.</li>
            <li> This shelving is great for my nail polish. To display the many colors I have on the wall, makes choosing the color for the week a breeze. I just love it !</li>
            <li> I bought awhile ago and have already filled it up. It&#x27;s great because I can organize all my nail colors by shade and easily keep track of my favorite polishes and keep them stocked.</li>
            <li> Came in mail super fast. Love it will be buying more soon!! Its super easy and holds up more then what you think. I can&#x27;t wait to open a salon up and get more of theses.</li>
            <li> Seriously?  If you have a nailpolish addiction and a free wall on which to hang this, you need this nail polish rack.  I can&#x27;t believe I subsisted on a drawer for so long.  This thing is amazing.  It doesn&#x27;t have any fancy/crazy branding.  it just holds your nailpolish bottles.  I wish I&#x27;d bought this years ago. They fit odd shaped bottles and it supports a full rack (even if it&#x27;s not drilled into studs).</li>
            <li> Looks really cute in my daughter&#x27;s bedroom!  It&#x27;s really neat for a &amp;#34;tween&amp;#34; to keep all her polish organized!  Definite necessity!</li>
            <li> It is presentable, but the little screws are hard to stick in the wall.</li>
            <li> it kind of looks weak to me, you can also see the cuts of the acrylic being a little bit whiter than the rest of the parts, I hope it makes sense, over all I like it, but I still think it-s a little expensive for what you really get.</li>
            <li> This product was okay but nothing great... when it came it was scratched in a lot of places which was very disapointing. Although I like the look of it on my wall so if you decided to keep this product like myself I would suggest spray painting it. Helps a tun.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with my purchase. I have over 300 bottles of polish. this helped me for work and home.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t put them up yet, I&#x27;m still waiting for an available room just for my nail stuff but I love them so far. They will get all my polishes out of the way &amp; more room for other items I need to find homes for.</li>
            <li> The price is right and it does its job... you dont need the bottom to be screwed into the wall like the top... I was a little worried since it only had holes for the top but it works.. and it doesnt seem to put too much preasure where I would be worried about it falling down from weight. Very nice product.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I can say is that it&#x27;s a little messy looking. You can see the glue where the shelf is glued to the front part of it. Now it&#x27;s just for my daughter&#x27;s room...so ok. I didn;t want to pay the shipping to send it back. If I could&#x27;ve returned to my local store I would have.</li>
            <li> It fits all of my nail polishes great  and it arrived a day before the delivery so great and the nail polish rack it&#x27;s self is acrylic so perfect loving it my room is big so I hang it up in my bath room it looks great:()</li>
            <li> This is a horrible rack. After trying to find one online, Fuji seemed to dominate the larger accommodating racks that can be assembled on the wall. The shipping itself is highway robbery, but I figured this product was going to be good and worth the money to get my polishes standing up and all in one place. The delivery did come as expected and it was a box within a box. When I opened it up, the top \\&quot;Polish Rack\\&quot; sign did not properly line up and the corners of the acrylic were already separating. After further inspection, the entire corner was broken in pieces. I don&#x27;t think I received a new one and actually probably got the remnants of an previous unhappy customer&#x27;s order. I have sent the seller and email to ship it back and return it. Hopefully they have good customer service and will either replace it at no cost or refund everything including the ridiculous shipping.</li>
            <li> The rack is sturdy and I am happy with it, just know that there is no way anything close to 96 bottles will fit in it.  Other than that it is great.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice rack and works very well at the shop. My wife loves it. And it arrived in great shape!</li>
            <li> Nice clear acrylic shelf for my nail polish collection. Bigger than I personally need for polishes, but I use some areas of the rack for other decorative things, like my crystal collection and tiny silk flowers. I have a studio apartment and I appreciate being able to utilize wall space for things that would otherwise take up space in drawers, cabinets etc.</li>
            <li> Decent quality, shipped quickly and packaged well. No problems.</li>
            <li> This is a nice (not fancy) way to put all your nailpolish together and not lumped in a bucket.  It gives a nice display.  It did come with a &amp;#34;Polish station&amp;#34; sign, that I didn&#x27;t attach. ( it doesn&#x27;t show it in the pictures).  Over all I like it, but the installation has to be done carefully, as the plastic seems a bit brittle.  I cracked mine a little when I put it up.  (my advice, hand screw it in, not power like I did)</li>
            <li> I will say this rack looks fine but, it absolutly does not hold 96 bottles of polish. I have less than 60 on it now and only haver room for maybe 10 more. very disappointing!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my nail Polish rack, but I think I need another one :-) I just can&#x27;t stop buy nail Polish, I would definitely buy another one, any discount out there .....:-) mmt.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 of these and had to order 2 more...great way to store and display your polishes.  I will probably be ordering more</li>
            <li> I love this product. It comes with screws to screw into your wall and it looks fabulous. I read a ton of reviews before I decided on thsi product and do not regret my choice.</li>
            <li> I recieved this in excellent condition.  It&#x27;s perfect to hold and organize nail polishes of many sizes and shapes.  I own a lot of different brands and didn&#x27;t have any trouble with any sitting in the space well.  It is a durable hard plastic frame and I was able to hang it up in seconds.  I would definitely recommend this item!</li>
            <li> this is the best thing i could have ever bought for my 16yo daughter and her friends.  no more polishes misplaced. all 96 bottles have their own home. love this rack. easy to install on wall. thumbs up</li>
            <li> I bought it for my granddaughter who has so many nail polishes.&lt;br /&gt;She has it on her wall. She is only 11 years old,but keeps a very orderly room.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to find the polish she wants without digging into the plastic container they&lt;br /&gt;were in before.&lt;br /&gt;It was delivered timely.</li>
            <li> This rack was received in great condition with the holes and proper screws for hanging.  I love it.  I order another one exactly like it and mistakenly order it from another vendor here on Amazon.  It was received cracked and without screws.  Be careful.  Great product and great vendor!</li>
            <li> My daughter got this from me as a gift. Its functional and works fine.  So far, holding up just fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it!  It&#x27;s sturdy plastic and easy to hang.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and in very good condition. Very Sturdy, and holds nail polishes of different sizes. It also came with a cute sign that reads, \\&quot;Polish Station\\&quot;. I am very happy with this purchase, since I got it, I&#x27;ve been buying nail polish left and right! I may need to buy another one! Ideal for a girl of any age who is looking to store her growing nail polish collection. Definately a good purchase :D</li>
            <li> I LOVE this rack so much that i&#x27;m ready to purchase another one and soon! it&#x27;s survived two apartments and it&#x27;s still holding strong! The only thing that I do when hanging it, is placing two nails halfway out the wall underneath the rack. This is not necessary, but it makes me feel better! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE*** I just purchased ANOTHER nail rack! Will be needing a third one soon! The first one that I purchased has survived THREE moves (i&#x27;m a gypsy!) and it&#x27;s still going strong! Definitely a MUST HAVE!!!</li>
            <li> Does what it says its a lot bigger than i tought it was gonna be very sturdy it had some scratches but nothing mayor unless your reallly lookin into detail ... Loved it</li>
            <li> I bought this nail polish shelf mainly to keep my obsession for nail polish under control (first world problems, I know). I had tried a few other nail polish holders before, but most just took too much space or didn&#x27;t hold enough polish. That all being said, this shelf works perfectly! It holds 96 total (I don&#x27;t quite have that many yet, but I have the room if I happen to buy more). I can organize my polish&#x27;s by color (for my ocd tendency) which makes it really easy to pick the colors I need. It also prevents me from buying too similar of a color or the same one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shelf itself can be hung on the wall if you want (I currently just have mine sitting against the  wall behind a door or in my closet so my boyfriend doesn&#x27;t have to see it). The quality was exactly what I had expected. It is clear plastic but very sturdy. Keep in mind this shelf is not a $200 shelf, it is not perfect, but it is well worth the price. I highly recommend this product for anyone who wants to be a bit more organized and doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on a higher quality shelf.</li>
            <li> Everyone that has seen it has loved it as well. Posted a photo on facebook, several people have loved it and asked where I git it. You should havemore orders for this coming soon! Best thing ever!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my personal manicurist.  She just loves it.  Now bottles with colors can be seen much better for selection by her clients.</li>
            <li> my wife loves being able to organize all her polish now. Instead of having to look through a box full.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter and came broken the first time, but the company responded the same day and shipped another one out at no cost to me of what I received a few days later. I am happy with the product and they great customer service!!</li>
            <li> My 16 year old daughter loves this.  We gave it to her for Christmas and it cleaned up her desk which was cluttered with nail polish bottles.  It is sturdy and looks nice in her room.</li>
            <li> The rack was delivered as scheduled, it was packaged well so it was safe upon arrival, and it&#x27;s just overall a great purchase. I can now see all of my nail polish and keep it organized, freeing up some drawer space as well. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> Fits my polishes and looks great mounted next to my manicure station. . . . . . . Good buy.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 7 year old and she loves it.  Keeps all the polish in one place and the polish is good too</li>
            <li> i already had one of these had to come back and buy another one. does what its supposed to, i love it.</li>
            <li> I am so sorry I did not do this sooner. I have been very ill with my diabete but this product so Rocks!  I will send all of my Nail Polish friends and just anyone to Amazon to get this product from you!  I will be making an order for more as well soon too!!  You guys have a very sturdy, reliable and well built rack and I want to say great for the price as well!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pertect, not to big not to small. I didn&#x27;t need the top plaque, and thought I ordered it without it, but at least it wasn&#x27;t attached so I had the option of not using it.</li>
            <li> The product overall, isn&#x27;t that great, nor horrible.  Kind of what I expected.  The shipping, however, is a complete rip off...50% of the cost of the product and not for anything great.  I ordered this product from a different supplier at a fraction of the shipping cost.  Waiting for it to arrive to see the difference.  Also, no instructions on how to mount on the wall.  Being that it is acrylic it would have been nice to see some sort of instructions as not to ruin it in the process.  I&#x27;ve had the rack for a week and a half now and it still sits in the box in which it arrived because I&#x27;m up in the air on whether I&#x27;m going to keep it or not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now nice &amp; organized &amp; can look at my collection all the time since it&#x27;s now displayed on my wall!</li>
            <li> I bought this Item in hopes of it working for displaying my model paints and it works great just need to get a few more</li>
            <li> When I received it I was pleasantly surprised that it looked just like the picture! Easy to mount an holds many bottles...highly recommended. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love this item. I can now see all the nail polish I have and no longer buy the same colors over and over. As soon as I fill this one up I&#x27;m getting another one. So easy to install on my wall.</li>
            <li> It was ship the first day, It&#x27;s so wonderful for all sorts of nail polish bottles. LOVE it s much (:</li>
            <li> This rack is perfect to display our CND Shellac &amp; IBD Just Gel Polish Bottles!  Will definitely buy this rack again!</li>
            <li> Bought the Fuji Brand Nail Polish Wall Rack Display as a gift for my daughters friend.  She absolutely loved it and was actually able to fit over 100 nail polish bottles!  The wall rack is sturdy and since it is clear fit right in with her room decor.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> It got here super quickly. And nothing was wrong with it. Pulled it right out of the box and hung it right up. Used nails instead of screws. Still works perfectly. Perfect size too. I&#x27;ve got about 50 nail polishes on there and it&#x27;s barely half full. Will definitely purchase again if I need another one.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as part of a Christmas gift for my 15-year old daughter.  It was very well protected when shipped and arrived undamaged.  I also ordered the 48 piece rainbow colors glitter nail polish, which has very vibrant colors.  The clear wall rack will allow the vibrant nailpolish to clearly show and definately will provide interest to any wall she chooses to hang it on. Fabulous!</li>
            <li> This was my favorite amazon purchase thusfar!  So useful and so great!  I never enjoyed my nail polishes so much.&lt;br /&gt;Installation was super easy.  Packaging was great, no damages!  LOVE THIS THING!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter and she loves it!!! She put it right on her wall as soon as it arrived. There was no cracks or any other kind of damage. She loves how it displays all of her polishes and she can finally see all the colors that she has. The shipping is great and it took about 4 days. The only down side is that you can see the glue, but once the polishes are up you don&#x27;t even see any of it! Great product!!!</li>
            <li> Now my nail polish is displayed nicely on the wall out of the way and not all clogged up on one of my draws where I can&#x27;t see what colors I have and want to use.  This helps me decide as I can nicely see all the beautiful colors organized and my girls love it and always come and pull a color off the rack and start polishing their nails.</li>
