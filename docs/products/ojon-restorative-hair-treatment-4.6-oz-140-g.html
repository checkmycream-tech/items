            <li>stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>I guess to each his own.</li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s the kind of product your looking for, you should buy it.    </li>
            <li>It also kind of worries me about where the product is coming from.  </li>
            <li>his wife is gorgeous and has a lovely personality.like that.  </li>
            <li>his wife is gorgeous and has a lovely personality.</li>
            <li>This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for de-frizzing naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this on a whim, as I do most of my beauty purchases, but I am thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li>If you have great hair....are used to spending alittle dough on it,  this stuff really is worth it.</li>
            <li>I find that it&#x27;s most effective that way.</li>
            <li>The more popular this product gets the more product they will have to produce, . .</li>
            <li>hair stylists are always amazed at the great condition my hair is in being that i heat treat it so often, and i get comments all the time from friends, family, and just people i encounter about how shiny and pretty my hair looks.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the woodsy, herbally smell - nothing I had to get used to.</li>
            <li>Goodbye to my favorite hair product line.</li>
            <li>Maybe some people will be able to get used to the smell, but I&#x27;m not one of them.</li>
            <li>but I will say it made my kinks smooth as butter while leaving it with a Foxy brown kind of afro.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Okay, my part of the say for this hair treatment.    </li>
            <li>You have to get used to the potent smell.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I like this better for use as a grooming gloss.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>really healthy.</li>
            <li>I think that is an okay product</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments.     </li>
            <li>- I love it.</li>
            <li>But it works better than anything I have ever tried in all my 43 years.</li>
            <li>with my over 2 feet of hair,  i thought i better try it.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m an ex-smoker, love patchouli,or incense, and anything exotic-smelling.</li>
            <li>Gave me more of a greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never looked or felt better.  </li>
            <li>but I really feel that it has been a great help in not letting it get any thinner.</li>
            <li>I agree the scent is exotic</li>
            <li>I am just as pleased with the conditioning benefits.</li>
            <li>I had to wash my hair THREE more times to get the stuff out.     </li>
            <li>My hair is healthy but since I am now coloring it, I thought I would try an oil treatment to keep it that way.  </li>
            <li>You do have to be careful not to use too much because it will leave your hair looking greasy, but when you find that perfect amount - its amazing!</li>
            <li>in all, great for natural styles or afros, to oil scalp or hair, or as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>I admit, I got sucked in watching QVC and with the idea of getting something special from the rain forest, but honestly, if you read the ingredients there is nothing special about this product.  </li>
            <li>I have to admit that the first time I used Ojon the strong smell gave me a headache, but now it doesn&#x27;t give me headaches at all, in fact, I love the burnt chocolate/coffee smell that is has!</li>
            <li>I will use more next time,  as i can see...once per week would be great for it.  </li>
            <li>And what&#x27;s better, when I used the shine serum and straightened it with a straightening comb, it looked like I had a fresh perm, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>it IS strong and does take some getting used to.  </li>
            <li>The smell is fine for me</li>
            <li>If Ojon works for you that&#x27;s great, but this product really is an overpriced hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy, color-treated hair..</li>
            <li>I have medium course fine density hair.  </li>
            <li>My daughter used it (her hair is always beautiful and healthy) and it too is very soft and shiney... Highly recommend...</li>
            <li>The smells is fantastic, like toasted coffee.</li>
            <li>But the results are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It makes it really smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>So, while it may make your hair feel good....if it then causes you to have to get your hair colored more often, it might not be worth it.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, we received a refund.  </li>
            <li>I know this might sound like a Redken review</li>
            <li>I think it will be very useful when my hair is fully grown out</li>
            <li>I scrunch my curl using both hands and towel, then I use a diffuser and a tiny bit of mousse (for curly hair) and the curl is amazing!</li>
            <li>OVER THE PAST 6 MONTHS SEARCHING FOR THE VERY BEST TREATMENT, SHAMPOO, AND CONDITIONER ON THE MARKET.</li>
            <li>I also discovered that it makes my tattoos (yes, tattoos LOL) look very defined and rich, and it makes the skin extremely soft.</li>
            <li>I also use it in between on my dry ends, and it works great.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin on my body, and this oily plant wax softens the skin beautifully and leaves it feeling calm and nourished.</li>
            <li>By the way, the ONLY thing good from John Frieda is Frizz-Ease...</li>
            <li>, IT WOULD HAVE SAVED ME THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AND A CLOSET FULL OF PRODUCTS THAT DON&#x27;T WORK.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it s not bad after all.  </li>
            <li>The smell is somehow peculiar, like coffe, but it is not bad.</li>
            <li>Even before beginning to blow-dry, my hair was SUPER greasy and literally stayed in a bun by itself.</li>
            <li>/&gt;P.S. People with healthy, not-so-damaged, and normal hair do not need to use this stuff.</li>
            <li>After using this product my hair did not seem as oily the next day and my hair seemed very shiny, manageable and most important healthy.</li>
            <li>Now I m happy as I found a way to make my jar last for a long time while getting the most out of the treatment</li>
            <li>Now I use Ojon about once every three weeks and my hair is in such better shape than it was before!</li>
            <li>the newer one kinda smells distinctly of cigarettes which kinda grosses me out</li>
            <li>ITS TOTALLY WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I am going to experiment with jojoba oil since my stylist mentioned it&#x27;s the oil most like that naturally found in your hair.</li>
            <li>(I parted my hair in sections to make sure it was completely saturated)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Redken Fresh Curls Curl Refiner, Redken Ringlet</li>
            <li>The smell does not bother me because it washes right off and after a while you get used to it.      </li>
            <li>I have been trying for over a year to find the right products that would give me</li>
            <li>I have short fine hair with natural nice curls with some friziness.</li>
            <li>I add a teeny touch more Ojon on my ends and a quick massage through just before I blow dry using a cool dryer and straighten using a ceramic ion iron.  </li>
            <li>It smells like a mild coffee which I love but also left my hair</li>
            <li>I treat my hair overnight, wash in the morning, and my hair looks soft, gorgeous and shiny the next day after blow drying.  </li>
            <li>Also, sometimes use it as an instant conditioner (to refresh the scent and conditioning properties)-this combined with a chocolatey based personal scent and great body to hair gets a lot a compliments.</li>
            <li>Not unpleasant but unusual.</li>
            <li>which I could deal with because I have other oils that I&#x27;ve used before that smell the same, but the Restorative hair treatment does have a very strong coffee &amp; shea butter kind of smell.</li>
            <li>i was very cautious about not using too much,  as i have very silky, fine strands...but</li>
            <li>The product is very oily, so USE SPARINGLY when you use it as a gloss or leave in conditioner!</li>
            <li>The first time I ever bleached my hair</li>
            <li>I just used it for the first time</li>
            <li>So, I would suggest for someone wanting to buy it to see if theres a way to get a free sample, I know sephora sometimes offers it as a sample if you order something online</li>
            <li>I have tried many products at different price ranges as well as home remedies and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real miracle!</li>
            <li>Top that off with living in Hawaii prior to that, and between the color, sun, and perm</li>
            <li>I now use a 2 dollar essential oil mix (peanut, castor, olive, almond, wheat germ, and sesame seed oils, as well as vitamin E) as a pre shampoo treatment and it works better than this.</li>
            <li>But once i blew it out,  not only did my usually-fine hair feel fuller,  but i could tangibly see the shine more.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have silky locks after first wash.</li>
            <li>I tried this product for the first time because a friend had recommended it, along with the shampoo and conditioner.      </li>
            <li>I used the restorative hair treatment 2 days in a row along with the conditioner, and I could blow-dry my hair straight because It was so conditioned!</li>
            <li>when i put this on at first</li>
            <li>i&#x27;d be interested to hear if this is happening to anyone</li>
            <li>but i really don&#x27;t think that this product is good on black people&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>In warm temperatures it does melt down but in my opinion it makes it easier to use.</li>
            <li>Now my hair feels even MORE dry than before the treatment.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m devastated to find that the signature scent of this product been changed to something not even note worthy and I&#x27;m more than a little perturbed</li>
            <li>I have a found a seller there that sells the large tub for $20 cheaper than what you buy it at Sephora for.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine blonde hair.</li>
            <li>The price is also very high.  </li>
            <li>I don t use this treatment for deep conditioning because it requires a huge amount...</li>
            <li>IT REALLY DOES WHAT IT CLAIMS TO DO.</li>
            <li>I put a really generous amount on, comb it through and put a plastic cap on, and leave it in for about 5 hours, and my hair is so silky it glows.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the smell much</li>
            <li>and i DID use it very sparingly.</li>
            <li>my hair looks fab!   And feels very silky,  and shiny.  </li>
            <li>but nothing absolutely nothing works for me.)</li>
            <li>I lilked it better as a oil or leave in as opposed to a regular conditioner since it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair as soft once it&#x27;s washed out.</li>
            <li>From the first time I used it, my hair was shiny and very soft.   </li>
            <li>so it really is better than some of the other things you could buy.</li>
            <li>Not horrible or anything, but not exactly yummy either, but it washes out.</li>
            <li>and i end up needing to do an emergency deep conditioning treatment with real products like avlon fiberguard positive links and 5 in 1 which is unbelievably good for our hair and absolutely made for black hair care!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to apply it and put on a deep conditioning cap or sit in the sun, then blow dry or flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I have spent big bucks on pricey conditioners and serums on many occasions and while some things seemed to help a bit, nothing ever made me go \\&quot;WOW!\\&quot; like this stuff!</li>
            <li>I just would have to say it is an okay product but not worth the money.  </li>
            <li>The hot treatment leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>New morning wash it out using Redken Real control Shampoo and Conditioner</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad at all, to me it is sweet and it does not last that long.  </li>
            <li>I wear my hair natural &amp; find that it is TONS better than a lot of other hair products for moisture or \\&quot;greasing\\&quot; your scalp.  </li>
            <li>It is very earthy and natural.  </li>
            <li>The old scent really grew on me</li>
            <li>I love the softness it gives and it does not stay heavy at all.</li>
            <li>but after a few treatments I now LOVE the smell.  </li>
            <li>First, I am caucasian with long, thick, fairly wavy/borderline curly hair that has been colored.  </li>
            <li>Although my hair is the opposite of thick and coarse, it is very fine; I love this product.</li>
            <li>My hair is very damaged and it gets very oily after only a day of not washing it</li>
            <li>, i have a very loud intuition and no offense, but i don&#x27;t believe that hyped out story about him working with and helping the tribe and sustainably taking the palm oil etc etc.</li>
            <li>I have a thin patch right at the top of my head after taking my braids out and that is what prompted me to get the Ojon.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair feel soft, but the smell was just too overpowering!</li>
            <li>At first you cannot even tell anything is different, esp.</li>
            <li>My hair is very kinky and dry, and I still want the straight look while my newgrowth is growing in.</li>
            <li>I can get the same results using pure melted shea butter instead.</li>
            <li>that I was sold a tiny little tub (original tubs were big) with the reassurance from the sales clerk that the original scent was being sold now only in the tiny tubs, only to get home and find that original scent has been changed as well</li>
            <li>A product that can be used for African American hair and baby fine blonde hair?</li>
            <li>I used coconut oil, frequent trims, keratin treatments and NOTHING</li>
            <li>puff, it can&#x27;t be beat as it will feel so soft</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I was in my early 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>soft, bouncy, and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;looks</li>
            <li>True--it does make the hair soft...</li>
            <li>Wow what shine and so soft.</li>
            <li>did NOT bother me,  and is completely gone once you wash it out.  </li>
            <li>It really was no different for me than putting some coconut oil in my hair which I used to do all the time growing up.  </li>
            <li>Try Lush retread conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Yes, my hair is soft.</li>
            <li>My mom gave me the Ojon Restorative Hair Treatment to use over my winter break and after just a few times using Ojon, my hair became smooth and silky again.</li>
            <li>Now I can wear my hair naturally with confidence.  </li>
            <li>As I have a pretty average hair type, if it doesn&#x27;t work for me, I&#x27;m sure it may cause problems for quite a few people.   </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to straighten it with a flat iron.</li>
            <li>i have long, fine, wavy hair which i flat iron about 5 times a week; this product definitely keeps your hair shiny and protected from heat damge and split ends.  </li>
            <li>color only took on the &#x27;new growth&#x27;, not on the rest of my hair - the hair that I had put the Ojon on!  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m seriously not exaggerating and i&#x27;ve tried every combo (leave it on, wash it off, pile it on, use a tiny bit)</li>
            <li>And too much conditioning weighs my hair down much of the time.</li>
            <li>This treatment left my hair softer,now my hair is a big soft frizz ball, it added too much body.</li>
            <li>I am a caucasian woman with long, slightly wavy hair that has been over-colored and frizzes easily in humidity.</li>
            <li>AND  it is very, very, did I say very greasy and very messy to use.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately the smell and oil wont come out of the towel after washing so, make sure to have a towel just for Ojon!    </li>
            <li>I am an African American woman, currently in the process of growing my hair out from a straight perm to natural.</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey but, for me it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend this product for African American Hair.</li>
            <li>I left this on over night and my hair felt amazingly soft after washing it.</li>
            <li>However, soap that can support maggots is kind of frightening.</li>
            <li>I use a bit of the shine serum too--really nasty looking stuff, but works great and does not weigh my hair (which is very fine) down at all.</li>
            <li>2 - 3 days later, my hair ends up being dry and brittle, as i have never seen it before in my whole life, breaking off like crispy crackers</li>
            <li>If you only try it once, I highly recommend it for African American hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and soft, but i little too oily (maybe I used too much).</li>
            <li>my hair smells like my shampoo/conditioner, so i really don&#x27;t understand what the other posts about the smell are trying to say.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because of all the advertised hype and because I have extremely straight coarse asian hair that always seems to be dry on the ends.  </li>
            <li>I mean the smell of coconut is mild compared to this product.</li>

            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING.</li>
            <li> OMG what an amazing change to my hair.</li>
            <li> stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> I guess to each his own.</li>
            <li> If that&#x27;s the kind of product your looking for, you should buy it.    </li>
            <li> It also kind of worries me about where the product is coming from.  </li>
            <li> his wife is gorgeous and has a lovely personality.like that.  </li>
            <li> his wife is gorgeous and has a lovely personality.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for de-frizzing naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim, as I do most of my beauty purchases, but I am thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li> If you have great hair....are used to spending alittle dough on it,  this stuff really is worth it.</li>
            <li> I find that it&#x27;s most effective that way.</li>
            <li> The more popular this product gets the more product they will have to produce, . .</li>
            <li> hair stylists are always amazed at the great condition my hair is in being that i heat treat it so often, and i get comments all the time from friends, family, and just people i encounter about how shiny and pretty my hair looks.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the woodsy, herbally smell - nothing I had to get used to.</li>
            <li> Goodbye to my favorite hair product line.</li>
            <li> Maybe some people will be able to get used to the smell, but I&#x27;m not one of them.</li>
            <li> but I will say it made my kinks smooth as butter while leaving it with a Foxy brown kind of afro.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Okay, my part of the say for this hair treatment.    </li>
            <li> You have to get used to the potent smell.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I like this better for use as a grooming gloss.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> really healthy.</li>
            <li> I think that is an okay product</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments.     </li>
            <li> - I love it.</li>
            <li> But it works better than anything I have ever tried in all my 43 years.</li>
            <li> with my over 2 feet of hair,  i thought i better try it.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m an ex-smoker, love patchouli,or incense, and anything exotic-smelling.</li>
            <li> Gave me more of a greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never looked or felt better.  </li>
            <li> but I really feel that it has been a great help in not letting it get any thinner.</li>
            <li> I agree the scent is exotic</li>
            <li> I am just as pleased with the conditioning benefits.</li>
            <li> I had to wash my hair THREE more times to get the stuff out.     </li>
            <li> My hair is healthy but since I am now coloring it, I thought I would try an oil treatment to keep it that way.  </li>
            <li> You do have to be careful not to use too much because it will leave your hair looking greasy, but when you find that perfect amount - its amazing!</li>
            <li> in all, great for natural styles or afros, to oil scalp or hair, or as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I admit, I got sucked in watching QVC and with the idea of getting something special from the rain forest, but honestly, if you read the ingredients there is nothing special about this product.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit that the first time I used Ojon the strong smell gave me a headache, but now it doesn&#x27;t give me headaches at all, in fact, I love the burnt chocolate/coffee smell that is has!</li>
            <li> I will use more next time,  as i can see...once per week would be great for it.  </li>
            <li> And what&#x27;s better, when I used the shine serum and straightened it with a straightening comb, it looked like I had a fresh perm, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> it IS strong and does take some getting used to.  </li>
            <li> The smell is fine for me</li>
            <li> If Ojon works for you that&#x27;s great, but this product really is an overpriced hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy, color-treated hair..</li>
            <li> I have medium course fine density hair.  </li>
            <li> My daughter used it (her hair is always beautiful and healthy) and it too is very soft and shiney... Highly recommend...</li>
            <li> The smells is fantastic, like toasted coffee.</li>
            <li> But the results are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It makes it really smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> So, while it may make your hair feel good....if it then causes you to have to get your hair colored more often, it might not be worth it.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, we received a refund.  </li>
            <li> I know this might sound like a Redken review</li>
            <li> I think it will be very useful when my hair is fully grown out</li>
            <li> I scrunch my curl using both hands and towel, then I use a diffuser and a tiny bit of mousse (for curly hair) and the curl is amazing!</li>
            <li> OVER THE PAST 6 MONTHS SEARCHING FOR THE VERY BEST TREATMENT, SHAMPOO, AND CONDITIONER ON THE MARKET.</li>
            <li> I also discovered that it makes my tattoos (yes, tattoos LOL) look very defined and rich, and it makes the skin extremely soft.</li>
            <li> I also use it in between on my dry ends, and it works great.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin on my body, and this oily plant wax softens the skin beautifully and leaves it feeling calm and nourished.</li>
            <li> By the way, the ONLY thing good from John Frieda is Frizz-Ease...</li>
            <li> , IT WOULD HAVE SAVED ME THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AND A CLOSET FULL OF PRODUCTS THAT DON&#x27;T WORK.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it s not bad after all.  </li>
            <li> The smell is somehow peculiar, like coffe, but it is not bad.</li>
            <li> Even before beginning to blow-dry, my hair was SUPER greasy and literally stayed in a bun by itself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;P.S. People with healthy, not-so-damaged, and normal hair do not need to use this stuff.</li>
            <li> After using this product my hair did not seem as oily the next day and my hair seemed very shiny, manageable and most important healthy.</li>
            <li> Now I m happy as I found a way to make my jar last for a long time while getting the most out of the treatment</li>
            <li> Now I use Ojon about once every three weeks and my hair is in such better shape than it was before!</li>
            <li> the newer one kinda smells distinctly of cigarettes which kinda grosses me out</li>
            <li> ITS TOTALLY WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li> but well worth it.  </li>
            <li> I am going to experiment with jojoba oil since my stylist mentioned it&#x27;s the oil most like that naturally found in your hair.</li>
            <li> (I parted my hair in sections to make sure it was completely saturated)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Redken Fresh Curls Curl Refiner, Redken Ringlet</li>
            <li> The smell does not bother me because it washes right off and after a while you get used to it.      </li>
            <li> I have been trying for over a year to find the right products that would give me</li>
            <li> I have short fine hair with natural nice curls with some friziness.</li>
            <li> I add a teeny touch more Ojon on my ends and a quick massage through just before I blow dry using a cool dryer and straighten using a ceramic ion iron.  </li>
            <li> It smells like a mild coffee which I love but also left my hair</li>
            <li> I treat my hair overnight, wash in the morning, and my hair looks soft, gorgeous and shiny the next day after blow drying.  </li>
            <li> Also, sometimes use it as an instant conditioner (to refresh the scent and conditioning properties)-this combined with a chocolatey based personal scent and great body to hair gets a lot a compliments.</li>
            <li> Not unpleasant but unusual.</li>
            <li> which I could deal with because I have other oils that I&#x27;ve used before that smell the same, but the Restorative hair treatment does have a very strong coffee &amp; shea butter kind of smell.</li>
            <li> i was very cautious about not using too much,  as i have very silky, fine strands...but</li>
            <li> The product is very oily, so USE SPARINGLY when you use it as a gloss or leave in conditioner!</li>
            <li> The first time I ever bleached my hair</li>
            <li> I just used it for the first time</li>
            <li> So, I would suggest for someone wanting to buy it to see if theres a way to get a free sample, I know sephora sometimes offers it as a sample if you order something online</li>
            <li> I have tried many products at different price ranges as well as home remedies and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real miracle!</li>
            <li> Top that off with living in Hawaii prior to that, and between the color, sun, and perm</li>
            <li> I now use a 2 dollar essential oil mix (peanut, castor, olive, almond, wheat germ, and sesame seed oils, as well as vitamin E) as a pre shampoo treatment and it works better than this.</li>
            <li> But once i blew it out,  not only did my usually-fine hair feel fuller,  but i could tangibly see the shine more.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have silky locks after first wash.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time because a friend had recommended it, along with the shampoo and conditioner.      </li>
            <li> I used the restorative hair treatment 2 days in a row along with the conditioner, and I could blow-dry my hair straight because It was so conditioned!</li>
            <li> when i put this on at first</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d be interested to hear if this is happening to anyone</li>
            <li> but i really don&#x27;t think that this product is good on black people&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> In warm temperatures it does melt down but in my opinion it makes it easier to use.</li>
            <li> Now my hair feels even MORE dry than before the treatment.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m devastated to find that the signature scent of this product been changed to something not even note worthy and I&#x27;m more than a little perturbed</li>
            <li> I have a found a seller there that sells the large tub for $20 cheaper than what you buy it at Sephora for.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine blonde hair.</li>
            <li> The price is also very high.  </li>
            <li> I don t use this treatment for deep conditioning because it requires a huge amount...</li>
            <li> IT REALLY DOES WHAT IT CLAIMS TO DO.</li>
            <li> I put a really generous amount on, comb it through and put a plastic cap on, and leave it in for about 5 hours, and my hair is so silky it glows.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell much</li>
            <li> and i DID use it very sparingly.</li>
            <li> my hair looks fab!   And feels very silky,  and shiny.  </li>
            <li> but nothing absolutely nothing works for me.)</li>
            <li> I lilked it better as a oil or leave in as opposed to a regular conditioner since it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair as soft once it&#x27;s washed out.</li>
            <li> From the first time I used it, my hair was shiny and very soft.   </li>
            <li> so it really is better than some of the other things you could buy.</li>
            <li> Not horrible or anything, but not exactly yummy either, but it washes out.</li>
            <li> and i end up needing to do an emergency deep conditioning treatment with real products like avlon fiberguard positive links and 5 in 1 which is unbelievably good for our hair and absolutely made for black hair care!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to apply it and put on a deep conditioning cap or sit in the sun, then blow dry or flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I have spent big bucks on pricey conditioners and serums on many occasions and while some things seemed to help a bit, nothing ever made me go \\&quot;WOW!\\&quot; like this stuff!</li>
            <li> I just would have to say it is an okay product but not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> The hot treatment leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> New morning wash it out using Redken Real control Shampoo and Conditioner</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad at all, to me it is sweet and it does not last that long.  </li>
            <li> I wear my hair natural &amp; find that it is TONS better than a lot of other hair products for moisture or \\&quot;greasing\\&quot; your scalp.  </li>
            <li> It is very earthy and natural.  </li>
            <li> The old scent really grew on me</li>
            <li> I love the softness it gives and it does not stay heavy at all.</li>
            <li> but after a few treatments I now LOVE the smell.  </li>
            <li> First, I am caucasian with long, thick, fairly wavy/borderline curly hair that has been colored.  </li>
            <li> Although my hair is the opposite of thick and coarse, it is very fine; I love this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is very damaged and it gets very oily after only a day of not washing it</li>
            <li> , i have a very loud intuition and no offense, but i don&#x27;t believe that hyped out story about him working with and helping the tribe and sustainably taking the palm oil etc etc.</li>
            <li> I have a thin patch right at the top of my head after taking my braids out and that is what prompted me to get the Ojon.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair feel soft, but the smell was just too overpowering!</li>
            <li> At first you cannot even tell anything is different, esp.</li>
            <li> My hair is very kinky and dry, and I still want the straight look while my newgrowth is growing in.</li>
            <li> I can get the same results using pure melted shea butter instead.</li>
            <li> that I was sold a tiny little tub (original tubs were big) with the reassurance from the sales clerk that the original scent was being sold now only in the tiny tubs, only to get home and find that original scent has been changed as well</li>
            <li> A product that can be used for African American hair and baby fine blonde hair?</li>
            <li> I used coconut oil, frequent trims, keratin treatments and NOTHING</li>
            <li> puff, it can&#x27;t be beat as it will feel so soft</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I was in my early 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> soft, bouncy, and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;looks</li>
            <li> True--it does make the hair soft...</li>
            <li> Wow what shine and so soft.</li>
            <li> did NOT bother me,  and is completely gone once you wash it out.  </li>
            <li> It really was no different for me than putting some coconut oil in my hair which I used to do all the time growing up.  </li>
            <li> Try Lush retread conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Yes, my hair is soft.</li>
            <li> My mom gave me the Ojon Restorative Hair Treatment to use over my winter break and after just a few times using Ojon, my hair became smooth and silky again.</li>
            <li> Now I can wear my hair naturally with confidence.  </li>
            <li> As I have a pretty average hair type, if it doesn&#x27;t work for me, I&#x27;m sure it may cause problems for quite a few people.   </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to straighten it with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> i have long, fine, wavy hair which i flat iron about 5 times a week; this product definitely keeps your hair shiny and protected from heat damge and split ends.  </li>
            <li> color only took on the &#x27;new growth&#x27;, not on the rest of my hair - the hair that I had put the Ojon on!  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m seriously not exaggerating and i&#x27;ve tried every combo (leave it on, wash it off, pile it on, use a tiny bit)</li>
            <li> And too much conditioning weighs my hair down much of the time.</li>
            <li> This treatment left my hair softer,now my hair is a big soft frizz ball, it added too much body.</li>
            <li> I am a caucasian woman with long, slightly wavy hair that has been over-colored and frizzes easily in humidity.</li>
            <li> AND  it is very, very, did I say very greasy and very messy to use.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the smell and oil wont come out of the towel after washing so, make sure to have a towel just for Ojon!    </li>
            <li> I am an African American woman, currently in the process of growing my hair out from a straight perm to natural.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey but, for me it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend this product for African American Hair.</li>
            <li> I left this on over night and my hair felt amazingly soft after washing it.</li>
            <li> However, soap that can support maggots is kind of frightening.</li>
            <li> I use a bit of the shine serum too--really nasty looking stuff, but works great and does not weigh my hair (which is very fine) down at all.</li>
            <li> 2 - 3 days later, my hair ends up being dry and brittle, as i have never seen it before in my whole life, breaking off like crispy crackers</li>
            <li> If you only try it once, I highly recommend it for African American hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and soft, but i little too oily (maybe I used too much).</li>
            <li> my hair smells like my shampoo/conditioner, so i really don&#x27;t understand what the other posts about the smell are trying to say.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the advertised hype and because I have extremely straight coarse asian hair that always seems to be dry on the ends.  </li>
            <li> I mean the smell of coconut is mild compared to this product.</li>
            <li> I flat iron it daily.</li>
            <li> I color my hair and use a flat iron several times a week</li>
            <li> cuz now i wish they made a perfume of it) and rub it in and the same thing happens to my hands, 2 days later my cuticles are all peeling and the skin on my hands is dry and crackling.  </li>
            <li> Towel dry hair and starting from the back of the head, parting my hair in about 4-6 sections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hair is shoulder length, and I only used the Ojon on the bottom 5 or 6 inches, because that&#x27;s the part that was dry.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, african-american hair that is relaxed (permed straight).</li>
            <li> It did condition my hair well, but I agree that the fragrances (which are added to it, by the way) make the odor very strong and unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> I usually use this product on wet hair (after a shampoo)when blow-drying my hair straight.</li>
            <li> WILL BE USING THIS PRODUCT FOR AS LONG AS THEY MANUFACTURE</li>
            <li> when it&#x27;s over 2 feet long you don&#x27;t HAVE to,  </li>
            <li> And seems to be a product where alittle goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> (I haven&#x27;t used it that long for me to give any difinitive opinion about growth),  </li>
            <li> I would recommend Ojon to anyone with long and or damaged hair.</li>
            <li> naturally curl look that was not frizzy or dried out.  </li>
            <li> my stylist left the bleach on wayy to long and my hair that was down my back broke off up to my shoulders and felt like hay.</li>
            <li> I read the label, and it is not a rare, tropical oil at all, but plain old American palm oil!  </li>
            <li> AFTER i BLOW DRY (I use David Babaii Thikening volcanic ash pdt).</li>
            <li> I also find that it works on the dry patches caused by my echzema while not leaving my skin greasy.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone with dry, color treated, frizzy or out of control hair.  </li>
            <li> after every wash before I blow dry.</li>
            <li> the shampoo in my opinion seems to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> so it was so so dry.  </li>
            <li> Bought this because my hair is dry from being dyed.  </li>
            <li> Anyone&#x27;s hair turning out AS DRY</li>
            <li> I bet in the last few months I have treid 30 different kinds of things,</li>
            <li> only down side is that Ojon smells like cigarettes and chocolate to me.</li>
            <li> I have the typical mink brown lowlights,  with chunky, white bleached streaks thru-out.</li>
            <li> I have VERY dry frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It is a little costly, but the amount that you use it will last for 5 years or maore</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE, ESPECIALLY THE LARGE SIZE.</li>
            <li> SInce it&#x27;s not a cream it did not make my hair look wet &amp; wavy but for a comb out or afro</li>
            <li> I also got the shampoo and conditioner once I started brushing my wet hair</li>
            <li> when your hair is still wet.  </li>
            <li> so technically it should have still felt oily and limp.  </li>
            <li> False advertising really bothers me.  </li>
            <li> I am black with mixed grade hair (it&#x27;s not kinky but has tight curls).  </li>
            <li> This product is only for heavy duty damage!</li>
            <li> however tends to last a while because the small amount that you use turns into an oil when you rub it into your hands.</li>
            <li> I will never buy anything other than Ojon again.  </li>
            <li> I used this product with caution because I had read the other reviews that said it washes your color out.  </li>
            <li> our hair needs extreme moisture and ojon products ROB my hair of every ounce of moisture about 2 days after treatment.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just not possible to sell on QVC and be small potatoes like that.  </li>
            <li> so I always have to shampoo everyday and consequently blow dry.</li>
            <li> But seriously, if you need MAJOR repair for your hair, CUT the damage off and use this every week as instructed.  </li>
            <li> it was always close to my desired look but never right.  </li>
            <li> believe me when i say, i&#x27;m really quite sad that it&#x27;s not working for me because i had no buyers remorse regarding price whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, bleach blonde hair and</li>
            <li> either you love it or hate it.</li>
            <li> but I put A Small Amount on my hair after I dhsmpoo and towel dry, AND SOME</li>
            <li> I bought this through QVC, with the shipping and tax and all, came out to over $50.00 and not worth half of that amount.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t smell after about a half hour.</li>
            <li> And it seems to have stripped out some product,  as my color looks truer, and less brassy.</li>
            <li> I plan on buying the shampoo, conditioner, and styling cream (it has been recommended for me since I have long, wavy, thick hair).</li>
            <li> The smell may take a little getting used to -</li>
            <li> Granted, the smell does take a little getting used to, but you shampoo it out.  </li>
            <li> (mine does not have the little beads in it like the sample i was given had)or</li>
            <li> Its does make hair softer and healthier but for me, its making it too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing its the oil that gets left behind after you wash it off.  </li>
            <li> If anything, the strands feel a bit tacky,  and limp.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed the ease of application, but the smell is HORRIBLE, as some other reviewers have said.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the smell, which does linger after you&#x27;ve dried and styled your hair.  </li>
            <li> not sure how it would work on straigher hair types</li>
            <li> usual restyling.</li>
            <li> so I ordered a small sized tub from Sephora.  </li>
            <li> But blown-dry, it feels thicker/fuller...and glossier than usual.</li>
            <li> In the process, it removed some of the color from my hair, even though I waited well past the recommended amount of time.    </li>
            <li> I usually sleep with it in, then wash it out in the morning.</li>
            <li> my intuition says this guy is just a marketing guy, i mean does he even have a cosmo license???  </li>
            <li> my intuition says this guy is just a marketing guy, i mean does he even have a cosmo license???  </li>
            <li> i mean seriously...</li>
            <li> (at first i hated the smell</li>
            <li> I started college this year and because of my dorm&#x27;s terrible softened water and the dry air that I wasn&#x27;t exposed to at my home, my hair turned into a dry, frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some seriously conflicting reports about sustainability issues.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some seriously conflicting reports about sustainability issues.  </li>
            <li> my hair was getting a little sad.</li>
            <li> but it is just complete trash, just sitting there $45 dollars worthless tub of yummy smelling nothing.  </li>
            <li> Also even worse it is very hard to wash out because it is an oil  not a cream.  </li>
            <li> am a perpetual hair dyer and last year had a perm that I then straightened because I hated it.  </li>
            <li> Because if you do, you&#x27;ll get silly comments from a tree-hugger that has nothing to do with the product.</li>
            <li> The smell--well, it does smell a bit weird.</li>
            <li> and I maybe wrong</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too expensive a risk.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so weird</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s crazy.</li>
            <li> call it the \\&quot;dirty hippy hair stuff\\&quot; since it smells like incense.</li>
            <li> and now i&#x27;m afraid to use any of this product anymore.    </li>
            <li> I bought this stuff from the Shopping Channel, and thought it wasn&#x27;t bad, until I went to get my hair colored.  </li>
            <li> It smells bad</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know if i just got a bad batch, a tub of the \\&quot;old\\&quot; formula</li>
            <li> :((  </li>
            <li> &#x3D;/ Blowdrying</li>
            <li> smell of the oil, the shampoo, or the conditioner didn&#x27;t bother me, but the HAIR SPRAY was disgusting.</li>
            <li> Hi, I bought this from QVC and I couldn&#x27;t believe how awful smelling it was...</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have short fine hair with natural nice curls with some friziness. I don t use this treatment for deep conditioning because it requires a huge amount...but I put A Small Amount on my hair after I dhsmpoo and towel dry, AND SOME AFTER i BLOW DRY (I use David Babaii Thikening volcanic ash pdt). MY HAIR LOOKS AMAZING, shiny,smooth and well hydrated. Yes..there is a smell, but it goes away after an hour or so and it s not bad after all.  Now I m happy as I found a way to make my jar last for a long time while getting the most out of the treatment</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff from the Shopping Channel, and thought it wasn&#x27;t bad, until I went to get my hair colored.  &lt;br /&gt;The color didn&#x27;t take! &lt;br /&gt;My hair is shoulder length, and I only used the Ojon on the bottom 5 or 6 inches, because that&#x27;s the part that was dry.  &lt;br /&gt;The color only took on the &#x27;new growth&#x27;, not on the rest of my hair - the hair that I had put the Ojon on!  &lt;br /&gt;The smell of the oil, the shampoo, or the conditioner didn&#x27;t bother me, but the HAIR SPRAY was disgusting. People remarked that I had overdosed on perfume, so I had to wash it again to get the rotten smell out of my hair. &lt;br /&gt;I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone who colors their hair.</li>
            <li> Lovely product &amp; leaves hair in a great condition.  Not sure about the smell, which does linger after you&#x27;ve dried and styled your hair.  Not unpleasant but unusual.</li>
            <li> Although my hair is the opposite of thick and coarse, it is very fine; I love this product. I also use it in between on my dry ends, and it works great. I absolutely LOVE the woodsy, herbally smell - nothing I had to get used to. I also discovered that it makes my tattoos (yes, tattoos LOL) look very defined and rich, and it makes the skin extremely soft. I have very dry skin on my body, and this oily plant wax softens the skin beautifully and leaves it feeling calm and nourished. My husband loves the smell as well and buries his nose in my hair after the treatment... :0)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m devastated to find that the signature scent of this product been changed to something not even note worthy and I&#x27;m more than a little perturbed that I was sold a tiny little tub (original tubs were big) with the reassurance from the sales clerk that the original scent was being sold now only in the tiny tubs, only to get home and find that original scent has been changed as well :((  Goodbye to my favorite hair product line. I miss you already.</li>
            <li> Hi, I bought this from QVC and I couldn&#x27;t believe how awful smelling it was... kind of like burnt coffee and smoke covered with a perfume - aack! It made my hair feel soft, but the smell was just too overpowering! I can get the same results using pure melted shea butter instead. Maybe some people will be able to get used to the smell, but I&#x27;m not one of them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the people who gave 1 or 2 star reviews but this product is the ONLY thing that saved my hair. I did everything from getting a curly perm to stripping the color. I used coconut oil, frequent trims, keratin treatments and NOTHING worked. My hair still kept breaking and splitting like clockwork. When I used the product, 3 treatments later and it&#x27;s never been healthier. The product is very oily, so USE SPARINGLY when you use it as a gloss or leave in conditioner! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;P.S. People with healthy, not-so-damaged, and normal hair do not need to use this stuff. Because if you do, you&#x27;ll get silly comments from a tree-hugger that has nothing to do with the product. This product is only for heavy duty damage! By the way, the ONLY thing good from John Frieda is Frizz-Ease...</li>
            <li> Whatever kind of nut they use in this product is wonderful. It smells like a mild coffee which I love but also left my hair the softest it has been in a while. That&#x27;s saying a lot because I&#x27;m forever searching for the perfect conditioner. It is pricey however tends to last a while because the small amount that you use turns into an oil when you rub it into your hands. I also find that it works on the dry patches caused by my echzema while not leaving my skin greasy. I wear my hair natural &amp; find that it is TONS better than a lot of other hair products for moisture or \\&quot;greasing\\&quot; your scalp.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how it would work on straigher hair types but I will say it made my kinks smooth as butter while leaving it with a Foxy brown kind of afro. SInce it&#x27;s not a cream it did not make my hair look wet &amp; wavy but for a comb out or afro puff, it can&#x27;t be beat as it will feel so soft it&#x27;s crazy. I lilked it better as a oil or leave in as opposed to a regular conditioner since it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair as soft once it&#x27;s washed out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;All in all, great for natural styles or afros, to oil scalp or hair, or as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. The ojon smells like coffee to me which is a good thing. I can&#x27;t understand how some people say this smells like cigarettes. I have never smoked in my life and can&#x27;t stand the smell of cigarettes, yet I think this product smells wonderful! I guess to each his own. I like the fact that this product melts with your body heat and you need just the smallest amount to see an improvement.</li>
            <li> Okay, my part of the say for this hair treatment.    1) Its does make hair softer and healthier but for me, its making it too heavy.  I&#x27;m guessing its the oil that gets left behind after you wash it off.  If that&#x27;s the kind of product your looking for, you should buy it.    2) You have to get used to the potent smell.  The fact that you have to sleep with this in your hair, I wasn&#x27;t too happy with the smell in my dreams.    3) Sacrifice a hair towel.  Unfortunately the smell and oil wont come out of the towel after washing so, make sure to have a towel just for Ojon!    4) But seriously, if you need MAJOR repair for your hair, CUT the damage off and use this every week as instructed.  It will WORK!</li>
            <li> I have baby fine blonde hair. Love this stuff. The smell is fine for me but I have to use it when my husband is not around as he can&#x27;t stand the smell. I love the softness it gives and it does not stay heavy at all. A product that can be used for African American hair and baby fine blonde hair? Awsome!</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff for your hair. It is a little costly, but the amount that you use it will last for 5 years or maore so it really is better than some of the other things you could buy. One the up side QVC Shopping net work has it for 42.50 for the same amount. The shampoo and cond. is $ 34.15 for both even with shipping you are way ahead. The smells is fantastic, like toasted coffee. I treid it the minute it got here and I am still in shock. The shine no frizzies the softness is unmatched anywhere I have treid. I bet in the last few months I have treid 30 different kinds of things, well this is it I am not ever going to use anything else.</li>
            <li> I have VERY dry frizzy hair.This treatment left my hair softer,now my hair is a big soft frizz ball, it added too much body.I like this better for use as a grooming gloss.</li>
            <li> I read the label, and it is not a rare, tropical oil at all, but plain old American palm oil!  False advertising really bothers me.  It did condition my hair well, but I agree that the fragrances (which are added to it, by the way) make the odor very strong and unpleasant.  The price is also very high.  I will not order this again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  The smell may take a little getting used to - but after a few treatments I now LOVE the smell.  It is very earthy and natural.  But the results are what will get you hooked.  I treat my hair overnight, wash in the morning, and my hair looks soft, gorgeous and shiny the next day after blow drying.  At the end of the day, if my hair gets frizzy and out of control, I put just a tiny bit of this stuff in my hands and comb it through.  My hair looks gorgeous again like I just finished blow drying.  I recommend this product to anyone with dry, color treated, frizzy or out of control hair.  It makes your hair look beautiful!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! I have thick, bleach blonde hair and this stuff works wonders! The first time I ever bleached my hair my stylist left the bleach on wayy to long and my hair that was down my back broke off up to my shoulders and felt like hay. I left this on over night and my hair felt amazingly soft after washing it. It even helped with the fizziness! The old scent really grew on me and I miss it, I could literally slather that stuff on as a lotion, how much I loved the smell! the newer one kinda smells distinctly of cigarettes which kinda grosses me out but the product is still good.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING. I NEVER HAD ANYTHING LIKE THIS PRODUCT BEFORE, EVER. IT REALLY DOES WHAT IT CLAIMS TO DO. MY SEARCH IS FINALLY OVER AFTER SPENDING OVER $3,000. OVER THE PAST 6 MONTHS SEARCHING FOR THE VERY BEST TREATMENT, SHAMPOO, AND CONDITIONER ON THE MARKET. TODAY.... I FINALLY FOUND IT. ITS OJON RESTORATIVE HAIR TREATMENT, RESTORATIVE SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER.&lt;br /&gt;ITS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE, ESPECIALLY THE LARGE SIZE. ITS TOTALLY WORTH THE MONEY. MY DRY-DAMAGED, COLOR TREATED BROKEN-OFF HAIR WILL FINALLY GET THE HELP IT  NEEDS. I WISH I WOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT IT BEFORE, IT WOULD HAVE SAVED ME THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AND A CLOSET FULL OF PRODUCTS THAT DON&#x27;T WORK.&lt;br /&gt;I WILL BE USING THIS PRODUCT FOR AS LONG AS THEY MANUFACTURE IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I REFUSE TO LIVE WITHOUT IT!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I used this stuff as directed and boy did it make my&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hair soft and shiny. My hair has not looked like this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;since I was in my early 20&#x27;s.  It is soft, bouncy, and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;looks really healthy. What&#x27;s more, it looked great the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;next morning with just a comb run through it instead of&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my usual restyling. The smell takes some getting used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to but after shampooing, it did not linger.  I highly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I just used it for the first time and I have only used as a leave-in oil. The smell is somehow peculiar, like coffe, but it is not bad. My friends said I smell like I&#x27;ve come from the HairDresser. My hair is shiny and soft, but i little too oily (maybe I used too much). I think that is an okay product and you should not avoid buying it because of the smell, which is nothing.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for de-frizzing naturally curly hair. My hair has about a medium wave to it. I use ojon rest. trmt. after every wash before I blow dry. I scrunch my curl using both hands and towel, then I use a diffuser and a tiny bit of mousse (for curly hair) and the curl is amazing! My hair goes from a medium wave to approx 1 inch barrel curls. I get so many compliments.     I&#x27;ve read some reviews that they don&#x27;t like the smell - I love it. It has a chocolatey/nutty smell. But I don&#x27;t smell after about a half hour. You do have to be careful not to use too much because it will leave your hair looking greasy, but when you find that perfect amount - its amazing!</li>
            <li> My hair is very damaged and it gets very oily after only a day of not washing it so I always have to shampoo everyday and consequently blow dry. After using this product my hair did not seem as oily the next day and my hair seemed very shiny, manageable and most important healthy. The smell does not bother me because it washes right off and after a while you get used to it.      I think that there is nothing out there that will work for everyone and thats why this product is either you love it or hate it. So, I would suggest for someone wanting to buy it to see if theres a way to get a free sample, I know sephora sometimes offers it as a sample if you order something online and I think Ulta does too. Thats how I tried it and it worked great on my hair. I have tried many products at different price ranges as well as home remedies and this product has given me the best results. But, I bought the shampoo and conditioner to use with it as well as styling products so that could be why it worked so well for me. It is a little pricey but, for me it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this through QVC, with the shipping and tax and all, came out to over $50.00 and not worth half of that amount. True--it does make the hair soft...but that&#x27;s all--I did not like it--I found that it made my hair unmanageable rather than manageable. AND  it is very, very, did I say very greasy and very messy to use.  Also even worse it is very hard to wash out because it is an oil  not a cream.  I had to wash my hair over and over to get this garbage out.  Yes it is garbage and I returned it to QVC   Do not buy this.  Want a good conditioner--I recommend anything by John Frieda</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim, as I do most of my beauty purchases, but I am thrilled with the results.  Granted, the smell does take a little getting used to, but you shampoo it out.  I&#x27;ve used this as a shine enhancer and leave-in conditioner and the smell fades.  I&#x27;ve had no problems.  But the results are fantastic.  My hair is softer than ever, even after coloring, and I get tons of compliments. I plan on buying the shampoo, conditioner, and styling cream (it has been recommended for me since I have long, wavy, thick hair). &lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind the smell, I highly recommend this!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, african-american hair that is relaxed (permed straight). I usually use this product on wet hair (after a shampoo)when blow-drying my hair straight. It makes it really smooth and shiny. I have received a lot of compliments on my hair since I have started using it. In warm temperatures it does melt down but in my opinion it makes it easier to use. When it is a solid you are supposed to rub it in the palm of your hands to liquify it and then put it in your hair. It does have a smokey scent to it but no one pays attention to that...they are looking at how great my hair is. I love Ojon&#x27;s conditioner (it is the very best I have ever used)but the shampoo in my opinion seems to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I am a caucasian woman with long, slightly wavy hair that has been over-colored and frizzes easily in humidity. I flat iron it daily. I started using this stuff about 3 weeks ago, and I am completely thrilled with it! I have spent big bucks on pricey conditioners and serums on many occasions and while some things seemed to help a bit, nothing ever made me go \\&quot;WOW!\\&quot; like this stuff! It&#x27;s a real miracle! I put a really generous amount on, comb it through and put a plastic cap on, and leave it in for about 5 hours, and my hair is so silky it glows. I use a bit of the shine serum too--really nasty looking stuff, but works great and does not weigh my hair (which is very fine) down at all. The smell--well, it does smell a bit weird. Not horrible or anything, but not exactly yummy either, but it washes out. The price is killing me, though. But it works better than anything I have ever tried in all my 43 years.</li>
            <li> After seeing this in a magazine, I decided I had to try it so I ordered a small sized tub from Sephora.  OMG what an amazing change to my hair. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am a perpetual hair dyer and last year had a perm that I then straightened because I hated it.  Top that off with living in Hawaii prior to that, and between the color, sun, and perm my hair was getting a little sad. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing. From the first time I used it, my hair was shiny and very soft.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I call it the \\&quot;dirty hippy hair stuff\\&quot; since it smells like incense. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want to pay the Sephora or QVC prices, buy it on ebay.  I have a found a seller there that sells the large tub for $20 cheaper than what you buy it at Sephora for.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to try Ojon Restorative Treatment and I finally bought it.  My hair has never looked or felt so good in years.  I color my hair and use a flat iron several times a week so it was so so dry.  I put it on last night left it in overnight.  I also got the shampoo and conditioner once I started brushing my wet hair I could tell that this stuff is good.  I will never buy anything other than Ojon again.  Truely it is the best.</li>
            <li> This restorative treatment is really good. I think it works well...I don&#x27;t like the smell much but I got over it, now that I am done with the container I am going back to my organic coconut oil, I get the same results from coconut oil, it&#x27;s inexpensive and the best part? It doesn&#x27;t SMELL! I mean the smell of coconut is mild compared to this product. I noticed the coffee type smell in my hair even after shampooing twice each time I washed my hair. I&#x27;m going back to the East Indian way of applying warmed coconut oil overnight and washing it off in the morning. It&#x27;s SO much better!!!!!!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using ojon for a year or so, and my hair has never been healthier.  i have long, fine, wavy hair which i flat iron about 5 times a week; this product definitely keeps your hair shiny and protected from heat damge and split ends.  hair stylists are always amazed at the great condition my hair is in being that i heat treat it so often, and i get comments all the time from friends, family, and just people i encounter about how shiny and pretty my hair looks.  the smell is distinctive (not offensive in my opinion), but you wash the product out out!  my hair smells like my shampoo/conditioner, so i really don&#x27;t understand what the other posts about the smell are trying to say.  i definitely reccomend this product and do so often.</li>
            <li> I admit, I got sucked in watching QVC and with the idea of getting something special from the rain forest, but honestly, if you read the ingredients there is nothing special about this product.  I now use a 2 dollar essential oil mix (peanut, castor, olive, almond, wheat germ, and sesame seed oils, as well as vitamin E) as a pre shampoo treatment and it works better than this. (Can be found at Sally&#x27;s, walgreens, and even walmart) If Ojon works for you that&#x27;s great, but this product really is an overpriced hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li> Bought this because my hair is dry from being dyed.  Wow what shine and so soft. This is amazing stuff. My daughter used it (her hair is always beautiful and healthy) and it too is very soft and shiney... Highly recommend...</li>
            <li> For as expensive as this stuff is,  and for as many places i&#x27;ve read about it....with my over 2 feet of hair,  i thought i better try it. Rumour had it when Demi Moore had waist-length hair,  this treatment is what she used to get those silky locks.  So i HAD to give it a whirl,  regardless of price.  I&#x27;ve only used it once....so keep in mind...i was very cautious about not using too much,  as i have very silky, fine strands...but ALOT of them.  And too much conditioning weighs my hair down much of the time. Not this stuff.  OK,,,firstly,  the smell is legandary,  but i&#x27;m an ex-smoker, love patchouli,or incense, and anything exotic-smelling. So the signature smell,  did NOT bother me,  and is completely gone once you wash it out.  At first you cannot even tell anything is different, esp. when your hair is still wet.  If anything, the strands feel a bit tacky,  and limp.  But once i blew it out,  not only did my usually-fine hair feel fuller,  but i could tangibly see the shine more. Admittedly,  i had not washed my hair in 5 days.....when it&#x27;s over 2 feet long you don&#x27;t HAVE to,  so technically it should have still felt oily and limp.  Not with this stuff...and i DID use it very sparingly. I will use more next time,  as i can see...once per week would be great for it.  But blown-dry, it feels thicker/fuller...and glossier than usual. And it seems to have stripped out some product,  as my color looks truer, and less brassy. I have the typical mink brown lowlights,  with chunky, white bleached streaks thru-out. If i must say so myself.....my hair looks fab!   And feels very silky,  and shiny.  If you have great hair....are used to spending alittle dough on it,  this stuff really is worth it. And seems to be a product where alittle goes a long way.  Def. try it girls....i mean seriously...what deep conditioning treatment actually THICKENS hair whilst glossing it way out?  Nuthin&#x27; i&#x27;ve ever shelled-out a lot of money on.....i like the stuff,  and will continue to use itonce a week.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the advertised hype and because I have extremely straight coarse asian hair that always seems to be dry on the ends.  I was brought up on Guam and am a Filipino so the tropical smell did not bother me but be forwarned for those of you not used to this smell it IS strong and does take some getting used to.  It did make my hair shiny but I don&#x27;t feel that it conditioned it all that well.  Gave me more of a greasy feeling.  It really was no different for me than putting some coconut oil in my hair which I used to do all the time growing up.  If I knew that this was just like that I would have not paid the outragous price that they were asking for.  It also kind of worries me about where the product is coming from.  I just hope and pray that the Ojon tribe is not so affected by the commercialization of this product.  I can&#x27;t imagine that they are not.  The more popular this product gets the more product they will have to produce, . . and I maybe wrong but what would a indian tribe that lives off the land do with a portion of the profits made from selling this?  I just would have to say it is an okay product but not worth the money.  Try Lush retread conditioner.  It works WONDERS.  It smells bad but well worth it.  You&#x27;ll have silky locks after first wash.</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad at all, to me it is sweet and it does not last that long.  I use it as a deep conditioner every two weeks, leaving it in overnight. I shampoo it out, leave the conditioner in for about 5 minutes, rinse out.  I add a teeny touch more Ojon on my ends and a quick massage through just before I blow dry using a cool dryer and straighten using a ceramic ion iron.  My hair has never looked or felt better.  I have a thin patch right at the top of my head after taking my braids out and that is what prompted me to get the Ojon.  While I am not saying that it is growing my hair back (I haven&#x27;t used it that long for me to give any difinitive opinion about growth),  but I really feel that it has been a great help in not letting it get any thinner. My hair no longer sheds like I am molting.  If you only try it once, I highly recommend it for African American hair.</li>
            <li> I agree the scent is exotic and I abolutely love it! Yes, as another reviewer described the scent resembles roasted coffee, chocolate, shea butter with a bit of another smoky scent.  I am just as pleased with the conditioning benefits. I wish this was offered as an auto shipment! I would definitely sign-up! It&#x27;s great to apply it and put on a deep conditioning cap or sit in the sun, then blow dry or flat iron.  Also, sometimes use it as an instant conditioner (to refresh the scent and conditioning properties)-this combined with a chocolatey based personal scent and great body to hair gets a lot a compliments.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time because a friend had recommended it, along with the shampoo and conditioner.      It stated to not use 5 days before or after you color your hair...so I waited two weeks.    I have fine, wavy, color-treated hair..but lots of it, so I thought this would be a good conditioning treatment.   I enjoyed the ease of application, but the smell is HORRIBLE, as some other reviewers have said. Similar to burnt coffee. And the smell lingers even after washing it out.    I used the treatment for about 25 minutes, then washed it out. Even before beginning to blow-dry, my hair was SUPER greasy and literally stayed in a bun by itself. &#x3D;/ Blowdrying it didn&#x27;t help. I had to wash my hair THREE more times to get the stuff out.     In the process, it removed some of the color from my hair, even though I waited well past the recommended amount of time.    Now my hair feels even MORE dry than before the treatment.   As I have a pretty average hair type, if it doesn&#x27;t work for me, I&#x27;m sure it may cause problems for quite a few people.   Would not recommend, or use again.</li>
            <li> First, I am caucasian with long, thick, fairly wavy/borderline curly hair that has been colored.  My hair is healthy but since I am now coloring it, I thought I would try an oil treatment to keep it that way.  I used this product with caution because I had read the other reviews that said it washes your color out.  So, after applying the product and leaving it in my hair for 45 minutes, I washed my hair out in the sink and I could literally see my hair color coming out in the water (I use Loreal Color Vitamino shampoo that my colorist gave me).  The Ojon packaging notes to *not* use this product within 5 days of chemically treating your hair, so I waited a couple of weeks and several washes before using it.  Yes, my hair is soft. Yes, the earthy/smoky smell is still in my hair after washing it with shampoo and conditioner (it smells like a pipe, not like cigarettes).  And yes, my hair is definitely *lighter* in color than it was before I used this product.    So, while it may make your hair feel good....if it then causes you to have to get your hair colored more often, it might not be worth it.  I am going to experiment with jojoba oil since my stylist mentioned it&#x27;s the oil most like that naturally found in your hair.</li>
            <li> My sister gave me the shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and the giant brown chocolatey ball for my birthday.     This product works great.    However, be cautious of how you keep it.  After a month of having it, I found maggots all over the ball of soap and now i&#x27;m afraid to use any of this product anymore.    It&#x27;s too expensive a risk.  Fortunately, we received a refund.  However, soap that can support maggots is kind of frightening.</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman, currently in the process of growing my hair out from a straight perm to natural. My hair is very kinky and dry, and I still want the straight look while my newgrowth is growing in. I used the restorative hair treatment 2 days in a row along with the conditioner, and I could blow-dry my hair straight because It was so conditioned! And what&#x27;s better, when I used the shine serum and straightened it with a straightening comb, it looked like I had a fresh perm, shiny and healthy. I think it will be very useful when my hair is fully grown out and I&#x27;m ready to straighten it with a flat iron. As for the smell, the shampoo, conditioner, and shine serum all smell like shea butter....which I could deal with because I have other oils that I&#x27;ve used before that smell the same, but the Restorative hair treatment does have a very strong coffee &amp; shea butter kind of smell. I personally wouldnt want to walk around smelling like that, so I shampoo it out before I leave the house. The end result smells like shea butter or something. I highly reccommend this product for African American Hair.</li>
            <li> I started college this year and because of my dorm&#x27;s terrible softened water and the dry air that I wasn&#x27;t exposed to at my home, my hair turned into a dry, frizzy mess. I came home at Christmas and had to have a foot taken off the bottom of my hair! (it needed a trimming anyway...but still) I still had two feet of damaged hair left. My mom gave me the Ojon Restorative Hair Treatment to use over my winter break and after just a few times using Ojon, my hair became smooth and silky again. Now I use Ojon about once every three weeks and my hair is in such better shape than it was before! When I use Ojon I usually sleep with it in, then wash it out in the morning. I find that it&#x27;s most effective that way. I have to admit that the first time I used Ojon the strong smell gave me a headache, but now it doesn&#x27;t give me headaches at all, in fact, I love the burnt chocolate/coffee smell that is has! I would recommend Ojon to anyone with long and or damaged hair. It is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Anyone&#x27;s hair turning out AS DRY AS THE DESERT about 2 - 3 days after using this?  I have medium course fine density hair.  when i put this on at first it&#x27;s good but 2 - 3 days later, my hair ends up being dry and brittle, as i have never seen it before in my whole life, breaking off like crispy crackers and i end up needing to do an emergency deep conditioning treatment with real products like avlon fiberguard positive links and 5 in 1 which is unbelievably good for our hair and absolutely made for black hair care!  sometimes i put the ojon on my hands (at first i hated the smell but i don&#x27;t know what happened cuz now i wish they made a perfume of it) and rub it in and the same thing happens to my hands, 2 days later my cuticles are all peeling and the skin on my hands is dry and crackling.  i&#x27;m seriously not exaggerating and i&#x27;ve tried every combo (leave it on, wash it off, pile it on, use a tiny bit) but nothing absolutely nothing works for me.) it&#x27;s so weird but i really don&#x27;t think that this product is good on black people&#x27;s hair.  our hair needs extreme moisture and ojon products ROB my hair of every ounce of moisture about 2 days after treatment.  i&#x27;d be interested to hear if this is happening to anyone else-- if the initial honeymoon of this product has warn of anyone and they see something like this happening to them.  believe me when i say, i&#x27;m really quite sad that it&#x27;s not working for me because i had no buyers remorse regarding price whatsoever.  i don&#x27;t know if i just got a bad batch, a tub of the \\&quot;old\\&quot; formula (mine does not have the little beads in it like the sample i was given had)or what but it is just complete trash, just sitting there $45 dollars worthless tub of yummy smelling nothing.  p.s., i have a very loud intuition and no offense, but i don&#x27;t believe that hyped out story about him working with and helping the tribe and sustainably taking the palm oil etc etc. not for one second. it&#x27;s just not possible to sell on QVC and be small potatoes like that.  I&#x27;ve read some seriously conflicting reports about sustainability issues.  my intuition says this guy is just a marketing guy, i mean does he even have a cosmo license???  his wife is gorgeous and has a lovely personality.like that.

            <li> I am black with mixed grade hair (it&#x27;s not kinky but has tight curls).  I grew out my relaxer and only have color in my hair.  I have been trying for over a year to find the right products that would give me naturally curl look that was not frizzy or dried out.  I tried all sorts fo things I finally got it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Use the Ojon Restorative Hair Treatment - Apply and leave in overnight (I parted my hair in sections to make sure it was completely saturated)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. New morning wash it out using Redken Real control Shampoo and Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Towel dry hair and starting from the back of the head, parting my hair in about 4-6 sections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. In section of my hair I applied 3 products.  Redken Fresh Curls Curl Refiner, Redken Ringlet No 7, and Redken Glass 01.  And let air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I know this might sound like a Redken review but here&#x27;s my point... I did steps 2 - 4 before and it was always close to my desired look but never right.  It was only when I used Ojon that I finally got the hair I was looking for.  There is NO sign of frizz, puffiness, or dryness.  Now I can wear my hair naturally with confidence.  I wish I would&#x27;ve tried this product sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is that Ojon smells like cigarettes and chocolate to me.</li>
            <li> Ojon restorative hair treatment is a Very good product. The hot treatment leaves my hair soft and manageable. I will continue to order it.</li>
