            <li>superfast shipping &amp; great price!</li>
            <li>Great find!!</li>
            <li>Adds incredible shine.</li>
            <li>Great product...</li>
            <li>I do love their shampoo/conditioner</li>
            <li>Maybe I need more time with this product, so I&#x27;ll keep it and see what happens.....</li>
            <li>I do not think the product was authentic since it is nothing like the beauty store product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking its a tad longer than I&#x27;ve been able to grow my hair before.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and the length is just below the shoulders.</li>
            <li>my hair looks much thicker and better already!</li>
            <li>I am going to invest in the full product line, conditioner shampoo etc.</li>
            <li>I rarely review products</li>
            <li>Not even worth $2 let alone $22.</li>
            <li>Really makes a difference!</li>
            <li>and I love how when I put this in my bleach blonde hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;It costs more than I&#x27;d like to spend on a hair product, but you only use a pea-sized amount and there is a lot in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>My friend told me this worked very well for her</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t, but</li>
            <li>Since using the Alterna line of products, including Caviar repair, my hair appears to be fuller, stronger, and looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, smells good and you only need a pea size of this, so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this a couple weeks, and so far I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>I will review later on after I&#x27;ve used a whole bottle.</li>
            <li>what I do know is my hair feels soft</li>
            <li>So far I am liking this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll come back to add to the review after I have used these products a few more months longer.</li>
            <li>The actual product was runnier than I had expected and I found myself using a little bit more than instructed to cover my whole scalp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the elixir for only a few days and my damaged hair feels significantly stronger.  </li>
            <li>not only did it not condition or tame the first of my hair</li>
            <li>did nothing for my hair which is very thin and takes a long time to grow, so it might work if you already have nice hair</li>

            <li> did nothing for my hair which is very thin and takes a long time to grow, so it might work if you already have nice hair</li>
            <li> Really makes a difference!</li>
            <li> Great product...superfast shipping &amp; great price! Couldn&#x27;t believe that my hair actually grew in a few days!  Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a couple weeks, and so far I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my hair. I&#x27;m assuming results will take awhile to see since it&#x27;s supposed to prevent breakage. But at this point, I would not repurchase. I will review later on after I&#x27;ve used a whole bottle. I do love their shampoo/conditioner though so I&#x27;m still hoping for greatness!!</li>
            <li> My friend told me this worked very well for her so I bought it. I use it regularly and am just waiting on results. My hair usually take a long time to grow.</li>
            <li> I wanted to so badly to work the brand and the price alone are the reasons I purchased it. I felt like I wasn&#x27;t putting anything on my hair not only did it not condition or tame the first of my hair think it may have actually made it worse.</li>
            <li> This is watery, I thought it would have had a thicker consistency.</li>
            <li> Will buy this again - my hair looks healthier after using this product for over a month.  I keep my hair short, so can&#x27;t speak to the lengthening part.</li>
            <li> Adds incredible shine.</li>
            <li> The actual product was runnier than I had expected and I found myself using a little bit more than instructed to cover my whole scalp. However, I have noticed a difference in my hair since starting use and overall I like it quite a bit. I plan to try out one of the shampoo/conditioner combos as well once I am in need of such again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is being used in conjunction with the Alterna Omega+ Nourishing Oil and I would recommend both.</li>
            <li> I was unsure about this stuff. My friend got a sample of this in her IPSY bag and I wanted to try it. Has it made my hair longer? I want to say yes but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s what I am seeing or what I want to see. I really don&#x27;t, but what I do know is my hair feels soft and I love how when I put this in my bleach blonde hair I can just run my fingers through it.</li>
            <li> I have used this as instructed since I bought it. Personally, I don&#x27;t see a difference, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks. It&#x27;s lightweight, smells good and you only need a pea size of this, so it will last a long time. Maybe I need more time with this product, so I&#x27;ll keep it and see what happens.....</li>
            <li> I have a lot of breakage and damage around my hairline due to the heat I use almost daily.  I&#x27;ve used the elixir for only a few days and my damaged hair feels significantly stronger.  I haven&#x27;t seen rapid regrowth or any miracles to that effect, but it definitely delivers on the strengthening aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It costs more than I&#x27;d like to spend on a hair product, but you only use a pea-sized amount and there is a lot in the bottle.  I think this will last for a very long time.  Great find!!</li>
            <li> I rarely review products but I have to say, this stuff WORKS. I have tried everything to repair my weak, brittle, damaged hair and i could tell a difference using this from day 1. plus i swear my hair has grown at twice the rate during the past 3 weeks of use. my hair looks much thicker and better already!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. I do not think the product was authentic since it is nothing like the beauty store product. Very small bottle. Not even worth $2 let alone $22. If I could send it back I would.</li>
            <li> too small, too expensive</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product.  It is lightweight and not greasy.  I can already see the differences in my hair especially in terms of texture.  I am going to invest in the full product line, conditioner shampoo etc.</li>
            <li> So far I am liking this. I have fine hair and the length is just below the shoulders. I&#x27;d like my hair to grow longer but for some reason it seems to stop growing at that length (is it breaking off, I don&#x27;t know). Since using the Alterna line of products, including Caviar repair, my hair appears to be fuller, stronger, and looks so much healthier. Will my hair grow longer? I&#x27;m thinking its a tad longer than I&#x27;ve been able to grow my hair before. I&#x27;ll come back to add to the review after I have used these products a few more months longer.</li>
            <li> Did not notice any difference in my hair.  A very expensive lesson to learn... that expensive doesn&#x27;t mean it works.</li>
            <li> I can see a big improvement in my hair already!</li>
