            <li>and I absolutely love this crimper.</li>
            <li>I love playing with my hair and just fell in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I think that it would look better on longer hair, but I have a bob and still love it.</li>
            <li>I was able to style my daughter&#x27;s hair in under 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s everything you should get in a crimper and more.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure, but if your&#x27;e crimping your hair every day you prob aren&#x27;t too worried about that i&#x27;m guessing...</li>
            <li>Would buy it again and recommend it to others :)</li>
            <li>So beware of the product&#x27;s effectiveness :).</li>
            <li>; position so you know for sure.</li>
            <li>and they simply love this look.</li>
            <li>those adorable zig</li>
            <li>and I love the volume and smoothness it creates.</li>
            <li>I recommend this for everybody :)</li>
            <li>Got this for our grand daughter.</li>
            <li>I am so glad we ordered it</li>
            <li>If you have fine/thin hair better just keep it on medium heat.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what I did to encourage my purchase of this product. :)</li>
            <li>and I love the color.</li>
            <li>I love the look and it lasts for days if I want it to.</li>
            <li>You MUST use a heat protect spray on your hair before use and make sure the setting is at 50% - 75% power.</li>
            <li>The Two inch width was the way to go covers more hair.  </li>
            <li>My daughters love this.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>I would like to start out with the fact that I am 30 and love crimped hair.</li>
            <li>just becuase I love crimped hair :)</li>
            <li>and I was able to crimp ALL of it in about an hour.</li>
            <li>it will be more defined if you dont comb through it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use this to give more volume to my hair.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>:).</li>
            <li>I got this for the great reviews, but it didn&#x27;t work very well for me.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>MORE.YOU WILL LOVE IT</li>
            <li>love the effect you get from this crimper,</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I Love this.  </li>
            <li>We have both used it and love it.</li>
            <li>It heated up fast, did not &amp;#34;fry&amp;#34; her hair and gave great results.</li>
            <li>love this crimper.</li>
            <li>And so many people have said something about it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that the more I experiment with it, the better it will work out for me.</li>
            <li>Who knows, maybe I&#x27;ll figure out how to use it better</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS THING!&amp;#34;  &amp;</li>
            <li>;  &amp;#34;I love my crimper!!!&amp;#34;  &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t believe this thing takes all the hassle out crimping and</li>
            <li>This was for my granddaughter, her hair looks cute after styling with it</li>
            <li>I iron the top layer of my hair, takes just a couple minutes.  </li>
            <li>do that is sure to keep the party rocking.</li>
            <li>Nice range for temp changes, smooth plates don&#x27;t snag hair.</li>
            <li>We love this Crimper in all aspects.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am glad I went with my gut and gave this Crimper a try .&lt;br</li>
            <li>It had good reviews and rightly so.</li>
            <li>its easy to use, very comfy and just great.</li>
            <li>Even with her fine hair, I use the low setting, and it holds perfectly.</li>
            <li>and she was so excited, until she plugged it in and we went to do her hair!</li>
            <li>Oh what fun we had with this on 80s day at school!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
            <li>So, happy to have a new tool to spice up my hairdo.</li>
            <li>Heats up very quickly, you don&#x27;t have to hold it on the strand of hair for more than 5-10 seconds to get a long-lasting crimp.</li>
            <li>Ok, so the iron is great but remember when crimping hair its best on fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>its a lot better than the other brands and works great!</li>
            <li>but she did ask for one, it works great not like the crimpers from the old days if you purchase to buy heat protectent spray for the hair</li>
            <li>Does work better if you use your free hand to pinch the end together on the fingerhold.</li>
            <li>Bought the crimper to replace the 7 year old one that I had and was so happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>The product is attractive with its rich, sparkly teal color and high quality.</li>
            <li>Easy for her to use.</li>
            <li>Despite lack of knowledge in hairstyling, I found the crimping iron easy to use.</li>
            <li>Handles easily so for.</li>
            <li>This crimper works great, runs pretty hot, even just on the medium setting</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and not to heavy.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It crimps very quickly, so</li>
            <li>This crimper was easy to use and was inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Well constructed, easy to use.</li>
            <li>One evening I expressed a strong desire to have one again.</li>
            <li>I have just tried these and they won&#x27;t get warm or hot</li>
            <li>Ordered with ease, Arrived on time estimated, and as shown, I dont like being required to put in a certain amount of words for review!!!</li>
            <li>This works fine.  </li>
            <li>Works just fine.</li>
            <li>It works just fine though.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, below shoulder length hair</li>
            <li>followed it for our hair type (fine)  </li>
            <li>Over all its super cute style.</li>
            <li>This works super well!</li>
            <li>but for some reason my crimps stayed in super well!</li>
            <li>Her hair is on the fine side so anything that adds body, especially to the roots is great</li>
            <li>Advise me about free postage of return.....</li>
            <li>This Product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>They had a lot of fun turning themselves into 80&#x27;s wavy head girls :-)  </li>
            <li>I looked on Amazon for a cheap crimper and found two.</li>
            <li>which was important because my daughter has a ton of hair.</li>
            <li>It seems like it&#x27;s made of kinda cheap quality though.</li>
            <li>thing there&#x27;s a light that works in the &amp;#34;On&amp;#34</li>
            <li>It came in a secure package.</li>
            <li>It is an awsome one, it heats up really fast and makes nice and defined crimps.</li>
            <li>so it does provide what it&#x27;s for - fabulous crimps.</li>
            <li>for crimping:&lt;br /&gt;*Spray a light mist of hairspray before and after crimping&lt;br</li>
            <li>&gt;* lightly brush your hair out after all your hair is crimped.  </li>
            <li>it seems pretty easy to use and safe as well.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it works great :)</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!!</li>
            <li>It works great and it&#x27;s better than most crimpers that I have had in the past.</li>
            <li>Pretty good!my daughter love it.</li>
            <li>love it, but my hair poofs out when using it. ! will definitely use more when my hair grows out.</li>
            <li>I love this product , my first time buying this tool</li>
            <li>Heats up fast--makes perfect small crimps.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for one of my friends, she was excited about 90&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would ever find a crimper like or better than my first.</li>
            <li>I would say that if your looking for small waves this would be the best!</li>
            <li>I did the bottom layer of my hair first in 1-2 inch sections then the top layer&lt;</li>
            <li>Her hair is very fine - almost like baby hair texture and stick straight.</li>
            <li>I love this product it makes nice crimps and is a pretty color it gets hot fast!</li>
            <li>happy with this purchase and happy to recomend to other potential purchases.</li>
            <li>was great for getting my long hair done quickly.</li>
            <li>Very good for a messy look.</li>
            <li>Heats Up Quickly, Gets real Hot.  </li>
            <li>The selection I made (Bed Head Totally Bent Chrome Crimper 2-inch) was a good one.</li>
            <li>Good price, especially considering I&#x27;ve seen these in stores for 2 and 3x the price.</li>
            <li>Crimped hair hasn&#x27;t really caught on in our area yet, so the girls feel like trend setters :)  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping love this</li>
            <li>The next day, the crimps still looked good.  </li>
            <li>I just won&#x27;t be rocking the &#x27;80s full crimp like I want.</li>
            <li>It gives the desired volume and style which is really cool</li>
            <li>we have been looking for a good crimp-er and have now finally found it!</li>
            <li>perfect for thick hair</li>
            <li>This crimper heats up really fast and creates a style that looks cute and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for thick hair..</li>
            <li>Have had this crimper for a over  two years and still works very well, does a wonderful job in my daughters straight flat hair</li>
            <li>I have always been able to crimp my hair since I was a little girl and for some reason this crimper does not put a good crimp in it.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves it and quick shipping too</li>
            <li>Heats quickly, crimps evenly-</li>
            <li>and it worked really quickly</li>
            <li>Although, it does make her hair super poofy like Dianna Ross, but she loves that effect.  </li>
            <li>Heats up quick &amp; crimps with the quickness.</li>
            <li>As far as how it works, it is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Full size ,gets hot!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take long to heat up and the lowest setting works perfect for my fine, long hair.</li>
            <li>Upside, it&#x27;s very hot which makes this a quick job.</li>
            <li>She had no problem using it and the results were very pretty.  </li>
            <li>The iron is VERY hot and will make your hair smell and break if used on the highest setting.</li>
            <li>Overall very pleased.</li>
            <li>Bought this to use for an 80s theme party and it worked really well and super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Full size and the little knobs on the end work great to hold on to.</li>
            <li>My daughters new favorite hair styling item.</li>
            <li>My daughter has thick hair and it came out very cute, not frizzy, you could see the waves nicely.</li>
            <li>Such a good price and shipping was so fast!</li>
            <li>really liked the finger tip plates at the end of the crimper so that you can use that to clamp down instead of touching the crimper because the plastic does heat</li>
            <li>Love the color, hot really quick, easy to use and put away, good products overall, definitely recommend to everyone, worth the trial</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair, you only need the lowest setting for a count of 3 or less to get perfect crimps.  </li>
            <li>The results were exactly what I had been hoping for!</li>
            <li>I always have it on the lowest setting and it&#x27;s plenty hot!</li>
            <li>Haha!!</li>
            <li>I love crimping irons and most of the ones the sell in the stores are too small to crimp more than a strand or two</li>
            <li>It was exactly what she wanted color and all!</li>
            <li>so when I get to crimp my hair with this, I end up having the most epic hair style ever!</li>
            <li>She and her friends love to use it -- they are busy for hours!</li>
            <li>After buying this, I have stopped using a whole bunch of products in my hair!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It heats really fast, and does your hair sooooo quickly!</li>
            <li>, it heats up fast, I have fine hair and using the crimper makes my hair feel thicker.  </li>
            <li>but it works well and gives hair a fun crimp style.</li>
            <li>Nice deep crimps.</li>
            <li>They are 11 yrs old and all the girls love it.  </li>
            <li>8 and 10 year old girls love the look and so fun.</li>
            <li>She is 7 yrs old soon and just loves it. :-)</li>
            <li>I just wanted a crimping iron to use for my daughter to have some fun with.  </li>
            <li>So much better than the old ones from 20 years ago.</li>
            <li>My husband doesn&#x27;t like the crimp look, but it can be fun at times.  </li>
            <li>We have lots of fun doing hair together.</li>
            <li>Fun to use evey now and the.</li>
            <li>For a fun funky hair style.</li>
            <li>I had so much fun with this crimper</li>
            <li>this crimp-er gets very hot very fast.</li>
            <li>It gets really hot and quickly.  </li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>Yes, you can still burn yourself, but if you hold it right that won&#x27;t happen.  </li>
            <li>My 9 year old has super thick hair, and I thought maybe I would have to go up on the settings from \\&quot;low\\&quot;, however, it does her hair perfectly.</li>
            <li>It gets hot fast!!</li>
            <li>still works great my hair looks fabulous and never had to retouch until i washed the hair last long and came super fast</li>
            <li>This Crimper works way better than a $25 Conair 3 in 1 I bought, tried and then returned because it barely made any crimps.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to use mine that I did my whole head at first</li>
            <li>I tested out right away and it crimped my hair very fast.</li>
            <li>It is fast and heats up quick.</li>
            <li>It heats up fairly fast and crimps quickly as well minimizing any damage to the hair.</li>
            <li>And all her friends now think having a couple crimped chunks of hair is  a NEW idea!!!</li>
            <li>Not us expected but love it!</li>
            <li>I recommend that if you are doing children&#x27;s hair to do their hair right away after plugging it in, no need to wait for it to heat up (it can get really hot fast!).</li>
            <li>enough okay when done right</li>
            <li>my daughter loves this crimper very much.</li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for, heats up fast and is very user friendly.</li>
            <li>spray a little gel, scrunch and I am good for the day.  </li>
            <li>It is best on the low or medium settings (even on my super super thick hair) as it starts to smell like burning plastic and does crimp the hair too deeply on high.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I was looking more for bigger size crimps on my hair</li>
            <li>While I was crimping my hair with this product for a costume party, it smelled funny, so I stopped using it.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it needs to be doing , needed this for a 80 party</li>
            <li>Fast and works like a champ!</li>
            <li>It works exactly like it&#x27;s suppose to.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s colored blue.</li>
            <li>but does get hot</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>Worked great, even on my thick hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll even flashback and do some of my hair before the girls get home ;)</li>
            <li>Gets really hot.</li>
            <li>Gave her so much body!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>and when I first used it I had it on medium</li>
            <li>The only thing that could make it better is if it was dual voltage, as I travel a lot.</li>
            <li>i saw a bunch of pics recently on pinterest with girls with crimped hair and started the search on amazon--definitely didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot of money for it since it would infrequently used at best and also didn&#x27;t want big crimps--i specifically wanted smaller ones.</li>
            <li>Love it and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my daughters first father daughter dance.</li>
            <li>I even put 4 small crimped pieces into the top of my hair which was also incredibly cute.</li>
            <li>The handle does get too hot though,</li>
            <li>and it was hot.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I have not used this product yet but it looks pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li>I sectioned my hair off and only had to hold the crimper on my hair for a count of 5ish at the top, and maybe 3 at the bottom since my hair gets thinner towards the bottom.</li>
            <li>I use on highest setting and it works FAST!  </li>
            <li>VERY WELL WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I finally bought it since 80s day comes every year!  </li>
            <li>Oh and she managed to use it herself although she did say it he handle gets hot -</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for people who want to spice up their locks every now and again - I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments!!</li>
            <li>And your hair will need to be washed more often and such.</li>
            <li>The first thing I thought was \\&quot;I NEED to get a crimper!!!!\\&quot; I had no clue where to shop for a crimper, so</li>
            <li>This crimper was exactly what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I just might have to bring the look back into style :-)</li>
            <li>So I put I on high setting and quickly did her hair.</li>
            <li>It gets super hot, which is good for my thick hair, it defiantly gives it volume, I did all my hair, and just got a lot of compliments, I like the, 80s</li>
            <li>I have clean, soft hair, but with MEGA VOLUME at the roots.</li>
            <li>i liked the next day look with my old crimper</li>
            <li>I hardly use any pre-product anymore and still can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m one of these people raving about how amazing this product is!</li>
            <li>This has lived up to the positive reviews we read before buying it.  </li>
            <li>I am struggling with giving a hair crimper a positive review...</li>
            <li>I bought this crimper based on all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been in love with this color for as long as I can remember</li>
            <li>Gets really hot really fast.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who wants to try it ;)</li>
            <li>It works well and it was delivered pretty fast.</li>
            <li>it will pretty much stay \\&quot;Crimped\\</li>
            <li>Good product but the size of the wave are really small n close together.</li>
            <li>:) My daughter has long hair and loves this thing!</li>
            <li>Especially one who is prone to headaches easily.</li>
            <li>The large plate makes it way easier to use.  </li>
            <li>The days I use this and the days I don&#x27;t is such a huge difference.</li>
            <li>You can crimp the whole head or just sections, whatever you would like.</li>
            <li>She said that it works really well.</li>
            <li>straight outta</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>Heats up fast.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than in the stores, Heats up, and Crimps very well.</li>
            <li>A red light comes on when you plug it in.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the light is supposed to turn green when it&#x27;s ready, but even on the lowest heat setting the light never changed color.  </li>
            <li>cause everyone wants to go straight-</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>And I can make my hair really neat looking with it.</li>
            <li>Cost is very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>it also heats up really fast</li>
            <li>and i finish my whole hair in 20 minutes</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t really need to.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves this thing.</li>
            <li>It works fast and well.</li>
            <li>I set the iron on the highest heat setting (I have straight, medium-thick hair)</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Its works very well and fast.</li>
            <li>The crimps are much closer together and not as defined.</li>
            <li>, this gives you a very crimped look.</li>
            <li>I was very exticed when this came in.</li>
            <li>I recommend using heat protectant spray because the heat can be very damaging.</li>
            <li>but I burn my fingers on the plates that are exposed on the straight side every time I use it.</li>
            <li>We have done her whole head</li>
            <li>Highly recommend trying it!  </li>
            <li>This crimper does not crimp hair as much as it makes it look very fuzzy.  </li>
            <li>My daughter really likes this product.  </li>
            <li>SHIPPED VERY FAST.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like this tool.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.com and Bed Head.</li>
            <li>this is fast, can do the job..</li>
            <li>This crimping iron worked very well.  </li>
            <li>Heats really well.</li>
            <li>/crimp very well</li>
            <li>Hahaha</li>
            <li>I much prefer it to curling.  </li>
            <li>haha and</li>
            <li>, she really does say that</li>
            <li>Arrived fast.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast.</li>
            <li>Item as described and works really well.</li>
            <li>So I wont be using it as much as I want too.</li>
            <li>I have seen her a few times using it and it makes her hair all nice and wavy.</li>
            <li>I use to own a crimper a few years</li>
            <li>outside of the Crimper gets very warm , but you shouldn&#x27;t be holding it long enough for your hand to get hot, if so that&#x27;s probably why your hair is frying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This will change the life of people with fine hair, flat hair, and those who always like to tease their hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought it would take a long time to crimp my hair because there is so much of it; however, once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s very quick.  </li>
            <li>This crimper doesnt take long to do and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Not sure there&#x27;s a whole lot more to say!</li>
            <li>because the crimper gets very hot, even on med it gets to hot to hold in the middle plate section.</li>
            <li>The crimps are somewhat small or tight but they produce great volume!</li>
            <li>This crimper works really well on my long, fine hair.</li>
            <li>Would recommend for a fun and cute style for your little one!</li>
            <li>Other than those two complaints I love it.</li>
            <li>I know you can&#x27;t always rely on a brand name to give you a quality product, but this one looked more reliable than some of the other options I had</li>
            <li>Worked ok the first few timed i used it on my daughters hair.  </li>
            <li>naturally, I checked Amazon first.  </li>
            <li>As my daughters got older, I couldn&#x27;t help but want to crimp their hair.</li>
            <li>I would only give if 4 stars because it was pretty hot to hold onto, should have been made with a heavier plastic to insulate.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking not to spend $50 on something your kid will use for 6 months this is a decent product.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and the waves last all day.</li>
            <li>It is a very pretty blue color too.</li>
            <li>On the low setting (even after I have forgotten that I plugged it in) it doesn&#x27;t get very hot.  </li>
            <li>Works very well so far!</li>
            <li>It gets hot pretty quickly and there are little finger holds on the end</li>
            <li>Gets REALLY hot so be careful but that is probably one of the reasons it works so quickly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>CREATES LOTS OF VOLUME, HIGHLY RECOMMNDED, AFFORDABLE, DOES NOT OVER HEAT</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this crimper based on the reviews here.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Even though it was on high</li>
            <li>I started out HIGH because it seems I always have to use HIGH-</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for anyone wanting to style part of their hair or all of it.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Coming from me that is high praise as my hair doesn&#x27;t hold anything well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>heat controls are located on the inside which is the same as most flat irons</li>
            <li>and it certainly has so far.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this product is so cool!</li>
            <li>If you want a great crimper you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li>My 7 year old \\&quot;fashionista\\&quot; wants me to do her hair every.single.day.  </li>
            <li>My 10 year old daughter loves it and it doesn&#x27;t take a ton of time to get her whole head done</li>
            <li>i purchased this for my 10 year old niece thinking it might be too much for her to handle</li>
            <li>I have worn the same hairstyle for most of my adult life and recently decided that I wanted to start experimenting with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun and reminds me of my younger days.</li>
            <li>ACTUALLY SHOULD BE WORTH</li>
            <li>I have very thin hair, I use this by the scalp and it give my hair great volume.</li>
            <li>I felt as though this was a brand that had a reputation to live up to</li>
            <li>Hers held all night on New Years and into the morning.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it heats up quick &amp; crimps hair fast.</li>
            <li>Gets HOT on the High setting, maybe a little too hot, but does the crimping job well!  </li>
            <li>good product but my only complaint is the heat shield from the handle to to crimper plates is non existent</li>
            <li>Better than I expected actually.</li>
            <li>The only think is the weight, it&#x27;s kind of heavy.</li>
            <li>It seems professional without the high price.  </li>
            <li>The crimps stay in for a couple of days which I am very surprised.</li>
            <li>I love my new crimper, and from past experience and this one.</li>
            <li>I would only keep the crimper on a section of hair for 4-5 seconds, and had no product on it, so the crimper was just too hot.</li>
            <li>next time I will only do the top layer of hair instead of all of it because she made me pull it back</li>
            <li>No problems so far, my kids even like it when I crimp their hair!</li>
            <li>the only problem i had with it was it got really hot and damaged your hair</li>
            <li>Pretty blue/green plastic outside with swivel cord.  </li>
            <li>This was a Christmas gift for my 12yr old daughter,  and she loves it!</li>
            <li>Heats up so hot that the hair is instantly singed.</li>
            <li>I thought crimping ALL my hair would take over an hour, so being the Type A personality I am, I set aside exactly 60 minutes to crimp my entire head of hair.  </li>
            <li>I have long blonde fine hair (but a lot of hair)</li>
            <li>I have long blonde hair and enjoy crimping my hair often.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and do not have to apply so long to hair for crimp look which means less damage</li>
            <li>I promise you won&#x27;t be dissappointed and probably be on here next writing pretty much the same</li>
            <li>If you have fine, oily or really long hair, the crimp doesn&#x27;t tend to stay very long, even with product.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and stays hot, and the crimps last a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an adult woman, well-experienced with hair tools.  </li>
            <li>My 8 year old</li>
            <li>It took no time at all and it completely transformed my look.</li>
            <li>This definitely gives me the 80&#x27;s look without too much of an effort and salon prepping.</li>
            <li>My hair feels fluffy and free after using it.</li>
            <li>You just take a section of hair, start near the root</li>
            <li>I purchased this for a 14 year old.  </li>
            <li>Love this I was worried because of the negative comments because</li>
            <li>Her old brother couldn&#x27;t believe how soft her hair felt.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my thirteen year old, she used it once now it won&#x27;t heat up.  </li>
            <li>So much faster than curling iron, and something different.</li>
            <li>It was fast and I only needed the lowest setting.</li>
            <li>My 15 year old daughter loves this thing.</li>
            <li>This was for my 13 year old neice who wanted to crimp her hair.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my thirteen year old, she used it once now it won&#x27;t heat up..</li>
            <li>Maybe I needed to take smaller sections of hair because it covered up all the straight hair underneath and didn&#x27;t highlight my look at all.</li>
            <li>I recently got it cut into a straight a line</li>
            <li>The iron has 3 different levels of heat and warms up fast.</li>
            <li>VERY GENTLE ON MY FINE HAIR, VERY SMALL TINY CRIMPS,</li>
            <li>It gets hot enough to just clamp your roots for 1 second to get the micro crimps.</li>
            <li>If you want the traditional 80&#x27;s look of highly crimped hair this crimper is the way to go.</li>
            <li>It has a low and high setting.</li>
            <li>crimper features an on/off switch, as well as 3 temperatures to choose from (low, medium, high...</li>
            <li>I used it for an 80s party last night, slept on my crimps, and my hair still looks pretty decent (minus the bed head).</li>
            <li>It helped add volume and texture to my straw straight long hair.</li>
            <li>I had resisted this purchase for a long time, because I very specifically remember throwing mine away....</li>
            <li>even if you are doing your whole head, it doesn&#x27;t take too long.  </li>
            <li>and it adds TONS of volume and really lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Be careful using this, because this gets really hot.</li>
            <li>Just have to be careful doesn&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
            <li>Gets really hot though so be careful.</li>
            <li>Takes Me half the time to do my whole head!!</li>
            <li>Now that my hair is fine and thin this really adds body and volume.  </li>
            <li>give some background, my hair is long (about mid-way down my back) and on a scale of 1 - 5, 1 being extremely fine hair, and 5 being crazy-thick hair, I would say I&#x27;m about a 3 (in normal volume range- non crimped, of course!)&lt;br</li>
            <li>They even have little finger rests at the top to hold the iron closed.</li>
            <li>A little more drying than a curling iron or straightener, but very minimal and nowhere near damaging.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is the pads on the crimping end, I normally use my fingers to ensure more definition, occassionaly gets a little too hot</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast especially the next day shipping option.</li>
            <li>crimps really well, but only last about 5 hours max.</li>
            <li>So, my experience with the Bed Head Crimper is not due to user error.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think the iron was too hot to hold, like some other people have said.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other brands of crimpers, but this is the first time purchasing a Bed Head crimper.  </li>
            <li>We did her hair all up completely crimped for dance recital, and then several times we have just crimped a few sections for a cool effect.  </li>
            <li>I see no issues and a hopefully long relationship with my new found fave hair tool!</li>
            <li>The metal is not coated with anything, it&#x27;s just bare metal.  </li>
            <li>It was only used once so as far as continued functionality or stability, I&#x27;m unsure?</li>
            <li>I was using it on my daughters hair for maybe the fourth time when we heard a loud pop and smelled smoke.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like that look on me (too wild and big)</li>
            <li>My 11 year old daughter wanted to do something different with her hair.  </li>
            <li>but at the same time made her hair so soft.  </li>
            <li>but this one completely flattens out by the next day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my old for a number of years and finally the spring gave out</li>
            <li>It also takes a long time to cool down.</li>
            <li>I received it fast and quickly became addicted.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and takes just a few minutes to crimp an entire head of hair.</li>
            <li>but my buff has had hers for two years and it works as well as the first defiantly recommend over any other hair tool it last forever will be using this till I die</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;on\\&quot; indicator light is also in an awkward region, like under an edge, near the hot plates.</li>
            <li>This crimper is for fine to medium to thick straight or slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I used to braid my daughters blonde hair when wet and take the braids out in the morning to achieve the &amp;#34;crimped&amp;#34; look, but this makes it so much easier and faster.</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical of using this at first, but after using it a couple of times, it is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Honestly, my hair hasn&#x27;t been that fluffy in at least a couple of decades!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The metal is a little cheap but other than that it works great😄</li>
            <li>It heats up so fast, but watch how hot you have it because I have VERY thick hair</li>
            <li>I have medium thin straight hair and this takes about 15 mins or so do to my whole head!</li>
            <li>Purchased for my 13 year old niece who has very long, straight heavy hair.  </li>
            <li>I have medium length thin, fine hair and was looking for a volume boosting tool.  </li>
            <li>My hair is thin and fine.  </li>
            <li>The only negative is that it doesnt lock closed for easy storage and power switch</li>
            <li>my hair is pin straight, was looking for something to give just a little volume.  </li>
            <li>Well her pretty long healthy hair now looks fried like adults get, very broken off all down her hair.</li>
            <li>(I thought it was a little frightening; she LOVED it).</li>
            <li>So, essentially, after about an hour, it&#x27;s simply adding a little volume and you can&#x27;t see much of the crimping.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and she was so excited, until she plugged it in and we went to do her hair!</li>
            <li> Oh what fun we had with this on 80s day at school!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
            <li> So, happy to have a new tool to spice up my hairdo.</li>
            <li> Heats up very quickly, you don&#x27;t have to hold it on the strand of hair for more than 5-10 seconds to get a long-lasting crimp.</li>
            <li> Ok, so the iron is great but remember when crimping hair its best on fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> its a lot better than the other brands and works great!</li>
            <li> but she did ask for one, it works great not like the crimpers from the old days if you purchase to buy heat protectent spray for the hair</li>
            <li> Does work better if you use your free hand to pinch the end together on the fingerhold.</li>
            <li> Bought the crimper to replace the 7 year old one that I had and was so happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The product is attractive with its rich, sparkly teal color and high quality.</li>
            <li> Easy for her to use.</li>
            <li> Despite lack of knowledge in hairstyling, I found the crimping iron easy to use.</li>
            <li> Handles easily so for.</li>
            <li> This crimper works great, runs pretty hot, even just on the medium setting</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and not to heavy.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It crimps very quickly, so</li>
            <li> This crimper was easy to use and was inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Well constructed, easy to use.</li>
            <li> One evening I expressed a strong desire to have one again.</li>
            <li> I have just tried these and they won&#x27;t get warm or hot</li>
            <li> Ordered with ease, Arrived on time estimated, and as shown, I dont like being required to put in a certain amount of words for review!!!</li>
            <li> This works fine.  </li>
            <li> Works just fine.</li>
            <li> It works just fine though.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, below shoulder length hair</li>
            <li> followed it for our hair type (fine)  </li>
            <li> Over all its super cute style.</li>
            <li> This works super well!</li>
            <li> but for some reason my crimps stayed in super well!</li>
            <li> Her hair is on the fine side so anything that adds body, especially to the roots is great</li>
            <li> Advise me about free postage of return.....</li>
            <li> This Product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> They had a lot of fun turning themselves into 80&#x27;s wavy head girls :-)  </li>
            <li> I looked on Amazon for a cheap crimper and found two.</li>
            <li> which was important because my daughter has a ton of hair.</li>
            <li> It seems like it&#x27;s made of kinda cheap quality though.</li>
            <li> thing there&#x27;s a light that works in the &amp;#34;On&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It came in a secure package.</li>
            <li> It is an awsome one, it heats up really fast and makes nice and defined crimps.</li>
            <li> so it does provide what it&#x27;s for - fabulous crimps.</li>
            <li> for crimping:&lt;br /&gt;*Spray a light mist of hairspray before and after crimping&lt;br</li>
            <li> &gt;* lightly brush your hair out after all your hair is crimped.  </li>
            <li> it seems pretty easy to use and safe as well.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it works great :)</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!!</li>
            <li> It works great and it&#x27;s better than most crimpers that I have had in the past.</li>
            <li> Pretty good!my daughter love it.</li>
            <li> love it, but my hair poofs out when using it. ! will definitely use more when my hair grows out.</li>
            <li> I love this product , my first time buying this tool</li>
            <li> Heats up fast--makes perfect small crimps.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for one of my friends, she was excited about 90&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would ever find a crimper like or better than my first.</li>
            <li> I would say that if your looking for small waves this would be the best!</li>
            <li> I did the bottom layer of my hair first in 1-2 inch sections then the top layer&lt;</li>
            <li> Her hair is very fine - almost like baby hair texture and stick straight.</li>
            <li> I love this product it makes nice crimps and is a pretty color it gets hot fast!</li>
            <li> happy with this purchase and happy to recomend to other potential purchases.</li>
            <li> was great for getting my long hair done quickly.</li>
            <li> Very good for a messy look.</li>
            <li> Heats Up Quickly, Gets real Hot.  </li>
            <li> The selection I made (Bed Head Totally Bent Chrome Crimper 2-inch) was a good one.</li>
            <li> Good price, especially considering I&#x27;ve seen these in stores for 2 and 3x the price.</li>
            <li> Crimped hair hasn&#x27;t really caught on in our area yet, so the girls feel like trend setters :)  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping love this</li>
            <li> The next day, the crimps still looked good.  </li>
            <li> I just won&#x27;t be rocking the &#x27;80s full crimp like I want.</li>
            <li> It gives the desired volume and style which is really cool</li>
            <li> we have been looking for a good crimp-er and have now finally found it!</li>
            <li> perfect for thick hair</li>
            <li> This crimper heats up really fast and creates a style that looks cute and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for thick hair..</li>
            <li> Have had this crimper for a over  two years and still works very well, does a wonderful job in my daughters straight flat hair</li>
            <li> I have always been able to crimp my hair since I was a little girl and for some reason this crimper does not put a good crimp in it.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it and quick shipping too</li>
            <li> Heats quickly, crimps evenly-</li>
            <li> and it worked really quickly</li>
            <li> Although, it does make her hair super poofy like Dianna Ross, but she loves that effect.  </li>
            <li> Heats up quick &amp; crimps with the quickness.</li>
            <li> As far as how it works, it is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Full size ,gets hot!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long to heat up and the lowest setting works perfect for my fine, long hair.</li>
            <li> Upside, it&#x27;s very hot which makes this a quick job.</li>
            <li> She had no problem using it and the results were very pretty.  </li>
            <li> The iron is VERY hot and will make your hair smell and break if used on the highest setting.</li>
            <li> Overall very pleased.</li>
            <li> Bought this to use for an 80s theme party and it worked really well and super easy to use.</li>
            <li> Full size and the little knobs on the end work great to hold on to.</li>
            <li> My daughters new favorite hair styling item.</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick hair and it came out very cute, not frizzy, you could see the waves nicely.</li>
            <li> Such a good price and shipping was so fast!</li>
            <li> really liked the finger tip plates at the end of the crimper so that you can use that to clamp down instead of touching the crimper because the plastic does heat</li>
            <li> Love the color, hot really quick, easy to use and put away, good products overall, definitely recommend to everyone, worth the trial</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair, you only need the lowest setting for a count of 3 or less to get perfect crimps.  </li>
            <li> The results were exactly what I had been hoping for!</li>
            <li> I always have it on the lowest setting and it&#x27;s plenty hot!</li>
            <li> Haha!!</li>
            <li> I love crimping irons and most of the ones the sell in the stores are too small to crimp more than a strand or two</li>
            <li> It was exactly what she wanted color and all!</li>
            <li> so when I get to crimp my hair with this, I end up having the most epic hair style ever!</li>
            <li> She and her friends love to use it -- they are busy for hours!</li>
            <li> After buying this, I have stopped using a whole bunch of products in my hair!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It heats really fast, and does your hair sooooo quickly!</li>
            <li> , it heats up fast, I have fine hair and using the crimper makes my hair feel thicker.  </li>
            <li> but it works well and gives hair a fun crimp style.</li>
            <li> Nice deep crimps.</li>
            <li> They are 11 yrs old and all the girls love it.  </li>
            <li> 8 and 10 year old girls love the look and so fun.</li>
            <li> She is 7 yrs old soon and just loves it. :-)</li>
            <li> I just wanted a crimping iron to use for my daughter to have some fun with.  </li>
            <li> So much better than the old ones from 20 years ago.</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t like the crimp look, but it can be fun at times.  </li>
            <li> We have lots of fun doing hair together.</li>
            <li> Fun to use evey now and the.</li>
            <li> For a fun funky hair style.</li>
            <li> I had so much fun with this crimper</li>
            <li> this crimp-er gets very hot very fast.</li>
            <li> It gets really hot and quickly.  </li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> Yes, you can still burn yourself, but if you hold it right that won&#x27;t happen.  </li>
            <li> My 9 year old has super thick hair, and I thought maybe I would have to go up on the settings from \\&quot;low\\&quot;, however, it does her hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> It gets hot fast!!</li>
            <li> still works great my hair looks fabulous and never had to retouch until i washed the hair last long and came super fast</li>
            <li> This Crimper works way better than a $25 Conair 3 in 1 I bought, tried and then returned because it barely made any crimps.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to use mine that I did my whole head at first</li>
            <li> I tested out right away and it crimped my hair very fast.</li>
            <li> It is fast and heats up quick.</li>
            <li> It heats up fairly fast and crimps quickly as well minimizing any damage to the hair.</li>
            <li> And all her friends now think having a couple crimped chunks of hair is  a NEW idea!!!</li>
            <li> Not us expected but love it!</li>
            <li> I recommend that if you are doing children&#x27;s hair to do their hair right away after plugging it in, no need to wait for it to heat up (it can get really hot fast!).</li>
            <li> enough okay when done right</li>
            <li> my daughter loves this crimper very much.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for, heats up fast and is very user friendly.</li>
            <li> spray a little gel, scrunch and I am good for the day.  </li>
            <li> It is best on the low or medium settings (even on my super super thick hair) as it starts to smell like burning plastic and does crimp the hair too deeply on high.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I was looking more for bigger size crimps on my hair</li>
            <li> While I was crimping my hair with this product for a costume party, it smelled funny, so I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it needs to be doing , needed this for a 80 party</li>
            <li> Fast and works like a champ!</li>
            <li> It works exactly like it&#x27;s suppose to.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s colored blue.</li>
            <li> but does get hot</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> Worked great, even on my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll even flashback and do some of my hair before the girls get home ;)</li>
            <li> Gets really hot.</li>
            <li> Gave her so much body!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> and when I first used it I had it on medium</li>
            <li> The only thing that could make it better is if it was dual voltage, as I travel a lot.</li>
            <li> i saw a bunch of pics recently on pinterest with girls with crimped hair and started the search on amazon--definitely didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot of money for it since it would infrequently used at best and also didn&#x27;t want big crimps--i specifically wanted smaller ones.</li>
            <li> Love it and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works very well!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughters first father daughter dance.</li>
            <li> I even put 4 small crimped pieces into the top of my hair which was also incredibly cute.</li>
            <li> The handle does get too hot though,</li>
            <li> and it was hot.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I have not used this product yet but it looks pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> I sectioned my hair off and only had to hold the crimper on my hair for a count of 5ish at the top, and maybe 3 at the bottom since my hair gets thinner towards the bottom.</li>
            <li> I use on highest setting and it works FAST!  </li>
            <li> VERY WELL WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I finally bought it since 80s day comes every year!  </li>
            <li> Oh and she managed to use it herself although she did say it he handle gets hot -</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for people who want to spice up their locks every now and again - I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments!!</li>
            <li> And your hair will need to be washed more often and such.</li>
            <li> The first thing I thought was \\&quot;I NEED to get a crimper!!!!\\&quot; I had no clue where to shop for a crimper, so</li>
            <li> This crimper was exactly what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I just might have to bring the look back into style :-)</li>
            <li> So I put I on high setting and quickly did her hair.</li>
            <li> It gets super hot, which is good for my thick hair, it defiantly gives it volume, I did all my hair, and just got a lot of compliments, I like the, 80s</li>
            <li> I have clean, soft hair, but with MEGA VOLUME at the roots.</li>
            <li> i liked the next day look with my old crimper</li>
            <li> I hardly use any pre-product anymore and still can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m one of these people raving about how amazing this product is!</li>
            <li> This has lived up to the positive reviews we read before buying it.  </li>
            <li> I am struggling with giving a hair crimper a positive review...</li>
            <li> I bought this crimper based on all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in love with this color for as long as I can remember</li>
            <li> Gets really hot really fast.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who wants to try it ;)</li>
            <li> It works well and it was delivered pretty fast.</li>
            <li> it will pretty much stay \\&quot;Crimped\\</li>
            <li> Good product but the size of the wave are really small n close together.</li>
            <li> :) My daughter has long hair and loves this thing!</li>
            <li> Especially one who is prone to headaches easily.</li>
            <li> The large plate makes it way easier to use.  </li>
            <li> The days I use this and the days I don&#x27;t is such a huge difference.</li>
            <li> You can crimp the whole head or just sections, whatever you would like.</li>
            <li> She said that it works really well.</li>
            <li> straight outta</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> Heats up fast.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than in the stores, Heats up, and Crimps very well.</li>
            <li> A red light comes on when you plug it in.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the light is supposed to turn green when it&#x27;s ready, but even on the lowest heat setting the light never changed color.  </li>
            <li> cause everyone wants to go straight-</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> And I can make my hair really neat looking with it.</li>
            <li> Cost is very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> it also heats up really fast</li>
            <li> and i finish my whole hair in 20 minutes</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t really need to.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves this thing.</li>
            <li> It works fast and well.</li>
            <li> I set the iron on the highest heat setting (I have straight, medium-thick hair)</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Its works very well and fast.</li>
            <li> The crimps are much closer together and not as defined.</li>
            <li> , this gives you a very crimped look.</li>
            <li> I was very exticed when this came in.</li>
            <li> I recommend using heat protectant spray because the heat can be very damaging.</li>
            <li> but I burn my fingers on the plates that are exposed on the straight side every time I use it.</li>
            <li> We have done her whole head</li>
            <li> Highly recommend trying it!  </li>
            <li> This crimper does not crimp hair as much as it makes it look very fuzzy.  </li>
            <li> My daughter really likes this product.  </li>
            <li> SHIPPED VERY FAST.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like this tool.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.com and Bed Head.</li>
            <li> this is fast, can do the job..</li>
            <li> This crimping iron worked very well.  </li>
            <li> Heats really well.</li>
            <li> /crimp very well</li>
            <li> Hahaha</li>
            <li> I much prefer it to curling.  </li>
            <li> haha and</li>
            <li> , she really does say that</li>
            <li> Arrived fast.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast.</li>
            <li> Item as described and works really well.</li>
            <li> So I wont be using it as much as I want too.</li>
            <li> I have seen her a few times using it and it makes her hair all nice and wavy.</li>
            <li> I use to own a crimper a few years</li>
            <li> outside of the Crimper gets very warm , but you shouldn&#x27;t be holding it long enough for your hand to get hot, if so that&#x27;s probably why your hair is frying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This will change the life of people with fine hair, flat hair, and those who always like to tease their hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought it would take a long time to crimp my hair because there is so much of it; however, once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s very quick.  </li>
            <li> This crimper doesnt take long to do and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Not sure there&#x27;s a whole lot more to say!</li>
            <li> because the crimper gets very hot, even on med it gets to hot to hold in the middle plate section.</li>
            <li> The crimps are somewhat small or tight but they produce great volume!</li>
            <li> This crimper works really well on my long, fine hair.</li>
            <li> Would recommend for a fun and cute style for your little one!</li>
            <li> Other than those two complaints I love it.</li>
            <li> I know you can&#x27;t always rely on a brand name to give you a quality product, but this one looked more reliable than some of the other options I had</li>
            <li> Worked ok the first few timed i used it on my daughters hair.  </li>
            <li> naturally, I checked Amazon first.  </li>
            <li> As my daughters got older, I couldn&#x27;t help but want to crimp their hair.</li>
            <li> I would only give if 4 stars because it was pretty hot to hold onto, should have been made with a heavier plastic to insulate.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking not to spend $50 on something your kid will use for 6 months this is a decent product.  </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and the waves last all day.</li>
            <li> It is a very pretty blue color too.</li>
            <li> On the low setting (even after I have forgotten that I plugged it in) it doesn&#x27;t get very hot.  </li>
            <li> Works very well so far!</li>
            <li> It gets hot pretty quickly and there are little finger holds on the end</li>
            <li> Gets REALLY hot so be careful but that is probably one of the reasons it works so quickly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> CREATES LOTS OF VOLUME, HIGHLY RECOMMNDED, AFFORDABLE, DOES NOT OVER HEAT</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this crimper based on the reviews here.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Even though it was on high</li>
            <li> I started out HIGH because it seems I always have to use HIGH-</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for anyone wanting to style part of their hair or all of it.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Coming from me that is high praise as my hair doesn&#x27;t hold anything well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> heat controls are located on the inside which is the same as most flat irons</li>
            <li> and it certainly has so far.</li>
            <li> Other than that, this product is so cool!</li>
            <li> If you want a great crimper you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old \\&quot;fashionista\\&quot; wants me to do her hair every.single.day.  </li>
            <li> My 10 year old daughter loves it and it doesn&#x27;t take a ton of time to get her whole head done</li>
            <li> i purchased this for my 10 year old niece thinking it might be too much for her to handle</li>
            <li> I have worn the same hairstyle for most of my adult life and recently decided that I wanted to start experimenting with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun and reminds me of my younger days.</li>
            <li> ACTUALLY SHOULD BE WORTH</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair, I use this by the scalp and it give my hair great volume.</li>
            <li> I felt as though this was a brand that had a reputation to live up to</li>
            <li> Hers held all night on New Years and into the morning.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it heats up quick &amp; crimps hair fast.</li>
            <li> Gets HOT on the High setting, maybe a little too hot, but does the crimping job well!  </li>
            <li> good product but my only complaint is the heat shield from the handle to to crimper plates is non existent</li>
            <li> Better than I expected actually.</li>
            <li> The only think is the weight, it&#x27;s kind of heavy.</li>
            <li> It seems professional without the high price.  </li>
            <li> The crimps stay in for a couple of days which I am very surprised.</li>
            <li> I love my new crimper, and from past experience and this one.</li>
            <li> I would only keep the crimper on a section of hair for 4-5 seconds, and had no product on it, so the crimper was just too hot.</li>
            <li> next time I will only do the top layer of hair instead of all of it because she made me pull it back</li>
            <li> No problems so far, my kids even like it when I crimp their hair!</li>
            <li> the only problem i had with it was it got really hot and damaged your hair</li>
            <li> Pretty blue/green plastic outside with swivel cord.  </li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my 12yr old daughter,  and she loves it!</li>
            <li> Heats up so hot that the hair is instantly singed.</li>
            <li> I thought crimping ALL my hair would take over an hour, so being the Type A personality I am, I set aside exactly 60 minutes to crimp my entire head of hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long blonde fine hair (but a lot of hair)</li>
            <li> I have long blonde hair and enjoy crimping my hair often.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and do not have to apply so long to hair for crimp look which means less damage</li>
            <li> I promise you won&#x27;t be dissappointed and probably be on here next writing pretty much the same</li>
            <li> If you have fine, oily or really long hair, the crimp doesn&#x27;t tend to stay very long, even with product.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and stays hot, and the crimps last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult woman, well-experienced with hair tools.  </li>
            <li> My 8 year old</li>
            <li> It took no time at all and it completely transformed my look.</li>
            <li> This definitely gives me the 80&#x27;s look without too much of an effort and salon prepping.</li>
            <li> My hair feels fluffy and free after using it.</li>
            <li> You just take a section of hair, start near the root</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a 14 year old.  </li>
            <li> Love this I was worried because of the negative comments because</li>
            <li> Her old brother couldn&#x27;t believe how soft her hair felt.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my thirteen year old, she used it once now it won&#x27;t heat up.  </li>
            <li> So much faster than curling iron, and something different.</li>
            <li> It was fast and I only needed the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughter loves this thing.</li>
            <li> This was for my 13 year old neice who wanted to crimp her hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my thirteen year old, she used it once now it won&#x27;t heat up..</li>
            <li> Maybe I needed to take smaller sections of hair because it covered up all the straight hair underneath and didn&#x27;t highlight my look at all.</li>
            <li> I recently got it cut into a straight a line</li>
            <li> The iron has 3 different levels of heat and warms up fast.</li>
            <li> VERY GENTLE ON MY FINE HAIR, VERY SMALL TINY CRIMPS,</li>
            <li> It gets hot enough to just clamp your roots for 1 second to get the micro crimps.</li>
            <li> If you want the traditional 80&#x27;s look of highly crimped hair this crimper is the way to go.</li>
            <li> It has a low and high setting.</li>
            <li> crimper features an on/off switch, as well as 3 temperatures to choose from (low, medium, high...</li>
            <li> I used it for an 80s party last night, slept on my crimps, and my hair still looks pretty decent (minus the bed head).</li>
            <li> It helped add volume and texture to my straw straight long hair.</li>
            <li> I had resisted this purchase for a long time, because I very specifically remember throwing mine away....</li>
            <li> even if you are doing your whole head, it doesn&#x27;t take too long.  </li>
            <li> and it adds TONS of volume and really lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Be careful using this, because this gets really hot.</li>
            <li> Just have to be careful doesn&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
            <li> Gets really hot though so be careful.</li>
            <li> Takes Me half the time to do my whole head!!</li>
            <li> Now that my hair is fine and thin this really adds body and volume.  </li>
            <li> give some background, my hair is long (about mid-way down my back) and on a scale of 1 - 5, 1 being extremely fine hair, and 5 being crazy-thick hair, I would say I&#x27;m about a 3 (in normal volume range- non crimped, of course!)&lt;br</li>
            <li> They even have little finger rests at the top to hold the iron closed.</li>
            <li> A little more drying than a curling iron or straightener, but very minimal and nowhere near damaging.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the pads on the crimping end, I normally use my fingers to ensure more definition, occassionaly gets a little too hot</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast especially the next day shipping option.</li>
            <li> crimps really well, but only last about 5 hours max.</li>
            <li> So, my experience with the Bed Head Crimper is not due to user error.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think the iron was too hot to hold, like some other people have said.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other brands of crimpers, but this is the first time purchasing a Bed Head crimper.  </li>
            <li> We did her hair all up completely crimped for dance recital, and then several times we have just crimped a few sections for a cool effect.  </li>
            <li> I see no issues and a hopefully long relationship with my new found fave hair tool!</li>
            <li> The metal is not coated with anything, it&#x27;s just bare metal.  </li>
            <li> It was only used once so as far as continued functionality or stability, I&#x27;m unsure?</li>
            <li> I was using it on my daughters hair for maybe the fourth time when we heard a loud pop and smelled smoke.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that look on me (too wild and big)</li>
            <li> My 11 year old daughter wanted to do something different with her hair.  </li>
            <li> but at the same time made her hair so soft.  </li>
            <li> but this one completely flattens out by the next day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my old for a number of years and finally the spring gave out</li>
            <li> It also takes a long time to cool down.</li>
            <li> I received it fast and quickly became addicted.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and takes just a few minutes to crimp an entire head of hair.</li>
            <li> but my buff has had hers for two years and it works as well as the first defiantly recommend over any other hair tool it last forever will be using this till I die</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;on\\&quot; indicator light is also in an awkward region, like under an edge, near the hot plates.</li>
            <li> This crimper is for fine to medium to thick straight or slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I used to braid my daughters blonde hair when wet and take the braids out in the morning to achieve the &amp;#34;crimped&amp;#34; look, but this makes it so much easier and faster.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of using this at first, but after using it a couple of times, it is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Honestly, my hair hasn&#x27;t been that fluffy in at least a couple of decades!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The metal is a little cheap but other than that it works great😄</li>
            <li> It heats up so fast, but watch how hot you have it because I have VERY thick hair</li>
            <li> I have medium thin straight hair and this takes about 15 mins or so do to my whole head!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my 13 year old niece who has very long, straight heavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I have medium length thin, fine hair and was looking for a volume boosting tool.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thin and fine.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is that it doesnt lock closed for easy storage and power switch</li>
            <li> my hair is pin straight, was looking for something to give just a little volume.  </li>
            <li> Well her pretty long healthy hair now looks fried like adults get, very broken off all down her hair.</li>
            <li> (I thought it was a little frightening; she LOVED it).</li>
            <li> So, essentially, after about an hour, it&#x27;s simply adding a little volume and you can&#x27;t see much of the crimping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice little machine and works well (and fast!), but I&#x27;m afraid to use it too often as my hair feels really dry when I crimp it.</li>
            <li> :) The crimps are small, so like the other reviewer said, the effect is pretty dramatic.</li>
            <li> Only takes about 5-10 minutes to do her long hair.</li>
            <li> have pretty thick hair that goes to my waist-</li>
            <li> I really thought the style was forever banished to the stacks of 1980&#x27;s  vintage high school annuals, but apparently I am wrong.</li>
            <li> only improvement would be for them to make one that crimps from wet</li>
            <li> (my daughter has long hair and it took 6 crimps per section).  </li>
            <li> I did not hold it on long at all.</li>
            <li> Even without product the crimps stay for a long while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted a crimper for so long.  </li>
            <li> Should have bought this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> my daughter has wanted one for so long.  </li>
            <li> Without going into a long review, I&#x27;ll just quote what she&#x27;s been saying after using it.  </li>
            <li> even if you have really long hair</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and its very long but as long as you don&#x27;t try to crimp too much at one time</li>
            <li> rub some pomeade into your hands and gently go through your hair and that will tame it down a bit.</li>
            <li> I buy this based on the reviews of it and compare reviews of the other similar products.</li>
            <li> It is not worth the time and money to ship back.  </li>
            <li> maybe it&#x27;s a loose screw?</li>
            <li> Total let down.</li>
            <li> This product actually crimps your hair unlike all the other crimpers I have ever gotten!</li>
            <li> With a little spray after done crimping, it will last as long as you will let it.</li>
            <li> It crimps your hair in less then 10 second.</li>
            <li> Have seen it used by her several times and no hot handle issues like other models.</li>
            <li> It is very hot though and it can burn the fingers with repeated use of fingers in the wrong place.</li>
            <li> but thas way too long started smoking my hair and now have one section of my hair all dried so only for about 3-5 sec</li>
            <li> Not so much for thick blond hair!</li>
            <li> I finally broke the Crimper that I have had since I was a little girl and replaced it with this one.  </li>
            <li> Be really careful with this one.  </li>
            <li> Be really careful how you use this product.</li>
            <li> On a regular night out, I&#x27;d just crimp a few chunks of hair.</li>
            <li> so be careful.</li>
            <li> so be careful.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected...</li>
            <li> it what I expected?</li>
            <li> The crimping iron is not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> It says on the instructions for 10-15 sec for medium crimps</li>
            <li> finally broke, with daily use on thick hair that reaches my bum.</li>
            <li> (not too close or you will burn), and hold down for a couple of seconds, then release and move down to the next section.  </li>
            <li> Only bad part, you keep it on too long, it gets very hot..............</li>
            <li> There are also little notches at the end to press down for an extra crimpy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took a little long to get here but works well.</li>
            <li> If I need other items in this genre I will look for this brand.</li>
            <li> Not too big or too small krimps</li>
            <li> Not too small or big crimps,</li>
            <li> Not hot to hold.</li>
            <li> This crimper works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> This seems of less quality than I expected from Bed Head</li>
            <li> It only really loses the crimp when the hair gets wet.   </li>
            <li> I have seen numerous reviews with the same complaint and should have read them BEFORE I ordered it :/</li>
            <li> I have thin hair that always lies flat, so this is such a lifesaver!!</li>
            <li> It definitely makes small, tight crimps</li>
            <li> I was having a tough time finding a crimping iron for my nine year old.  </li>
            <li> I love it, I wanted to try new things to my boring plain hair</li>
            <li> I also want to inform you that if you plan on straightening your hair the next day shower the night before because you will wake up wit the waves still in your hair and they are hard to straighten.</li>
            <li> Only complaint the plates are not ceramic.  </li>
            <li> when I curl my hair it stays for several hours at least, but the crimp stayed a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> Also, it dried my hair out and gave it a rough texture.</li>
            <li> i have EXTREMELY thick, wavy hair, and this crimper actually crimps my hair.  </li>
            <li> one down side that you have to watch out for.</li>
            <li> so I turned it down to medium</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not let down a bit.</li>
            <li> As you can see from other customers if Crimps are what you want you will achieve it with this!</li>
            <li> Her hair is very thin and doesn&#x27;t hold a curl very well.</li>
            <li> I had mine in this weekend for 2 and a half days.</li>
            <li> Not even a bend, much less a curl or wave.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t typically style my hair... ever.  </li>
            <li> This one has 2-inch crimping plates - I figured this would help speed up the process since I don&#x27;t typically style my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and she has long thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I can even hold the plastic over the plates to close it tight.</li>
            <li> so you can squeeze it tight without getting burned.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE VERY LONG THICK HAIR</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little area that comes off the end that you can use to squeeze the iron shut.  </li>
            <li> Some people are saying it gives you a &#x27;little girl look&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I have 4 little girls</li>
            <li> I was excited when I got it but disappointed when it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that it added a little glisten or shine to my hair.</li>
            <li> Those of you with fine hair, like me, who have to use ton of products in your hair to thicken and volumize it will know how annoying and time consuming that can get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a few compliments when I crimp my hair with it.</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times now</li>
            <li> She uses it everyday to style her hair.</li>
            <li> til I wash it (which is about 3-4 days), every now then after sleeping on it will need a few pieces here and</li>
            <li> This gives you a fluffy 80s &#x27;</li>
            <li> there touched up but takes less than 5 mins if that!</li>
            <li> First of all, the heat control dial is in a very awkward spot on the handle and is very loose.  </li>
            <li> The crimps are small &amp; tight on the hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is long (shoulder length and very very thick).</li>
            <li> but I ended up looking like I had stuck my finger in an electrical socket, even though I only did a few sections randomly throughout my hair.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of my money!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it everyday !</li>
            <li> Sorry, this one is going back.</li>
            <li> I have bought two of these in the past two months and they both broke after a couple uses.</li>
            <li> This gives you like if you had a small braid in</li>
            <li> and she uses it everyday!</li>
            <li> We have done just small sections in conjunction with curls.</li>
            <li> Next time ill just do couple section of my hair.</li>
            <li> No more texturizers, ever.</li>
            <li> I found out the hard way</li>
            <li> (See: That poor little girl on Youtube.)</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t anything negative I can say about this product.  </li>
            <li> There are not alot of options out there for crimpers but of the ones I have used lately</li>
            <li> /&gt;.Many reviewers complained about the heat settings and placement of the heat settings</li>
            <li> It does make krimps through my daughter&#x27;s thick hair</li>
            <li> so use if you have thick hair.</li>
            <li> No more breakage from teasing the heck out of your hair!</li>
            <li> A little nostalgic.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick, its medium length</li>
            <li> not great for your hair</li>
            <li> The reason I gave it 4 stars is only because, everytime I use this product it smells so bad!</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin and the crimp look make my hair look thick!  </li>
            <li> I used to have a crimping iron back in the days, I hated it because it took me hours to do my hair.</li>
            <li> Looked fake, poofy and felt weird</li>
            <li> It smells like it is burning even before I put it on my hair, which is weird, but I ended up getting use to it after awhile.</li>
            <li> these are useless in my country</li>
            <li> This was very frustrating, shipping is already so expensive in Alaska now returns yikes.</li>
            <li> This was very frustrating</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very dramatic look, i think ill use it for Halloween or night clubs.</li>
            <li> waste of money and very scary!!</li>
            <li> It stinks as soon as I turn it on until the time I turn it off.</li>
            <li> This crimps like crazy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to sleeping with braids at night which can be quite painful at times.</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t been disappointed with it.  </li>
            <li> sadly, wasn&#x27;t terribly flattering on my</li>
            <li> It just makes my hair look frizzy. :(</li>
            <li> but it broke :(</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed</li>
            <li> These are impossible to find in stores!!</li>
            <li> Worst crimper ever in my opinion!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Worked perfectly my step daughter loved it.</li>
            <li> Be really careful with this one.  The metal is not coated with anything, it&#x27;s just bare metal.  It does have temperature control, so that&#x27;s something.  If you have fine hair, you only need the lowest setting for a count of 3 or less to get perfect crimps.  Be really careful how you use this product.</li>
            <li> Ok, so the iron is great but remember when crimping hair its best on fine, thin hair. Not so much for thick blond hair! It poofs out and not so sure that was the look I was going for! Looked fake, poofy and felt weird lol. I found out the hard way</li>
            <li> I used this crimper for my cruise, (80&#x27;s Party) and I loved it. It works great and stays for hours!!!! I wish crimping would come back already.</li>
            <li> This crimper doesnt take long to do and is easy to use. You can crimp the whole head or just sections, whatever you would like. My daughter loves it and quick shipping too</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and great product.</li>
            <li> It works great and does not even look tacky like I thought it would</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this crimper.  Works well.  Never had any problems with it after 2 years.</li>
            <li> I bought this crimper as a gift for my mother and she loves it. I have seen her a few times using it and it makes her hair all nice and wavy. She said that it works really well. The shipping was fast especially the next day shipping option.</li>
            <li> just as advertised, but quality was even better! thank you</li>
            <li> I purchased this crimper for a specific reason. I was going to an 80&#x27;s prom themed party. I was totally relying on this thing! It only worked for 1/2 my head and did not work for everyone else&#x27;s! Total let down. The thing did not heat up at all!</li>
            <li> I love crimping my hair with this crimper!  Looking like I am straight outta the 90&#x27;s again!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Easier than using regular curling iron.  Takes Me half the time to do my whole head!! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> got this for my daughter (10) as she got into braiding her hair to make it curly. I used a crimper as a kid and figured it would give her that look she wanted without braids and rubberbands. worked great. Easy for her to use. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great. Fast delivery.  Heats up fast. Works excellent.  Had lots of compliments when used to crimp hair. Love it</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for, heats up fast and is very user friendly.</li>
            <li> The metal is a little cheap but other than that it works great😄</li>
            <li> my daughter loves this crimper.  it works great and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this purchase. I have worn the same hairstyle for most of my adult life and recently decided that I wanted to start experimenting with it. Despite lack of knowledge in hairstyling, I found the crimping iron easy to use. The results were exactly what I had been hoping for! It helped add volume and texture to my straw straight long hair. The product is attractive with its rich, sparkly teal color and high quality. Bed Head is a company I trust to deliver excellent products, and I have found everything I hoped for and more with my purchase.</li>
            <li> VERY GENTLE ON MY FINE HAIR, VERY SMALL TINY CRIMPS, CREATES LOTS OF VOLUME, HIGHLY RECOMMNDED, AFFORDABLE, DOES NOT OVER HEAT</li>
            <li> I have just tried these and they won&#x27;t get warm or hot can you help please. ? I just took it for granted they would work....Rita   I do not agree to pay for postage of return. Advise me about free postage of return.....Rita</li>
            <li> I like it, a good adition to my styling tools. The crimps are small &amp; tight on the hair. It&#x27;s a very dramatic look, i think ill use it for Halloween or night clubs. I was looking more for bigger size crimps on my hair so I&#x27;ll keep looking for a crimper that does bigger size crimps. Other than that, it heats up quick &amp; crimps hair fast.</li>
            <li> Present for niece. She loves it.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> This crimper works really well on my long, fine hair. It heats up fast and stays hot, and the crimps last a long time. I used it for an 80s party last night, slept on my crimps, and my hair still looks pretty decent (minus the bed head). :) The crimps are small, so like the other reviewer said, the effect is pretty dramatic. On a regular night out, I&#x27;d just crimp a few chunks of hair. Definitely a good addition to my stash of hair tools!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult woman, well-experienced with hair tools.  I&#x27;ve been using a straightener for ten or twelve years, and a curling iron for years before that. So, my experience with the Bed Head Crimper is not due to user error. (See: That poor little girl on Youtube.) While I was crimping my hair with this product for a costume party, it smelled funny, so I stopped using it. The next day when I washed my hair (and got the crimps out) I noticed some of my hair was singed and burnt. I would only keep the crimper on a section of hair for 4-5 seconds, and had no product on it, so the crimper was just too hot. I think the heating mechanism was faulty. When I emailed Bed Head about it, they were unresponsive. I do not recommend this crimper.</li>
            <li> I have always loved crimped hair and have not had a crimping iron for years. One evening I expressed a strong desire to have one again. Someone suggested I look online for one. The selection I made (Bed Head Totally Bent Chrome Crimper 2-inch) was a good one. The product worked just as I hoped. The lowest setting crimped my hair wonderfully. I am so happy to have this product. I highly recommend it. I felt as though this was a brand that had a reputation to live up to and it certainly has so far.</li>
            <li> Really nice crimp. Full size ,gets hot! 2 girls with waist length hair and it gets the hair crimped in no time. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old and I both use this... WE LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> My daughter and niece love it when I crimp their hair.  It does a great job</li>
            <li> My girlfriend wanted this for an 80&#x27;s themed Halloween party. It worked well for both her and her friend, with no issues. It was only used once so as far as continued functionality or stability, I&#x27;m unsure?</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it needs to be doing , needed this for a 80 party</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it. Perfect waves</li>
            <li> Makes beautiful waves</li>
            <li> Loved how it gives my hair more texture but it spoilt after 3 uses. What a waste of my money!</li>
            <li> Fast and works like a champ!</li>
            <li> my hair stylist was using this to create my hair volume and it worked magic. I love this hair crimper and I&#x27;ve been using it everyday !</li>
            <li> This Product is fantastic. Cheaper than in the stores, Heats up, and Crimps very well. I crimp my hair often with this product, I love it. GET THIS PRODUCT. ITS AWESOME.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great tool, I have a lot of fine curly hair and was able to style it on a lower heat setting and it turned out great!</li>
            <li> This seems of less quality than I expected from Bed Head but it works well and gives hair a fun crimp style.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it. It gets super hot, which is good for my thick hair, it defiantly gives it volume, I did all my hair, and just got a lot of compliments, I like the, 80s look it gives, but I burned my ear and finger many times, because of the plates on the side, but it still deserves, 5 stars, I love it!!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this crimper based on the reviews here.  I have medium length thin, fine hair and was looking for a volume boosting tool.  This was on sale at the local Ulta store, plus I had a coupon, so I thought I would give it a try.  First of all, the heat control dial is in a very awkward spot on the handle and is very loose.  A red light comes on when you plug it in.  I don&#x27;t know if the light is supposed to turn green when it&#x27;s ready, but even on the lowest heat setting the light never changed color.  The deal breaker was when I tried it on my hair.  Despite using a thermal protective spray beforehand, my hair looked fried.  It definitely makes small, tight crimps but I ended up looking like I had stuck my finger in an electrical socket, even though I only did a few sections randomly throughout my hair.  Sorry, this one is going back.</li>
            <li> Pretty good!my daughter love it.</li>
            <li> I love to crimp my hair- no crimpers in the stores anymore cause everyone wants to go straight- but this is a GREAT crimper!  Heats quickly, crimps evenly- love it- only improvement would be for them to make one that crimps from wet like they do with some straighteners.  Love the 80s!</li>
            <li> This works fine.  I was having a tough time finding a crimping iron for my nine year old.  She&#x27;s happy with the job it does.</li>
            <li> Bought this to use for an 80s theme party and it worked really well and super easy to use. Great product. Love the temperature control setting.</li>
            <li> This has lived up to the positive reviews we read before buying it.  This is the best crimper.</li>
            <li> I finally broke the Crimper that I have had since I was a little girl and replaced it with this one.  It has done wonderfully.  I have really thick hair and its very long but as long as you don&#x27;t try to crimp too much at one time it works great.  It gets really hot and quickly.  Holds the heat well!  I am very pleased with it... and I&#x27;m a picky person when it comes to using things on my hair and I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have never owned or used a crimper before. I wanted to try it so I found this one. It had good reviews and rightly so. It works exactly like it&#x27;s suppose to. The crimp stays in for days too. I had mine in this weekend for 2 and a half days. It only really loses the crimp when the hair gets wet.   It is a very pretty blue color too. It doesn&#x27;t take long to heat up and the lowest setting works perfect for my fine, long hair. This was a great value. It seems professional without the high price.  I crimped the front part of my hair before work Friday. It took no time at all and it completely transformed my look. People at work complimented me on it and my boyfriend said I looked like a different person.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product. If I need other items in this genre I will look for this brand.</li>
            <li> This definitely gives me the 80&#x27;s look without too much of an effort and salon prepping. I love that it&#x27;s colored blue. I&#x27;ve been in love with this color for as long as I can remember and it&#x27;s also very easy to grip. Love this thingy!</li>
            <li> daughter loves the crimper</li>
            <li> It does make krimps through my daughter&#x27;s thick hair and she&#x27;s happy with it. Not too big or too small krimps but does get hot so be careful.</li>
            <li> I wish they had one inch. It would work better this one is big so use if you have thick hair. Over all its super cute style.</li>
            <li> Kids loved it! They had a lot of fun turning themselves into 80&#x27;s wavy head girls :-)  Good quality. Good price, especially considering I&#x27;ve seen these in stores for 2 and 3x the price. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> These are impossible to find in stores!! I looked on Amazon for a cheap crimper and found two. The first one didn&#x27;t get great reviews so I bought this one. I love it! I like the look of it. And I can make my hair really neat looking with it. I&#x27;ve gotten a few compliments when I crimp my hair with it. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a crimper. I always have it on the lowest setting and it&#x27;s plenty hot!</li>
            <li> Great crimper! Works perfectly and my daughter loves it. She also loves the color. Love Bed Head products! Great buy!</li>
            <li> It worked great! I bought it to use on my daughter for a performance she was in. Good sized plates and it worked really quickly which was important because my daughter has a ton of hair. Gets REALLY hot so be careful but that is probably one of the reasons it works so quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> Got this to create some 80&#x27;s hair for my daughter. It works great, heats up very quick. And all her friends now think having a couple crimped chunks of hair is  a NEW idea!!! Haha!!</li>
            <li> Love this crimper!  Cost is very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;Once you crimp your hair - do NOT run your fingers through it or the hair will look frizzy on the ends.  Recommend using an argan oil type of hair smoothing product with crimper to decrease frizziness.</li>
            <li> Handles easily so for. Just getting use to moving it around my hair so it will do what I want.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who wanted crimpy hair.  I almost works too well!!!!  She was sure crimpy and next time I will only do the top layer of hair instead of all of it because she made me pull it back it was so big.  This Crimper works way better than a $25 Conair 3 in 1 I bought, tried and then returned because it barely made any crimps.  If you want a great crimper you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> My girls love this! Couldn&#x27;t asked for better! My 7 and 10 year olds can use this product with ease.</li>
            <li> This product is really good.It crimps your hair in less then 10 second.Even for the most thickest hair it works. You just have to make sure to straighten your hair if you want perfect results</li>
            <li> still works great my hair looks fabulous and never had to retouch until i washed the hair last long and came super fast it also heats up really fast and i finish my whole hair in 20 minutes also works great for volume looks like dolly porton when i am done lol</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a Christmas gift, but she loves it!!!  You were the only &amp;#34;store&amp;#34; i shopped.  Always pleased with all aspects of site and availibility of items needed.</li>
            <li> Works really well. My hair feels fluffy and free after using it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Bed Head crimper for my daughter for Christmas as she had a crimper on her list, and this one looked the coolest out of the ones I found on Amazon.  We haven&#x27;t been disappointed with it.  It is very stylish looking and she loved that.  As far as how it works, it is very easy to use.  You just take a section of hair, start near the root (not too close or you will burn), and hold down for a couple of seconds, then release and move down to the next section.  It does take longer than a curling iron would because depending on your hair length, you have to do several crimps on each hair section (my daughter has long hair and it took 6 crimps per section).  We did her hair all up completely crimped for dance recital, and then several times we have just crimped a few sections for a cool effect.  She loves it and I do as well.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;It heats really fast, and does your hair sooooo quickly! I get compliments every time I crimp my hair.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT product, GREAT price!</li>
            <li> Perfect for our 80&#x27;s party.  Worked great, even on my thick hair.  Like that the heat setting is adjustable!</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and fine.  I had a crimper before when I was younger. Now that my hair is fine and thin this really adds body and volume.  It has settings for heat control which I like so it does not burn your hair.  I like the narrower crimping rather than the wider ones.  I also bought the mini-crimper by Bed Head which is good for roots and touchup.  The crimps stay in for a couple of days which I am very surprised.</li>
            <li> Love my crimper. The only negative is that it doesnt lock closed for easy storage and power switch is tiny.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my 13 year old niece who has very long, straight heavy hair.  She had no problem using it and the results were very pretty.  Price was great compared to some of the others out there.  Hopefully, it&#x27;ll hold up for awhile.</li>
            <li> I just LOVE this crimper--I know, so 80s of me. But it&#x27;s awesome!  It works perfectly, and the end result is super fun!</li>
            <li> I love crimping irons and most of the ones the sell in the stores are too small to crimp more than a strand or two but this one is full size and works great, love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this so that I could do my daughters&#x27; hair. They are ages 7 and 9, and I just earned some super awesome MOM points with this purchase. My 9 year old has super thick hair, and I thought maybe I would have to go up on the settings from \\&quot;low\\&quot;, however, it does her hair perfectly. My 7 year old \\&quot;fashionista\\&quot; wants me to do her hair every.single.day.  Even with her fine hair, I use the low setting, and it holds perfectly. I purchased this, initially, because Halloween is coming up. I had resisted this purchase for a long time, because I very specifically remember throwing mine away.... a looooong time ago.  Crimped hair hasn&#x27;t really caught on in our area yet, so the girls feel like trend setters :)  All their friends are now begging for their hair to be crimped. YAY ME!!  Now onto the actual product.  On the low setting (even after I have forgotten that I plugged it in) it doesn&#x27;t get very hot.  I can even hold the plastic over the plates to close it tight. However, I don&#x27;t really need to. There&#x27;s a little area that comes off the end that you can use to squeeze the iron shut.  It&#x27;s a very beautiful color, doesn&#x27;t take long to warm up, and is overall a very awesome product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(maybe I&#x27;ll even flashback and do some of my hair before the girls get home ;)</li>
            <li> I ordered this to do my hair for a skit. It was perfect and worked great!  It has a temperature dial, so you can adjust heat settings. :)</li>
            <li> Gets really hot. But all in all, it&#x27;s a nice crimper.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she absolutely loves this thing. She uses it every day. Seems like a great product.</li>
            <li> Works great on my daughter&#x27;s fine hair.  Gave her so much body!</li>
            <li> This crimper is probably the best purchase I&#x27;ve made from Amazon so far!&lt;br /&gt;it heats up almost instantly on the lowest setting too!&lt;br /&gt;Extremely happy and satisfied with this product! :)</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with the results ! i used it twice and the result was just like the advertisements.</li>
            <li> love it, but my hair poofs out when using it. ! will definitely use more when my hair grows out.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great! works on all types of hair.</li>
            <li> I used to have a crimping iron back in the days, I hated it because it took me hours to do my hair. So I wanted to buy a different tool to do my hair, and bed head crimper  2 inch kept popping up. So I started looking in my local stores but for my surprise they were all sold out. So since I wanted it A.S.A.P I decided to buy it through amazon. Very pleased with this product. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my pre teen. She loves it. It&#x27;s fun and reminds me of my younger days. A little nostalgic.</li>
            <li> Love the color, hot really quick, easy to use and put away, good products overall, definitely recommend to everyone, worth the trial</li>
            <li> I wish I could leave a review, but the package was stolen off of my front porch!</li>
            <li> I love it! Works perfectly, just like back in the day.</li>
            <li> Great for the price!! You cant beat it. It works great and it&#x27;s better than most crimpers that I have had in the past. Trust me, this is a great buy. It shipped really fast to my house and the quality is really great!! It gets hot fast!! Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> This was a wonderful way to give my hair volume and not burn me! It was inexpensive but it has great quality! I love this brand bed head😜</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughters spa bday party. It came in and we were in a hurry but she wanted me to put some in her hair. So I put I on high setting and quickly did her hair. Even though it was on high I did not hold it on long at all. Well her pretty long healthy hair now looks fried like adults get, very broken off all down her hair. If you use this please keep it only on low setting. It&#x27;s a shame. I&#x27;m throwing it in the trash.</li>
            <li> works great, no weird smell after ive finished styling my hair and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on the iron when i use products.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! Even my daughter has taken to this crimper. I&#x27;m used to sleeping with braids at night which can be quite painful at times. Especially one who is prone to headaches easily. This makes it easy to use and people at work love the way it looks!</li>
            <li> i absolutely love it. it works great.</li>
            <li> DD wanted for Christmas.  Great price.  Only complaint the plates are not ceramic.  Crimp looks great, but makes hair quite static.</li>
            <li> Does the job, doesn&#x27;t look too frizzy or crispy</li>
            <li> Works fairly well for the price you pay!</li>
            <li> I have short hair and I absolutely love this crimper. It is fast and heats up quick. I love playing with my hair and just fell in love with this product. I have to say that I think that it would look better on longer hair, but I have a bob and still love it.</li>
            <li> I used to braid my daughters blonde hair when wet and take the braids out in the morning to achieve the &amp;#34;crimped&amp;#34; look, but this makes it so much easier and faster. Although, it does make her hair super poofy like Dianna Ross, but she loves that effect.  And the steam from the crimper on the hair tends to burn my thumbs, so I have to blow on it when I have it on her hair. Other than those two complaints I love it.</li>
            <li> I have bought two of these in the past two months and they both broke after a couple uses.</li>
            <li> My wife just had to have this. Her hair is on the fine side so anything that adds body, especially to the roots is great (her words). This crimper works great, runs pretty hot, even just on the medium setting so be careful. Even without product the crimps stay for a long while. Very good for a messy look.</li>
            <li> does good work!!! i like it a lot. its a lot better than the other brands and works great! havent had any problems with it</li>
            <li> Xmas for my daughter and received it in two days and she absolutely loves it!!!!! It was exactly what she wanted color and all! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Worked ok the first few timed i used it on my daughters hair.  I was using it on my daughters hair for maybe the fourth time when we heard a loud pop and smelled smoke.  It wouldn&#x27;t turn on again after that.  waste of money and very scary!!</li>
            <li> This crimper is for fine to medium to thick straight or slightly wavy hair. It works great for that type of hair. I recommend straighting your hair before you crimp if you want to create a sleek look. I was so excited to use mine that I did my whole head at first and I found out I don&#x27;t like that look on me (too wild and big) peacing it and creating a sleek look is best on me. I have long blonde fine hair (but a lot of hair) and I like to wear it sleek with some pieces crimped. Hope that helps!</li>
            <li> So easy to use!  I was able to style my daughter&#x27;s hair in under 20 minutes.  This is a must have for crimp lovers!</li>
            <li> I love this product , my first time buying this tool and i love it and amazing results.</li>
            <li> It heats up so fast, but watch how hot you have it because I have VERY thick hair and when I first used it I had it on medium and I smelled my hair and it smelled almost burnt.  I put it on a lower setting and it worked awesome.  I thought it would take a long time to crimp my hair because there is so much of it; however, once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s very quick.  There isn&#x27;t anything negative I can say about this product.  The price was great too.  It&#x27;s everything you should get in a crimper and more. The quality is great and and it doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s going to break at all soon.</li>
            <li> The large plate makes it way easier to use.  My 10 year old daughter loves it and it doesn&#x27;t take a ton of time to get her whole head done and she has long thick hair.  Great quality for a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use on my hair for an 80&#x27;s party.  The iron crimps vert well, but when raised to the highest setting, smoke comes off your hair as you are crimping and literally burns your hair.  I think the product works well, but definitely on medium setting.</li>
            <li> It works fast and well. Nice deep crimps. The only thing that could make it better is if it was dual voltage, as I travel a lot.</li>
            <li> it was a gift, she loves it</li>
            <li> Bought his for my daughter for her birthday and she was so excited, until she plugged it in and we went to do her hair! It did not work at all, wouldn&#x27;t heat up.... But, we have an exchange coming so we will see how it works!</li>
            <li> i saw a bunch of pics recently on pinterest with girls with crimped hair and started the search on amazon--definitely didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot of money for it since it would infrequently used at best and also didn&#x27;t want big crimps--i specifically wanted smaller ones. this is it. inexpensive, works, looks like i wanted it to. sadly, wasn&#x27;t terribly flattering on my but i&#x27;m not giving up yet (and def wasn&#x27;t the crimper&#x27;s fault)! not great for your hair i&#x27;m sure, but if your&#x27;e crimping your hair every day you prob aren&#x27;t too worried about that i&#x27;m guessing...</li>
            <li> Love it!! I received it fast and quickly became addicted. Love it and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected... good product but my only complaint is the heat shield from the handle to to crimper plates is non existent so you do have to watch out when using.</li>
            <li> Had to buy a second one for my daughters friend for her birthday. They are 11 yrs old and all the girls love it.  Works very well!</li>
            <li> Works just fine. Nice to have the heat settings as well.</li>
            <li> This hair crimper is a good product. This gives you like if you had a small braid in then you take it out my daughter loves this!</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair, I use this by the scalp and it give my hair great volume.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a 14 year old.  She loved it and it did great with her hair.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping love this</li>
            <li> I bought this crimper as a gift for someone but ended up keeping it for myself becuase she got a crimper before I could give her the gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never owned a crimper before but lately I&#x27;ve seen some fun looks that I wanted to try.  I set the iron on the highest heat setting (I have straight, medium-thick hair) and I feel like I burnt my hair. I didn&#x27;t think the iron was too hot to hold, like some other people have said.  The crimps are somewhat small or tight but they produce great volume! The next day, the crimps still looked good.  I don&#x27;t know how often I&#x27;ll use this product, but I think it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. I received as a gift and used it three times already! I love it! Great look, nice volume, and reminds me of an 80&#x27;s look!</li>
            <li> Works great! No problems so far, my kids even like it when I crimp their hair! I recommend that if you are doing children&#x27;s hair to do their hair right away after plugging it in, no need to wait for it to heat up (it can get really hot fast!). Love it! Would buy it again and recommend it to others :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughters first father daughter dance. Her hair is very thin and doesn&#x27;t hold a curl very well. We love this crimper! Works great on the low-med setting and crimps without poofing. Would recommend for a fun and cute style for your little one!</li>
            <li> It took a little long to get here but works well. I was impressed by the packaging and how sturdy the box was and all. It seems like it&#x27;s made of kinda cheap quality though. But still works great.</li>
            <li> the product was a great crimp er. Its works very well and fast. the only problem i had with it was it got really hot and damaged your hair i would recommend a heat tamer before use. It also takes a long time to cool down. over all though it was a very good crimper.</li>
            <li> It does what it suppose to!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love this!! Brings back memories of the 80&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loved it as a gift.</li>
            <li> This product is great :) It heats up nicely :) And my hair was crimped for a week! A hair straightener couldn&#x27;t even get all of the \\&quot;crimp\\&quot; out. So beware of the product&#x27;s effectiveness :). Other than that it works great :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE CRIMP COMES OUT PERFECT!</li>
            <li> Love this I was worried because of the negative comments because but my buff has had hers for two years and it works as well as the first defiantly recommend over any other hair tool it last forever will be using this till I die</li>
            <li> Do I like it? Yes.&lt;br /&gt;Is it what I expected? No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works and it looks like the item in the picture, HOWEVER, the crimp does not come out as shown in the picture with the model. The crimps are much closer together and not as defined. I have used it a few times now and I do not get the same crimp as seen in the pic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, while the crimper works, it was assembled or stickered incorrectly as &amp;#34;ON&amp;#34; is &amp;#34;OFF&amp;#34; and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;Good thing there&#x27;s a light that works in the &amp;#34;On&amp;#34; position so you know for sure.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!!</li>
            <li> Fun-daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> If you want the traditional 80&#x27;s look of highly crimped hair this crimper is the way to go. Beware though, this gives you a very crimped look. This is nothing close to a waver. Some people are saying it gives you a &#x27;little girl look&#x27;. This will make your hair big and somewhat frizzy. I have 4 little girls and they simply love this look. I even put 4 small crimped pieces into the top of my hair which was also incredibly cute. The handle does get too hot though, one down side that you have to watch out for. Upside, it&#x27;s very hot which makes this a quick job. The size is also nice to speed up the process.</li>
            <li> My 11 year old daughter wanted to do something different with her hair.  I told her about crimpers I used to have growing up.  I went on Amazon to do a Crimper search and I found this one with great reviews...great reviews with a great price...so I purchased it and used it on her hair the day after we received it.  She loved it.  It gave her hair those adorable zig zag waves but at the same time made her hair so soft.  Her old brother couldn&#x27;t believe how soft her hair felt.  That was an added bonus!</li>
            <li> I love it, I wanted to try new things to my boring plain hair so I sparked it up by crimping and I love the volume and smoothness it creates. I recommend this for everybody :)</li>
            <li> Works great! 8 and 10 year old girls love the look and so fun.</li>
            <li> Got this for our grand daughter. Have seen it used by her several times and no hot handle issues like other models. She is 7 yrs old soon and just loves it. :-)</li>
            <li> I just wanted a crimping iron to use for my daughter to have some fun with.  It&#x27;s not for every day use.  It works just fine though.  it seems pretty easy to use and safe as well.  I don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
            <li> My Mother used to own one of these and I loved when she would crimp my hair. As my daughters got older, I couldn&#x27;t help but want to crimp their hair. I looked all over town and finally succumbed to the idea I would have to order one online and wait for it to be shipped. Well, good ole&#x27; Amazon Prime came to my rescue and I had my crimper before I knew it. I am so glad we ordered it and it works great!</li>
            <li> I received the crimp iron within a week.  Pretty blue/green plastic outside with swivel cord.  Used for 80&#x27;s theme on halloween, work great for crimping.  I would only give if 4 stars because it was pretty hot to hold onto, should have been made with a heavier plastic to insulate.  And the 2 in. was great for getting my long hair done quickly.</li>
            <li> I crimped only hair my hair on a Saturday for dinner.... and husband loved my hair, sister loved my hair, friends loved my hair...and it was perfect for Monday also boss liked it and my colleagues too. After so many compliments...obviously!!! i totally loved it &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> The crimping iron is not what I expected.  I thought it would make a larger &amp;#34;crimping&amp;#34; pattern.  It just makes my hair look frizzy. :(</li>
            <li> Purchased from Ulta, not via Amazon, but thought I&#x27;d throw my 2 cents in.  Purchased for my daughter who is 13.  It is best on the low or medium settings (even on my super super thick hair) as it starts to smell like burning plastic and does crimp the hair too deeply on high.  I do wish it had a feature where the 2 plates could be clamped together when laying on bathroom counter like my BaByliss straightener does.  I thought crimping would never come back from the darkest depths of the 1980s, but it is back.  If you are looking not to spend $50 on something your kid will use for 6 months this is a decent product.  The \\&quot;on\\&quot; indicator light is also in an awkward region, like under an edge, near the hot plates.</li>
            <li> I was very exticed when this came in. I tested out right away and it crimped my hair very fast. I recommend using heat protectant spray because the heat can be very damaging.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a Christmas gift to my niece. She loved it!!  It worked perfectly, it had a great grip to hold her fine long hair and it was hot.  Great price for  this product that works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted a crimper for so long.  Finally found one on Amazon. Gets really hot really fast.  If you have fine/thin hair better just keep it on medium heat.  Crimps last until washed out.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I got this for my birthday about a month ago. I was very skeptical of using this at first, but after using it a couple of times, it is fantastic! My hair is very thick, its medium length so when I get to crimp my hair with this, I end up having the most epic hair style ever! This hair style is great for parties and going on a night out. The reason I gave it 4 stars is only because, everytime I use this product it smells so bad! It stinks as soon as I turn it on until the time I turn it off. It smells like it is burning even before I put it on my hair, which is weird, but I ended up getting use to it after awhile. Be careful using this, because this gets really hot. Other than that, this product is so cool! It feels like I&#x27;m living in the 80&#x27;s even though I was born in the 90&#x27;s ;) I recommend this to anyone who wants to try it ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S Also if you want to learn how to crimp your hair, go on YouTube and look up some videos to give you an idea of how it would look. That&#x27;s what I did to encourage my purchase of this product. :)</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier. Heats up fast--makes perfect small crimps. Great for a quick styling tool. Will purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> It works amazingly great, and I personally love this brand. I bought it as a gift for a friend and she uses it everyday!</li>
            <li> crimps really well, but only last about 5 hours max. i liked the next day look with my old crimper but this one completely flattens out by the next day.</li>
            <li> Not us expected but love it!</li>
            <li> I have not used this product yet but it looks pretty sturdy. The size is good  and I love the color. It came in a secure package. It came on time.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to give the after braided look and this did it and more!! I love the look and it lasts for days if I want it to. It is very hot though and it can burn the fingers with repeated use of fingers in the wrong place. It&#x27;s easy to use and not to heavy.&lt;br /&gt;Also, do not use this on the highest heat setting! The iron is VERY hot and will make your hair smell and break if used on the highest setting. You MUST use a heat protect spray on your hair before use and make sure the setting is at 50% - 75% power. I have been using one spray by Tresemme (it has red writing on it and a spray nozzle with a trigger on it) it seems to work well. hopefully this helps. Happy crimping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 4/19/15&lt;br /&gt;It finally broke, with daily use on thick hair that reaches my bum. I bought another one because I&#x27;ve had many crimpers but this one has the best crimp and heat control. I love it!!</li>
            <li> Heats Up Quickly, Gets real Hot.  The Two inch width was the way to go covers more hair.  Ordered with ease, Arrived on time estimated, and as shown, I dont like being required to put in a certain amount of words for review!!!</li>
            <li> This was a present for a teen who wanted a crimper. She hasnt used it yet, but it appears to be nice.</li>
            <li> My daughter had been asking for a crimper for a while now, I read the reviews on this one and decided to give it a try, I am glad I did!! It&#x27;s awesome</li>
            <li> Bought this for my thirteen year old, she used it once now it won&#x27;t heat up.  This was very frustrating</li>
            <li> Worst crimper ever in my opinion! Don&#x27;t waster your money.</li>
            <li> My daughters love this. Would have given this 5 stars but I burn my fingers on the plates that are exposed on the straight side every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I love this tool! Gives me the 80s look that I am looking for. It heats up fairly fast and crimps quickly as well minimizing any damage to the hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  It&#x27;s great. It do everything that it&#x27;s supposed to do like the label said.  Great for the price and fun to use.</li>
            <li> Gets HOT on the High setting, maybe a little too hot, but does the crimping job well!  This was a big hit for my daughter</li>
            <li> If you have fine, oily or really long hair, the crimp doesn&#x27;t tend to stay very long, even with product. I have all three. So, essentially, after about an hour, it&#x27;s simply adding a little volume and you can&#x27;t see much of the crimping. But, the volume does tend to stay. And it does help with flyaways. I just won&#x27;t be rocking the &#x27;80s full crimp like I want.</li>
            <li> I would like to start out with the fact that I am 30 and love crimped hair. I didin&#x27;t buy this for drill teamers or a teenage daughter... yup, I got it for myself just becuase I love crimped hair :)&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty thick hair that goes to my waist- and I was able to crimp ALL of it in about an hour. The heat settings work nicely- I started out HIGH because it seems I always have to use HIGH- but I believe that was starting to burn my hair so I turned it down to medium and it worked perfectly. I sectioned my hair off and only had to hold the crimper on my hair for a count of 5ish at the top, and maybe 3 at the bottom since my hair gets thinner towards the bottom. THIS WILL GIVE YOU BIG HAIR! If you crimp your hair and then brush through it- prepare for big hair- rub some pomeade into your hands and gently go through your hair and that will tame it down a bit. If you are just doing sections- it will be more defined if you dont comb through it.&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the finger tip plates at the end of the crimper so that you can use that to clamp down instead of touching the crimper because the plastic does heat up.&lt;br /&gt;At this point- I see no issues and a hopefully long relationship with my new found fave hair tool!</li>
            <li> I use this to give more volume to my hair. It crimps great! Not too small or big crimps, just right. It keeps squeaking when I use it though...maybe it&#x27;s a loose screw?</li>
            <li> Loving this throwback to the 80&#x27;s!  :) My daughter has long hair and loves this thing! We have done her whole head (I thought it was a little frightening; she LOVED it). We have done just small sections in conjunction with curls.</li>
            <li> I like this crimper, it heats up fast, I have fine hair and using the crimper makes my hair feel thicker.  Only bad part, you keep it on too long, it gets very hot..............</li>
            <li> Daughter loves it. Only takes about 5-10 minutes to do her long hair. Just have to be careful doesn&#x27;t get too hot. We always use low setting. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Looked nice and l like it!  Not sure there&#x27;s a whole lot more to say! Alright! Love this stuff! Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I use on highest setting and it works FAST!  So much faster than curling iron, and something different. :). Love it!  Not necessary, but thinking about getting the mini size too, but this size is perfect and awesome!  A little more drying than a curling iron or straightener, but very minimal and nowhere near damaging.  Love it!  Highly recommend trying it!  Oh, and the color is awesome too!  :)</li>
            <li> Have had this crimper for a over  two years and still works very well, does a wonderful job in my daughters straight flat hair</li>
            <li> i purchased this for my 10 year old niece thinking it might be too much for her to handle but she did ask for one, it works great not like the crimpers from the old days if you purchase to buy heat protectent spray for the hair</li>
            <li> I got this for the great reviews, but it didn&#x27;t work very well for me. the crimp didn&#x27;t stay in my hair at all. when I curl my hair it stays for several hours at least, but the crimp stayed a couple of minutes. What  a time waster.</li>
            <li> It does not burn your hair but use the lowest heat setting possible. Crimps very nice if used correctly of course.</li>
            <li> This crimper does not crimp hair as much as it makes it look very fuzzy.  It is not worth the time and money to ship back.  Next time I will buy one from a local beauty supply store so returning it (if need be) will be easier.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these after I lost my crimper from the 1980&#x27;s and this is a great purchase.  It heats up very quickly and very hot (but has nice lower settings too) and works great.  I highly recommend for anyone wanting to style part of their hair or all of it.  It crimps very quickly, so even if you are doing your whole head, it doesn&#x27;t take too long.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> It is an awsome one, it heats up really fast and makes nice and defined crimps. I use it every morning, and will until it breaks</li>
            <li> Fantastic! So much better than the old ones from 20 years ago. I received it tonight and already used it. It was fast and I only needed the lowest setting. My hair is medium to moderate in thickness and it worked beautifully. Not hot to hold. Does work better if you use your free hand to pinch the end together on the fingerhold. Overall very pleased.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for one of my friends, she was excited about 90&#x27;s hair. It works well and it was delivered pretty fast. Within two days. All and all good experience.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughter loves this thing.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my 12yr old daughter,  and she loves it! Thinking about using it myself. Gets really hot though so be careful.</li>
            <li> My daughter really likes this product.  She definitely channels the 80&#x27;s.  :)  My only complaint is the pads on the crimping end, I normally use my fingers to ensure more definition, occassionaly gets a little too hot</li>
            <li> I used it (and loved it) 3 times and then it stopped working, it doesn&#x27;t heat up!!! I have seen numerous reviews with the same complaint and should have read them BEFORE I ordered it :/</li>
            <li> Perfect touch for the alternative look.</li>
            <li> Great Item!  Use it daily and it&#x27;s been a while and still perfect.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE ALL TIME BEST. I PROMISE YOU WILL BE VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PURCHASE. I HAVE VERY LONG THICK HAIR AND IT&#x27;S WORKS PERFECT ON THE LOWEST SETTING. I&#x27;M SO HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT AND THE SELLER SHIPPED VERY FAST.&lt;br /&gt;I USE MY CRIMPER OFTEN. EVEN WHEN I GO TO SLEEP AND WAKE UP IT&#x27;S STILL CRIMPED. AND WILL STAY THAT WAY ALL DAY. DON&#x27;T HESITATE TO BUY. VERY WELL WORTH THE MONEY. ACTUALLY SHOULD BE WORTH MORE.YOU WILL LOVE IT I PROMISE</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it!  We use it to crimp her hair and it works amazing!</li>
            <li> This works super well! It heats up quickly and the waves last all day. You&#x27;ll get a lot of attention from this hairstyle. BEWARE!</li>
            <li> I buy this based on the reviews of it and compare reviews of the other similar products. I really like this tool. It gives the desired volume and style which is really cool</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loved it. She uses it everyday to style her hair. The crimper works very good. Thanks Amazon.com and Bed Head.</li>
            <li> This crimps like crazy.  if that&#x27;s the look you want then this is the iron for you.  Good price too.</li>
            <li> this is fast, can do the job..love the effect you get from this crimper, I&#x27;am a Cosmetolgist.it is great..Buy it.</li>
            <li> This was for my 13 year old neice who wanted to crimp her hair. She loves it and it does a good job.</li>
            <li> This crimping iron worked very well.  My daughter has had a blast fixing her hair with it.  Also it did not damage her hair.</li>
            <li> I use to own a crimper a few years but it broke :( I loved how well it worked. I didn&#x27;t think I would ever find a crimper like or better than my first. Then, I found this crimper by Bed head and was happy again :D It arrived in perfect condition. It has a low and high setting. Heats really well. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> This Crimper is the best yet.  I have long blonde hair and enjoy crimping my hair often.  I&#x27;ve had other brands of crimpers, but this is the first time purchasing a Bed Head crimper.  This crimper works extremely well.  The adjustable heat function is a wonderful option to have.  The slim design and the end tip for pressing is great.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my thirteen year old, she used it once now it won&#x27;t heat up..This was very frustrating, shipping is already so expensive in Alaska now returns yikes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this Crimper! I&#x27;ve had my old for a number of years and finally the spring gave out, I came on here and found the amazing product and since have been in love! I have medium thin straight hair and this takes about 15 mins or so do to my whole head! It heats up very quickly and works like a charm! It does have controled heat setting. I found when I do my hair it will pretty much stay \\&quot;Crimped\\&quot; til I wash it (which is about 3-4 days), every now then after sleeping on it will need a few pieces here and there touched up but takes less than 5 mins if that! I hardly use any pre-product anymore and still can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m one of these people raving about how amazing this product is! As you can see from other customers if Crimps are what you want you will achieve it with this! I promise you won&#x27;t be dissappointed and probably be on here next writing pretty much the same I just did, enjoy and Happy Crimping!</li>
            <li> Heats up very quickly, you don&#x27;t have to hold it on the strand of hair for more than 5-10 seconds to get a long-lasting crimp.</li>
            <li> Works amazing!!!! Best one I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> Heats up so hot that the hair is instantly singed.</li>
            <li> Later tool for granddaughter</li>
            <li> Works great. My hair stayed crimped all night for an 80s party. Lots of compliments and I only used the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> Works great and fast! Better than I expected actually. My hair doesn&#x27;t hold curl/crimp very well but for some reason my crimps stayed in super well!</li>
            <li> Good product but the size of the wave are really small n close together. Didnt look good. Next time ill just do couple section of my hair. Would recommand a larger wave tool.</li>
            <li> Oh what fun we had with this on 80s day at school!!  There was big crimped hair everywhere!!  It worked awesome and I&#x27;m so glad I finally bought it since 80s day comes every year!  It gets hot pretty quickly and there are little finger holds on the end so you can squeeze it tight without getting burned.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> One of the best purchases I ever made. This crimper was easy to use and was inexpensive. I have three girls who loved that I was able to crimp their hair quickly. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If this is what your looking for and you know it will work well for you, then buy it. If you wan&#x27;t something to do a really good job you may have to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Love this crimper! Works great and fast!</li>
            <li> I Love this.  It works great and looks great!  My hair is very thin and the crimp look make my hair look thick!  I am very happy.</li>
            <li> This Crimper is great, and I love it. Quality is excellent too! Best bang for your buck!</li>
            <li> My daughters new favorite hair styling item. Her hair looks beautiful when she uses it.  All bedhead items work wonderfully</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick hair and it came out very cute, not frizzy, you could see the waves nicely. As an eighties girl myself I love crimp hair! Hahaha so it does provide what it&#x27;s for - fabulous crimps. Oh and she managed to use it herself although she did say it he handle gets hot -</li>
            <li> It says on the instructions for 10-15 sec for medium crimps but thas way too long started smoking my hair and now have one section of my hair all dried so only for about 3-5 sec an thats enough okay when done right but after a while it just makes you hair look all puffy</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter.  She and her friends love to use it -- they are busy for hours!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as described. thank you!</li>
            <li> I was so scared to crimp my 8 year olds hair.  I haven&#x27;t touched a crimper since the 80&#x27;s.  It was the fastest, easiest thing to do.  I much prefer it to curling.  My husband doesn&#x27;t like the crimp look, but it can be fun at times.  Hers held all night on New Years and into the morning.  Very easy!!</li>
            <li> My daughter received this as a birthday gift last year. We have both used it and love it. It makes my daughter&#x27;s hair look beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Not being told of the voltage these are useless in my country that is why I have given 1 star&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t use them</li>
            <li> this crimp-er gets very hot very fast. got it for my youngest and she loves it and has been using it since the day it came in the mail! we have been looking for a good crimp-er and have now finally found it!</li>
            <li> I am struggling with giving a hair crimper a positive review...I really thought the style was forever banished to the stacks of 1980&#x27;s  vintage high school annuals, but apparently I am wrong. My daughter wanted a crimper to style her hair for decades week at school. She read countless reviews and found this one. I have to say, if it is crimped hair you want, crimped hair is what you will get with this. It heated up fast, did not &amp;#34;fry&amp;#34; her hair and gave great results. I was amazed. Her hair is very fine - almost like baby hair texture and stick straight. Not even a bend, much less a curl or wave. This crimper made her hair look like she belonged in a Madonna video. It worked beautifully!</li>
            <li> Love this crimper!  Should have bought this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> perfect for thick hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect. Works like it should and I&#x27;ve had no problems whatsoever. I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm! My crimps lasted for 4 days!</li>
            <li> love this crimper. my daughter has wanted one for so long.  We have lots of fun doing hair together. gotta love bed head!</li>
            <li> I love this crimper! It makes my hair so poofy and awesome. And so many people have said something about it. Like one of my baseball players said that it looks like crinkle fries haha and two ladies were like omg do you have a crimper ?!!! And i was like yeah. Anyways it works awesome</li>
            <li> Bought the crimper to replace the 7 year old one that I had and was so happy with my purchase. It was cheaper than any of the stores around here and it adds TONS of volume and really lasts a long time. Coming from me that is high praise as my hair doesn&#x27;t hold anything well. Could not be happier with my purchase. I love my new crimper, and from past experience and this one., Bed Head products are wonderful!</li>
            <li> Got it for my daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Fun to use evey now and the. For a fun funky hair style. Daughter 6 loves the look.</li>
            <li> Works very well so far! Full size and the little knobs on the end work great to hold on to.</li>
            <li> This crimper gave great volume but made my hair look incredibly frizzy and unprofessional. I have fine, below shoulder length hair and it just didn&#x27;t give me the results I was hoping for. Maybe I needed to take smaller sections of hair because it covered up all the straight hair underneath and didn&#x27;t highlight my look at all. Also, it dried my hair out and gave it a rough texture. I&#x27;m hoping that the more I experiment with it, the better it will work out for me. It does heat up nicely though and it&#x27;s great quality. Who knows, maybe I&#x27;ll figure out how to use it better and then I&#x27;ll start liking it.</li>
            <li> Great product, it does create volume where I clamp underneath my crown area. The only think is the weight, it&#x27;s kind of heavy.</li>
            <li> my daughter loves this crimper very much. her friends and cousins always want to use it. i just recently purchased one for my niece. thank you</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for her birthday in September.  Without going into a long review, I&#x27;ll just quote what she&#x27;s been saying after using it.  &amp;#34;OH MY GOD I LOVE THIS THING!&amp;#34;  &amp;#34;Can you believe I did that in 20 minutes?!?&amp;#34;  &amp;#34;I love my crimper!!!&amp;#34;  &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t believe this thing takes all the hassle out crimping and my hair doesn&#x27;t get damaged.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, she really does say that and no, I&#x27;m not a paid spokesperson for this company.  She&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> Works wonderful! Arrived fast.</li>
            <li> must have it if you want to get rid of the look that your hair is sticking to your head and face without vitality</li>
            <li> This crimper heats up really fast and creates a style that looks cute and lasts all day. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this crimper based on all the positive reviews. I was excited when I got it but disappointed when it didn&#x27;t work. It heats up fast. But for some reason, it would not crimp my hair. My hair is long (shoulder length and very very thick). I was very disappointed so I had to send it back.</li>
            <li> Awesome hairstyling tool! Works great, just make sure not to use it on all your hair, it gets poofy.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I love this product it makes nice crimps and is a pretty color it gets hot fast! every body likes my hair when i use this product!</li>
            <li> This product actually crimps your hair unlike all the other crimpers I have ever gotten! Such a good price and shipping was so fast! Thank you</li>
            <li> Item as described and works really well.</li>
            <li> I have always been able to crimp my hair since I was a little girl and for some reason this crimper does not put a good crimp in it. So I wont be using it as much as I want too.</li>
            <li> i love this thing! its easy to use, very comfy and just great. i bought it for my bday gift and it was the best self-bought gift i ever got!&lt;br /&gt;i def reccomand it!</li>
            <li> This was for my granddaughter, her hair looks cute after styling with it</li>
            <li> Great price! Very easy to use and do not have to apply so long to hair for crimp look which means less damage</li>
            <li> This is perfect for thick hair.. I recently got it cut into a straight a line Bob &amp; it still works out perfectly. Heats up quick &amp; crimps with the quickness. Bed head is a great brand.. I&#x27;m not let down a bit. This is gonna be great for those quick cute hair days 😸</li>
            <li> this is a really good crimper! I would say that if your looking for small waves this would be the best! even if you have really long hair it works! I tried it on mine and my friend&#x27;s hair and it all worked! I also want to inform you that if you plan on straightening your hair the next day shower the night before because you will wake up wit the waves still in your hair and they are hard to straighten.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice little machine and works well (and fast!), but I&#x27;m afraid to use it too often as my hair feels really dry when I crimp it. Highly recommend for people who want to spice up their locks every now and again - I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments!!</li>
            <li> my hair is pin straight, was looking for something to give just a little volume.  I iron the top layer of my hair, takes just a couple minutes.  spray a little gel, scrunch and I am good for the day.  I wouldn&#x27;t do the entire head because it does give a lot of volume.</li>
            <li> Perfect- better than the one I had in the 80s&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll have the best hair at my 80s party</li>
            <li> No more breakage from teasing the heck out of your hair! It gets hot enough to just clamp your roots for 1 second to get the micro crimps. I have thin hair that always lies flat, so this is such a lifesaver!! The days I use this and the days I don&#x27;t is such a huge difference. After buying this, I have stopped using a whole bunch of products in my hair!! Those of you with fine hair, like me, who have to use ton of products in your hair to thicken and volumize it will know how annoying and time consuming that can get. And your hair will need to be washed more often and such. After using this crimper, I don&#x27;t need to do any of that anymore! How great is that? I have clean, soft hair, but with MEGA VOLUME at the roots. No more texturizers, ever. This will change the life of people with fine hair, flat hair, and those who always like to tease their hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This product was bought by me and the review is my honest opinion*</li>
            <li> My Grandaughter age 10 loved it! She was able to do her own hair. Good value based on others I considered.</li>
            <li> One of my best friends decided to have an 80s themed party for her birthday and I was ecstatic.  The first thing I thought was \\&quot;I NEED to get a crimper!!!!\\&quot; I had no clue where to shop for a crimper, so naturally, I checked Amazon first.  Bingo! This crimper was exactly what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give some background, my hair is long (about mid-way down my back) and on a scale of 1 - 5, 1 being extremely fine hair, and 5 being crazy-thick hair, I would say I&#x27;m about a 3 (in normal volume range- non crimped, of course!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t typically style my hair... ever.  I&#x27;m a \\&quot;wash &amp; go\\&quot; kinda gal.  I thought crimping ALL my hair would take over an hour, so being the Type A personality I am, I set aside exactly 60 minutes to crimp my entire head of hair.  The entire process only took about 30 minutes which was awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this one specifically for a couple of reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1) The Brand Name - I know you can&#x27;t always rely on a brand name to give you a quality product, but this one looked more reliable than some of the other options I had found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) This one has 2-inch crimping plates - I figured this would help speed up the process since I don&#x27;t typically style my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is AWESOME.  It did just what it promised and my hair looked great.  Honestly, my hair hasn&#x27;t been that fluffy in at least a couple of decades!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crimper features an on/off switch, as well as 3 temperatures to choose from (low, medium, high... I used medium).  There are also little notches at the end to press down for an extra crimpy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip for crimping:&lt;br /&gt;*Spray a light mist of hairspray before and after crimping&lt;br /&gt;* Section your hair.  I did the bottom layer of my hair first in 1-2 inch sections then the top layer&lt;br /&gt;* lightly brush your hair out after all your hair is crimped.  This gives you a fluffy 80s &#x27;do that is sure to keep the party rocking. I had so much fun with this crimper, I just might have to bring the look back into style :-)</li>
            <li> i did a lot of research before i bought this crimper, and it&#x27;s awesome.  i have EXTREMELY thick, wavy hair, and this crimper actually crimps my hair.  now i just have to stop crimping my hair, or not.</li>
            <li> Well constructed, easy to use. My daughter loves it, as do all her friends.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this purchase and happy to recomend to other potential purchases.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my grand daughter, she loved it !!&lt;br /&gt; She is very pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Great guality</li>
            <li> I bought this crimper for an editorial fashion photo shoot and it worked great! It heats up quickly and takes just a few minutes to crimp an entire head of hair.</li>
            <li> Very easy for my daughter to use.  Yes, you can still burn yourself, but if you hold it right that won&#x27;t happen.  If she can do it anyone can...she is a bit of a klutz.  In a good way of course! :)</li>
            <li> Bed Head products have always had a solid reputation which is why I purchased this crimper. It&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;d used one and I&#x27;m so happy I made this purchase. The iron has 3 different levels of heat and warms up fast. With a little spray after done crimping, it will last as long as you will let it. I also noticed that it added a little glisten or shine to my hair. I&#x27;ve had several people ask me where I got my crimping iron. So, happy to have a new tool to spice up my hairdo.</li>
            <li> There are not alot of options out there for crimpers but of the ones I have used lately this is a good one. Nice range for temp changes, smooth plates don&#x27;t snag hair. They even have little finger rests at the top to hold the iron closed. Why do you need these? because the crimper gets very hot, even on med it gets to hot to hold in the middle plate section.</li>
            <li> We love this Crimper in all aspects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I wanted  to address some of the reviews that made me think twice about this purchase to help put minds at ease!!&lt;br /&gt;.Many reviewers complained about the heat settings and placement of the heat settings control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crimper package contained a user guide with recommendations for heat settings for all types of hair .We followed it for our hair type (fine)  and it works wonderfully (even on my 9 yr. olds bangs:).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heat controls are located on the inside which is the same as most flat irons so no problem there.&lt;br /&gt;The outside of the Crimper gets very warm , but you shouldn&#x27;t be holding it long enough for your hand to get hot, if so that&#x27;s probably why your hair is frying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am glad I went with my gut and gave this Crimper a try .&lt;br /&gt; We love it and are very happy with its performance.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t 2nd guess yourself if your thinking about it buy It&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
            <li> Words cannot express how much I love this crimper!</li>
