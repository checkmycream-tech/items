            <li>He said it works good.</li>
            <li>I always thought I did a good job washing my face</li>
            <li>I have waited to write a review to ensure that I am giving a fair review.  </li>
            <li>I use the spin for perfect skin primarily on my face</li>
            <li>Things shipped good.</li>
            <li>Item is good.  </li>
            <li>Good value and works well.</li>
            <li>This was a good brush.  </li>
            <li>3 months seems good to me.  </li>
            <li>I mostly use the exfoliating attachment for my face and it works great.</li>
            <li>Because it spins it cleans your face so much better!  </li>
            <li>Make sure you do what it says and wear a headband or hold your hair by your hairline or it may catch!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I use the body brush with body wash and omgggg LOVE!  </li>
            <li>But more than anything, I have to say that the AMAZING customer service, not from Amazon, but rather from this seller made all the difference in the world!  </li>
            <li>Has everything you need to leave you from head to toe with beautiful radiant clean skin.</li>
            <li>Have to say its worth the money, very good value for price.  </li>
            <li>My body and skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li>I liked the sealed waterproof system; I liked the rechargeable battery system.  </li>
            <li>I wish it were rechargeable, but then again it is nice to throw in a drawer and not have a charger out ...</li>
            <li>I never use cleansers on my face, just warm water and a washcloth</li>
            <li>Treat yourself to your own spa treatment at home with the Vitagoods Spin-For-Perfect-Skin Face &amp; Body cleansing brush system.</li>
            <li>To be honest I regretted buying it.</li>
            <li>This is an effective system for cleaning and exfoliating.</li>
            <li>But, at this price point, it does a pretty good job!</li>
            <li>The additional attachments for sensitive skin, body brush and pumice stone are awesome also.  </li>
            <li>So far, it has performed great!  </li>
            <li>I originally got this one on a groupon and LOVED it.  </li>
            <li>My face was more radiant and beautiful after the first use.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush so much more than Clairsonic.  </li>
            <li>I am in school to be an esthetician and have recommended this product to all my classmates and they have ordered one and love it too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen many of these cleansing brushes ranging in price from 14 bucks to upwards of 200.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my skin.  </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m sure if it was electric powered it&#x27;d drive the price up.</li>
            <li>I would love to stay that a friend recommended it to me, but I somehow got convinced by an Instagram ad...</li>
            <li>, I would never pay more than $30 for it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for that extra cleansing you feel you need.</li>
            <li>just love this brush for the price</li>
            <li>purchased the Vitagoods Spin-For-Perfect-Skin Face &amp; Body cleansing brush to keep my face in tip top shape</li>
            <li>But, I am so glad to have started using this product</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>This facial scrubber is awesome!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the brushes besides the exfoliatior yet, but I&#x27;m sure I will eventually.</li>
            <li>and if it didn&#x27;t work out that was ok.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS BRUSH.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the body brush yet, as it will take more time in the shower for that - I&#x27;ll have to try over the weekend.</li>
            <li>I also love that I can use it in the shower without fear of it succombing to water damage.</li>
            <li>I love the brushes for the face but the one for the body I can do without.</li>
            <li>I wanted an excellent facial brush/cleansing system, but couldn&#x27;t afford the $100/$200 by clarisonic.</li>
            <li>My face looks softer, and more even.</li>
            <li>way more power (torque)  </li>
            <li>Looking forward to even better results with continued use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s FANTASTIC!  </li>
            <li>Even you face product seem to work better while using it.</li>
            <li>Also, you find yourself using a lot more soap with the body brush.  </li>
            <li>I Love it and have given one to my daughter for a gift</li>
            <li>Love that I can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m glad I did</li>
            <li>Works perfectly in the shower and way more effective than using harsh scrubs.</li>
            <li>Very handy - skin is soft!</li>
            <li>Fortunately I&#x27;ve been able to get my money refunded so that I could replace the defective items.  </li>
            <li>I just happened to find it on Amazon for a few dollars more, and coupled with the great reviews about it, it seem like a wise &amp;#34;investment.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li>This is the best $35 dollar I&#x27;ve probably ever spent!</li>
            <li>Cleaning is easy as the attachments come off.</li>
            <li>Your body will love you for it - it leaves you feeling so clean and refreshed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it was working just fine.</li>
            <li>The exfoliatior brush really makes my skin smooth and gives my skin a nice glow.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it for women and men who would like to keep their face and body in great condition.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>My face has been flake free after I started using this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a great product overall -</li>
            <li>I liked mine so much that I bought one for my mother - and told her she had to try it and not just put it in the closet.  </li>
            <li>and they said if I forwarded them the reciept they would send me a replacement free of charge.  </li>
            <li>Face feels really clean and free of make up.</li>
            <li>but my skin feels smooth, clean and not bruised.</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying that for the most part my skin is pretty mellow.</li>
            <li>and I was NOT disappointed.</li>
            <li>I have not had to change my battery since I originally brought it around the summer of 2012.  </li>
            <li>I originally saw this on Groupon for $32 -</li>
            <li>But, it was definitely worth the $29 groupon goods purchase I made to have it!</li>
            <li>but I knew that my face wasn&#x27;t getting as clean as it could be.  </li>
            <li>I wash my face about 3 times per day and thought that my face was clean until I purchased and used this product.  </li>
            <li>The soft facial cleaning brush, as well as the exfoliating brush, are wonderful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the pumice stone for a callous on my foot, and so far, it&#x27;s done an excellent job of reducing the pain and overall size of the callous.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my 4th brush, I like the above link best so far.</li>
            <li>It gets all the makeup off and leaves your skin really clean.</li>
            <li>It really shines and is very smooth.  </li>
            <li>I don;t know which was for every day use and which was for &#x27;special&#x27; exfoliation.</li>
            <li>I have been cheating my skin out of a totally good deep cleansing.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft on your skin and the pumice stone attachment is excellent for smoothing those rough spots from your feet.  </li>
            <li>Is it worth the $100 original price?</li>
            <li>Within two days of using it by face feels clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Vitagoods for making such a great product.  </li>
            <li>I brought this facial brush last year through Groupon for $29.00 and I just have to say it is great!</li>
            <li>facial brush and exfoliating facial brush are excellent for \\&quot;brushing away\\&quot; pimples and removing blackheads.</li>
            <li>Has a good continuous spin but not too fast that it will leave you with \\&quot;brush burn\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with one large body brush that can be used in the shower with your favorite body wash to cleanse and deep clean and improve your skin&#x27;s texture.</li>
            <li>Quality construction, good function, long battery life.  </li>
            <li>but once I started using it more than a month ago I cannot live without it.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t compare but this one works great and the price is a lot less.</li>
            <li>Bought the vitagood for solo much less and its great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to stay that the next day I woke up with perfectly clear beautiful skin, but I will say that after a about 3 weeks I was seeing results that I hadn&#x27;t in 4 months.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this as a Christmas gift and was pretty excited.</li>
            <li>and my face is still butter soft :)</li>
            <li>(I rarely wear makeup</li>
            <li>I thought it was a rare incident.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the amazon price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference in my skin -- much clearer, smoother, more vibrant.  </li>
            <li>It is a good value compared to other brands.</li>
            <li>right around the time something else comes along</li>
            <li>and she was so right about this product that i had to hug</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li>The face brushes really get my skin squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>I have used a buffing sponge prior to this purchase but the Vitagoods cleansing brush does a far superior job of cleaning my skin.  </li>
            <li>have only used the smaller brush and the pumice buffer and they are both great tools to add to your beauty regimen.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t tug on your skin like clarisonic and is very gentle.</li>
            <li>It will make your life that much easier!</li>
            <li>But, after using it several more times, I&#x27;m hooked.  </li>
            <li>I have been enjoying this product immensely.</li>
            <li>At first, it took me a while to use it</li>
            <li>pumice stone piece is not put together well -- the pumice detached from the plastic within one of my first uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if I received a product that worked, I&#x27;d be of the same opinion of my friend, but I can&#x27;t rate the effectiveness of the product.</li>
            <li>The first brush system set I received</li>
            <li>;).  </li>
            <li>personal favorite is the pumice stone.</li>
            <li>I use the brush on my face everyday for about 2 minutes because it just feels good and I</li>
            <li>Even made my own little exfoliating mix, coffee grounds, fresh from this morning and a touch of granulated sugar.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feel clear, clean, and supple.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and clean after just one use.</li>
            <li>Granted, I&#x27;ve only had it for little over a week, but so far, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li>After using the cleansing brush on my face the first time, I was ready to return it.  </li>
            <li>I use this without a cleanser on my face in the shower, I just wet the brush, my skin feels so smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>They both leave my face much, much cleaner than if I try to clean it by rubbing cleanser onto my skin, directly with my hands.</li>
            <li>If you use it frequently, you can run through batteries quickly unless you&#x27;re using rechargeable ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much smoother and soft and it really helps to give a deeper clean.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product and I would definitely be purchasing replacement brushes.</li>
            <li>It’s working fine now, but I will update if I have any problems like that in the future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had people really &amp;#34;compliment&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I know guys aren&#x27;t too much on skin care products</li>
            <li>Service from Amazon.com was a breeze......very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>I used the gentle face brush.</li>
            <li>My acne and breakouts have reduced so much.  </li>
            <li>I have this set for myself and ordered this one for my daughter for Christmas because I like it so much.</li>
            <li>feels very sturdy in my hand</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had multiple people tell me that I have such nice skin.  </li>
            <li>:B00CP7M2VG Water-Resistant Professional Skin Care Face and Body Brush System by ToiletTree Products (Purple)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT!!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;only drawback is that it takes regular batteries, no charger like the clarisonic, but i find it to be superior to the clarisonic in every other way.  </li>
            <li>I have an oily complexion and am prone to acne, this product helped to deep clean my face.  </li>
            <li>I went 1 week without it and noticed my skin was starting to look dull again, but after 1 use its back to its new normal - smooth, bright, and toned!</li>
            <li>The first time I used the tool it removed 3 day old make-up from my face</li>
            <li>Time to buy a new one!</li>
            <li>other reviews have stated, a rechargeable unit would be great, but would likely increase the price such that I would not have ordered.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve seen improvement myself, I&#x27;ve had less pimples, fewer blackheads, and more even skin tone.  </li>
            <li>My face is smooth and clear at this present moment</li>
            <li>I love the different attachments for different purposes and can&#x27;t wait to try them all.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend you don&#x27;t do that</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this beauty.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND getting it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It just didn&#x27;t seem powerful enough.  </li>
            <li>It also comes with a pumic stone that is made of poor quality, but the brushes are good.</li>
            <li>The power level is just right for daily use.  </li>
            <li>This is an extremely important issue for me because I normally have combination skin, and have always read (with other cleansing brushes) that sometimes there&#x27;s noticeable peeling or dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is an awesome product and even the little pumice stone works wonders on those tough heels.</li>
            <li>Additionally, as my New Years resolution I am trying to make a conscience effect not to turn my face throughout the day and also to leave my blemishes</li>
            <li>You live and learn ,</li>
            <li>I bought brand new batteries, they got stuck in the handle</li>
            <li>the acne that I do have is clearing up and nothing new has cropped up.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;bought a new brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>and I live the 4 brush options.</li>
            <li>I had just added new batteries, so</li>
            <li>There’s a more gentle brush designed for the face, and a larger brush that you can use all over the body, especially in trouble spots such as the knees and elbows and the top of the feet.</li>
            <li>She said she had the nicest old lady skin in the city!</li>
            <li>I bought one for myself and a friend, and we both use the facial attachment almost daily, and I definitely think my skin is softer, clearer, more healthier looking.</li>
            <li>For the cost of a pedicure (or two) you can get one of these and get rid of the dead skin and calluses easily.</li>
            <li>It was gentle enough but your skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li>It takes both my thumbs and they are completely sore after cleansing my face.</li>
            <li>I just used the soft brush.</li>
            <li>I am 71 years old and had a face lift on 6/17/13.</li>
            <li>I am 31 years old and have always had issues with acne.  </li>
            <li>I cannot wait to wash my face because it completely cleanses your skin from the dirt, oil and makeup throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I am 29 years old and still struggle with acne.  </li>
            <li>B002RZKFAQ Nutra Sonic 1020 Professional 4 Speed Face and Body Cleansing System, Lavender]]  </li>
            <li>a month so far with no</li>
            <li>I used the face and body attachments so far, and my skin already feels smoother and invigorated.  </li>
            <li>Finally got them out and put new batteries in (they also got stuck) and the device wouldn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>the products i use leave my skin very flaky around the mouth area, and this product helps to remove the dry skin</li>
            <li>, that does have me a bit worried about how long this will hold up, is that one of the first times I used it after about ten minutes</li>
            <li>it started letting out a kind of high-pitched screech and slowed down a bit from its usual tempo.</li>
            <li>Only downside is that it&#x27;s battery powered, but batteries last pretty long</li>
            <li>One thing to note, do NOT wet the brush before you put your cleanser of the brush.</li>
            <li>Since the first few weeks, my skin has become softer, smoother and has a natural glow to it.</li>
            <li>The price is right on this little brush.</li>

            <li>I tried a few different sets of batteries to make sure it was not due to dead batteries.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this once so far and can definitely feel and see a lot of improvements with my skin(face) in regards to exfoliating (that&#x27;s the only brush I used along with some St. Ives face wash).</li>

            <li> I always thought I did a good job washing my face</li>
            <li> I have waited to write a review to ensure that I am giving a fair review.  </li>
            <li> I use the spin for perfect skin primarily on my face</li>
            <li> Things shipped good.</li>
            <li> Item is good.  </li>
            <li> Good value and works well.</li>
            <li> This was a good brush.  </li>
            <li> 3 months seems good to me.  </li>
            <li> I mostly use the exfoliating attachment for my face and it works great.</li>
            <li> Because it spins it cleans your face so much better!  </li>
            <li> Make sure you do what it says and wear a headband or hold your hair by your hairline or it may catch!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I use the body brush with body wash and omgggg LOVE!  </li>
            <li> But more than anything, I have to say that the AMAZING customer service, not from Amazon, but rather from this seller made all the difference in the world!  </li>
            <li> Has everything you need to leave you from head to toe with beautiful radiant clean skin.</li>
            <li> Have to say its worth the money, very good value for price.  </li>
            <li> My body and skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li> I liked the sealed waterproof system; I liked the rechargeable battery system.  </li>
            <li> I wish it were rechargeable, but then again it is nice to throw in a drawer and not have a charger out ...</li>
            <li> I never use cleansers on my face, just warm water and a washcloth</li>
            <li> Treat yourself to your own spa treatment at home with the Vitagoods Spin-For-Perfect-Skin Face &amp; Body cleansing brush system.</li>
            <li> To be honest I regretted buying it.</li>
            <li> This is an effective system for cleaning and exfoliating.</li>
            <li> But, at this price point, it does a pretty good job!</li>
            <li> The additional attachments for sensitive skin, body brush and pumice stone are awesome also.  </li>
            <li> So far, it has performed great!  </li>
            <li> I originally got this one on a groupon and LOVED it.  </li>
            <li> My face was more radiant and beautiful after the first use.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush so much more than Clairsonic.  </li>
            <li> I am in school to be an esthetician and have recommended this product to all my classmates and they have ordered one and love it too.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen many of these cleansing brushes ranging in price from 14 bucks to upwards of 200.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my skin.  </li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m sure if it was electric powered it&#x27;d drive the price up.</li>
            <li> I would love to stay that a friend recommended it to me, but I somehow got convinced by an Instagram ad...</li>
            <li> , I would never pay more than $30 for it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for that extra cleansing you feel you need.</li>
            <li> just love this brush for the price</li>
            <li> purchased the Vitagoods Spin-For-Perfect-Skin Face &amp; Body cleansing brush to keep my face in tip top shape</li>
            <li> But, I am so glad to have started using this product</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> This facial scrubber is awesome!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the brushes besides the exfoliatior yet, but I&#x27;m sure I will eventually.</li>
            <li> and if it didn&#x27;t work out that was ok.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS BRUSH.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the body brush yet, as it will take more time in the shower for that - I&#x27;ll have to try over the weekend.</li>
            <li> I also love that I can use it in the shower without fear of it succombing to water damage.</li>
            <li> I love the brushes for the face but the one for the body I can do without.</li>
            <li> I wanted an excellent facial brush/cleansing system, but couldn&#x27;t afford the $100/$200 by clarisonic.</li>
            <li> My face looks softer, and more even.</li>
            <li> way more power (torque)  </li>
            <li> Looking forward to even better results with continued use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s FANTASTIC!  </li>
            <li> Even you face product seem to work better while using it.</li>
            <li> Also, you find yourself using a lot more soap with the body brush.  </li>
            <li> I Love it and have given one to my daughter for a gift</li>
            <li> Love that I can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m glad I did</li>
            <li> Works perfectly in the shower and way more effective than using harsh scrubs.</li>
            <li> Very handy - skin is soft!</li>
            <li> Fortunately I&#x27;ve been able to get my money refunded so that I could replace the defective items.  </li>
            <li> I just happened to find it on Amazon for a few dollars more, and coupled with the great reviews about it, it seem like a wise &amp;#34;investment.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li> This is the best $35 dollar I&#x27;ve probably ever spent!</li>
            <li> Cleaning is easy as the attachments come off.</li>
            <li> Your body will love you for it - it leaves you feeling so clean and refreshed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it was working just fine.</li>
            <li> The exfoliatior brush really makes my skin smooth and gives my skin a nice glow.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it for women and men who would like to keep their face and body in great condition.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> My face has been flake free after I started using this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a great product overall -</li>
            <li> I liked mine so much that I bought one for my mother - and told her she had to try it and not just put it in the closet.  </li>
            <li> and they said if I forwarded them the reciept they would send me a replacement free of charge.  </li>
            <li> Face feels really clean and free of make up.</li>
            <li> but my skin feels smooth, clean and not bruised.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that for the most part my skin is pretty mellow.</li>
            <li> and I was NOT disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have not had to change my battery since I originally brought it around the summer of 2012.  </li>
            <li> I originally saw this on Groupon for $32 -</li>
            <li> But, it was definitely worth the $29 groupon goods purchase I made to have it!</li>
            <li> but I knew that my face wasn&#x27;t getting as clean as it could be.  </li>
            <li> I wash my face about 3 times per day and thought that my face was clean until I purchased and used this product.  </li>
            <li> The soft facial cleaning brush, as well as the exfoliating brush, are wonderful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the pumice stone for a callous on my foot, and so far, it&#x27;s done an excellent job of reducing the pain and overall size of the callous.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my 4th brush, I like the above link best so far.</li>
            <li> It gets all the makeup off and leaves your skin really clean.</li>
            <li> It really shines and is very smooth.  </li>
            <li> I don;t know which was for every day use and which was for &#x27;special&#x27; exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I have been cheating my skin out of a totally good deep cleansing.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft on your skin and the pumice stone attachment is excellent for smoothing those rough spots from your feet.  </li>
            <li> Is it worth the $100 original price?</li>
            <li> Within two days of using it by face feels clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Vitagoods for making such a great product.  </li>
            <li> I brought this facial brush last year through Groupon for $29.00 and I just have to say it is great!</li>
            <li> facial brush and exfoliating facial brush are excellent for \\&quot;brushing away\\&quot; pimples and removing blackheads.</li>
            <li> Has a good continuous spin but not too fast that it will leave you with \\&quot;brush burn\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with one large body brush that can be used in the shower with your favorite body wash to cleanse and deep clean and improve your skin&#x27;s texture.</li>
            <li> Quality construction, good function, long battery life.  </li>
            <li> but once I started using it more than a month ago I cannot live without it.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t compare but this one works great and the price is a lot less.</li>
            <li> Bought the vitagood for solo much less and its great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to stay that the next day I woke up with perfectly clear beautiful skin, but I will say that after a about 3 weeks I was seeing results that I hadn&#x27;t in 4 months.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas gift and was pretty excited.</li>
            <li> and my face is still butter soft :)</li>
            <li> (I rarely wear makeup</li>
            <li> I thought it was a rare incident.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the amazon price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference in my skin -- much clearer, smoother, more vibrant.  </li>
            <li> It is a good value compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> right around the time something else comes along</li>
            <li> and she was so right about this product that i had to hug</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li> The face brushes really get my skin squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> I have used a buffing sponge prior to this purchase but the Vitagoods cleansing brush does a far superior job of cleaning my skin.  </li>
            <li> have only used the smaller brush and the pumice buffer and they are both great tools to add to your beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t tug on your skin like clarisonic and is very gentle.</li>
            <li> It will make your life that much easier!</li>
            <li> But, after using it several more times, I&#x27;m hooked.  </li>
            <li> I have been enjoying this product immensely.</li>
            <li> At first, it took me a while to use it</li>
            <li> pumice stone piece is not put together well -- the pumice detached from the plastic within one of my first uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if I received a product that worked, I&#x27;d be of the same opinion of my friend, but I can&#x27;t rate the effectiveness of the product.</li>
            <li> The first brush system set I received</li>
            <li> ;).  </li>
            <li> personal favorite is the pumice stone.</li>
            <li> I use the brush on my face everyday for about 2 minutes because it just feels good and I</li>
            <li> Even made my own little exfoliating mix, coffee grounds, fresh from this morning and a touch of granulated sugar.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feel clear, clean, and supple.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and clean after just one use.</li>
            <li> Granted, I&#x27;ve only had it for little over a week, but so far, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> After using the cleansing brush on my face the first time, I was ready to return it.  </li>
            <li> I use this without a cleanser on my face in the shower, I just wet the brush, my skin feels so smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> They both leave my face much, much cleaner than if I try to clean it by rubbing cleanser onto my skin, directly with my hands.</li>
            <li> If you use it frequently, you can run through batteries quickly unless you&#x27;re using rechargeable ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much smoother and soft and it really helps to give a deeper clean.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product and I would definitely be purchasing replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> It’s working fine now, but I will update if I have any problems like that in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had people really &amp;#34;compliment&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I know guys aren&#x27;t too much on skin care products</li>
            <li> Service from Amazon.com was a breeze......very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> I used the gentle face brush.</li>
            <li> My acne and breakouts have reduced so much.  </li>
            <li> I have this set for myself and ordered this one for my daughter for Christmas because I like it so much.</li>
            <li> feels very sturdy in my hand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had multiple people tell me that I have such nice skin.  </li>
            <li> :B00CP7M2VG Water-Resistant Professional Skin Care Face and Body Brush System by ToiletTree Products (Purple)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT!!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;only drawback is that it takes regular batteries, no charger like the clarisonic, but i find it to be superior to the clarisonic in every other way.  </li>
            <li> I have an oily complexion and am prone to acne, this product helped to deep clean my face.  </li>
            <li> I went 1 week without it and noticed my skin was starting to look dull again, but after 1 use its back to its new normal - smooth, bright, and toned!</li>
            <li> The first time I used the tool it removed 3 day old make-up from my face</li>
            <li> Time to buy a new one!</li>
            <li> other reviews have stated, a rechargeable unit would be great, but would likely increase the price such that I would not have ordered.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve seen improvement myself, I&#x27;ve had less pimples, fewer blackheads, and more even skin tone.  </li>
            <li> My face is smooth and clear at this present moment</li>
            <li> I love the different attachments for different purposes and can&#x27;t wait to try them all.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend you don&#x27;t do that</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this beauty.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND getting it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t seem powerful enough.  </li>
            <li> It also comes with a pumic stone that is made of poor quality, but the brushes are good.</li>
            <li> The power level is just right for daily use.  </li>
            <li> This is an extremely important issue for me because I normally have combination skin, and have always read (with other cleansing brushes) that sometimes there&#x27;s noticeable peeling or dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is an awesome product and even the little pumice stone works wonders on those tough heels.</li>
            <li> Additionally, as my New Years resolution I am trying to make a conscience effect not to turn my face throughout the day and also to leave my blemishes</li>
            <li> You live and learn ,</li>
            <li> I bought brand new batteries, they got stuck in the handle</li>
            <li> the acne that I do have is clearing up and nothing new has cropped up.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;bought a new brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> and I live the 4 brush options.</li>
            <li> I had just added new batteries, so</li>
            <li> There’s a more gentle brush designed for the face, and a larger brush that you can use all over the body, especially in trouble spots such as the knees and elbows and the top of the feet.</li>
            <li> She said she had the nicest old lady skin in the city!</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself and a friend, and we both use the facial attachment almost daily, and I definitely think my skin is softer, clearer, more healthier looking.</li>
            <li> For the cost of a pedicure (or two) you can get one of these and get rid of the dead skin and calluses easily.</li>
            <li> It was gentle enough but your skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li> It takes both my thumbs and they are completely sore after cleansing my face.</li>
            <li> I just used the soft brush.</li>
            <li> I am 71 years old and had a face lift on 6/17/13.</li>
            <li> I am 31 years old and have always had issues with acne.  </li>
            <li> I cannot wait to wash my face because it completely cleanses your skin from the dirt, oil and makeup throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I am 29 years old and still struggle with acne.  </li>
            <li> B002RZKFAQ Nutra Sonic 1020 Professional 4 Speed Face and Body Cleansing System, Lavender]]  </li>
            <li> a month so far with no</li>
            <li> I used the face and body attachments so far, and my skin already feels smoother and invigorated.  </li>
            <li> Finally got them out and put new batteries in (they also got stuck) and the device wouldn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> the products i use leave my skin very flaky around the mouth area, and this product helps to remove the dry skin</li>
            <li> , that does have me a bit worried about how long this will hold up, is that one of the first times I used it after about ten minutes</li>
            <li> it started letting out a kind of high-pitched screech and slowed down a bit from its usual tempo.</li>
            <li> Only downside is that it&#x27;s battery powered, but batteries last pretty long</li>
            <li> One thing to note, do NOT wet the brush before you put your cleanser of the brush.</li>
            <li> Since the first few weeks, my skin has become softer, smoother and has a natural glow to it.</li>
            <li> The price is right on this little brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can get replacements brushes right here on Amazon, here are a few of the links:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00JKZMTT6</li>
            <li> I tried a few different sets of batteries to make sure it was not due to dead batteries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so far and can definitely feel and see a lot of improvements with my skin(face) in regards to exfoliating (that&#x27;s the only brush I used along with some St. Ives face wash).</li>
            <li> My skin was pretty much raw .</li>
            <li> I had no major skin issues except tiny bumps under the&lt;br /&gt;skin of my forehead.  </li>
            <li> the batteries did not last long.  </li>
            <li> I haven’t had that issue recur, but it suggests to me there might be something loose in the motor that jolted out of place and then jolted back again.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, so i used have dry patches around my nose and forehead, but this has gotten rid of it with daily use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s long time performance.  </li>
            <li> The only part of the unit that gets wet is the brush.  </li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t use it everyday anyways because my skin is too sensitive for that.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth, no more ridiculous acne, it lessened the appearance of acne scars on my face, it just...</li>
            <li> other &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; face cleansing brushes on the market, this on ACTUALLY SPINS!  </li>
            <li> I think the spin works as well as the other brush, approximately same quality feel.  </li>
            <li> And, suprisingly, I&#x27;ve been using the cleansing brush twice a day, every day on my face, and my face hasn&#x27;t peeled or gotten dry.</li>
            <li> I often wear Tevas, flip-flops, and sandals, and my feet tend to dry out.</li>
            <li> but since using the facial brush I realize how much makeup I was leaving behind.  </li>
            <li> I use this spin brush every single day.</li>
            <li> I only wish the stone was a flat shape rather than round</li>
            <li> So I received this item less than 8 weeks, I noticed the second week</li>
            <li> I find the body brush to work well, especially on your feet after a trip to the beach, or in the winter when you wear black socks</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars only because it takes 4 AA batteries which is annoying and will cost more in the long run.</li>
            <li> I have some dry spots on my face from a recent breakout and the brush is helping to remove any dead skin that I still have.  </li>
            <li> I ended up with a little red spot</li>
            <li> The only con - hard to open to insert batteries.</li>
            <li> I wet the bristles and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> pumice stone can be used for the rough skin areas on your elbows and feet.</li>
            <li> These are not too rough, but I would suggest lots of lotion after using the body brush.  </li>
            <li> Still use it about a week before my &amp;#34;special time of the month&amp;#34; and I have noticed that it actually does prevent my annoying breakouts somewhat better than just face wash alone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain, as I&#x27;m a frugal person by nature.</li>
            <li> It works well but is not very powerful.</li>
            <li> The only consideration which is a small one is that it&lt;br /&gt;needs</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the other attachments but know the face cleansing  brush is</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased a few as gifts for other people and, unfortunately, some of those did not work straight out of the box and another stopped working shortly after.  </li>
            <li> There are other skin cleaning brushes out there</li>
            <li> your ordinary facial cleaner leaves behind.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and acne prone skin</li>
            <li> and I try every other day</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> The cleaning brushes were not powerful.  </li>
            <li> The pluses are that you don&#x27;t have a cord hanging down or another charger to store.  </li>
            <li> press to your face and still spins, doesnt bog motor down.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try other attachments!</li>
            <li> I thought I removed with previous washes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find myself using a lot less with the face brush...</li>
            <li> /&gt;One odd thing, though</li>
            <li> I had tons of little bumps all over my face.</li>
            <li> The rechargeable battery died after a little over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the vitagoods spin maybe 6 months ago.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a week now</li>
            <li> I was frustrated with the return process, but have completely changed my mind on this product and especially on this seller.  </li>
            <li> He likes it and uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> Somehow I feel like I was missing out on something now that I have a spinning electronic face cleanser</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your time and money, mine didn&#x27;t even turn on</li>
            <li> It takes off the dead skin, but you need to moisturize.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There’s a everyday brush, that you can use anywhere you need it to apply cleansers and brush off dead skin.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a pumice stone that works well removing dead skin from the feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first</li>
            <li> so I guess I had a bad first set of batteries ...</li>
            <li> took unit apart to see if I could fix it, looks like a wiring issue to the switch, hard to get to the internal components though, would have been tough to repair, so in the trash</li>
            <li> not too tough on my delicate skin, even though i&#x27;m following a strict AHA/benzoyl peroxide regimen from my esthetician.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and was afraid a brush might be too harsh but it isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how it compares to the pricier ones out there.</li>
            <li> I used it every morning and night until it suddenly stopped working 3 months later :(</li>
            <li> when I first turned on the device, I was disappointed with its power.</li>
            <li> However after using it for less than a week my skin quality improved ridiculously.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t usually write reviews</li>
            <li> it was very difficult to change the spin head (s) then it became extremely difficult, finally not able to change the heads or get it to even operate, I&#x27;ve contacted the seller and to no avail, I can&#x27;t even locate or find the exact item on their website, hmmmm, just maybe someone else has problems.</li>
            <li> had they at least replied about the issue .</li>
            <li> Seemed a lot of people complained that it was not chargable and</li>
            <li> After researching this brush and reading all of the reviews, I figured that I could at least give it a try</li>
            <li> but they both break me out even though I&#x27;ve been trying for at least 6 months</li>
            <li> only gripe is the 2 face attachments were impossible for me to tell apart, so</li>
            <li> The button is too hard to hold down!!!!</li>
            <li> My first set of batteries in the spin lasted maybe a month, I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> When a company stands behind their product and reaches out to customers in order to resolve any issues promptly and efficiently, well, that&#x27;s the way to run a business....</li>
            <li> This thing spins so slowly, maybe I got a bad one.</li>
            <li> My box was delivered to the wrong house</li>
            <li> You wont be sorry...</li>
            <li> Very poor product...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the price has since spiked up. :(</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t want to stay burn because it wasn&#x27;t that bad) from over doing it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t of been too bad .</li>
            <li> It was driving me crazy!</li>
            <li> me, you will NOT be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen it in almost a month :(</li>
            <li> This tool takes AA batteries which is also an added bonus for travel I hate carrying a BUNCH of power cords.</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about it!</li>
            <li> You are going to be mad at yourself for not knowing about this sooner!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this off of Vitagoods&#x27; website with a discount code.  I&#x27;ve been using it every day since I got it, which was about 2 weeks ago.  I&#x27;ve never had people really &amp;#34;compliment&amp;#34; my skin until now.  I&#x27;ve had multiple people tell me that I have such nice skin.  And I&#x27;ve seen improvement myself, I&#x27;ve had less pimples, fewer blackheads, and more even skin tone.  If I had to recommend a product to use, it&#x27;d be this one.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it compares to the pricier ones out there. But, at this price point, it does a pretty good job! Face feels really clean and free of make up. Like the fact that I can even use it in the shower. One piece of advice..invest in rechargeable batteries. It will make your life that much easier!</li>
            <li> I love this brush so much more than Clairsonic.  Because it spins it cleans your face so much better!  The additional attachments for sensitive skin, body brush and pumice stone are awesome also.  I have two of these....one for by my sink and one for shower !!!  I also bought one for my husband and he loves it too.  I am in school to be an esthetician and have recommended this product to all my classmates and they have ordered one and love it too.  I have purchased one for my Dad as well.  I know guys aren&#x27;t too much on skin care products but once they use this, they see the scleansing benefits.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen many of these cleansing brushes ranging in price from 14 bucks to upwards of 200.  I originally got this one on a groupon and LOVED it.  Until I dropped it and broke it.  Replaced through amazon.  Have to say its worth the money, very good value for price.  I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on my skin.  Highly recommend.  Only downside is that it&#x27;s battery powered, but batteries last pretty long and i&#x27;m sure if it was electric powered it&#x27;d drive the price up.</li>
            <li> Dropped this item once in the shower and now it will not work! dissapointed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so far and can definitely feel and see a lot of improvements with my skin(face) in regards to exfoliating (that&#x27;s the only brush I used along with some St. Ives face wash). Its day 4/5 and my face is still butter soft :)</li>
            <li> I use this spin brush every single day. It is an awesome product and even the little pumice stone works wonders on those tough heels. I would not hesitate to  get it even though it takes four double A batteries. Remember to have them on hand for when your product arrives because it does not come with batteries.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my son. He likes it and uses it everyday. He said it works good. 😋</li>
            <li> I use this product at nighttime to cleanse my face with a facial cleansing cream.  I have used a buffing sponge prior to this purchase but the Vitagoods cleansing brush does a far superior job of cleaning my skin.  The only consideration which is a small one is that it&lt;br /&gt;needs four AA batteries.  The pluses are that you don&#x27;t have a cord hanging down or another charger to store.  The brushes are very soft on your skin and the pumice stone attachment is excellent for smoothing those rough spots from your feet.  This product  exceeded my expectations.  I am extremely happy I made this purchase and will recommend it to my sisters and friends.  This would make a wonderful gift. Thanks Vitagoods for making such a great product.  Service from Amazon.com was a breeze......very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> The button is too hard to hold down!!!! It takes both my thumbs and they are completely sore after cleansing my face. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> So I received this item less than 8 weeks, I noticed the second week it was very difficult to change the spin head (s) then it became extremely difficult, finally not able to change the heads or get it to even operate, I&#x27;ve contacted the seller and to no avail, I can&#x27;t even locate or find the exact item on their website, hmmmm, just maybe someone else has problems.</li>
            <li> I like this product, very good for skin cleansing. It also comes with a pumic stone that is made of poor quality, but the brushes are good.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that for the most part my skin is pretty mellow. I have a breakout about once a month right around the time something else comes along haha but I recently deployed and for some reason (probably stress and changing my diet) my skin freaked out! I had tons of little bumps all over my face. It was driving me crazy! I decided to give this Spin for Perfect skin a shot. I would love to stay that a friend recommended it to me, but I somehow got convinced by an Instagram ad... I ended up paying $30 for it with the promo code at the time.&lt;br /&gt;When I got it I went all out, used ever one of the brushed. I would HIGHLY recommend you don&#x27;t do that if you have zero self control with blemishes on your face.  I ended up with a little red spot (I don&#x27;t want to stay burn because it wasn&#x27;t that bad) from over doing it.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the next time I used it I just used the soft brush. I&#x27;m not going to stay that the next day I woke up with perfectly clear beautiful skin, but I will say that after a about 3 weeks I was seeing results that I hadn&#x27;t in 4 months.&lt;br /&gt;6 months later... Still use it about a week before my &amp;#34;special time of the month&amp;#34; and I have noticed that it actually does prevent my annoying breakouts somewhat better than just face wash alone. Additionally, as my New Years resolution I am trying to make a conscience effect not to turn my face throughout the day and also to leave my blemishes alone.&lt;br /&gt;So yes, I would buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;No, I would never pay more than $30 for it.</li>
            <li> The reason for the 4 stars is because I&#x27;ve had this product only a short time so cannot rate it&#x27;s long time performance.  So far, it has performed great!  I always thought I did a good job washing my face but since using the facial brush I realize how much makeup I was leaving behind.  I have sensitive skin and was afraid a brush might be too harsh but it isn&#x27;t.  Very happy with product.  The only con - hard to open to insert batteries.</li>
            <li> After using the cleansing brush on my face the first time, I was ready to return it.  It just didn&#x27;t seem powerful enough.  But, after using it several more times, I&#x27;m hooked.  The power level is just right for daily use.  My skin feels refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviews have stated, a rechargeable unit would be great, but would likely increase the price such that I would not have ordered.  As it is, it&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> The price is right on this little brush. Had been looking for a facial brush and didn&#x27;t want to spend big bucks. It&#x27;s perfect for that extra cleansing you feel you need. I highly recommend this beauty. I haven&#x27;t used the other attachments but know the face cleansing  brush is a must have. You will feel the difference.</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas gift and was pretty excited. I washed my face with it and it burned my skin. My skin was pretty much raw . I used the gentle face brush. I sent them an email to ask if my product was defective or what was the deal and they never replied . I sent them another email a week later .. Nothing ... My face Basically felt like sand paper since it was a giant scab . It wouldn&#x27;t of been too bad . You live and learn , had they at least replied about the issue .</li>
            <li> got this product two weeks ago on recommendation from a friend and she was so right about this product that i had to hug her!&lt;br /&gt;unlike other &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; face cleansing brushes on the market, this on ACTUALLY SPINS!  not too tough on my delicate skin, even though i&#x27;m following a strict AHA/benzoyl peroxide regimen from my esthetician.  the products i use leave my skin very flaky around the mouth area, and this product helps to remove the dry skin so i don&#x27;t walk around looking crazy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only drawback is that it takes regular batteries, no charger like the clarisonic, but i find it to be superior to the clarisonic in every other way.  very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> See My Video On My Skin Care With Vitagood Spin Brush&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It changed my skin on my face, body and my feet were a PLUS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just love this brush for the price you cant beat it. No one has 4-5 Brushed in ONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope they just work on a PLUG IN instead of batteries. But its a GO for me!</li>
            <li> OMG! I have been cheating my skin out of a totally good deep cleansing. Your skin will feel like a burden has been lifted off of it. You will be amazed at what you haven&#x27;t been getting off your skin!  I am totally a fan of this product and I would encourage those of you that truly care about the health, look and feel of your skin to try this. You are going to be mad at yourself for not knowing about this sooner!!!</li>
            <li> I am 71 years old and had a face lift on 6/17/13. After the face lift my friends said I looked &amp;#34;Awesome.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Vitagoods Spin-For-Perfect-Skin Face &amp; Body cleansing brush to keep my face in tip top shape and I was NOT disappointed. I would definitely recommend it for women and men who would like to keep their face and body in great condition.&lt;br /&gt;Like me, you will NOT be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have waited to write a review to ensure that I am giving a fair review.  I use the spin for perfect skin primarily on my face and I must say that it does what it says. Initially, I feel that it pulled all of my impurities to the surface, because I started getting pimples. Since the first few weeks, my skin has become softer, smoother and has a natural glow to it. I have been enjoying this product immensely. I have never used the clarisonic, so I can not compare it, but this product has worked wonders for my skin and I use it daily!! I love it!!</li>
            <li> It works well but is not very powerful. The battery case was had to open, The item was as advertised. Shipping was prompt and packed well.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the quality. I mostly use the exfoliating attachment for my face and it works great. Cleaning is easy as the attachments come off.</li>
            <li> I bought brand new batteries, they got stuck in the handle (yes I put them in correctly), and the unit wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  Finally got them out and put new batteries in (they also got stuck) and the device wouldn&#x27;t work.  I had bought 2 of them and gave one to my sister.  Her device works great.  Guess I just got unlucky.</li>
            <li> I brought this facial brush last year through Groupon for $29.00 and I just have to say it is great! I am 31 years old and have always had issues with acne.  At first, it took me a while to use it but once I started using it more than a month ago I cannot live without it.  Every time I come home I cannot wait to wash my face because it completely cleanses your skin from the dirt, oil and makeup throughout the day.  My acne and breakouts have reduced so much.  As for the pumice and body cleanser, I have not used it.  But, I am so glad to have started using this product and I don&#x27;t have any problems with the battery life.  I have not had to change my battery since I originally brought it around the summer of 2012.  Everything about this product is great.  Your skin needs this.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews before purchasing a groupon about one year ago.  Any negatives that I read were not bothersome at the&lt;br /&gt;price I was paying for the groupon (maybe around $29).  Seemed a lot of people complained that it was not chargable and&lt;br /&gt;that the batteries did not last long.  I use the brush on my face everyday for about 2 minutes because it just feels good and I&lt;br /&gt;know it works for me.  I have not changed the batteries in a year.  I had no major skin issues except tiny bumps under the&lt;br /&gt;skin of my forehead.  This brush has eradicated these bumps that I&#x27;ve always had.  I am 62 and I would buy another so,&lt;br /&gt;if and when mine bites the dust, I will have backup.  The only part of the unit that gets wet is the brush.  I don&#x27;t put the unit&lt;br /&gt;under running water.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I gave the cleansing brush to my daughter for Christmas, but it didn&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;m returning it to Vitagoods.  Disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these for myself and I LOVE it.  I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference in my skin -- much clearer, smoother, more vibrant.  If you use it frequently, you can run through batteries quickly unless you&#x27;re using rechargeable ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pumice stone piece is not put together well -- the pumice detached from the plastic within one of my first uses.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also figured out that the product is not actually waterproof but rather water-resistant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased a few as gifts for other people and, unfortunately, some of those did not work straight out of the box and another stopped working shortly after.  Fortunately I&#x27;ve been able to get my money refunded so that I could replace the defective items.  Unfortunately, the price has since spiked up. :(</li>
            <li> Very poor product... It broke and I threw it away !</li>
            <li> I have never wrote a review before.  Somehow I feel like I was missing out on something now that I have a spinning electronic face cleanser + . Have nothing to compare it to and have always been an advocate of skincare.  Very happy with the results.  Even made my own little exfoliating mix, coffee grounds, fresh from this morning and a touch of granulated sugar. My body and skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li> This facial scrubber is awesome! I&#x27;ve never had a Clarosonic one so I can&#x27;t compare but this one works great and the price is a lot less. I haven&#x27;t used the brushes besides the exfoliatior yet, but I&#x27;m sure I will eventually. The exfoliatior brush really makes my skin smooth and gives my skin a nice glow. Make sure you do what it says and wear a headband or hold your hair by your hairline or it may catch!</li>
            <li> My face has been flake free after I started using this. It&#x27;s been a month, and all the parts work properly. It&#x27;s glowing also. I have dry skin, so i used have dry patches around my nose and forehead, but this has gotten rid of it with daily use. I heard that you can use it in the shower, but I haven&#x27;t because I am worried about it getting ruined. I wet the bristles and that&#x27;s it. Things shipped good.</li>
            <li> Item is good.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I am 29 years old and still struggle with acne.  A lot of it is hormonal but I knew that my face wasn&#x27;t getting as clean as it could be.  I wanted to try a facial cleansing brush but I didn&#x27;t want to spend $200.00 on it if it wasn&#x27;t going to actually make a difference.  After researching this brush and reading all of the reviews, I figured that I could at least give it a try and if it didn&#x27;t work out that was ok.  I LOVE THIS BRUSH.  I can never go back to washing my face with my hands.  Within two days of using it by face feels clean and fresh.  The pores on my face are smaller and the acne that I do have is clearing up and nothing new has cropped up.  The exfoliation brush is also great.  I have some dry spots on my face from a recent breakout and the brush is helping to remove any dead skin that I still have.  I cannot wait to give the body brush a try!  I&#x27;ll be purchasing this brush as a gift for my girlfriends who struggle with acne too.</li>
            <li> I bought this and it was initially great! I used it every morning and night until it suddenly stopped working 3 months later :(</li>
            <li> I originally saw this on Groupon for $32 - I was planning to order it, but they were sold out! I just happened to find it on Amazon for a few dollars more, and coupled with the great reviews about it, it seem like a wise &amp;#34;investment.&amp;#34; Oh. My. Gosh. This is the best $35 dollar I&#x27;ve probably ever spent! It works amazingly! My skin is so smooth, no more ridiculous acne, it lessened the appearance of acne scars on my face, it just... WORKS! The face brushes really get my skin squeaky clean. I haven&#x27;t used the body brush yet, as it will take more time in the shower for that - I&#x27;ll have to try over the weekend. I also love that I can use it in the shower without fear of it succombing to water damage. It&#x27;s just a great product overall - I HIGHLY RECOMMEND getting it. I have nothing bad to say about it!</li>
            <li> The cleaning brushes were not powerful.  I already called about it. Thank you.  Also, the cleaner will not stand up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about two weeks and I can definitely see a difference in my skin! It&#x27;s so much smoother and soft and it really helps to give a deeper clean. I love it! And for the price it&#x27;s a steal!</li>
            <li> This product is so awesome. I highly recommend it. For the price it goes above and beyond! I think my friend took mine, though.. I haven&#x27;t seen it in almost a month :( Time to buy a new one!</li>
            <li> I love the brushes for the face but the one for the body I can do without. Was grateful for the price too. My box was delivered to the wrong house but I ended up geyting it 3 days later. In all it works n I got it!</li>
            <li> April Jones&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for several months now and I like it. I wash my face about 3 times per day and thought that my face was clean until I purchased and used this product.  The first time I used the tool it removed 3 day old make-up from my face I thought I removed with previous washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used the smaller brush and the pumice buffer and they are both great tools to add to your beauty regimen. My face is smooth and clear at this present moment and I owe it to Vitagoods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the body brush was an added bonus for me and I have not used it but I will in the future. This tool takes AA batteries which is also an added bonus for travel I hate carrying a BUNCH of power cords.</li>
            <li> I, too, purchased this on groupon. I was concerned because there were no online reviews anywhere. I wanted an excellent facial brush/cleansing system, but couldn&#x27;t afford the $100/$200 by clarisonic. So, with my hesitations, I pushed forward. I&#x27;m so very happy that I did! The Vitagoods face and body cleaning brush system is awesome! Granted, I&#x27;ve only had it for little over a week, but so far, I&#x27;m very happy. The soft facial cleaning brush, as well as the exfoliating brush, are wonderful. They both leave my face much, much cleaner than if I try to clean it by rubbing cleanser onto my skin, directly with my hands. My face looks softer, and more even. And, suprisingly, I&#x27;ve been using the cleansing brush twice a day, every day on my face, and my face hasn&#x27;t peeled or gotten dry. This is an extremely important issue for me because I normally have combination skin, and have always read (with other cleansing brushes) that sometimes there&#x27;s noticeable peeling or dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, why only 4/5 stars?&lt;br /&gt;Well, the battery-operated function is not the easiest to deal with. It requires 4AA batteries. I have rechargeable Duracell batteries, but I only have two of them, and so must use regular AA batteries. And so, it&#x27;s eating up my battery life for my regular batteries. A device like this definitely benefits from either being rechargeable or having a plug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I haven&#x27;t used the body brush, and so I can&#x27;t comment how well it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the pumice stone for a callous on my foot, and so far, it&#x27;s done an excellent job of reducing the pain and overall size of the callous. I&#x27;m still working with it, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think it&#x27;s a great product. Is it worth the $100 original price? I&#x27;m not certain, as I&#x27;m a frugal person by nature. But, it was definitely worth the $29 groupon goods purchase I made to have it!</li>
            <li> This thing spins so slowly, maybe I got a bad one. I dropped it in the shower and it broke.</li>
            <li> I have this set for myself and ordered this one for my daughter for Christmas because I like it so much. Good value and works well.</li>
            <li> I liked mine so much that I bought one for my mother - and told her she had to try it and not just put it in the closet.  She did -(try it that is)  and she loves it.  She said she had the nicest old lady skin in the city!</li>
            <li> In july 2010 I purchased a Nutrisonic brush for $120 I think. [[ASIN:B002RZKFAQ Nutra Sonic 1020 Professional 4 Speed Face and Body Cleansing System, Lavender]]  This was a good brush.  I have an oily complexion and am prone to acne, this product helped to deep clean my face.  I liked the sealed waterproof system; I liked the rechargeable battery system.  The rechargeable battery died after a little over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the vitagoods spin maybe 6 months ago.  It takes AA batteries and is not rechargeable, it spins the brush, the Nutrisonic vibrated.  I think the spin works as well as the other brush, approximately same quality feel.  My first set of batteries in the spin lasted maybe a month, I was very disappointed.  The next set of batteries have lasted over 3 months ... so I guess I had a bad first set of batteries ... 3 months seems good to me.  I use this brush about every-other day for maybe 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final thoughts.  I like this brush.  Quality construction, good function, long battery life.  I wish it were rechargeable, but then again it is nice to throw in a drawer and not have a charger out ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update 6 months, no longer charges.  took unit apart to see if I could fix it, looks like a wiring issue to the switch, hard to get to the internal components though, would have been tough to repair, so in the trash it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bought a new brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00CP7M2VG Water-Resistant Professional Skin Care Face and Body Brush System by ToiletTree Products (Purple)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT!!!  AA batteries, not rechargeable, but way more power (torque)  press to your face and still spins, doesnt bog motor down.  a month so far with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my 4th brush, I like the above link best so far.</li>
            <li> I got this on Groupon as well.  It is amazing! I never use cleansers on my face, just warm water and a washcloth (I rarely wear makeup so I don&#x27;t have makeup removal issues).  I use this without a cleanser on my face in the shower, I just wet the brush, my skin feels so smooth and clean.  I use the body brush with body wash and omgggg LOVE!  All that bumpy skin on the back of my thighs and rear end is gone! I&#x27;ve tried every scrub out there and nothing has worked like this. I gave it 4 stars only because it takes 4 AA batteries which is annoying and will cost more in the long run. Buy it!</li>
            <li> If I could give it zero stars I would.  After purchasing this item it arrived to my house non-functional.  I contacted Vitagoods customer service and they said if I forwarded them the reciept they would send me a replacement free of charge.  They said that they would contact me within 24 hours.  Instead, I have sent and resent the email to them five times over the last three weeks and haven&#x27;t heard a peep since.  Now I&#x27;m just returning it and buying a different brand.</li>
            <li> There are other skin cleaning brushes out there but this one from Vitagoods give you four accessories. There is a brush for every day cleaning, an exfoliating brushing, a pumice stone for feet and a larger brush for elbows, knees, ankles, etc. It is a good value compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> Treat yourself to your own spa treatment at home with the Vitagoods Spin-For-Perfect-Skin Face &amp; Body cleansing brush system. Has everything you need to leave you from head to toe with beautiful radiant clean skin. Has a good continuous spin but not too fast that it will leave you with \\&quot;brush burn\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with one large body brush that can be used in the shower with your favorite body wash to cleanse and deep clean and improve your skin&#x27;s texture. Your body will love you for it - it leaves you feeling so clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The facial brush and exfoliating facial brush are excellent for \\&quot;brushing away\\&quot; pimples and removing blackheads. Besides getting rid of blemishes, it also deeply cleanses the pores of makeup and toxins that your ordinary facial cleaner leaves behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pumice stone can be used for the rough skin areas on your elbows and feet. I only wish the stone was a flat shape rather than round so it would be easier to maneuver around my heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all it is WATER RESISTANT. Take it in the shower or tub with you and brush away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get replacements brushes right here on Amazon, here are a few of the links:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00JKZMTT6 Vitagoods Replacement Brush Heads, 4 Count]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00BWTX1PO Vitagoods Replacement Face Exfoliating Brush Heads for Perfect Skin, 2 Count]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00BWTWXDA Vitagoods Replacement Body Brush Heads for Perfect Skin, 2 Count]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00BWTWWU4 Vitagoods Replacement Pumice Stone Heads, 2 Count]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One year manufacturer&#x27;s warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product sample.</li>
            <li> I bought this specific product because of a friend who raves how well it works. When I received it, I put in batteries to find it doesn&#x27;t even power on. I tried a few different sets of batteries to make sure it was not due to dead batteries. Also, I know of another who received this product who had the same problem. I thought it was a rare incident. This is leading me to believe otherwise. I&#x27;m sure if I received a product that worked, I&#x27;d be of the same opinion of my friend, but I can&#x27;t rate the effectiveness of the product.</li>
            <li> I just used this exfoliater after purchasing it with a Groupon. My skin feels so soft and clean after just one use. Can&#x27;t wait to use it on the rest of my body. One thing to note, do NOT wet the brush before you put your cleanser of the brush. It will fly all over the place. Doesn&#x27;t need it. Looking forward to even better results with continued use.</li>
            <li> The first brush system set I received wouldn&#x27;t even turn on.  I was frustrated with the return process, but have completely changed my mind on this product and especially on this seller.  Within no time at all, the seller contacted me and arranged to send a replacement overnight.  I received the replacement this afternoon, and used it just now.  It&#x27;s FANTASTIC!  I love the different attachments for different purposes and can&#x27;t wait to try them all.  I used the face and body attachments so far, and my skin already feels smoother and invigorated.  But more than anything, I have to say that the AMAZING customer service, not from Amazon, but rather from this seller made all the difference in the world!  When a company stands behind their product and reaches out to customers in order to resolve any issues promptly and efficiently, well, that&#x27;s the way to run a business....I am a \\&quot;Vitagoods\\&quot; fan for life now.</li>
            <li> when I first turned on the device, I was disappointed with its power. To be honest I regretted buying it. However after using it for less than a week my skin quality improved ridiculously.It was gentle enough but your skin feels so soft. I have extremely oily skin and acne prone skin but my skin feels smooth, clean and not bruised. Even you face product seem to work better while using it.Works perfectly in the shower and way more effective than using harsh scrubs. After using this product you would never want to use your hands again to wash your face. I would have given it 5 stars but it uses 4 AA-batteries.</li>
            <li> Very handy - skin is soft! I have used all the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is the 2 face attachments were impossible for me to tell apart, so I don;t know which was for every day use and which was for &#x27;special&#x27; exfoliation. But I don&#x27;t use it everyday anyways because my skin is too sensitive for that.</li>
            <li> Bought the clarisonic for my face. Gave it to one ofmy daughters. Bought the vitagood for solo much less and its great</li>
            <li> I bought this at ross and it was The BEST thing ive done for my face! My skin is smoother and brighter.  It is well worth the amazon price.  I went 1 week without it and noticed my skin was starting to look dull again, but after 1 use its back to its new normal - smooth, bright, and toned! Get it! You wont be sorry...</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your time and money, mine didn&#x27;t even turn on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a week now and I can already tell a difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;This feels very sturdy in my hand and I live the 4 brush options.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says it will do. My skin looks and feel clear, clean, and supple. I strongly recommend this product and I would definitely be purchasing replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a month. And it stopped working. I&#x27;m waiting to hear from Vitagoods to see if they will replace.</li>
            <li> This brush comes with everything you need, except a charger.  My face was more radiant and beautiful after the first use.  I find the body brush to work well, especially on your feet after a trip to the beach, or in the winter when you wear black socks ;).  The pumice stone is wonderful.  These are not too rough, but I would suggest lots of lotion after using the body brush.  It takes off the dead skin, but you need to moisturize.  Also, you find yourself using a lot more soap with the body brush.  I find myself using a lot less with the face brush... odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I bought mine for $29.00 plus shipping on groupon.&lt;br /&gt;for $100 I might buy something with a charger, because this on requires batteries.</li>
            <li> I Love it and have given one to my daughter for a gift and she loves it also.  It gets all the makeup off and leaves your skin really clean. It really shines and is very smooth.  Debra</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself and a friend, and we both use the facial attachment almost daily, and I definitely think my skin is softer, clearer, more healthier looking. Love that I can use it in the shower. Can&#x27;t wait to try other attachments!</li>
            <li> This is an effective system for cleaning and exfoliating. It spins rapidly, and comes with four separate brushes, each with a different purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There’s a everyday brush, that you can use anywhere you need it to apply cleansers and brush off dead skin. There’s a more gentle brush designed for the face, and a larger brush that you can use all over the body, especially in trouble spots such as the knees and elbows and the top of the feet. It also comes with a pumice stone that works well removing dead skin from the feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My personal favorite is the pumice stone. I often wear Tevas, flip-flops, and sandals, and my feet tend to dry out. For the cost of a pedicure (or two) you can get one of these and get rid of the dead skin and calluses easily. Others in the family prefer the facial brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it’s waterproof. You can use it in the shower, and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One odd thing, though, that does have me a bit worried about how long this will hold up, is that one of the first times I used it after about ten minutes it started letting out a kind of high-pitched screech and slowed down a bit from its usual tempo. I had just added new batteries, so I don’t think it was a power issue. Anyhow, I stopped using it, let it sit for about twenty minutes, tried it again and it was working just fine. I haven’t had that issue recur, but it suggests to me there might be something loose in the motor that jolted out of place and then jolted back again. It’s working fine now, but I will update if I have any problems like that in the future. (Sample provided for the purpose of testing and review.)</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have the looking for this all my life. I have the clarisonic and olay but they both break me out even though I&#x27;ve been trying for at least 6 months and I try every other day so I gave up. I don&#x27;t know what made me buy this on groupon but i&#x27;m glad I did and it was only for $29 I think. I was very skeptical at first but I find that i can use this with any cleanser, no break outs. Doesn&#x27;t tug on your skin like clarisonic and is very gentle. My skin feels refreshed and radiant. I noticed a difference right away. Don&#x27;t usually write reviews but I had to say something. If clarisonic is not for you, try this!</li>
