            <li>love the way it looks on my hair specially when I pick it up..</li>
            <li>Such Beautiful colors.</li>
            <li>so this is great in that it actually holds it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The purple one is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It looks kinda cheap.</li>
            <li>Beautifully Detailed.</li>
            <li>It is a heavy 2 prong clip which holds my hair wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Plastic clips don&#x27;t last and don&#x27;t do a great job.</li>
            <li>So unique.</li>
            <li>expect a masterpiece for this price; but you will certainly get more value than what you paid for.</li>
            <li>But not bad.</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>It took almost 2 months to get here, which I dislike very much, but can&#x27;t complain too much because it was cheap and free shipping.</li>
            <li>They are so pretty!</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured!</li>
            <li>The hinge seems very sturdy &amp; the gems are securely &amp; neatly glued in place.</li>
            <li>Still a beautiful hairpin and not worth returning since it didnt cost much.</li>
            <li>It takes a while to get to you, but anything you want I  life is worth waiting on.</li>
            <li>Pretty, fair hold for long hair.</li>
            <li>Larger than expected - which is great!  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money and the wait.</li>
            <li>I truly have gotten my monies worth</li>
            <li>I got this for my wife who has very looooooooong hair, and it has no trouble holding all that hair because the structure is all metal and very strong.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s the right color description.</li>
            <li>This was cheap, and it looks perfectly decent.</li>
            <li>SO VERY MUCH.</li>
            <li>Pretty</li>

            <li>Color is exactly as shown on the picture.</li>
            <li>Really pretty hairpin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li>For less than 3 dollars its worth way more than that.</li>
            <li>It is very vintage looking circa 1920.  </li>
            <li>High quality hairpiece!</li>
            <li>The pricing is extemely reasonable.</li>
            <li>The clip is on the heavier side, so it might not be comfortable for those with thin or very fine hair.</li>
            <li>Item looks just like the pictures and has good grip, however my hair is very thick and it doesn&#x27;t hold much of it.</li>
            <li>Overall I love what it would have looked like and if the stone had been with the clip I would have put it back in and been on my way.</li>
            <li>Works great for wearing hair up, down, or half up/down.</li>
            <li>Its beautiful, but bigger than I thought and I have thin hair</li>
            <li>They gave me the option to refund me the money or send me a new one.  </li>
            <li>Love the different uses and its not too heavy.</li>
            <li>MY KIDS LIKED THEM FOR THEIR VERY LONG THICK HAIR.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t quite remember how long it took the first time, but the second time was 2 weeks shipping.</li>
            <li>This is very pretty but arrived with a stone out and the hanging part missing</li>
            <li>I am mixed, with long curly hair, therefore I&#x27;m very particular about hair accessories.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended for long hair on a bun or as a gift!!</li>
            <li>These clips are high quality, hands down.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> These clips are high quality, hands down.</li>
            <li> Little hanging piece is kind of annoying, it taps at your ear the whole time.</li>
            <li> , I have long hair and wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else to clip my hair up with...</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not scared of breaking it when I use it in my long hair.</li>
            <li> I bought one in pink too.</li>
            <li> That being said, I still want the other ones</li>
            <li> They were packaged with extreme care.</li>
            <li> The photos do them absolutely no justice!</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> though - the colors are not true to the picture and the beads don&#x27;t match on the item itself.</li>
            <li> Mine did vary a little from the photo.</li>
            <li> Con: it&#x27;s quite heavy, so you need a lot of hair and a tight hairdo for it to stay in.</li>
            <li> but it is way way to heavy to be a hair clip.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair, but a lot of it (long)</li>
            <li> but the quality is so poor it broke as soon as i touched it.</li>
            <li> so I was a bit sad.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone, before going to a mall paying the outrageous prices.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> When I got my order in the mail, it wasn&#x27;t the hairpin showed in the displayed image. Still a beautiful hairpin and not worth returning since it didnt cost much. This is what the hairpin I got looked like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00BRW1AFO Vintage Jewelry Crystal Butterfly Hairpins]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still works nicely, would have given 5 stars if I got the correct product.</li>
            <li> Pretty but the quality is so poor it broke as soon as i touched it. Took forever to arrive. Not worth it. DOn&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> These are Beautiful hair clips, they are made strong and hold well, I have long hair and wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else to clip my hair up with...Such Beautiful colors. Every where I go strangers stop and ask me, where did you get that hair clip.</li>
            <li> No jewels have fallen out of it and it works great! It&#x27;s made out of a sturdy metal so I&#x27;m not scared of breaking it when I use it in my long hair.</li>
            <li> pretty. Arrived on time. Brighter than pictured, also a tad more greenish turquoise, it&#x27;s teal, that&#x27;s the right color description. It shows turquoise in the picture, but is definitely teal in actuality.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! it is so beautiful in person it makes my hair look amazing always get compliments</li>
            <li> This was cheap, and it looks perfectly decent. What impressed me about this item is the actual clip, which is sturdy and strong.

            <li> l though the first hairpin I received was defected, I must admit that this is a beautiful piece. I contacted the seller &amp; explained my situation. They gave me the option to refund me the money or send me a new one.  I chosed to get another one.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I did. It&#x27;s beautiful, just a great hairpin. A must have. I get alot of complements on it. Color is exactly as shown on the picture. I feel that it looks way better in person. For less than 3 dollars its worth way more than that.

            <li> THESE WERE A BIG HIT AT CHRISTMAS. MY KIDS LIKED THEM FOR THEIR VERY LONG THICK HAIR. LA LA LA</li>
            <li> This one is nice as a fun/costume jewelry piece. It is a bit bigger/bulkier than Ithought, so I wouldn&#x27;t wear it day to day. But not bad.</li>
            <li> Pretty, fair hold for long hair. Little hanging piece is kind of annoying, it taps at your ear the whole time.</li>

            <li> i bought five for my bridesmaid&#x27;s they loved them. warning they are bigger than you think but overall these are gorgeous and a affordable price!</li>
            <li> Really pretty hairpin. Mine did vary a little from the photo. (Didn&#x27;t have the hanging accents)</li>
            <li> I bought a purple version of this too. The purple one is fantastic. I wasnt impressed with the teal one though - the colors are not true to the picture and the beads don&#x27;t match on the item itself. It looks kinda cheap. Just not a fan.</li>
            <li> This clip is beautiful!  Larger than expected - which is great!  Well worth the money and the wait.</li>
            <li> This is beautiful. Can&#x27;t beat the price</li>

            <li> This is very pretty but arrived with a stone out and the hanging part missing so I was a bit sad.  Overall I love what it would have looked like and if the stone had been with the clip I would have put it back in and been on my way. It is a heavy 2 prong clip which holds my hair wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I waited about a week before of use, before I gave this review. I recieved all 32 items claw clips I ordered. They were packaged with extreme care. I examined each clip and was amazed at how gorgeous they were. The photos do them absolutely no justice! I am mixed, with long curly hair, therefore I&#x27;m very particular about hair accessories. Plastic clips don&#x27;t last and don&#x27;t do a great job. I&#x27;ve been using metal hair clips for over 15 years. These clips are high quality, hands down. The pricing is extemely reasonable. I truly have gotten my monies worth and then some. I would recommend this product to anyone, before going to a mall paying the outrageous prices. If I could rate this product any higher, I would!!!</li>
            <li> And the person that I bought it for loves it and says it&#x27;s the prettiest hair clip that she&#x27;s ever had.</li>
            <li> Love this! Bought for my daughter and she loves it. Con: it&#x27;s quite heavy, so you need a lot of hair and a tight hairdo for it to stay in.</li>
            <li> Took a while to get here but she loves it</li>
            <li> Really good and cute thanks i like the design and everything thank you</li>
