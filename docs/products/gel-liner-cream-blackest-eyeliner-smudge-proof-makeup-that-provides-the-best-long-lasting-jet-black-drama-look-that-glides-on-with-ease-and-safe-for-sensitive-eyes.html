            <li>Wonderful company, I hope they keep adding new products to their line.</li>
            <li>It does come off very easy with any make up remover</li>
            <li>Best natural eyeliner!</li>
            <li>The company is amazing too, they follow up to make sure it&#x27;s arrived</li>
            <li>very smooth to apply (love the fact that you just use whatever brush you have already mastered).</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m glad i took a chance.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>But Shimarz is more waxy.  </li>
            <li>2 is too many, and 3 is getting obnoxious.</li>
            <li>I have to say I love the consistency -</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Also want to mention that the company itself has outstanding customer service and is very involved on making sure their customers are happy with their products.</li>
            <li>n more convinient ..</li>
            <li>It is better than my branded eyeliners.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s 70% organic because there are way too many cosmetics out there with harmful ingredients in them.</li>
            <li>Some eyeliners end up on the top of my eyelid unless I use eyeshadow to help seal it in.</li>
            <li>It glided on so smoothly and was very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my new eyeliner, for sure!!</li>
            <li>Love it...glides on smoothly and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all natural which is even better!!</li>
            <li>i ve also purchased the makeup set with it , so they match each other perfectly..</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s still easy to take off at night.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner comes off easily with coconut oil.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I bought a kit of makeup brushes which had a fine brush for eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It stayed put all day and looked fantastic.</li>
            <li>It glides on smooth and doesn&#x27;t smudge or run during the day.</li>
            <li>It flows so smoothly and glides on the the eyelid.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also vegan and gluten free.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s far superior than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that I still had two very distinct lines on my hand.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go, the eyeliner lasts pretty much through the day.</li>
            <li>I have found my new favorite liner!  </li>
            <li>So I was excited to try this out.  </li>
            <li>It is worth every penny !</li>
            <li>love the way more natural product compared to the OTC products out there.</li>
            <li>Came off clean.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very silky and goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>It is definitely &amp;#34;very black&amp;#34; and stayed pretty much perfect and fresh through the whole day and night.</li>
            <li>So nice to know that is natural ingredients and not harmful to the eyes.</li>
            <li>Seriously one of the best gel liners I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Now I m loyal customer to Shimraz line of beauty ..</li>
            <li>I have tried to find something as good that is also safe and so far this totally hits the mark.  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>But the upper lash stays perfect all day long!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love that this eyeliner goes on so easily and does not end up on my upper eyelid after all day wear.</li>
            <li>So they werent worth it..</li>
            <li>Overall nice will buy from them again</li>
            <li>Totally love this organic natural eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I received this today and was excited to try it so put it straight on.</li>
            <li>based on &amp;#34;non active/primarily indoor with couple of errands outside in heat and average humidity days&amp;#34; dear daughter, the liner stayed on perfect all day.</li>
            <li>Great gel liner, the color is truly a solid black and it won&#x27;t budge through most of the day.</li>
            <li>This product does not need to be &amp;#34;sealed&amp;#34; with any eyeshadow and is a wonderful deep black.</li>
            <li>was great at first but dried up super fast.</li>
            <li>, I still had a crisp cat eye after submerging my face in water.</li>
            <li>already love the lash curler and will try the liquid liner next!</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly, no weird ingredients.</li>
            <li>When I first received it, I tried it on my hand with a liner brush to test the color.</li>
            <li>First of all i ve never thought i d be using gel eyeliner..</li>
            <li>Really good smudge pot, a nice dark black.</li>
            <li>Good news as I tend to be a bit oily and make up that is not long lasting smudges on me.</li>
            <li>I do love the fact that it does not contain anything that will irritate my eyes which have become hypersensitive to beeswax and certain ingredients such as BHT and any type of urea.  </li>
            <li>I also love it,I have sensitive eyes, i need a better thinner brush, to put it on, but i also would like to see it in a black brown color.&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li>I tried it based off of positive reviews</li>
            <li>and it was easy enough to remove.  </li>
            <li>It is pricey as all the new natural toxic free makeup is.</li>
            <li>Liquid liner was so much easier</li>
            <li>they both make the gel eyeliner application much easier</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is Vegan, has less harmful ingredients and goes on easily!  </li>
            <li>as many other eyeliners I have tried.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how much better and easier it was than any other eyeliners I have used!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s relatively easy to apply but as with many gel liners, I feel that it&#x27;s a little dry</li>
            <li>I love that this product smudges only a little, a quick wipe of the tissue on my lids</li>
            <li>, I highly recommenced it and</li>
            <li>My first day using this (in combination with Jane Cosmetic Eye Primer) has left me amazed!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised as to how it slid on across my lid, and stayed on all day!  </li>
            <li>I wanted a matte black that glided on easily, wasn&#x27;t too wet and runny nor too dry and cracky, that stayed on yet washed off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li>I swim frequently with my children</li>
            <li>I am changing to all natural make up and bought this eye liner bc of the reviews.</li>
            <li>So far I like it.</li>
            <li>Immediately after I put it onto my eyes I gave my toddler a bath, completely forgetting about the test lines on my hand.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how black it is and does not irritate my eyes if I keep it on for long.</li>
            <li>This is a rich black gel liner that glides on and stays on!</li>
            <li>I was looking for an all natural product that was still super dark, and this is the answer!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a very large jar, so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>I live in NYC where summer commutes are hot, sweaty, and not fun when you get to work to find your make up has smudged and/or transferred to your upper lid.</li>
            <li>i thought maybe it was my fault for not storing it properly but the second pot i ordered started off dry right away.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s ok, but what is not ok is the business sending multiple emails begging for a review, every single time she orders the smallest item.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In my experience, items marked &#x27;organic&#x27;, &#x27;natural&#x27; or &#x27;vegan&#x27; do not necessarily have the same staying power that traditional cosmetics do.</li>
            <li>tried at end of day for a rubbing of eye area for &amp;#34;stay put&amp;#34; durability test&#x3D;it only lightened the liner color and intensity but did not show major smear.</li>
            <li>This applies so smooth and has some serious all day long wear.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> When I first received it, I tried it on my hand with a liner brush to test the color.</li>
            <li> First of all i ve never thought i d be using gel eyeliner..</li>
            <li> Really good smudge pot, a nice dark black.</li>
            <li> Good news as I tend to be a bit oily and make up that is not long lasting smudges on me.</li>
            <li> I do love the fact that it does not contain anything that will irritate my eyes which have become hypersensitive to beeswax and certain ingredients such as BHT and any type of urea.  </li>
            <li> I also love it,I have sensitive eyes, i need a better thinner brush, to put it on, but i also would like to see it in a black brown color.&lt;br /&gt;great</li>
            <li> I tried it based off of positive reviews</li>
            <li> and it was easy enough to remove.  </li>
            <li> It is pricey as all the new natural toxic free makeup is.</li>
            <li> Liquid liner was so much easier</li>
            <li> they both make the gel eyeliner application much easier</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is Vegan, has less harmful ingredients and goes on easily!  </li>
            <li> as many other eyeliners I have tried.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how much better and easier it was than any other eyeliners I have used!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s relatively easy to apply but as with many gel liners, I feel that it&#x27;s a little dry</li>
            <li> I love that this product smudges only a little, a quick wipe of the tissue on my lids</li>
            <li> , I highly recommenced it and</li>
            <li> My first day using this (in combination with Jane Cosmetic Eye Primer) has left me amazed!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised as to how it slid on across my lid, and stayed on all day!  </li>
            <li> I wanted a matte black that glided on easily, wasn&#x27;t too wet and runny nor too dry and cracky, that stayed on yet washed off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li> I swim frequently with my children</li>
            <li> I am changing to all natural make up and bought this eye liner bc of the reviews.</li>
            <li> So far I like it.</li>
            <li> Immediately after I put it onto my eyes I gave my toddler a bath, completely forgetting about the test lines on my hand.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how black it is and does not irritate my eyes if I keep it on for long.</li>
            <li> This is a rich black gel liner that glides on and stays on!</li>
            <li> I was looking for an all natural product that was still super dark, and this is the answer!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a very large jar, so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I live in NYC where summer commutes are hot, sweaty, and not fun when you get to work to find your make up has smudged and/or transferred to your upper lid.</li>
            <li> i thought maybe it was my fault for not storing it properly but the second pot i ordered started off dry right away.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s ok, but what is not ok is the business sending multiple emails begging for a review, every single time she orders the smallest item.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In my experience, items marked &#x27;organic&#x27;, &#x27;natural&#x27; or &#x27;vegan&#x27; do not necessarily have the same staying power that traditional cosmetics do.</li>
            <li> tried at end of day for a rubbing of eye area for &amp;#34;stay put&amp;#34; durability test&#x3D;it only lightened the liner color and intensity but did not show major smear.</li>
            <li> This applies so smooth and has some serious all day long wear.</li>
            <li> Overall I highly recommend this liner, especially if you tend to have an issue with your usual liner smudging.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long this will last.</li>
            <li> I currently use a gel pencil liner because of how dark it is, and the staying power,  The downfall of my current brand is that it sometimes runs in the corner of my eyes.  </li>
            <li> and I have to leave my eyes shut and fan them for a long time before it dries</li>
            <li> i think company is keeping these too long on the shelves.</li>
            <li> To take it off, I use baby wipes and wipe it off my eyes and it doesn&#x27;t even take long.</li>
            <li> It stays put just as long</li>
            <li> All the ones I tried were so hard to put on , smudgy even though they were high end ..</li>
            <li> and I wonder whether it&#x27;s going to dry up like</li>
            <li> I have had issues with finding a product dark enough that has the staying power that I look for.  </li>
            <li> I just washed my face and it only dulled the black and didn&#x27;t smudge it</li>
            <li> I have heavily lidded eyes and within an hour of applying eyeliner, it is already coming off onto my upper lid.  </li>
            <li> so I appreciate an eyeliner that doesn&#x27;t smudge or run when wet</li>
            <li> Not only does it NOT contain harsh chemicals, it has nourishing ingredients to help improve and condition lashes and brows.</li>
            <li> I put the jar lid on slightly askew without realizing it and and it the next time I went to put it on it was completely dried out into a shrunked disc and was unusable.</li>
            <li> This is certainly not the case with this gel eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I wash the brush with soap and water afterwards but the brush is always stiff the next day.</li>
            <li> Stayed on longer than other smudge pots I have used.</li>
            <li> Every other gel eyeliner I&#x27;ve tried is very wet</li>
            <li> The amount you get in this little glass jar is minimal.</li>
            <li> And I love that it&#x27;s not made with bad chemicals!</li>
            <li> After a few bad eye infections from traditional makeup and eyeliner, I decided to go organic and natural to go with my vegetarian/vegan lifestyle as well.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because of the natural ingredients in this product</li>
            <li> Very Black.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is very versatile and can be subtle or very dramatic.</li>
            <li> I use a small brush to apply it.</li>
            <li> It comes in like the texture of mud or thick frosting.</li>
            <li> I do have a bit of a difficult time getting it in a thin line but this could be due to my brush.</li>
            <li> Since I am used to a pencil, I thought this may be difficult.  </li>
            <li> I will try to remember to touch base after I&#x27;ve been using it for a while to update this too.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best natural eyeliner! Glides on perfectly, does not smudge and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m vegan and this is the best vegan eyeliner I have ever used. I wanted a matte black that glided on easily, wasn&#x27;t too wet and runny nor too dry and cracky, that stayed on yet washed off easily with soap and water. Bingo! This stuff is excellent.</li>
            <li> I also love it,I have sensitive eyes, i need a better thinner brush, to put it on, but i also would like to see it in a black brown color.&lt;br /&gt;great stuff, I&#x27;m glad i took a chance. would like to try the pencil next, to carry in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;so glad its no chemicals!</li>
            <li> I have heavily lidded eyes and within an hour of applying eyeliner, it is already coming off onto my upper lid.  I&#x27;ve been searching for an eyeliner that would stay on.  This is the one!  I tried it based off of positive reviews and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  Every other gel eyeliner I&#x27;ve tried is very wet and I have to leave my eyes shut and fan them for a long time before it dries and then it still wears off onto my upper lid.  But Shimarz is more waxy.  I do not have to fan my eyes and it stays on immediately.  It DOES wear off somewhat before the end of the day but it&#x27;s far superior than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.  So I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s perfect, but it&#x27;s better than any others I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot.  It&#x27;s also a very large jar, so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> My first day using this (in combination with Jane Cosmetic Eye Primer) has left me amazed! I live in NYC where summer commutes are hot, sweaty, and not fun when you get to work to find your make up has smudged and/or transferred to your upper lid. Not with this eyeliner! I just washed my face and it only dulled the black and didn&#x27;t smudge it, I still had a crisp cat eye after submerging my face in water. It does come off very easy with any make up remover though. I am super impressed with the quality of this. It is definitely &amp;#34;very black&amp;#34; and stayed pretty much perfect and fresh through the whole day and night. I suggest you find a good quality slanted eye brush for best results of course. I even accidentally rubbed my eye at one point today and no smudge. So glad I found this!!</li>
            <li> Love it! I was looking for an all natural product that was still super dark, and this is the answer! Because I like to line my lower lash line as well, if I&#x27;m going out at night, I sometimes have to reapply it. But the upper lash stays perfect all day long! Very happy!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s the best natural gel eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used!!!! The company is amazing too, they follow up to make sure it&#x27;s arrived and then again to make sure you are satisfied!!! I&#x27;ll buy more products from these guys!!</li>
            <li> color is deep and solid. this gel gave is a between liquid and pencil look (closer to liquid). very smooth to apply (love the fact that you just use whatever brush you have already mastered). based on &amp;#34;non active/primarily indoor with couple of errands outside in heat and average humidity days&amp;#34; dear daughter, the liner stayed on perfect all day. tried at end of day for a rubbing of eye area for &amp;#34;stay put&amp;#34; durability test&#x3D;it only lightened the liner color and intensity but did not show major smear. love the way more natural product compared to the OTC products out there. already love the lash curler and will try the liquid liner next!</li>
            <li> This gel liner was very easy to use - very smooth and the perfect color!</li>
            <li> I currently use a gel pencil liner because of how dark it is, and the staying power,  The downfall of my current brand is that it sometimes runs in the corner of my eyes.  So I was excited to try this out.  I was amazed at the ease of using the Shimarz angled brush and the Gel Liner together.  Since I am used to a pencil, I thought this may be difficult.  I was pleasantly surprised as to how it slid on across my lid, and stayed on all day!  I didn&#x27;t have the issue of it running like I do my current brand.  I have had issues with finding a product dark enough that has the staying power that I look for.  I have found my new favorite liner!  I received this product in exchange for an honest product evaluation.</li>
            <li> was great at first but dried up super fast. i thought maybe it was my fault for not storing it properly but the second pot i ordered started off dry right away. i think company is keeping these too long on the shelves.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes. Goes on smoothly, no weird ingredients. I love it!  Amended: I put the jar lid on slightly askew without realizing it and and it the next time I went to put it on it was completely dried out into a shrunked disc and was unusable.</li>
            <li> I used  a similar eyeliner product but found that it not only smudged throughout the day but it irritated my eyes and contacts.  I love that this product smudges only a little, a quick wipe of the tissue on my lids and I&#x27;m good to go, the eyeliner lasts pretty much through the day.</li>
            <li> My wife buys a lot of stuff, using my amazon account. That&#x27;s ok, but what is not ok is the business sending multiple emails begging for a review, every single time she orders the smallest item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 email is enough. 2 is too many, and 3 is getting obnoxious. If I do not want to give a review, the business should respect that, especially since to me it is only a simple eye liner.</li>
            <li> Love it...glides on smoothly and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Great product, goes on and stays on wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I received this today and was excited to try it so put it straight on. I have to say I love the consistency - it&#x27;s very silky and goes on very smoothly. It stayed put all day and looked fantastic. I am so happy to find this product as since throwing out my Bobbi Brown Gel Eyeliner which has toxic stuff in it I have tried to find something as good that is also safe and so far this totally hits the mark.  I removed it with some moisturizer and it was easy enough to remove.  This is great stuff.  I will try to remember to touch base after I&#x27;ve been using it for a while to update this too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this gel eyeliner. It glides on smooth and doesn&#x27;t smudge or run during the day. I swim frequently with my children so I appreciate an eyeliner that doesn&#x27;t smudge or run when wet and that&#x27;s still easy to take off at night. This eyeliner comes off easily with coconut oil. Love it. Also want to mention that the company itself has outstanding customer service and is very involved on making sure their customers are happy with their products. I&#x27;m very impressed with this product and the service I received. Thank you!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s  very good,  the good aroma , smoothie. really liked</li>
            <li> So nice to know that is natural ingredients and not harmful to the eyes. Very Black. Goes on well.</li>
            <li> I am changing to all natural make up and bought this eye liner bc of the reviews. So far I like it. I use a small brush to apply it. The brush tends to get clumpy if I don&#x27;t wash it. It definitely stays on all day. I do have a bit of a difficult time getting it in a thin line but this could be due to my brush. Overall I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Stays on way better than Bobbi Brown and drugstore brands! And I love that it&#x27;s not made with bad chemicals!</li>
            <li> This is a rich black gel liner that glides on and stays on! Not only does it NOT contain harsh chemicals, it has nourishing ingredients to help improve and condition lashes and brows.I am very impressed with this line of cosmetics!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously impressed with this gel eye liner. In my experience, items marked &#x27;organic&#x27;, &#x27;natural&#x27; or &#x27;vegan&#x27; do not necessarily have the same staying power that traditional cosmetics do. This is certainly not the case with this gel eyeliner. When I first received it, I tried it on my hand with a liner brush to test the color. Then, I put it on my eyes. Immediately after I put it onto my eyes I gave my toddler a bath, completely forgetting about the test lines on my hand. After bathing, drying and getting him dressed I noticed that I still had two very distinct lines on my hand. Good news as I tend to be a bit oily and make up that is not long lasting smudges on me. The excellent news is that the liner removes very easily with my make up removing wipes and/or cleanser. Overall I highly recommend this liner, especially if you tend to have an issue with your usual liner smudging. I received this product in exchange for an honest product evaluation.</li>
            <li> I ve been using Shimraz gel eyeliner for three days till now.. First of all i ve never thought i d be using gel eyeliner.. All the ones I tried were so hard to put on , smudgy even though they were high end .. So they werent worth it.. Liquid liner was so much easier n more convinient .. However , when i tried Shimraz gel eyeliner , I FELL in LOVE with it ! It is amazing .. i ve also purchased the makeup set with it , so they match each other perfectly.. they both make the gel eyeliner application much easier n simplier.. Now I m loyal customer to Shimraz line of beauty .. n It is worth every penny ! Definitly recommended</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because of the natural ingredients in this product but I have to say that this gel liner does stay on.  It&#x27;s relatively easy to apply but as with many gel liners, I feel that it&#x27;s a little dry and I wonder whether it&#x27;s going to dry up like gel liners tend to do.  I guess only time will tell.  I do love the fact that it does not contain anything that will irritate my eyes which have become hypersensitive to beeswax and certain ingredients such as BHT and any type of urea.  Just because of that I would buy this item again.</li>
            <li> Really good smudge pot, a nice dark black. Stayed on longer than other smudge pots I have used. Came off clean. Overall nice will buy from them again</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:8f11dacc4920cf77f5d95f7d3f7c1e3f]] Totally love this organic natural eyeliner. It flows so smoothly and glides on the the eyelid. I absolutely love how black it is and does not irritate my eyes if I keep it on for long. To take it off, I use baby wipes and wipe it off my eyes and it doesn&#x27;t even take long. It is better than my branded eyeliners. Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> After a few bad eye infections from traditional makeup and eyeliner, I decided to go organic and natural to go with my vegetarian/vegan lifestyle as well.I have never used a smudge pot before. I bought a kit of makeup brushes which had a fine brush for eyeliner. It is easy to apply. It comes in like the texture of mud or thick frosting. I wash the brush with soap and water afterwards but the brush is always stiff the next day. I manage. The amount you get in this little glass jar is minimal. About an eighth of an inch. I don&#x27;t know how long this will last. It is pricey as all the new natural toxic free makeup is. The price is the only factor for wanting to go back to cheaper makeup that is functional.</li>
            <li> I have never used an eyeliner that wasn&#x27;t in pencil form before. I couldn&#x27;t believe how much better and easier it was than any other eyeliners I have used! This eyeliner is very versatile and can be subtle or very dramatic. It also stays put for the day. I felt great purchasing this product because of its organic and non toxic ingredients. I had some questions and concerns and the company&#x27;s customer service was excellent and very prompt. Wonderful company, I hope they keep adding new products to their line.</li>
            <li> Great gel liner, the color is truly a solid black and it won&#x27;t budge through most of the day.</li>
            <li> Best eyeliner ever!  I used M.A.C. forever, but they&#x27;ve since been bought out by Estee Lauder, who animal tests.  This eyeliner is Vegan, has less harmful ingredients and goes on easily!  It even smells great, I highly recommenced it and it&#x27;s my new eyeliner, for sure!!</li>
            <li> Seriously one of the best gel liners I have ever used! This applies so smooth and has some serious all day long wear. I tested a swatch on my hand to see how well it would hold up throughout the day compared to a different gel liner.  It stayed ALL day, not a smudge or line out of place!! Most excellent gel liner i have found and it&#x27;s all natural which is even better!! This product was provided for inspection and my honest review.</li>
            <li> This is a great eye liner pot! The color payoff for this eyeliner is very impressive. It glided on so smoothly and was very easy to apply. I only needed to go over a spot one time and didn&#x27;t need to go back and touch it up. I love that it&#x27;s 70% organic because there are way too many cosmetics out there with harmful ingredients in them. This is perfect for someone who wears contacts! It&#x27;s also vegan and gluten free. It stays put just as long as many other eyeliners I have tried. It even has coconut oil, vitamin E, and grape seed oil, which are all great conditioners for your lashes. I am very impressed with the performance of this eyeliner. It stayed put all day and I even rubbed my eye without realized it and it still looked perfect. *sample provided for testing and review*</li>
            <li> I absolutely love that this eyeliner goes on so easily and does not end up on my upper eyelid after all day wear. Some eyeliners end up on the top of my eyelid unless I use eyeshadow to help seal it in. This product does not need to be &amp;#34;sealed&amp;#34; with any eyeshadow and is a wonderful deep black.</li>
