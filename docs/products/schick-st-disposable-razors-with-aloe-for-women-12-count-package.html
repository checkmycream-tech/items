            <li>Good one time use disposable razors.</li>

            <li>So far so good not problems great shipment</li>
            <li>They are easy and cheap and do a good job.</li>
            <li>For most people a 2-blade razor is all you need, and these also have a &amp;#34;gunk eject&amp;#34; button.  </li>
            <li>I love these and will buy them again</li>
            <li>I love these razors.</li>
            <li>Some could be re-assembled, but most could not.  </li>
            <li>A W OK MAN</li>
            <li>Pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li>just not enough blades for for a delicut LOL kind of girl.  </li>
            <li>and i think a triple is better, but it&#x27;s fine for the price.</li>
            <li>The razors are great - no nicks or cuts so far, and a smooth shave each time I use them.</li>
            <li>I had to make sure I didn&#x27;t slice my skin off when I shaved my legs with it for the first time!</li>
            <li>Kinda cheap but will work in a pinch.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave.</li>
            <li>They give a close shave and leave my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>I order these because they&#x27;re super cheap...  </li>
            <li>so disposible that they are only good for one use</li>
            <li>I use them once on significant areas and save them to use one more time on my underarms only since they don&#x27;t need a fresh razor, and then I toss them out!</li>
            <li>These right here, suck in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;*They&#x27;re</li>
            <li>my have last twice as long (up to four days) and my skin feels super soft afterward :) very satisfied</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>For the record I don&#x27;t even have that much hair..</li>
            <li>the job done, but it took longer and didn&#x27;t get much of a close shave.</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast from Amazon, and the price was cheaper than the stores in my neighborhood so kudos for that.</li>
            <li>harder to clean, so</li>
            <li>They are really dull right out of the package, and don&#x27;t last more than 2-3 shaves.</li>
            <li>I had been spending more money on blades for a different razor and thought I could get away with buying these instead and saving a little money.</li>
            <li>ok I don&#x27;t like to say negative about any product.</li>
            <li>For people who complained I would ask if they are using them more than once, because you&#x27;re not supposed to.</li>
            <li>They are not sharp what so ever.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I usually used the BIC razors in the pink package, the ones not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>As far as disposables go, they last quite a while</li>
            <li>my leg hair usually grows back prickly the next day whenever i use the cheap store brand $2 razors.</li>

            <li> Usually use bic</li>

            <li> I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to switch to something a little less expensive like this.</li>

            <li> Wrong!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Several blades were snapped off inside the packaging.</li>
            <li> ok I don&#x27;t like to say negative about any product. the Aloe is a plus.  just not enough blades for for a delicut LOL kind of girl.  my skin is just too sesitive for these even with the Aloe. Just me. Great value.</li>
            <li> So far so good not problems great shipment</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> If you need to shave this will work for you!</li>
            <li> Kinda cheap but will work in a pinch.</li>
            <li> Just disposable razor blades. Works as well as any.</li>
            <li> They do their job and are cost effective.  For most people a 2-blade razor is all you need, and these also have a &amp;#34;gunk eject&amp;#34; button.  My wife and I use this type because it meets both of our needs well.</li>
            <li> I love these and will buy them again</li>
            <li> I love these razors. Couldn&#x27;t find them at the local stores around me anymore. The razors don&#x27;t nick my skin. Smooth shave.</li>
            <li> These hurt me. Unusable.</li>
            <li> My wife is happy and that makes me happy.</li>
            <li> Fall apart very easily. Only last one shave if that. Will never buy again.</li>
            <li> Good one time use disposable razors. I use them for my family of girls when we go on vacation. No accidental sharing.</li>
            <li> I like these razors. As far as disposables go, they last quite a while but they are still disposables. As expected.</li>
            <li> Easily half of the razors were broken when they arrived. Some could be re-assembled, but most could not.  Not a great deal when you can only use half.</li>
            <li> They are not sharp what so ever. I will not buy again &amp; do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years. They are easy and cheap and do a good job. I have no complaints and the price is alright.</li>
            <li> I order these because they&#x27;re super cheap...  I can&#x27;t use &#x27;em on my legs, but I shave my netheryaya with these.  I use a new one every 2-3 times, and don&#x27;t feel bad throwing these out after so few uses.</li>
            <li> Great razors for a desposable razor. They work great.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought.. My kids hate them and wont use them. I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
            <li> I just canceled my subscription for these because they suck. They are rusty in like 2 days and they just suck at shaving. Just don&#x27;t even bother. For the record I don&#x27;t even have that much hair..</li>
            <li> These are really worthless. I had been spending more money on blades for a different razor and thought I could get away with buying these instead and saving a little money. I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to switch to something a little less expensive like this. Wrong! I had to make sure I didn&#x27;t slice my skin off when I shaved my legs with it for the first time! I ended up giving them away.</li>
            <li> my leg hair usually grows back prickly the next day whenever i use the cheap store brand $2 razors. i tried these after a friend recommended them. my have last twice as long (up to four days) and my skin feels super soft afterward :) very satisfied</li>
            <li> What can I say, It works as intended.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Schick.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I usually used the BIC razors in the pink package, the ones not for sensitive skin. These right here, suck in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;*They&#x27;re harder to clean, so I only used them for 2 shaving experiences each, which makes sense, but the BIC lasted longer, and cleaned easier, and didn&#x27;t rust as fast.&lt;br /&gt;*Got the job done, but it took longer and didn&#x27;t get much of a close shave. I&#x27;ll be returning to BIC after I finish this package. The delivery was fast from Amazon, and the price was cheaper than the stores in my neighborhood so kudos for that.</li>
            <li> Works well. This is a double blade and i think a triple is better, but it&#x27;s fine for the price.</li>
            <li> Usually use bic but I thought I would give these a shot. They are really dull right out of the package, and don&#x27;t last more than 2-3 shaves. Won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> I like these razors! I get the best shave with disposable razors and these aren&#x27;t any exception. They give a close shave and leave my skin smooth. For people who complained I would ask if they are using them more than once, because you&#x27;re not supposed to. I use them once on significant areas and save them to use one more time on my underarms only since they don&#x27;t need a fresh razor, and then I toss them out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always worried about receiving counterfeit items on Amazon and was hesitant to make this purchase. The razors are great - no nicks or cuts so far, and a smooth shave each time I use them.</li>
            <li> so disposible that they are only good for one use</li>
            <li> DISAPOINTED DIDN&#x27;T. WORK FOR ME I ONLY USE IT ON NY BEARD AS A W OK MAN IT IS EMBARRASSING BUT WHEN SHAVED CAN&#x27;T TELL BUT I COULD STILL SEE SOMETHING SO HAD TO GET ANOTHER ONE WHICH WAS A WAIST.</li>
            <li> These razors are great to use because I never get razor burn and I never cut myself when using them.</li>
            <li> Wimpy little two-blade operation.  I was severely unimpressed.</li>
            <li> Pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know they were only 1-blade razors.  Not worth it.</li>
