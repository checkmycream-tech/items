            <li>Great results.</li>
            <li>Great value.</li>
            <li>Love the UV desinfecting option and they remain charged without the port perfectly for a weekend trip</li>
            <li>My latest report from the dental hygienist was excellent.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;re very happy with this purchase, love the 2 min.</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are fabulous, and our dentist is very happy that we got them.</li>
            <li>The sonic concept is good, just not this brand.</li>
            <li>I loved this product until one of the toothbrushes stopped working after one month&#x27;s use.  </li>
            <li>After looking at the options I decided an ultrasonic brush would be a good choice.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be well made, using good quality materials.  </li>
            <li>I like it much better than the Sonicare we had!</li>
            <li>When the brushes were working, I really liked them.</li>
            <li>both of these worked well and were effective for about 6 months.  </li>
            <li>I bought a Pursonic s400 a year ago and liked it.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush unit.  </li>
            <li>The question is do we give them another shot, or just purchase a reputable brand?</li>
            <li>They love them.</li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for, my kids love them</li>
            <li>If I had bought it at a dept. store they would gladly replace a defective item.</li>
            <li>I have no way of testing its&#x27; effectiveness, but I looked online and found a study that indicated that UV sanitizers reduced most, but not all of thebacteria on the brush heads.  </li>
            <li>so you can get into the side of your teeth better to get the plaque out.</li>
            <li>Love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>First the Good ...</li>
            <li>The sonic action is apparently very effective.  </li>
            <li>Great, love the three speeds, timer functions and especially the ultraviolet chamber for disinfecting.  </li>
            <li>It seems to clean my teeth much better.</li>
            <li>After speaking with customer service, i was able to return for full refund.</li>
            <li>It worked fine, but it has rinsing ports in the brush head which would grow slimy mold.  </li>
            <li>: Well made Versatile settings Dual Handles UV brush sanitizer Great report from dentist Good price particularly with extra brush heads  </li>
            <li>UV light does not work and that was why I bought it.</li>
            <li>The light is in the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; position</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s great return policy left me feeling confident that it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this was a great find.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m returning this one because the UV light doesn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Samsonic isn&#x27;t NOT the original supplier we had issues with.</li>
            <li>and my teeth do not feel as clean as they should after using this buy.</li>
            <li>These china imitations get very hot when charging and feel extremely cheap in your hand.</li>
            <li>Good size, fits in my travel bag, and the charge lasts for several days.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad purchase if both units work, and you do not have braces, but I would not recommend anyone with braces buying this product.</li>
            <li>I use the full two minutes for brushing and it actually feels good.  </li>
            <li>The unit was received very quickly and came exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>timer that pauses briefly every 30 sec &amp; think the UV light is great!</li>
            <li>The 2 min timer on the brushes is nice, but I never times it to see if it was actually 2 min.</li>
            <li>However,  the brush heads could be of better quality especially since they don&#x27;t fit snug and the rubber stopper continues to detach and fall.</li>
            <li>This is far better then just rinsing off the brush head.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as my other toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Looks good, just not worth the price since do not feel it is a comparable electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>Really does a great job of getting into tight spots too, I recommend these.</li>
            <li>and I love the santizer in the middle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still cavity free after nearly two years of the pursonic (that is unusual for me).  </li>
            <li>Generally works well, but had quality concerns after inspecting it upon receipt, and now UV light is already no longer working.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s charge long and the many fire warnings about leaving it plugged in make me nervous to charge it while out of the house.</li>
            <li>I really liked the brush, until my black one died,</li>
            <li>and if you press too hard the brush stops, which is good.</li>
            <li>I travel constantly, and having a toothbrush that keeps its charge for 1-2 weeks is important.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see where I can buy a replacement brush, so it looks like we have to replace the whole thing.</li>
            <li>The real test was when I had my checkup.  </li>
            <li>My teeth have done really well with this one.</li>
            <li>The 3 different settings are distinct and seem to be useful.  </li>
            <li>In comparison to the other, this one is actually better to my surprise.</li>
            <li>Lastly, the bristles are pretty soft, so I do not feel as though I get as good a cleaning as with other toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>More for less than comparable products.</li>
            <li>then one of the brushes stopped cycling through all 4 sessions on high.</li>
            <li>I use the high setting for brushing and the massage setting afterwards to stimulate my gums.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It has more power than the battery toothbrushes, but no where near my other brand.  </li>
            <li>Some review said the tooth brushes are too small, but my dentist says it&#x27;s good to use the smaller tooth brush</li>
            <li>My teeth do feel cleaner with the new &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; brushes.</li>
            <li>Emailed pursonic and they sent a new brush.</li>
            <li>It was grossing me out, so I decided to get a new brush.  </li>
            <li>No problems with either handle,  Everything works as new.  </li>
            <li>I like the cleaning lights/compartment, and I really enjoy the three different settings (especially the lower setting with pulse).  </li>
            <li>Hygienists says that my gums are much better, and she did very little scraping during the exam.  </li>
            <li>Do not buy this brand complete junk!</li>
            <li>and I would usually continue to brush till I was satisfied.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how to say this, but when are you supposed to use the black light?</li>
            <li>The first setting does&#x27;t work and the brush is looking very worn after only 2 weeks of regular use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seems like the brush component are poorly designed inside, or maybe not water resistant enough?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, to top it off the company is asking us to return the defective product at our cost for repair, this has to be a joke !</li>
            <li>Not year even one year old.</li>
            <li>Purchased the set to replace 2 old Oral B electric brushes that we could no longer find replacement head for.</li>
            <li>Her and the dentist commented on how my teeth and gums were looking the cleanest and with the least amount of plaque and scale in many years.  </li>
            <li>She said there was very little scaling and my gums were better than the last checkup.  </li>
            <li>Bought this set back in early 2014.</li>
            <li>my buddy who purchased the same model started having the same issue on the black one, our red brush is working fine, just the black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>rechargeable tooth brushes is that they don&#x27;t last much longer and they and their brushes are much more expensive.  </li>
            <li>I contacted Pursonc and they told me that the s452 operates at a higher rpm and less torque than the s400.  </li>
            <li>So glad we switched from ordinary, conventional brushes.</li>
            <li>Company needs to do a better QA job which could be just a poor quality and short product longevity.</li>
            <li>Tickled a little at first, but after 3-4 uses, that went away.  </li>
            <li>black brush had the issues first, it would sit on the charger for several hours and only have about 15-30 seconds of battery for brushing, and now it will not even charge.</li>
            <li>The black light for killing bacteria has only been used a few times.</li>
            <li>Smart looking - few feature that we like is variable speed</li>

            <li> Smart looking - few feature that we like is variable speed</li>
            <li> Needless to say that was only done a hand full of time and not used any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time, I thought it was broken and tried the second unit to confirm.  </li>
            <li> One black electric toothbrush stopped working after 6 months, red electric toothbrush is shutting off in 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> Tried that, and placing a wet brush head in the housing causes a &amp;#34;mold&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> It still works, but now the black brush has died with the same problem as the red brush and we are two months past warranty.</li>
            <li> Now the other toothbrush is stopping during the cycles.</li>
            <li> Their services were good, but the quality of the brushes are horrible.</li>
            <li> I was a little reluctant to buy the Pursonic because it wasn&#x27;t a known brand.  </li>
            <li> ANd, it is not too harsh on teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this, buy from a dept store.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Not sure if my purchase was refurbished.  </li>
            <li> Being a coffee drinker they usually would have some staining.  </li>
            <li> Usually I have had some staining and tartar that she would have to remove.  </li>
            <li> Today at the 1 year 8 month mark the second head failed.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d like to see better workmanship, especially of base unit.</li>
            <li> they should be replacing it free of charge, utterly disappointed !!</li>
            <li> I used the brush about 5 times and now it&#x27;s no good.</li>
            <li> After about 1 year and 4 months one of the power heads failed.  </li>

            <li> THE ONLY THING THIS PRODUCT DID WAS &#x27;BUZZ&amp;#34;  THE BRISTLES DID NOT MOVE.  I RETURNED IT.</li>
            <li> These work perfectly. Absolutely great toothbrushes. The heads hold up for about month (brushing three times a day) and it came with a ton of replacement heads. Really does a great job of getting into tight spots too, I recommend these.</li>
            <li> received as Christmas gift december 2014. Tonight mine quit working. Amazons policy no return after thirty days . After speaking with customer service, i was able to return for full refund. Do not buy this brand complete junk! These china imitations get very hot when charging and feel extremely cheap in your hand.</li>
            <li> One black electric toothbrush stopped working after 6 months, red electric toothbrush is shutting off in 10 seconds. Not year even one year old.JUNK</li>
            <li> Purchased August 2014. One handle now doesn&#x27;t work (January 2015). Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are fabulous, and our dentist is very happy that we got them. We have been using them for almost a year now. They are the bomb!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush unit.  It is perfect for my husband and me.  We both have a brush on one base and I love the santizer in the middle.  Also appreciate the number of brush heads that come with this unit.  ANd, it is not too harsh on teeth and gums.  I like it much better than the Sonicare we had!</li>
            <li> Purchased the set to replace 2 old Oral B electric brushes that we could no longer find replacement head for. The 2 min timer on the brushes is nice, but I never times it to see if it was actually 2 min. Seems too short and I would usually continue to brush till I was satisfied. My teeth do feel cleaner with the new &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; brushes. The black light for killing bacteria has only been used a few times. I don&#x27;t know how to say this, but when are you supposed to use the black light? After you brush? Tried that, and placing a wet brush head in the housing causes a &amp;#34;mold&amp;#34; smell. Needless to say that was only done a hand full of time and not used any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The black brush had the issues first, it would sit on the charger for several hours and only have about 15-30 seconds of battery for brushing, and now it will not even charge. The lasted about a month longer, but is now only holding a 30 second charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am honestly disappointed with these &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34; sonic tooth brushes. I only purchased because the reviews were so high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good news is Amazon picked up the warranty when the supplier would not. Samsonic isn&#x27;t NOT the original supplier we had issues with. The question is do we give them another shot, or just purchase a reputable brand?</li>
            <li> Bought this set back in early 2014. Since then the red toothbrush died. Sent it back to pursonic along with $10.00 money order for return. Got the brush back two weeks later and it worked for two days. Emailed pursonic and they sent a new brush. It still works, but now the black brush has died with the same problem as the red brush and we are two months past warranty. Their services were good, but the quality of the brushes are horrible. I&#x27;ll never purchase pursonic again.</li>
            <li> First the Good ... I like the cleaning lights/compartment, and I really enjoy the three different settings (especially the lower setting with pulse).  Good size, fits in my travel bag, and the charge lasts for several days.  I travel constantly, and having a toothbrush that keeps its charge for 1-2 weeks is important. The Bad ... one of the brushes does not work at all, so now I must go through the process of returning the item or only utilizing one brush when I paid for two.  Next, I have braces, and the bristles come off in the braces at every brushing.  I must pull the bristles out of my braces with tweezers after each brushing, so quite a hassle.  Lastly, the bristles are pretty soft, so I do not feel as though I get as good a cleaning as with other toothbrushes I&#x27;ve used.  Not a bad purchase if both units work, and you do not have braces, but I would not recommend anyone with braces buying this product.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and I like the product.</li>
            <li> I really liked the brush, until my black one died, pushing the button did nothing but charging was working, not only that but my buddy who purchased the same model started having the same issue on the black one, our red brush is working fine, just the black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems like the brush component are poorly designed inside, or maybe not water resistant enough?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, to top it off the company is asking us to return the defective product at our cost for repair, this has to be a joke ! they should be replacing it free of charge, utterly disappointed !!</li>
            <li> Not as good as my other toothbrush.  It has more power than the battery toothbrushes, but no where near my other brand.  The brush heads seem they will last longer.  No manual included.  Not sure if my purchase was refurbished.  Looks good, just not worth the price since do not feel it is a comparable electric toothbrush and my teeth do not feel as clean as they should after using this buy.</li>
            <li> Great design. Worked well for a couple of weeks then one of the brushes stopped cycling through all 4 sessions on high. A week later it stopped working at all. Now the other toothbrush is stopping during the cycles. I am in the process of returning the product now. When the brushes were working, I really liked them.</li>
            <li> Great, love the three speeds, timer functions and especially the ultraviolet chamber for disinfecting.  However,  the brush heads could be of better quality especially since they don&#x27;t fit snug and the rubber stopper continues to detach and fall.</li>
            <li> Work great! Love the UV desinfecting option and they remain charged without the port perfectly for a weekend trip</li>
            <li> Smart looking - few feature that we like is variable speed and if you press too hard the brush stops, which is good.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to my parents. They love them.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for, my kids love them</li>
            <li> I bought this 6 months ago and already one of the toothbrushes went out and they tell me they won&#x27;t replace it. The sanitizer went out the second day. If I had bought it at a dept. store they would gladly replace a defective item. I used the brush about 5 times and now it&#x27;s no good. I couldn&#x27;t use it before because of work done on my teeth. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this, buy from a dept store.</li>
            <li> Been using this for 5 months, and went for check up.  Hygienists says that my gums are much better, and she did very little scraping during the exam.  Tickled a little at first, but after 3-4 uses, that went away.  The sonic action is apparently very effective.  UPDATE-both of these worked well and were effective for about 6 months.  They both died, and I send them to bumbfu&amp;&amp;, NY for replacement and never heard squat.  Go ahead and purchase a Sonicare brand. The sonic concept is good, just not this brand.</li>
            <li> UV light does not work and that was why I bought it. Will return.</li>
            <li> very disappointed with the quality. The first setting does&#x27;t work and the brush is looking very worn after only 2 weeks of regular use. Doesn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s charge long and the many fire warnings about leaving it plugged in make me nervous to charge it while out of the house.</li>
            <li> I ordered this in September 2014. Today while I was brushing my teeth it got stuck. The light is in the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; position but it&#x27;s not working and pushing the button does nothing. I can&#x27;t see where I can buy a replacement brush, so it looks like we have to replace the whole thing. I would think for the amount we paid we would get a year of use out of it.</li>
            <li> There is no charging cord or manual included</li>
            <li> I loved this product until one of the toothbrushes stopped working after one month&#x27;s use.  I have given feedback to seller and am waiting for response.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for about three months now.  I waited to write a review until after my dental checkup and tooth cleaning.  I wanted to see if it made any difference.  I had been using an Oral B spinning type electric toothbrush.  It worked fine, but it has rinsing ports in the brush head which would grow slimy mold.  It was grossing me out, so I decided to get a new brush.  After looking at the options I decided an ultrasonic brush would be a good choice.  I was a little reluctant to buy the Pursonic because it wasn&#x27;t a known brand.  The price, the 12 extra brush heads, the fact that it has dual handles and a built in UV brush sanitizer sold me on trying it.  Amazon&#x27;s great return policy left me feeling confident that it was worth a try.  The unit was received very quickly and came exactly as advertised.  It seems to be well made, using good quality materials.  There have been no problems with either handle and it has performed quite well.  The 3 different settings are distinct and seem to be useful.  I use the high setting for brushing and the massage setting afterwards to stimulate my gums.  I use the full two minutes for brushing and it actually feels good.  After about one week I noticed that my teeth appeared cleaner and brighter.  The real test was when I had my checkup.  The dental hygienist reported that my teeth had no tartar or staining.  Being a coffee drinker they usually would have some staining.  She said there was very little scaling and my gums were better than the last checkup.  I told her about the brush and it&#x27;s price and she was quite impressed.  Usually I have had some staining and tartar that she would have to remove.  I like the UV brush sanitizer.  It&#x27;s super easy to use.  Just put a brush in (it holds two), put on the cover and it turns on glowing blue.  After 10 minutes it turns off.  I have no way of testing its&#x27; effectiveness, but I looked online and found a study that indicated that UV sanitizers reduced most, but not all of thebacteria on the brush heads.  This is far better then just rinsing off the brush head.  With the brush heads inside the covered sanitizer it is also isolated from airborne contaminants.  Overall, this was a great find.  Pro&#x27;s: Well made Versatile settings Dual Handles UV brush sanitizer Great report from dentist Good price particularly with extra brush heads  Con&#x27;s: None  Follow up after another 9 months of use:  No problems with either handle,  Everything works as new.  My latest report from the dental hygienist was excellent.  Her and the dentist commented on how my teeth and gums were looking the cleanest and with the least amount of plaque and scale in many years.  Another plus is I have not found it necessary to change the brush heads each month.  Another update:  I&#x27;m still cavity free after nearly two years of the pursonic (that is unusual for me).  After about 1 year and 4 months one of the power heads failed.  Today at the 1 year 8 month mark the second head failed.  I Just ordered another dual head set.  My experience with name brand rechargeable tooth brushes is that they don&#x27;t last much longer and they and their brushes are much more expensive.  My teeth have done really well with this one.</li>
            <li> Arrived with one of the brushes non-functional. Company needs to do a better QA job which could be just a poor quality and short product longevity.</li>
            <li> This set is taking the place of my Phillips Sonic Care toothbrush that I&#x27;ve had for years. When I saw this set, I decided to try it. In comparison to the other, this one is actually better to my surprise. It seems to clean my teeth much better. Some review said the tooth brushes are too small, but my dentist says it&#x27;s good to use the smaller tooth brush so you can get into the side of your teeth better to get the plaque out. I think the size is perfect. I&#x27;m returning this one because the UV light doesn&#x27;t stay on. I am ordering another Pursonic to replace it. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought a Pursonic s400 a year ago and liked it.  I thought I was buying an upgraded model with the Pursonic s452.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used it for the first time, I thought it was broken and tried the second unit to confirm.  They were both the same.  The brush did not seem to move at all.  I contacted Pursonc and they told me that the s452 operates at a higher rpm and less torque than the s400.  I am trying to exchange them or get a refund otherwise they are going to goodwill.</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes. Great results. So glad we switched from ordinary, conventional brushes. Great value. More for less than comparable products.</li>
            <li> We have had for a couple weeks.  Bought it for my 3 kids. Generally works well, but had quality concerns after inspecting it upon receipt, and now UV light is already no longer working.  Like the duel handle concept (as my kids were not sharing one well) but I&#x27;d like to see better workmanship, especially of base unit.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re very happy with this purchase, love the 2 min. timer that pauses briefly every 30 sec &amp; think the UV light is great!</li>
            <li> Both quit within 6 months.</li>
