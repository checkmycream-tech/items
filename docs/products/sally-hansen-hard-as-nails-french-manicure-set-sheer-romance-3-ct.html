    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great nail polish!</li>
            <li>The rear sights didn&#x27;t have anything on it so target acquistion was not the best.  </li>
            <li>Bought this as a Christmas gift and it turned out great.</li>
            <li>Great price</li>
            <li>It gets used a lot and is a really good product.</li>
            <li>and she loved it.  </li>
            <li>the nail polish was amazing</li>
            <li>I love the included nail guides as well.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just OKAY</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok for the price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>My nails look fantastic</li>
            <li>After I used this my nails look just as good as being done professionally.  </li>
            <li>The stickers are especially easy to use for a person like me, who is not very good at painting my own nails.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend if you&#x27;re looking for something quick and cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very streaky, unless you put on 3-4 coats, in which case, would defeat the purpose of it being &amp;#34;sheer.&amp;#34; The color itself is very, very light and not flesh-toned at all.</li>
            <li>The shade is true to form, therefore, no unwanted surprise.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, just have the patience to try a few times, once you  figure  out the best way to do it, it is a cinch!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely happy and would highly recommend, not only the product, but the seller as well!</li>
            <li>I will just find my own french color.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t matter how many coats you put on still clear  #sm#h</li>
            <li>I LOVE this french manicure set.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m going to definitely order more</li>
            <li>The first time I used this, the color was washy, no matter how many layers of the white tip I applied.</li>
            <li>My friend and my niece are enjoying it big time.</li>
            <li>and I know that mine look just as good if not better than those who go get their nails done every week or so.</li>
            <li>I love the colors of this set, not too pink as some products are.  </li>
            <li>Really regret ordering this.</li>
            <li>highly recommended for gun owners!</li>
            <li>These are very pretty and make french manicures much easier.</li>
            <li>I had no problems with the stickers, French White Tip, or UV Top Coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not the right sheer color.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly as described, not only that</li>
            <li>everything is clear coat</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ll just be sitting in my nail polish box with all my old nail polish.</li>
            <li>But overall decent product.</li>

            <li> (a few tries to get to perfection, but it does&#x27;t take  much practice)</li>
            <li> Not really what I was expecting</li>
            <li> It makes for a very unnatural, ugly complement to the French White Tip.</li>
            <li> Wasted my $5 -_-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to watery, and the paint chipped after a few days.</li>
            <li> but I received it within a few days!</li>
            <li> The main reason why I hate them so much...never ever purchasing again...</li>
            <li> it is rather thin and watery</li>
            <li> Do not buy this, as it wasn&#x27;t just me misusing the nail polish or it being a faulty product; it&#x27;s just bad.</li>
            <li> I hate this stuff.</li>
            <li> I received these &amp; was very disappointed.</li>

            <li> The french color doesn&#x27;t paint well at all. It&#x27;s hideous. It comes out lumpy and the polish has several bubbles. I will just find my own french color.</li>
            <li> This is a Christmas gift, so won&#x27;t know it we&#x27;ll like it yet or not.</li>
            <li> These are very pretty and make french manicures much easier. I love the included nail guides as well.</li>
            <li> Nothing to write home about on this set...it&#x27;s just OKAY</li>
            <li> I love the colors of this set, not too pink as some products are.  The stickers are especially easy to use for a person like me, who is not very good at painting my own nails.  After I used this my nails look just as good as being done professionally.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this french manicure set. My nails look fantastic (a few tries to get to perfection, but it does&#x27;t take  much practice) and I know that mine look just as good if not better than those who go get their nails done every week or so. I highly recommend this, just have the patience to try a few times, once you  figure  out the best way to do it, it is a cinch!</li>
            <li> Not really what I was expecting but it&#x27;s ok for the price it is rather thin and watery which means it dries faster....</li>
            <li> These sucked. Not the right sheer color. I like the white though. Nd the nail guides it came with. Wasted my $5 -_-</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift and it turned out great. It gets used a lot and is a really good product. I may buy it for myself.</li>
            <li> I received these &amp; was very disappointed. They were smaller than I thought &amp; were drying out. I can put any use into these anymore. Really regret ordering this. They&#x27;ll just be sitting in my nail polish box with all my old nail polish.</li>
            <li> delivery was on time but this does not work everything is clear coat don&#x27;t matter how many coats you put on still clear  #sm#h</li>
            <li> Well, thhe packaging was damaged when it arrived. But overall decent product. I&#x27;m quite satisfied with this purchase. Would recommend if you&#x27;re looking for something quick and cheap.</li>
            <li> The finger nail polish doesn&#x27;t go on evenly there are spots everywhere. It&#x27;s to watery, and the paint chipped after a few days.</li>
            <li> I hate this stuff. As so all sally Hansen products they chip as soon as you apply them and always falls short of what they claim. The main reason why I hate them so much...never ever purchasing again...</li>
            <li> Great nail polish! used it for my XD-M 5.25&amp;#34; competition.  The rear sights didn&#x27;t have anything on it so target acquistion was not the best.  Painted this epoxy paint on and problem solved! highly recommended for gun owners!</li>
            <li> I got this set to do a french tip manicure... the nail polish was amazing and I&#x27;m going to definitely order more</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, the color was washy, no matter how many layers of the white tip I applied. Do not buy this, as it wasn&#x27;t just me misusing the nail polish or it being a faulty product; it&#x27;s just bad.</li>
            <li> I had no problems with the stickers, French White Tip, or UV Top Coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, you might as well throw out the Sheer French Color. It&#x27;s very streaky, unless you put on 3-4 coats, in which case, would defeat the purpose of it being &amp;#34;sheer.&amp;#34; The color itself is very, very light and not flesh-toned at all. It makes for a very unnatural, ugly complement to the French White Tip.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as described, not only that but I received it within a few days! The shade is true to form, therefore, no unwanted surprise. I&#x27;m extremely happy and would highly recommend, not only the product, but the seller as well!</li>
            <li> Great price and she loved it.  Got this same thing for my niece on her birthday.  My friend and my niece are enjoying it big time.</li>
