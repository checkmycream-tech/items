            <li>I must&#x27;ve gone through 20 of the compacts it came in, and I loved the way it went on and looked.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I purchased this compact to carry in my purse for touch ups, it seems to be identical to my loved and lost cream to powder product.  </li>
            <li>good for oily skin, stay matt, covers flaws on my faces, skin looks even.&lt;br</li>

            <li>This compact is amazing.</li>
            <li>Packaging and delivery was fast and awesome.</li>
            <li>This product is a powder that can be used to set your BB cream, foundation or can be used on its own if that&#x27;s your preference.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s an awesome deal worth a lot more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s really nice ^^&lt;br</li>
            <li>Loving it.</li>
            <li>Nice product....</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own, as does the Cream.</li>
            <li>The color matches my skintone well and has warm undertones.</li>
            <li>I am really impressed with this powder and would recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li>Can be used without foundation and gives a nice smooth finish to your face!</li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy with my purchase &amp; feel very confident in my appearance while wearing the product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel too \\&quot;made-up\\&quot; either, which is very important to me.</li>
            <li>love all the littles freebies.</li>
            <li>ok coverage and color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That being said, I do love the packaging.</li>
            <li>dry/combo skin would probably love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>and also if you have skin problems, like flaky skin, it&#x27;ll make it more flaky.</li>
            <li>I have started using the BB cream and have been pleased with the coverage and SPF benefits that provides.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really love it!&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>love the product - no colors even close to my complextion.</li>
            <li>love it though.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth as silk and becomes one with my skin!</li>
            <li>so I actually mix them to get the best tone for my skin!)</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is great and does last a fair amount of time.</li>
            <li>The mirror is a nice touch, and the size will fit into just about any bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love these products from their cream makeup to this compact.</li>
            <li>I use this along with the Skin79 BB cream, just where I get most oily, my nose and chin.  </li>
            <li>Amazing for quick touch ups.</li>
            <li>Most powders are too light and make you look ghost like.</li>
            <li>Works very well and is surprisingly good at controlling oil.</li>
            <li>The packaging is adorable and the consistency is nice and creamy, very pigmented.</li>
            <li>The compact is cute, has a good mirror and a clear plastic flip tray to separate the powder applicator from the cake.  </li>
            <li>I find the powder works fine on</li>
            <li>Also, the powder has a nice texture, good coverage, &amp; never seems to look cakey as long as you take a moment to blend it.</li>
            <li>and I just lightly set my face with this.</li>
            <li>My mom has medium-tan skintone and it&#x27;s a bit light for her.</li>
            <li>I have medium to light, combination skin.</li>
            <li>Someone with medium to light</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and even and takes the shine away from my foundation.  </li>
            <li>Great for touch ups later in the day too.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>All products are fabulous Skin79  </li>
            <li>Just a bit too light for my olive skin.</li>
            <li>It provides light coverage when I use a buffing brush.</li>
            <li>a guarantee that it&#x27;s a genuine BB product.  </li>
            <li>Early is always good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very silky &amp; with a sheer coverage but wonderful diffusing effect.</li>
            <li>I wish it would blend more evenly but other than that its great product.</li>
            <li>As I mentioned above, I&#x27;ve always used Fair to Light colors for foundation and concealers, but this, even with it&#x27;s orange tint, once applied correctly it gives a full, smooth coverage.</li>
            <li>Super light, not cakey like a lot of powders.</li>
            <li>I think it does great coverage, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin...</li>
            <li>It has good coverage, doesn&#x27;t cause me breakouts, and in these winter months does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t do a good job absorbing oil for more than about an hour, and the BB cream actually seems to rub off faster with it than without it</li>
            <li>I just wish it was lighter and did a better job absorbing oil and setting the BB cream.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a powder only, and am delighted by the surprise.  </li>
            <li>So, this powder has been a lifesaver for me to just quickly brush on and then go out to the store or run an errand.  </li>
            <li>but if you apply it the right way it should just give your skin a nice natural hint of color.</li>
            <li>Before ordering my very first one, I had read the reviews and noticed that some were complaining that the Beblesh pact is orange and makes them look orange.</li>
            <li>I just gently tap it on and lightly blend...</li>
            <li>I have only found one powder I ever liked and used until it was gone (called &#x27;EI Solutions&#x27;),</li>
            <li>I use the BB Super Beblesh Balm Triple Function first.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t get super oily, my skin is very normal, and this just really keeps it looking fresh and luminous.</li>
            <li>THE COLOR SEEMS A LITTLE ODD,BUT BLENDS WELL WITH MY FAIR SKIN AND GOES ON</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m better off setting my BB cream with regular mineral powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have reordered two at a time since my first purchase.</li>
            <li>One of my first BB cream product.</li>
            <li>compact itself is great; there&#x27;s a hinged plastic piece that protects the product, and is much nicer than the usual flimsy throwaway piece.  </li>
            <li>My skin looked very even &amp; it felt smooth &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>I did notice that my forehead became a bit MORE dry after wearing the powder for a few days in a row, so maybe it would be good for someone who had an oilier complexion, but it could just be my dyer, aging skin.</li>
            <li>For the office or more formal events I do need foundation, but not as much (spot only) because this powder takes care of the additional coverage.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been very pleased by all the Skin79 products I&#x27;ve purchased, and this one came with the little silver seal intact--</li>
            <li>Initially when I daubed on the Powder it really didn&#x27;t seem right but blended in GREAT as I continued to work it slightly.</li>
            <li>I am new to Skin79 products and rarely write reviews.</li>
            <li>but I prefer the consistency of the Hot Pink package more</li>
            <li>They seem to be smart products, in the sense that they blend into a variety of skin colors and types.</li>
            <li>Yes, I still find it heavier than my original favorite powder, but the fact that this has SPF and other benefits far outweighs this.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of yellow in my skin and this seems to be a great color for me year round.</li>
            <li>It was packed well and fast delivery than my expectation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>VERY SMOOTH.WILL BUY THIS</li>
            <li>BECAUSE SHE REALLY WANTED MINE.</li>
            <li>so most people who have pink tones to their skin probably can&#x27;t wear this.</li>
            <li>Although the compact was not broken, the powder inside was</li>
            <li>I really like the skin food</li>
            <li>Also I like the smell so much</li>
            <li>,it smells very natural,not like chemical things.</li>
            <li>I cannot use this as much as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>the high SPF and will be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li>and I use Skin79 Protect Beblesh pact to even things out after blotting and it works really well. .</li>
            <li>I believe I was an nc23 in mac, don&#x27;t really remember because since I discovered</li>
            <li>As with all beblesh products, and as was true with the compact I used to use, it&#x27;s necessary to give the stuff time to blend into your skin--it looks a bit ghostly at first, but soon mellows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is in fact a Powder, &amp; a much darker version - much more \\&quot;orangey\\&quot; - whereas the \\&quot;Hot Pink\\&quot; package BB Cream is pretty whitish pale on me until blended.</li>
            <li>This is one of the very rare times I don&#x27;t actually like a skin79 product.  </li>
            <li>The skin food powder is very light in texture which I really like, but it does not have any color so when you first apply it, you will look pale.  </li>
            <li>that this has SPF whereas many other powders don&#x27;t.    </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s any better than any other powder compact, but I got it for protection from the sun while using Retin-A.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely fair so the BB Cream matches well, but this powder is just too dark and yellow for me.</li>
            <li>(Prior to application, be sure your face is clean, properly moisturized to avoid flaking if you are prone &amp; your BB Creams are applied properly, if applicable.)</li>
            <li>but this product is too drying for older skin type.</li>
            <li>Much much more yellow toned than the grayish tint of the hot pink bb cream.  </li>
            <li>I thought the powder was ok but a little heavier than others that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look healthy, without clogging my pores and heavy feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li>This product is okay, but goes on pretty thick.  </li>
            <li>The Powder apparently has a higher SPF than the Cream</li>
            <li>THIS IS A NEW PURCHASE FOR ME.</li>
            <li>I use this to set the Skin79 Hot Pink &amp; Hot Orange BB Creams and also for touch ups.</li>
            <li>but it looks completely natural!</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced, they outperform American high end products by far!</li>
            <li>Oddly, this powder is MUCH darker and more yellow toned than the corresponding Hot Pink BB cream.</li>
            <li>It actually enhances the look of large pores.  </li>
            <li>It can become a bit tricky when layering, especially if it settles into fine lines of age so experiment with application or use them separately because the Cream did influence the color &amp; texture of the powder a BIT, (not much,) for me.</li>
            <li>As an added bonus, it&#x27;s about half the price of my original c to p .</li>
            <li>I like the clear plastic tray separating the sponge and the powder.</li>
            <li>I am presently using the cream as a foundation and this compliments it very well.  </li>
            <li>It helps set your make up and makes your skin look natural than looking like you are wearing make up.  </li>
            <li>I like the natural look, so</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t see much diff with regular drug store cosmetics, eg L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li>Soft matte finish.</li>
            <li>I like it so far</li>
            <li>I like its covering and soft sensation on my face</li>
            <li>I am a fan of makeup that looks really natural.</li>
            <li>For me it was good but not perfect, so I will keep looking for a powder with SPF.    </li>
            <li>after having this compact for a few months, I&#x27;ve decided to upgrade to 5 stars from the original 3.</li>
            <li>All of the Skin79 brand products have been very helpful in protecting against that, but I do not wear makeup every day - usually only wearing coconut oil &amp; sunscreen if I am not going out in public.</li>
            <li>I am surprised that this powder is so awesome because the same brand&#x27;s matching BB cream (pink label) is a disgusting pasty grey that I do NOT like (and the grey cast doesn&#x27;t ever disappear IMHO), although the consistency and other aspects are good.  </li>
            <li>its a yellow based powder that has moisture absorbing properties, matches well with asian and south indian skins that are on brighter side with yellow undertones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a late 40-something white female with problem, combination skin and have purchased a TON of powder over the years (including Bare Minerals), most being used once and sitting in the cosmetic graveyard (aka: under the sink).  </li>
            <li>It does the job and it not heavy, with extra sun protection.</li>
            <li>I get a full days wear out of it, without it feeling too thick, cakey or completely disappearing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am in my early 40&#x27;s with skin that has become VERY dry as I am aging, quite pale with yellow undertones, will easily flush &amp; burn with brown spots appearing any time I go in the sun.</li>
            <li>While I adore the other products by skin79,  for this one I&#x27;m not so much of a fan.</li>
            <li>and it makes my skin look old and dry</li>
            <li>It blends fairly easily, but still looks a bit dark, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m getting away with it.  </li>
            <li>I put this product on top of my Super Pink Plus BB Cream its not to bad</li>
            <li>I looked around so long for BB creams and thanks to the other buyers left their comments I decided to buy this one.</li>

            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> It makes me feel safe to use it!</li>
            <li> This compact is amazing.</li>
            <li> Packaging and delivery was fast and awesome.</li>
            <li> This product is a powder that can be used to set your BB cream, foundation or can be used on its own if that&#x27;s your preference.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s an awesome deal worth a lot more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it&#x27;s really nice ^^&lt;br</li>
            <li> Loving it.</li>
            <li> Nice product....</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own, as does the Cream.</li>
            <li> The color matches my skintone well and has warm undertones.</li>
            <li> I am really impressed with this powder and would recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li> Can be used without foundation and gives a nice smooth finish to your face!</li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy with my purchase &amp; feel very confident in my appearance while wearing the product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel too \\&quot;made-up\\&quot; either, which is very important to me.</li>
            <li> love all the littles freebies.</li>
            <li> ok coverage and color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That being said, I do love the packaging.</li>
            <li> dry/combo skin would probably love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> and also if you have skin problems, like flaky skin, it&#x27;ll make it more flaky.</li>
            <li> I have started using the BB cream and have been pleased with the coverage and SPF benefits that provides.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really love it!&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> love the product - no colors even close to my complextion.</li>
            <li> love it though.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth as silk and becomes one with my skin!</li>
            <li> so I actually mix them to get the best tone for my skin!)</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is great and does last a fair amount of time.</li>
            <li> The mirror is a nice touch, and the size will fit into just about any bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love these products from their cream makeup to this compact.</li>
            <li> I use this along with the Skin79 BB cream, just where I get most oily, my nose and chin.  </li>
            <li> Amazing for quick touch ups.</li>
            <li> Most powders are too light and make you look ghost like.</li>
            <li> Works very well and is surprisingly good at controlling oil.</li>
            <li> The packaging is adorable and the consistency is nice and creamy, very pigmented.</li>
            <li> The compact is cute, has a good mirror and a clear plastic flip tray to separate the powder applicator from the cake.  </li>
            <li> I find the powder works fine on</li>
            <li> Also, the powder has a nice texture, good coverage, &amp; never seems to look cakey as long as you take a moment to blend it.</li>
            <li> and I just lightly set my face with this.</li>
            <li> My mom has medium-tan skintone and it&#x27;s a bit light for her.</li>
            <li> I have medium to light, combination skin.</li>
            <li> Someone with medium to light</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and even and takes the shine away from my foundation.  </li>
            <li> Great for touch ups later in the day too.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> All products are fabulous Skin79  </li>
            <li> Just a bit too light for my olive skin.</li>
            <li> It provides light coverage when I use a buffing brush.</li>
            <li> a guarantee that it&#x27;s a genuine BB product.  </li>
            <li> Early is always good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very silky &amp; with a sheer coverage but wonderful diffusing effect.</li>
            <li> I wish it would blend more evenly but other than that its great product.</li>
            <li> As I mentioned above, I&#x27;ve always used Fair to Light colors for foundation and concealers, but this, even with it&#x27;s orange tint, once applied correctly it gives a full, smooth coverage.</li>
            <li> Super light, not cakey like a lot of powders.</li>
            <li> I think it does great coverage, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin...</li>
            <li> It has good coverage, doesn&#x27;t cause me breakouts, and in these winter months does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t do a good job absorbing oil for more than about an hour, and the BB cream actually seems to rub off faster with it than without it</li>
            <li> I just wish it was lighter and did a better job absorbing oil and setting the BB cream.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a powder only, and am delighted by the surprise.  </li>
            <li> So, this powder has been a lifesaver for me to just quickly brush on and then go out to the store or run an errand.  </li>
            <li> but if you apply it the right way it should just give your skin a nice natural hint of color.</li>
            <li> Before ordering my very first one, I had read the reviews and noticed that some were complaining that the Beblesh pact is orange and makes them look orange.</li>
            <li> I just gently tap it on and lightly blend...</li>
            <li> I have only found one powder I ever liked and used until it was gone (called &#x27;EI Solutions&#x27;),</li>
            <li> I use the BB Super Beblesh Balm Triple Function first.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get super oily, my skin is very normal, and this just really keeps it looking fresh and luminous.</li>
            <li> THE COLOR SEEMS A LITTLE ODD,BUT BLENDS WELL WITH MY FAIR SKIN AND GOES ON</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m better off setting my BB cream with regular mineral powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have reordered two at a time since my first purchase.</li>
            <li> One of my first BB cream product.</li>
            <li> compact itself is great; there&#x27;s a hinged plastic piece that protects the product, and is much nicer than the usual flimsy throwaway piece.  </li>
            <li> My skin looked very even &amp; it felt smooth &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> I did notice that my forehead became a bit MORE dry after wearing the powder for a few days in a row, so maybe it would be good for someone who had an oilier complexion, but it could just be my dyer, aging skin.</li>
            <li> For the office or more formal events I do need foundation, but not as much (spot only) because this powder takes care of the additional coverage.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been very pleased by all the Skin79 products I&#x27;ve purchased, and this one came with the little silver seal intact--</li>
            <li> Initially when I daubed on the Powder it really didn&#x27;t seem right but blended in GREAT as I continued to work it slightly.</li>
            <li> I am new to Skin79 products and rarely write reviews.</li>
            <li> but I prefer the consistency of the Hot Pink package more</li>
            <li> They seem to be smart products, in the sense that they blend into a variety of skin colors and types.</li>
            <li> Yes, I still find it heavier than my original favorite powder, but the fact that this has SPF and other benefits far outweighs this.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of yellow in my skin and this seems to be a great color for me year round.</li>
            <li> It was packed well and fast delivery than my expectation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> VERY SMOOTH.WILL BUY THIS</li>
            <li> BECAUSE SHE REALLY WANTED MINE.</li>
            <li> so most people who have pink tones to their skin probably can&#x27;t wear this.</li>
            <li> Although the compact was not broken, the powder inside was</li>
            <li> I really like the skin food</li>
            <li> Also I like the smell so much</li>
            <li> ,it smells very natural,not like chemical things.</li>
            <li> I cannot use this as much as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> the high SPF and will be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> and I use Skin79 Protect Beblesh pact to even things out after blotting and it works really well. .</li>
            <li> I believe I was an nc23 in mac, don&#x27;t really remember because since I discovered</li>
            <li> As with all beblesh products, and as was true with the compact I used to use, it&#x27;s necessary to give the stuff time to blend into your skin--it looks a bit ghostly at first, but soon mellows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is in fact a Powder, &amp; a much darker version - much more \\&quot;orangey\\&quot; - whereas the \\&quot;Hot Pink\\&quot; package BB Cream is pretty whitish pale on me until blended.</li>
            <li> This is one of the very rare times I don&#x27;t actually like a skin79 product.  </li>
            <li> The skin food powder is very light in texture which I really like, but it does not have any color so when you first apply it, you will look pale.  </li>
            <li> that this has SPF whereas many other powders don&#x27;t.    </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s any better than any other powder compact, but I got it for protection from the sun while using Retin-A.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely fair so the BB Cream matches well, but this powder is just too dark and yellow for me.</li>
            <li> (Prior to application, be sure your face is clean, properly moisturized to avoid flaking if you are prone &amp; your BB Creams are applied properly, if applicable.)</li>
            <li> but this product is too drying for older skin type.</li>
            <li> Much much more yellow toned than the grayish tint of the hot pink bb cream.  </li>
            <li> I thought the powder was ok but a little heavier than others that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look healthy, without clogging my pores and heavy feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is okay, but goes on pretty thick.  </li>
            <li> The Powder apparently has a higher SPF than the Cream</li>
            <li> THIS IS A NEW PURCHASE FOR ME.</li>
            <li> I use this to set the Skin79 Hot Pink &amp; Hot Orange BB Creams and also for touch ups.</li>
            <li> but it looks completely natural!</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced, they outperform American high end products by far!</li>
            <li> Oddly, this powder is MUCH darker and more yellow toned than the corresponding Hot Pink BB cream.</li>
            <li> It actually enhances the look of large pores.  </li>
            <li> It can become a bit tricky when layering, especially if it settles into fine lines of age so experiment with application or use them separately because the Cream did influence the color &amp; texture of the powder a BIT, (not much,) for me.</li>
            <li> As an added bonus, it&#x27;s about half the price of my original c to p .</li>
            <li> I like the clear plastic tray separating the sponge and the powder.</li>
            <li> I am presently using the cream as a foundation and this compliments it very well.  </li>
            <li> It helps set your make up and makes your skin look natural than looking like you are wearing make up.  </li>
            <li> I like the natural look, so</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t see much diff with regular drug store cosmetics, eg L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> Soft matte finish.</li>
            <li> I like it so far</li>
            <li> I like its covering and soft sensation on my face</li>
            <li> I am a fan of makeup that looks really natural.</li>
            <li> For me it was good but not perfect, so I will keep looking for a powder with SPF.    </li>
            <li> after having this compact for a few months, I&#x27;ve decided to upgrade to 5 stars from the original 3.</li>
            <li> All of the Skin79 brand products have been very helpful in protecting against that, but I do not wear makeup every day - usually only wearing coconut oil &amp; sunscreen if I am not going out in public.</li>
            <li> I am surprised that this powder is so awesome because the same brand&#x27;s matching BB cream (pink label) is a disgusting pasty grey that I do NOT like (and the grey cast doesn&#x27;t ever disappear IMHO), although the consistency and other aspects are good.  </li>
            <li> its a yellow based powder that has moisture absorbing properties, matches well with asian and south indian skins that are on brighter side with yellow undertones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a late 40-something white female with problem, combination skin and have purchased a TON of powder over the years (including Bare Minerals), most being used once and sitting in the cosmetic graveyard (aka: under the sink).  </li>
            <li> It does the job and it not heavy, with extra sun protection.</li>
            <li> I get a full days wear out of it, without it feeling too thick, cakey or completely disappearing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am in my early 40&#x27;s with skin that has become VERY dry as I am aging, quite pale with yellow undertones, will easily flush &amp; burn with brown spots appearing any time I go in the sun.</li>
            <li> While I adore the other products by skin79,  for this one I&#x27;m not so much of a fan.</li>
            <li> and it makes my skin look old and dry</li>
            <li> It blends fairly easily, but still looks a bit dark, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m getting away with it.  </li>
            <li> I put this product on top of my Super Pink Plus BB Cream its not to bad</li>
            <li> I looked around so long for BB creams and thanks to the other buyers left their comments I decided to buy this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it everyday for about two months now and have not hit the pan yet, so for me it has really gone a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I accidentally dropped it a few times and the piece separating the puff from the powder completely broke on me.</li>
            <li> This leaves my skin almost matte, not completely.</li>
            <li> Yes the one shade goes on a bit dark, but it blends out beautifully on my pale skin, (over the hot pink BB cream).</li>
            <li> I prefer to use a little LESS BB Cream when I will be using the powder, such as just using Cream on \\&quot;problem areas\\&quot; or using less than normal &amp; blending</li>
            <li> but this stuff is a little too yellow for my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not recommend using it in winter, it shows dry spots on your face like other powder.</li>
            <li> This product is not so bad, but after reading the news article about how BB product will cause more acne..</li>
            <li> It loses a star only because it comes in one shade and it&#x27;s a really yellow</li>
            <li> (In the morning I use the pink or gold bb cream)</li>
            <li> They have replaced all of my other products and have become</li>
            <li> I did have more pimple than before:(</li>
            <li> If you give it a few minutes, your skin tone does come out and it controls oil for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Plus it doesn&#x27;t control sebum as well as other powders I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Wish it came in other shades...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use this powder as a setting powder and my face becomes extremely oily throughout the day.</li>
            <li> its a little bit on the yellow orange ish color, so i dont recommend it to really pale people.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way WAY too dark for me.</li>
            <li> I like that it is darker , but not too dark.</li>
            <li> i did&#x27;t like it it to dark kinda of orangy</li>
            <li> Alas, the company changed the packaging and formula, and the new one was too heavy and made me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does come out a little dark</li>
            <li> The puff has a little strap to hold onto and a hinged plastic divider keeps the puff from sitting in the powder and contaminating it.</li>
            <li> As mentioned, the skin79 feels heavier and on me the color is a little off, on the orange/yellow side.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a little separator between the puff and the powder.</li>
            <li> (4.99 for shipping sort of bites, but as promised by seller it was here in just a few days.)</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> I will be using it during the summer months when I usually allow myself a slight tan.</li>
            <li> i was surprise that impact of this powder, feel like an air, at this price, i was really been shocked.</li>
            <li> Its my go to for lazy makeup days when I just want a one step application.</li>
            <li> And you can hardly tell that your even wearing powder foundation, it doesn&#x27;t leave excess powder on your face or nor does it leave you looking cakey.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It covers and blends nicely - not cakey -</li>
            <li> it was a thick creme compact version of the BB Cream I already have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not big on makeup - my issue is having residue on my skin, I just hate the feeling on my face.</li>
            <li> Not happy</li>
            <li> bb&#x27;s I never went back to that cakey crap.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in the color of the product.</li>
            <li> Not too expensive, but once you try - you&#x27;ll be hooked</li>
            <li> kinda afraid to use it again.</li>
            <li> I use it all the way to the base of my neck so it&#x27;ll blend evenly.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It was packed well and fast delivery than my expectation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Missha before.I tried this brand review is good.&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;but Missha do a stong cover.</li>
            <li> Very good for sun burn protection</li>
            <li> THIS IS A NEW PURCHASE FOR ME. THE COLOR SEEMS A LITTLE ODD,BUT BLENDS WELL WITH MY FAIR SKIN AND GOES ON VERY SMOOTH.WILL BUY THIS FOR MY TEENAGE GRANDDAUGHTER BECAUSE SHE REALLY WANTED MINE.</li>
            <li> Packaging and delivery was fast and awesome. This product however was just not for me. I use bb cream and I just lightly set my face with this. It&#x27;s way WAY too dark for me. It&#x27;s noticeable. If there was a lighter color, maybe I&#x27;d be content, my fault though! I won&#x27;t be purchasing again. It&#x27;s also made of plastic. I accidentally dropped it a few times and the piece separating the puff from the powder completely broke on me. 😭. Anyways, but if you have darker skin tone maybe missha #23? Then I think this could work for you.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the product and will definetely buy again from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;Also love all the littles freebies.</li>
            <li> ok coverage and color. but this product is too drying for older skin type. I think would be great for oily skin.</li>
            <li> Love it! Makes my skin look flawless!</li>
            <li> This product is a powder that can be used to set your BB cream, foundation or can be used on its own if that&#x27;s your preference. The color suits light-medium or medium skintones. My mom has medium-tan skintone and it&#x27;s a bit light for her. Works very well and is surprisingly good at controlling oil.</li>
            <li> I am new to Skin79 products and rarely write reviews. Korean skin care is the BEST (and I am not Korean)! Skin79&#x27;s BB cream together with the Sun protect beblesh pact make a perfect pairing for even, translucent coverage and maximum sun protection. They have replaced all of my other products and have become the must have, go to basic items! They seem to be smart products, in the sense that they blend into a variety of skin colors and types. I have medium to light, combination skin. Reasonably priced, they outperform American high end products by far! Try it! I am recommending it to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> This product is not so bad, but after reading the news article about how BB product will cause more acne..kinda afraid to use it again. Plus, I purchased the BB cream (the orange bottle) before... I did have more pimple than before:(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad this matches my skin color because I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it now! I get compliments saying my skin looks like porcelain when I wear this makeup. Super light, not cakey like a lot of powders. It loses a star only because it comes in one shade and it&#x27;s a really yellow so most people who have pink tones to their skin probably can&#x27;t wear this.</li>
            <li> i was surprise that impact of this powder, feel like an air, at this price, i was really been shocked.</li>
            <li> I love this compact! I use the Skin79 BB cream and use this over it. In the summer sometimes all I need is this during the day. Great coverage. I will never use drugstore compacts again!</li>
            <li> I use this to set the Skin79 Hot Pink &amp; Hot Orange BB Creams and also for touch ups. Oddly, this powder is MUCH darker and more yellow toned than the corresponding Hot Pink BB cream. It blends fairly easily, but still looks a bit dark, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m getting away with it.  I&#x27;m extremely fair so the BB Cream matches well, but this powder is just too dark and yellow for me. Also, it doesn&#x27;t do a good job absorbing oil for more than about an hour, and the BB cream actually seems to rub off faster with it than without it so I don&#x27;t think it actually helps set anything. I&#x27;m better off setting my BB cream with regular mineral powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I do love the packaging. The puff has a little strap to hold onto and a hinged plastic divider keeps the puff from sitting in the powder and contaminating it. Also, the powder has a nice texture, good coverage, &amp; never seems to look cakey as long as you take a moment to blend it. I just wish it was lighter and did a better job absorbing oil and setting the BB cream. This just doesn&#x27;t get the job done for me. Someone with medium to light dry/combo skin would probably love this product.</li>
            <li> Opaque coverage but it looks completely natural! And my skin feels great, it&#x27;s an awesome deal worth a lot more.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this product. I&#x27;m not big on makeup - my issue is having residue on my skin, I just hate the feeling on my face. This, however, was a total surprise. It makes my skin look healthy, without clogging my pores and heavy feeling on my skin. If in doubt - buy it. Not too expensive, but once you try - you&#x27;ll be hooked</li>
            <li> I love it!  It goes on smooth and even and takes the shine away from my foundation.  Great for touch ups later in the day too.</li>
            <li> I opened it up and the compact was not glued inside properly.  It fell onto the tile floor in the bathroom and into a million powdery pieces.  Not happy</li>
            <li> I am presently using the cream as a foundation and this compliments it very well.  It goes on smooth and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> excelente producto siempre me a encantado esta marca ademas el paquete arribo rápido y sin problemas.</li>
            <li> its a yellow based powder that has moisture absorbing properties, matches well with asian and south indian skins that are on brighter side with yellow undertones.</li>
            <li> I like that it is darker , but not too dark. Most powders are too light and make you look ghost like. This is perfect for my summer tan look.</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;I bought this powder before ^^.. and I order it for mom and friends ^^&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s really nice ^^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> Great compact accompanied with the BB cream!  It helps set your make up and makes your skin look natural than looking like you are wearing make up.  I like the natural look, so this works perfect for me!  Definitely will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Good for the money. But I don&#x27;t see much diff with regular drug store cosmetics, eg L&#x27;Oreal. I like the clear plastic tray separating the sponge and the powder.</li>
            <li> Love it but it is lighter than my skin so yeah</li>
            <li> Wonderful wonderful wonderful!!! Perfect color match. Best I&#x27;ve ever found. Works over any foundation. Soft matte finish. Can be used without foundation and gives a nice smooth finish to your face! Have reordered two at a time since my first purchase. Great price compared to what else is out there. Don&#x27;t hesitate here, seriously worth it!!!!</li>
            <li> Although the compact was not broken, the powder inside was but I tried to salvage it anyway however in retrospect I wish I returned the item.  I thought the powder was ok but a little heavier than others that I&#x27;ve tried. I really like the skin food peach sake silky powder so I&#x27;m always comparing this powder to that one.  The skin food powder is very light in texture which I really like, but it does not have any color so when you first apply it, you will look pale.  If you give it a few minutes, your skin tone does come out and it controls oil for a long time.  However, the skinfood doesn&#x27;t have SPF and that is why I tried the skin79. As mentioned, the skin79 feels heavier and on me the color is a little off, on the orange/yellow side. Plus it doesn&#x27;t control sebum as well as other powders I&#x27;ve tried. That said, I do like that this has SPF whereas many other powders don&#x27;t.    Compared to mainstream brands, this is a very good powder and I would urge anyone to try it as it may work perfectly for their skin.  For me it was good but not perfect, so I will keep looking for a powder with SPF.    Update Jan 2015:  after having this compact for a few months, I&#x27;ve decided to upgrade to 5 stars from the original 3. Yes, I still find it heavier than my original favorite powder, but the fact that this has SPF and other benefits far outweighs this. This powder streamlined my morning routine. It has good coverage, doesn&#x27;t cause me breakouts, and in these winter months does not dry out my skin. So, this powder has been a lifesaver for me to just quickly brush on and then go out to the store or run an errand.  For the office or more formal events I do need foundation, but not as much (spot only) because this powder takes care of the additional coverage.    And again, the fact that it has SPF is a win in itself. If you use the US brand name powders, I recommend you give this a try--you may not ever go back!</li>
            <li> This is one of the very rare times I don&#x27;t actually like a skin79 product.  I dunno, I don&#x27;t like the way the powder finishes off. It actually enhances the look of large pores.  No mas.</li>
            <li> When the packaged product came the box was damaged and also the product did not work well.</li>
            <li> its a little bit on the yellow orange ish color, so i dont recommend it to really pale people. and also if you have skin problems, like flaky skin, it&#x27;ll make it more flaky.</li>
            <li> All products are fabulous Skin79  i used BB CREAM  this powder reinforces the concept that I have this fabulous brand is excellent quality</li>
            <li> I have started using the BB cream and have been pleased with the coverage and SPF benefits that provides. I decided to get the compact for touch ups on the go. The product goes on great and melts into my tone. So I get the benefits of a powder and a sunscreen. It&#x27;s a good size product. I like that there&#x27;s a little separator between the puff and the powder. It took a while to get here, coming from overseas, but it arrived well before the estimated delivery date. Early is always good.</li>
            <li> I carried this compact with me every day for touch up.  I like it so far and I also like the fact it has spf protection also.  Will recommend it.</li>
            <li> ilove it！&lt;br /&gt;Fast deliver!&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product!&lt;br /&gt;Really love it!&lt;br /&gt;Thank u soo much!&lt;br /&gt;It works very good on my face! Also I like the smell so much ,it smells very natural,not like chemical things. It makes me feel safe to use it!</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in the color of the product. Much much more yellow toned than the grayish tint of the hot pink bb cream.  I cannot use this as much as I&#x27;d like. My olive skinned daughter uses it all the time though.  I will be using it during the summer months when I usually allow myself a slight tan. The packaging is adorable and the consistency is nice and creamy, very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I like its covering and soft sensation on my face it is realy good I recommend this stuff for every one</li>
            <li> Posting for the wife.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> excellent! recommended</li>
            <li> This BB compact is great, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase. It does come out a little dark but it doesn&#x27;t show at all once the powder starts to settle. I think it does great coverage, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin... And you can hardly tell that your even wearing powder foundation, it doesn&#x27;t leave excess powder on your face or nor does it leave you looking cakey.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend if you use BB cream foundation.</li>
            <li> love the product - no colors even close to my complextion. I mix it with my makeup and apply it...so it will last me quite a while. love it though.</li>
            <li> This product is okay, but goes on pretty thick.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s any better than any other powder compact, but I got it for protection from the sun while using Retin-A.  I doubt I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> I looked around so long for BB creams and thanks to the other buyers left their comments I decided to buy this one. One of my first BB cream product. Loving it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with the performance of this powder. Yes the one shade goes on a bit dark, but it blends out beautifully on my pale skin, (over the hot pink BB cream). I get a full days wear out of it, without it feeling too thick, cakey or completely disappearing.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t get super oily, my skin is very normal, and this just really keeps it looking fresh and luminous. Thankfully it&#x27;s not too matte, but cuts the shine from the BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it everyday for about two months now and have not hit the pan yet, so for me it has really gone a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Love the high SPF and will be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> I love it. Good product.</li>
            <li> Nice product.... Wish it came in other shades... Just a bit too light for my olive skin.</li>
            <li> Amazing for quick touch ups. I just keep this in my purse (In the morning I use the pink or gold bb cream) It does the job and it does it well. Freshens up the face with just a tiny bit.</li>
            <li> i did&#x27;t like it it to dark kinda of orangy and it makes my skin look old and dry</li>
            <li> Maybe I haven&#x27;t figured out to use this correctly, but it seems too &amp;#34;thick,&amp;#34; too opaque. I am a fan of makeup that looks really natural. While I adore the other products by skin79,  for this one I&#x27;m not so much of a fan.</li>
            <li> I had to give this all five stars. This compact is amazing. I always order them in 2&#x27;s so I don&#x27;t run out!&lt;br /&gt;I have fair skin, never used compact because it used to make me look orange or if I used anything lighter, I would look like a ghost. I use the BB Super Beblesh Balm Triple Function first.  After I let that set in (5-6 min) , I use the Sun Protect Beblesh pact... I just gently tap it on and lightly blend... It covers everything. It&#x27;s smooth as silk and becomes one with my skin! AND it stays on all day. I don&#x27;t have to reapply ever. Before ordering my very first one, I had read the reviews and noticed that some were complaining that the Beblesh pact is orange and makes them look orange. Yes, it has an orange tint but if you apply it the right way it should just give your skin a nice natural hint of color. As I mentioned above, I&#x27;ve always used Fair to Light colors for foundation and concealers, but this, even with it&#x27;s orange tint, once applied correctly it gives a full, smooth coverage. I use it all the way to the base of my neck so it&#x27;ll blend evenly.</li>
            <li> I like the SPF but this stuff is a little too yellow for my skin. My skin undertone is probably reddish or something else because its just too yellow for me.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this thinking it was a thick creme compact version of the BB Cream I already have. It is in fact a Powder, &amp; a much darker version - much more \\&quot;orangey\\&quot; - whereas the \\&quot;Hot Pink\\&quot; package BB Cream is pretty whitish pale on me until blended. (The Gold package Cream is closer to my skin tone but I prefer the consistency of the Hot Pink package more so I actually mix them to get the best tone for my skin!) Initially when I daubed on the Powder it really didn&#x27;t seem right but blended in GREAT as I continued to work it slightly. It&#x27;s very silky &amp; with a sheer coverage but wonderful diffusing effect. My skin looked very even &amp; it felt smooth &amp; soft. I didn&#x27;t feel too \\&quot;made-up\\&quot; either, which is very important to me. (Prior to application, be sure your face is clean, properly moisturized to avoid flaking if you are prone &amp; your BB Creams are applied properly, if applicable.) I prefer to use a little LESS BB Cream when I will be using the powder, such as just using Cream on \\&quot;problem areas\\&quot; or using less than normal &amp; blending well so I don&#x27;t get a buildup of product. I find the powder works fine on it&#x27;s own, as does the Cream. It can become a bit tricky when layering, especially if it settles into fine lines of age so experiment with application or use them separately because the Cream did influence the color &amp; texture of the powder a BIT, (not much,) for me. The Powder apparently has a higher SPF than the Cream so I am looking forward to it giving my photosensitive skin extra sun protection. I am in my early 40&#x27;s with skin that has become VERY dry as I am aging, quite pale with yellow undertones, will easily flush &amp; burn with brown spots appearing any time I go in the sun. All of the Skin79 brand products have been very helpful in protecting against that, but I do not wear makeup every day - usually only wearing coconut oil &amp; sunscreen if I am not going out in public. I did notice that my forehead became a bit MORE dry after wearing the powder for a few days in a row, so maybe it would be good for someone who had an oilier complexion, but it could just be my dyer, aging skin. (I wish I had this product in my teens &amp; twenties!) Overall I am very happy with my purchase &amp; feel very confident in my appearance while wearing the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a late 40-something white female with problem, combination skin and have purchased a TON of powder over the years (including Bare Minerals), most being used once and sitting in the cosmetic graveyard (aka: under the sink).  I have only found one powder I ever liked and used until it was gone (called &#x27;EI Solutions&#x27;), something I got at Sephora years back but can&#x27;t find anymore - so you can say I am picky about powder.  This powder has a similar consistency to my HG EI powder.  Smooth, creamy looking, great coverage and the PERFECT COLOR!  I am really impressed with this powder and would recommend it highly.  The compact is cute, has a good mirror and a clear plastic flip tray to separate the powder applicator from the cake.  I am surprised that this powder is so awesome because the same brand&#x27;s matching BB cream (pink label) is a disgusting pasty grey that I do NOT like (and the grey cast doesn&#x27;t ever disappear IMHO), although the consistency and other aspects are good.  I guess you need to buy both if you are using their BB cream.  Anyway, I might buy a second one of these for my purse soon! (4.99 for shipping sort of bites, but as promised by seller it was here in just a few days.)</li>
            <li> I use this everyday. It provides light coverage when I use a buffing brush. The color matches my skintone well and has warm undertones. It doesn&#x27;t break me out and I like how it has SPF. This leaves my skin almost matte, not completely. Throughout the day, my skin looks dewier. I do powder my T zone with neutrogena shine control powder to make my face last all day without looking like an oily mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great and does last a fair amount of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use this powder as a setting powder and my face becomes extremely oily throughout the day. However, I find that when I use this powder as a touch-up powder, it does the job quite well. I use Maybelline Dream Matte Powder to set my foundation in the morning and I use Skin79 Protect Beblesh pact to even things out after blotting and it works really well. .</li>
            <li> Years ago, I used a great cream to powder foundation.  I must&#x27;ve gone through 20 of the compacts it came in, and I loved the way it went on and looked.  Alas, the company changed the packaging and formula, and the new one was too heavy and made me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I purchased this compact to carry in my purse for touch ups, it seems to be identical to my loved and lost cream to powder product.  I was expecting a powder only, and am delighted by the surprise.  As with all beblesh products, and as was true with the compact I used to use, it&#x27;s necessary to give the stuff time to blend into your skin--it looks a bit ghostly at first, but soon mellows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The compact itself is great; there&#x27;s a hinged plastic piece that protects the product, and is much nicer than the usual flimsy throwaway piece.  The mirror is a nice touch, and the size will fit into just about any bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been very pleased by all the Skin79 products I&#x27;ve purchased, and this one came with the little silver seal intact--a guarantee that it&#x27;s a genuine BB product.  As an added bonus, it&#x27;s about half the price of my original c to p .</li>
            <li> This is a great compact to keep in your purse. It covers and blends nicely - not cakey - I love these products from their cream makeup to this compact.</li>
            <li> I like the finish that it gives. I have oily skin in some places and it helps a lot with that.</li>
            <li> Great item. Got it within 10 days of ordering. Very happy will buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I put this product on top of my Super Pink Plus BB Cream its not to bad I wish it would blend more evenly but other than that its great product.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of yellow in my skin and this seems to be a great color for me year round. I believe I was an nc23 in mac, don&#x27;t really remember because since I discovered bb&#x27;s I never went back to that cakey crap. This powder provides a good medium coverage and the spf is awesome. Its my go to for lazy makeup days when I just want a one step application.</li>
            <li> good for oily skin, stay matt, covers flaws on my faces, skin looks even.&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend using it in winter, it shows dry spots on your face like other powder. Otherwise, great product</li>
            <li> I use this along with the Skin79 BB cream, just where I get most oily, my nose and chin.  It does the job and it not heavy, with extra sun protection.</li>
