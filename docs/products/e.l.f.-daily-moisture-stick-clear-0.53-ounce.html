            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>This is a product I read about in a review of effective beauty products and it lived up to the hype!  </li>
            <li>I add this to some dryer areas, I can&#x27;t say I feel any difference, but it may just be the good quality moisturizers I use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely loved it.</li>

            <li>i love this!</li>
            <li>I love this moisture stick!</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li>kind of just makes things look un-cakey.</li>
            <li>Waxy to touch (but melts nicely) and doesn&#x27;t appear that way on face and neck.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>But it goes on nicely and seems to hydrate my skin well :-)</li>
            <li>It makes it so easy to apply to my face!</li>
            <li>It gives the skin a comfort level that is very soothing and allows the bronzing mineral powder and then the highlighter cream to go on smoothly and appear flawless.  </li>
            <li>OK for the price but better products out there.</li>
            <li>I love the packaging.</li>
            <li>nice but light weight</li>
            <li>Love this product,  able to apply throughout the day if you start looking powdery and</li>
            <li>I love this product; but it took me a minute to figure out when and how to use it in my make-up application.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a moisture stuck - nothing fancy or magical</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I find that it does wonders applied with your finger to the undereye area on top of your makeup towards the end of the day -</li>
            <li>and I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>You can use alone or under/on top of make up.</li>
            <li>My lip balm does a better job than this thing.</li>
            <li>:) I use it at night before bed and wake up with a still hydrated face.</li>
            <li>Love this product, I was able to use it all over my face with no breaking out at all.  </li>
            <li>very hydrating, my skin feels amazing after applying!</li>
            <li>I use it on both my face and my hands (which get incredibly chapped in the wintertime if I&#x27;m not careful).</li>
            <li>This is wonderful, does not dry my skin, matter of fact my skin feels smooth and looks very healthy after use, perfect for everyday use as described !</li>
            <li>It felt refreshing on my skin and smelled light and clean, but still did a nice job moisturizing my skin.</li>
            <li>I originally fell in love with this brand&#x27;s Mineral Primer (here:</li>
            <li>I think really think of any situation where it is exceptionally convenient.</li>
            <li>It blends in really easy and has no smell or stickiness.</li>
            <li>Like, strongly chemical.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty nice moisturizer, my skin feels hydrated after gliding it across</li>
            <li>Keeps my undereye concealer from caking up and creasing into my fine lines.</li>
            <li>it replenishes the area with hydrating agents, without smudging the makeup and does away with any fine lines that may appear as you lose the hydratation from your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used any kind of cream on my face, it was my first time wit elf , it leaves my face so smooth..</li>
            <li>This little moisture stick lives in my purse and is perfect for those times when you check the mirror and need to touch things up.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non-greasy, and works like a huge tube of chapstick.</li>
            <li>I do, however, apply it to the &amp;#34;upper lip&amp;#34;, as it helps that area appear moist and smooth.  </li>
            <li>is such a great brand</li>
            <li>/&gt;What was originally a 5 star product for me has dropped to 2 stars now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a significant improvement with the clarity of my skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is great for both my oily and dry areas.  </li>
            <li>This E.L.F.  Moisture stick is so very moist and glides luxuriatingly across my two smiling pink cheeks that stay moist real good.</li>
            <li>Nothing too special about it...</li>
            <li>but I will use more when my face is extra dry or when the winter comes but really love it!!!</li>
            <li>I really like it :-)</li>
            <li>Made of some Great oils, no funny smell.  </li>
            <li>tackles perfectly, your dry spots, without causing blemishes - AS LONG as you lightly spread over skin afterward, with clean fingertips)</li>
            <li>I use the primer (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004DIXYWG/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o04_s00_i03?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1)  first to smooth out my skin.  </li>
            <li>Plumps skin, leaves it moisturized and looking super fresh ALL DAY.  </li>
            <li>So hydrating, felt so lovely going on and immediately gets soaked up by the skin and leave you feeling so soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>(I did my face, but it would work with any skin) and it somehow moisturizes (as opposed to putting on face cream and it getting absorbed).</li>
            <li>Your make-up glides over it, and many others suggest using it on elbows and other trouble spot, for which it may be excellent for.</li>
            <li>This product will not allow the concealer to lay right if applied underneath it.  </li>
            <li>If you are going to wear makeup under the eye, I suggest using clean fingertips to gently massage this balm into skin</li>
            <li>I use it before I put on make-up on rare occassions, but I mostly just use it for a facial moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It basically is exactly what it says it is... a moisture stick.</li>
            <li>This works pretty well as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>(AGAIN: I would recommend getting the eye refresh and using first, under the moisture</li>
            <li>When I finally found more in stock, I ordered two of them.</li>
            <li>One of the most gross face or make up products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by how lightly it goes on</li>
            <li>This is so great for those occasional dry patches you get throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Works great, definitely gets rid of any dry areas and keeps your make up intact.</li>
            <li>I am on some very strong prescription acne drugs, so my face gets very dry.  </li>
            <li>the stick arrived oily , think its been kept too long , not sure if its authentic the elf word wasn&#x27;t printed nicely !</li>
            <li>so I only use it at night but overall good product</li>
            <li>I use SIMPLE replenishing skin cream over my face, then lightly run this stick over both areas and again; gently massage into skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sorry I don&#x27;t have very helpful remarks...</li>
            <li>It really does make the flakiness disappear.</li>
            <li>I really like the feel.</li>
            <li>It does go on a little wet, but it is very light and dries quickly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if e.l.f changed their formula, but both of the new sticks smelled slightly fishy and the coverage wasn&#x27;t as nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also full of chemicals which ultimately led to my skin breaking out.  </li>
            <li>I am 42, have VERY sensitive skin, &amp; have the potential to break out, wearing most facial creams, and certainly any oils.  </li>
            <li>While I do not use it as my main moisturizer (not yet, anyways)</li>
            <li>Would recommend this highly.</li>
            <li>I love this little roll-on moisture stick.</li>
            <li>I am considering using this to replace my normal moisturizer.</li>
            <li>parabens(lotions/shampoos/makeup anything applied and absorbed by the skin) are linked to breast cancer and skin exposed to sun with parabens present may also react with UVB leading to increased skin aging and DNA damage…</li>
            <li>A useful product that I do not use enough.</li>
            <li>only issue was the scent, it didnt have a sweet smell, but i guess thats a good thing because that means its not loaded with perfume or all sorts of unhealthy stuff!</li>
            <li>Both sticks were new and sealed when they arrived, so I have no idea</li>
            <li>A new staple in my make-up bag.</li>
            <li>Does not cause any irritation or break outs on my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Average item for a cheap price.</li>
            <li>(I have pretty severe acne, so I have to be careful with certain products).</li>
            <li>I have to use moisturizer constantly, and I still get a lot of creases in my makeup where the fine lines are dry.  </li>
            <li>hmmm well it&#x27;s about the size of two lipsticks put together, and be careful not to lose your protective plastic cover or the stick will dry out :)</li>
            <li>also am starting to get little dry wrinkles over my top lip, and nasolabial folds (laugh lines around each side of mouth).</li>
            <li>Once I was out, I had a hard time finding availability to purchase more.</li>
            <li>Or at least that&#x27;s what I experiences as many teenaged boys kept trying to get my number...</li>
            <li>The product did serve its purpose, but I have sensitive skin,</li>
            <li>Wow, just got this stick for a trip to an arid climate, and was blown away by its awesomeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took me about 4-5 months of daily use to get through the whole stick.</li>
            <li>This stick can be used all over the body, but I do not recommend using it on your lips or near your eyes.</li>
            <li>Upon that soaking in, I gently rub this moisture stick in upward motions of the tear duct inner corner under-eye area, sweeping outward &amp; upward to the laugh crinkles at the other outer corner, followed by sweeping the stick over the lower and upper eye lid.  </li>
            <li>Just rub my finger on it, and it is just the right amount to settle down flakey patches or dab over any makeup that has settled into the trenches.  </li>
            <li>The stick felt slightly thicker going on my skin, and didn&#x27;t feel nearly as refreshing as the previous stick did.</li>
            <li>The first time I ordered this, I got the correct product (which goes on clear though does make your skin a little shiny.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s genuine or I was sent a knock off but be careful when ordering this online.  </li>
            <li>It reminds me a lot of when I used to use aloe straight from the plant on my face as a kid, only less sticky.</li>
            <li>I purchased it a few months ago and never got around to writing a review until now, but it&#x27;s extremely useful if you have dry skin or just need to moisturize.</li>
            <li>At night I have to use a very expensive night cream on my cheeks; but this adds a very nice comfort to all the other areas on my face at that time also.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by how lightly it goes on</li>
            <li> This is so great for those occasional dry patches you get throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Works great, definitely gets rid of any dry areas and keeps your make up intact.</li>
            <li> I am on some very strong prescription acne drugs, so my face gets very dry.  </li>
            <li> the stick arrived oily , think its been kept too long , not sure if its authentic the elf word wasn&#x27;t printed nicely !</li>
            <li> so I only use it at night but overall good product</li>
            <li> I use SIMPLE replenishing skin cream over my face, then lightly run this stick over both areas and again; gently massage into skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry I don&#x27;t have very helpful remarks...</li>
            <li> It really does make the flakiness disappear.</li>
            <li> I really like the feel.</li>
            <li> It does go on a little wet, but it is very light and dries quickly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if e.l.f changed their formula, but both of the new sticks smelled slightly fishy and the coverage wasn&#x27;t as nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also full of chemicals which ultimately led to my skin breaking out.  </li>
            <li> I am 42, have VERY sensitive skin, &amp; have the potential to break out, wearing most facial creams, and certainly any oils.  </li>
            <li> While I do not use it as my main moisturizer (not yet, anyways)</li>
            <li> Would recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> I love this little roll-on moisture stick.</li>
            <li> I am considering using this to replace my normal moisturizer.</li>
            <li> parabens(lotions/shampoos/makeup anything applied and absorbed by the skin) are linked to breast cancer and skin exposed to sun with parabens present may also react with UVB leading to increased skin aging and DNA damage…</li>
            <li> A useful product that I do not use enough.</li>
            <li> only issue was the scent, it didnt have a sweet smell, but i guess thats a good thing because that means its not loaded with perfume or all sorts of unhealthy stuff!</li>
            <li> Both sticks were new and sealed when they arrived, so I have no idea</li>
            <li> A new staple in my make-up bag.</li>
            <li> Does not cause any irritation or break outs on my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Average item for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> (I have pretty severe acne, so I have to be careful with certain products).</li>
            <li> I have to use moisturizer constantly, and I still get a lot of creases in my makeup where the fine lines are dry.  </li>
            <li> hmmm well it&#x27;s about the size of two lipsticks put together, and be careful not to lose your protective plastic cover or the stick will dry out :)</li>
            <li> also am starting to get little dry wrinkles over my top lip, and nasolabial folds (laugh lines around each side of mouth).</li>
            <li> Once I was out, I had a hard time finding availability to purchase more.</li>
            <li> Or at least that&#x27;s what I experiences as many teenaged boys kept trying to get my number...</li>
            <li> The product did serve its purpose, but I have sensitive skin,</li>
            <li> Wow, just got this stick for a trip to an arid climate, and was blown away by its awesomeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me about 4-5 months of daily use to get through the whole stick.</li>
            <li> This stick can be used all over the body, but I do not recommend using it on your lips or near your eyes.</li>
            <li> Upon that soaking in, I gently rub this moisture stick in upward motions of the tear duct inner corner under-eye area, sweeping outward &amp; upward to the laugh crinkles at the other outer corner, followed by sweeping the stick over the lower and upper eye lid.  </li>
            <li> Just rub my finger on it, and it is just the right amount to settle down flakey patches or dab over any makeup that has settled into the trenches.  </li>
            <li> The stick felt slightly thicker going on my skin, and didn&#x27;t feel nearly as refreshing as the previous stick did.</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered this, I got the correct product (which goes on clear though does make your skin a little shiny.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s genuine or I was sent a knock off but be careful when ordering this online.  </li>
            <li> It reminds me a lot of when I used to use aloe straight from the plant on my face as a kid, only less sticky.</li>
            <li> I purchased it a few months ago and never got around to writing a review until now, but it&#x27;s extremely useful if you have dry skin or just need to moisturize.</li>
            <li> At night I have to use a very expensive night cream on my cheeks; but this adds a very nice comfort to all the other areas on my face at that time also.</li>
            <li> It has a little bit of a weird smell, but it fades quickly and works so well that I&#x27;m willing to put up with that!</li>
            <li> My face has an annoying habit of showing dry spots only after I&#x27;ve put on my makeup, and this moisture stick is a great solution to that problem.</li>
            <li> This is the first e.l.f product I&#x27;ve disliked!!</li>
            <li> Also, the stick didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I still suffer from the occasional acne, but this has helped reduce the number of whiteheads, blackheads and cystic under-the-skin acne I get from dry</li>
            <li> This little stick really surprised me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never be without it as long as it is on the market.</li>
            <li> sucks cause the reviews I read are very compelling :/</li>
            <li> I like it, especially that it can be used in other places not just face.</li>
            <li> I have a dry patch of skin on my face and apply this to it and it has soothed it quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Around my chin, my foundation can sometimes dry out during the winter.</li>
            <li> It has SAVED my skin from getting so dry that it causes acne.  </li>
            <li> It spreads on a thin layer, so I&#x27;m not sure that it would work on excessively dry skin, but it moisturizes without becoming too oily, and it doesn&#x27;t break me out</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last nearly long enough for my uses.</li>
            <li> The smell was unpleasant, but even more so it was like rubbing wax on my face.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend for people like me who have to constantly apply moisturizer to a small area.</li>
            <li> If you have very dry skin</li>
            <li> A little of this product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> That means I have some lines that makeup can settle into, and flakes that crop up from time to time due to the Retin-A.  </li>
            <li> I rub a little on my fingertip and then tap/dab it on the dry spots until they go away.</li>
            <li> My nose usually peels constantly in the winter and this little stick is convenient to pull out and use in bathrooms, etc.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product hands down.</li>
            <li> some of the ingredients used in this product are not safe for consumption so please just be careful.</li>
            <li> it does not make you look shiny or oily, just gives you a little refresher throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I also put a little on my cheeks and nose if I know I&#x27;m going out into the wind in wintertime.</li>
            <li> I got the wrong color completely</li>
            <li> Covers without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not tacky and doesn&#x27;t leave behind residue, and seems to last quite a while.</li>
            <li> It is compact and won&#x27;t run out after a few uses.</li>
            <li> The moisture stick did not glide at all &amp; was heavy.</li>
            <li> I hate throwing out products, but I wouldn&#x27;t even use this product if it was free.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t have the heavy feel of creams.</li>
            <li> The second time, the lettering on the tube was a little crooked and the actual product smells AWFUL.</li>
            <li> Moisturizers tend to feel thick and heavy on my oily skin and contribute to clogged pores.</li>
            <li> Instead of a cream or something, it is a hard gel that you rub on your skin</li>
            <li> and I have a hard time recommending it since it changed.</li>
            <li> However, it is really thick feeling</li>
            <li> When they say you can use this on anything, they really mean it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> not a good combo with the poreless primer, though -- makes my skin too oily looking.</li>
            <li> It is not too greasy applied in a thin layer</li>
            <li> sooooo unfortunately it broke me out.</li>
            <li> The smell is just not good at all!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got terrible dry skin</li>
            <li> Dry and worthless!</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t moisturize at all and all I got was a really bad odor.  </li>
            <li> The worst part is that covering acne spots and scars is almost impossible.  </li>
            <li> Horrible, feels like wax on my face!</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is so great for those occasional dry patches you get throughout the day. Does not take off your already applied makeup. Would recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> I originally fell in love with this brand&#x27;s Mineral Primer (here: [[ASIN:B004DIXYWG l f Studio Mineral Infused Primer]] so I had to try this thing out. It was marvelous! So hydrating, felt so lovely going on and immediately gets soaked up by the skin and leave you feeling so soft and hydrated. When they say you can use this on anything, they really mean it. Face, Knees, elbows, hands, feet, your rugged boyfriend&#x27;s feet... I wish they had a bigger version! It also pairs well with the mineral face primer and leaves you with gorgeous make-up!  You will literally look 5 years younger. Or at least that&#x27;s what I experiences as many teenaged boys kept trying to get my number... even when I was practically dressed like a nun.</li>
            <li> Works great, definitely gets rid of any dry areas and keeps your make up intact.</li>
            <li> This is a product I read about in a review of effective beauty products and it lived up to the hype!  Amazing!</li>
            <li> It basically is exactly what it says it is... a moisture stick. Nothing too special about it... I think really think of any situation where it is exceptionally convenient. Personally, I think you will be happier sticking to using lotion. Also, the stick didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> This is a great product love but I will use more when my face is extra dry or when the winter comes but really love it!!!</li>
            <li> This works pretty well as a moisturizer. I have a dry patch of skin on my face and apply this to it and it has soothed it quite a bit. However, it is really thick feeling and I can&#x27;t use it all over my face because it clogs pores.</li>
            <li> OK for the price but better products out there.</li>
            <li> well.. it quite looks like the petroleum jelly? i dont like the smell but when applied thankfully it becomes odourless.</li>
            <li> I love the packaging. It makes it so easy to apply to my face!</li>
            <li> nice but light weight</li>
            <li> I am on some very strong prescription acne drugs, so my face gets very dry.  I have to use moisturizer constantly, and I still get a lot of creases in my makeup where the fine lines are dry.  The worst part is that covering acne spots and scars is almost impossible.  If I use concealer, it just dries out and looks caked and clumpy. I can&#x27;t wear lipstick at all, only Aquaphor.  I use the primer (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004DIXYWG/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o04_s00_i03?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1)  first to smooth out my skin.  Then, I use this stuff on the driest areas, especially the eyes. I still need my moisturizer, but these both work to keep my makeup looking great! I am planning on getting another one to keep in my handbag to refresh my eye makeup during the day.  Another reviewer said something about it being like Vaseline.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s like that at all! It does go on a little wet, but it is very light and dries quickly and smoothly.  It isn&#x27;t gunky or greasy at all.  It is great for both my oily and dry areas.  I haven&#x27;t seen any increased breakouts either, so it doesn&#x27;t seem to be working against my acne meds.</li>
            <li> Keeps my undereye concealer from caking up and creasing into my fine lines.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the stick it, its gives me a all day moisture, it lives in my purse.</li>
            <li> Horrible, feels like wax on my face! I&#x27;ll stick w/the cocoa butter moisture stick! This is the first e.l.f product I&#x27;ve disliked!! Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> I got the wrong color completely</li>
            <li> This E.L.F.  Moisture stick is so very moist and glides luxuriatingly across my two smiling pink cheeks that stay moist real good.</li>
            <li> I love this little roll-on moisture stick. Covers without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> Love this product,  able to apply throughout the day if you start looking powdery and it does not make you look shiny or oily, just gives you a little refresher throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty nice moisturizer, my skin feels hydrated after gliding it across and it doesn&#x27;t have an odor. It&#x27;s not tacky and doesn&#x27;t leave behind residue, and seems to last quite a while. I use it before I put on make-up on rare occassions, but I mostly just use it for a facial moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry I don&#x27;t have very helpful remarks...hmmm well it&#x27;s about the size of two lipsticks put together, and be careful not to lose your protective plastic cover or the stick will dry out :)</li>
            <li> the stick arrived oily , think its been kept too long , not sure if its authentic the elf word wasn&#x27;t printed nicely !</li>
            <li> I think my skin is well moisturized but since I&#x27;m 50+ I add this to some dryer areas, I can&#x27;t say I feel any difference, but it may just be the good quality moisturizers I use. It&#x27;s non-greasy, and works like a huge tube of chapstick. It&#x27;s very easy to apply. If you have very dry skin and you need the extra moisturizer, I think you&#x27;ll like it. Your make-up glides over it, and many others suggest using it on elbows and other trouble spot, for which it may be excellent for. As for my skin, I probably wont need to reorder.</li>
            <li> This little stick really surprised me. Instead of a cream or something, it is a hard gel that you rub on your skin (I did my face, but it would work with any skin) and it somehow moisturizes (as opposed to putting on face cream and it getting absorbed). It is compact and won&#x27;t run out after a few uses. I am considering using this to replace my normal moisturizer. I am really impressed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got terrible dry skin and this helps some go away, sometimes it can make your skin look greasy so I only use it at night but overall good product</li>
            <li> I love this product; but it took me a minute to figure out when and how to use it in my make-up application.  I put this on AROUND the T-Zone BEFORE anything else, because I have Rosacea and have to use concealer in that area.  This product will not allow the concealer to lay right if applied underneath it.  I do, however, apply it to the &amp;#34;upper lip&amp;#34;, as it helps that area appear moist and smooth.  It gives the skin a comfort level that is very soothing and allows the bronzing mineral powder and then the highlighter cream to go on smoothly and appear flawless.  At night I have to use a very expensive night cream on my cheeks; but this adds a very nice comfort to all the other areas on my face at that time also.</li>
            <li> The product did serve its purpose, but I have sensitive skin, sooooo unfortunately it broke me out. So, I used it as a heel balm and it works GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing!!!!</li>
            <li> I have only used once,  it was moisturizing.  Made of some Great oils, no funny smell.  I like it, especially that it can be used in other places not just face.</li>
            <li> So of course the price is not the issue…I was just about to check out including this item and i thought let me check these ingredients…I think there was like 4 dif parabens listed esp methylparaben.. parabens(lotions/shampoos/makeup anything applied and absorbed by the skin) are linked to breast cancer and skin exposed to sun with parabens present may also react with UVB leading to increased skin aging and DNA damage…Quality over price in this case..sucks cause the reviews I read are very compelling :/</li>
            <li> I like it - it&#x27;s a moisture stuck - nothing fancy or magical lol I like not having to worry about spilling a lotion or getting cream under my nails from a jar. It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Does the job!! The smell is just not good at all!! But great product!!</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered this, I got the correct product (which goes on clear though does make your skin a little shiny. No scent.). The second time, the lettering on the tube was a little crooked and the actual product smells AWFUL. Like, strongly chemical.  Not sure if it&#x27;s genuine or I was sent a knock off but be careful when ordering this online.  If you find it in stores, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am 47 and use Retin A.  That means I have some lines that makeup can settle into, and flakes that crop up from time to time due to the Retin-A.  This little moisture stick lives in my purse and is perfect for those times when you check the mirror and need to touch things up.  Just rub my finger on it, and it is just the right amount to settle down flakey patches or dab over any makeup that has settled into the trenches.  :)  I&#x27;ll never be without it as long as it is on the market.</li>
            <li> I really like this product! While I do not use it as my main moisturizer (not yet, anyways) I find that it does wonders applied with your finger to the undereye area on top of your makeup towards the end of the day - it replenishes the area with hydrating agents, without smudging the makeup and does away with any fine lines that may appear as you lose the hydratation from your skin. It is not too greasy applied in a thin layer so it works perfectly for this, not to mention that you get a good amount and that the packaging makes it very easy to apply on the go. I just throw this in my purse for any touchups I may need during the day. I&#x27;d definitely recommend and repurchase myself if I run out of it - which won&#x27;t be for a while.</li>
            <li> I am 42, have VERY sensitive skin, &amp; have the potential to break out, wearing most facial creams, and certainly any oils.  I use the silver tube of e.l.f. eye refresh, immediately after washing face. Upon that soaking in, I gently rub this moisture stick in upward motions of the tear duct inner corner under-eye area, sweeping outward &amp; upward to the laugh crinkles at the other outer corner, followed by sweeping the stick over the lower and upper eye lid.  If you are going to wear makeup under the eye, I suggest using clean fingertips to gently massage this balm into skin first.&lt;br /&gt;I also am starting to get little dry wrinkles over my top lip, and nasolabial folds (laugh lines around each side of mouth). I use SIMPLE replenishing skin cream over my face, then lightly run this stick over both areas and again; gently massage into skin. - This stick is working miracles for my eyes and face (AGAIN: I would recommend getting the eye refresh and using first, under the moisture stick).&lt;br /&gt;*This tackles perfectly, your dry spots, without causing blemishes - AS LONG as you lightly spread over skin afterward, with clean fingertips)</li>
            <li> My face has an annoying habit of showing dry spots only after I&#x27;ve put on my makeup, and this moisture stick is a great solution to that problem. I rub a little on my fingertip and then tap/dab it on the dry spots until they go away. I also put a little on my cheeks and nose if I know I&#x27;m going out into the wind in wintertime. This also works great on my hands if I&#x27;ve forgotten to put lotion in my purse! It has a little bit of a weird smell, but it fades quickly and works so well that I&#x27;m willing to put up with that!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a giant chapstick for your face. It doesn&#x27;t make me break out or leave my skin feeling greasy. I love it!</li>
            <li> Average item for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> Wow, just got this stick for a trip to an arid climate, and was blown away by its awesomeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro tip: keep it in the fridge. Smoothing on nice, cool moisture under your eyes is very pleasantly soothing.</li>
            <li> Very good moisturizer...I recommend this product hands down.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these back in December and I absolutely loved it. It felt refreshing on my skin and smelled light and clean, but still did a nice job moisturizing my skin. Moisturizers tend to feel thick and heavy on my oily skin and contribute to clogged pores. I did not have those problems with this moisture stick at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me about 4-5 months of daily use to get through the whole stick. Once I was out, I had a hard time finding availability to purchase more. When I finally found more in stock, I ordered two of them. I don&#x27;t know if e.l.f changed their formula, but both of the new sticks smelled slightly fishy and the coverage wasn&#x27;t as nice. The stick felt slightly thicker going on my skin, and didn&#x27;t feel nearly as refreshing as the previous stick did. Both sticks were new and sealed when they arrived, so I have no idea what happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What was originally a 5 star product for me has dropped to 2 stars now and I have a hard time recommending it since it changed.</li>
            <li> This stuff feels delightful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a massive fan of e.l.f. products, and this moisturizer is one of my makeup staples. I use it on both my face and my hands (which get incredibly chapped in the wintertime if I&#x27;m not careful). It reminds me a lot of when I used to use aloe straight from the plant on my face as a kid, only less sticky. It spreads on a thin layer, so I&#x27;m not sure that it would work on excessively dry skin, but it moisturizes without becoming too oily, and it doesn&#x27;t break me out (I have pretty severe acne, so I have to be careful with certain products). My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t last nearly long enough for my uses. That said, I keep one tube in my makeup bag, and one in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> Great as a way to &amp;#34;refresh&amp;#34; your makeup. Not a dewy finish but kind of just makes things look un-cakey. I tried this because of Emily Noel. Around my chin, my foundation can sometimes dry out during the winter. I swirl my finger once atop the product, tap away on my chin, and skin-like foundation returns. A little of this product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> After reading multiple reviews I thought I&#x27;d give the product a try, but I wish I didn&#x27;t spend my money. The smell was unpleasant, but even more so it was like rubbing wax on my face. The moisture stick did not glide at all &amp; was heavy. My face in no way felt moisturized, but the moisture stick left my face feeling sticky &amp; didn&#x27;t allow my skin to breath.  It&#x27;s also full of chemicals which ultimately led to my skin breaking out.  I hate throwing out products, but I wouldn&#x27;t even use this product if it was free. One of the most gross face or make up products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes and makes my skin feel great at a great price! Must have! e.l.f. is such a great brand and I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I really like it :-) there is no sunscreen in it, which you can take for a good think or a drawback. But it goes on nicely and seems to hydrate my skin well :-)</li>
            <li> This is wonderful, does not dry my skin, matter of fact my skin feels smooth and looks very healthy after use, perfect for everyday use as described ! and great to use under make up! i love this! only issue was the scent, it didnt have a sweet smell, but i guess thats a good thing because that means its not loaded with perfume or all sorts of unhealthy stuff!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.  no joke, I take it everywhere.  It has SAVED my skin from getting so dry that it causes acne.  I&#x27;ve seen a significant improvement with the clarity of my skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vitamins in the formula create a balanced tone to my skin.  I still suffer from the occasional acne, but this has helped reduce the number of whiteheads, blackheads and cystic under-the-skin acne I get from dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...sometimes I use it as a lip balm between my &amp;#34;wash face&amp;#34; moment and &amp;#34;apply lipstick&amp;#34; moment...</li>
            <li> I use this on days my skin is showing the dryness from my acne and anti-aging medications. It really does make the flakiness disappear. You can use alone or under/on top of make up. It blends in really easy and has no smell or stickiness. A new staple in my make-up bag.</li>
            <li> A useful product that I do not use enough. Every time I remember to use it I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by how lightly it goes on and yet how well it moisturizes. My nose usually peels constantly in the winter and this little stick is convenient to pull out and use in bathrooms, etc. to keep the peeling at bay. I definitely recommend for people like me who have to constantly apply moisturizer to a small area.</li>
            <li> I love this moisture stick! I purchased it a few months ago and never got around to writing a review until now, but it&#x27;s extremely useful if you have dry skin or just need to moisturize. This stick can be used all over the body, but I do not recommend using it on your lips or near your eyes. I read a while back some of the ingredients used in this product are not safe for consumption so please just be careful.</li>
            <li> Plumps skin, leaves it moisturized and looking super fresh ALL DAY.  Does not cause any irritation or break outs on my very sensitive skin.  Waxy to touch (but melts nicely) and doesn&#x27;t appear that way on face and neck.</li>
            <li> I like ELF products but not this one...  it didn&#x27;t moisturize at all and all I got was a really bad odor.  Pass.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used any kind of cream on my face, it was my first time wit elf , it leaves my face so smooth..I&#x27;m hooked.. Will reorder it again</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!!  Makes your skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li> Awful. My lip balm does a better job than this thing. Dry and worthless!</li>
            <li> very hydrating, my skin feels amazing after applying! not a good combo with the poreless primer, though -- makes my skin too oily looking. :) I use it at night before bed and wake up with a still hydrated face.</li>
            <li> I really like the feel. It moisturizes your skin but it doesn&#x27;t have the heavy feel of creams.</li>
            <li> Love this product, I was able to use it all over my face with no breaking out at all.  Definitely something I would purchase again!</li>
