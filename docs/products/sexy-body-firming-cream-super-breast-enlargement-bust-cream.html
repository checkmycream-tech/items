            <li>but most of the products are nothing but frod.</li>
            <li>I had more fullness and sensitivity</li>

            <li>I have been using another bust firming cream for many years until it was discontinued.  </li>

            <li>I love this cream so much!</li>
            <li>Sometimes during the day I fell a quick tingle here in there inside my breast</li>
            <li>I looked into creams, saw this modestly presented one, with no outrageous claims, and thought... what the heck?</li>
            <li>It works super fast and it works well!  </li>
            <li>The new batch came  a bit different, the consistency is more concentrated ,the smell slightly more pronounced...</li>

            <li>I am on my second jar and love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product but doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li>I have not seen much growth but there is a lot of fullness.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>But this product i must say is really helpful.</li>
            <li>However, this last couple of days I feel more breast tenderness than before, especially in the nipple area.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I have purchased the product about three months ago and just after 15 days I had my breasts more firm.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks now and my breasts are definitely more firm</li>
            <li>I have super tiny breasts and have always wished I could make them bigger.</li>
            <li>My expectation was not to grow breast in a very noticeable way, just to get some fullness, if possible.</li>
            <li>She will be ordering it a few more times until she gets the final results she is looking for.</li>
            <li>I had very small breasts and that is why i tried so many products</li>
            <li>Apparently my friends know this because they bought this for me as a joke.</li>
            <li>OK, this is an update after a little less than a month: they keep growing, I can&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li>I have not had product long enough to rate results but my bottle was only half full.</li>
            <li>I like the smell so far but not sure about it working the way it stated yet, only my first time using it</li>

            <li> But I must tell you , on my last period they went down a bit</li>
            <li> Bought 2 jars and have been using it for a month and a half and the only result I&#x27;ve gotten is softer skin.</li>
            <li> I  expected  </li>
            <li> For someone who had such humble expectations, I am flabbergasted.</li>
            <li> I am reducing the frequency to only once a day, using a little less and massaging a bit lighter.</li>
            <li> I will update this post after one month use to let you know, but if like any other cream you have to keep using to maintain results, then I am up for it.  </li>
            <li> but  absolutely nothing uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I have a little improment but it work</li>
            <li> She had been using this product for a few weeks at the time.</li>
            <li> I used this product faithfully for a few weeks day and night...</li>
            <li> If you are looking to lift and firm your bust area</li>
            <li> it is absolutely nothing  painful or unbearable.</li>
            <li> The instructions on the bottle are so small and blurred, can&#x27;t read them</li>
            <li> &#x27;s a pic Half of product came sloppy and damaged</li>
            <li> I believe the reviews are fake</li>
            <li> Smells weird</li>
            <li> Which was disappointing..</li>
            <li> We were shocked to find that her bra size had increased.</li>
            <li> very disappointed  😢😢</li>
            <li> Smells awful (like something my grandma would wear).</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had very small breasts and that is why i tried so many products but none of them was helpful .One of my friend suggested me this and i must say this breast firming cream actually increases breast Size.It has been three weeks since i am using this and I have seen a significant improvement in my size.Now my figure looks way more shaped and I am planning to buy another tub.</li>
            <li> just another smell good cream</li>
            <li> Can someone who has used this tell me if you lose what you gain after you stop using the product??? Thank you in advance!!!</li>
            <li> Although I personally, as a male, have not used this product (yet), I can still attest to its results through my girlfriend during a trip to the mall. We were shocked to find that her bra size had increased. She had been using this product for a few weeks at the time. It truly works! Give it a shot!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product would work but I read a lot of good reviews. I have not seen much growth but there is a lot of fullness. My second order just came in today.</li>
            <li> does not work! ive seen zero results.</li>
            <li> I like the smell so far but not sure about it working the way it stated yet, only my first time using it &#x3D;). It came on time and it smells nice...</li>
            <li> I love this cream so much! It works super fast and it works well!  I feel great about myself and my boyfriend loves this too!</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this for about a month now and has seen results. Her breast are firmer and also has increased where she had to shop for new bras this past week. She will be ordering it a few more times until she gets the final results she is looking for. Overall great product that works like it should</li>
            <li> I been using this product for 3 days. And although I can&#x27;t see results yet. But I do feel my breast feeling firmed. Will give and up date after a month or so. It works.</li>
            <li> Package arrived damaged and opened product didn&#x27;t work if u don&#x27;t believe me here&#x27;s a pic Half of product came sloppy and damaged I believe the reviews are fake</li>
            <li> I used this product faithfully for a few weeks day and night... I really didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.  Which was disappointing.. But I guess it needs to be used for months before results are seen..but I did not experience a rash or any discomfort and it did reduce my stretch marks and make the skin softer so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell not residous I been used it for a month I have a little improment but it work</li>
            <li> I have super tiny breasts and have always wished I could make them bigger. Apparently my friends know this because they bought this for me as a joke. This actually is a great gift. I tried it and it seems to work, maybe I am just still happy from the joke. I would say this is a great gift for anyone in your life, joke or not.</li>
            <li> It smells good, but hasn&#x27;t done nothing.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement yet. But, haven&#x27;t been using it for very long so we&#x27;ll see what happens. I like the smell of it.</li>
            <li> I have not had product long enough to rate results but my bottle was only half full. It appeared that some of the cream had leaked out. The instructions on the bottle are so small and blurred, can&#x27;t read them</li>
            <li> This product is simply awesome.I have purchased the product about three months ago and just after 15 days I had my breasts more firm.Within a month i saw my breasts size increasing.I was still taking it light but when in two months it changed my bra size i was kind of obligated to write this review .Seriously people promice but most of the products are nothing but frod.But this product i must say is really helpful.I recommand all to benefit themselves.</li>
            <li> Smells awful (like something my grandma would wear). This product had no effect on firming nor enhancing my breasts. Olive oil massages work though!</li>
            <li> Awesome cream, works better than anything else I&#x27;ve bought. Books look great!</li>
            <li> Have only been using for a week, and has made my breast rounder and firmer just as it says on the jar. Hope to see some growth soon but only time will tell. You should try it!</li>
            <li> I had more fullness and sensitivity</li>
            <li> Bought 2 jars and have been using it for a month and a half and the only result I&#x27;ve gotten is softer skin. I read the reviews and for the price, I figured it&#x27;d work. But it didn&#x27;t. Was a pure waste of money!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks now and my breasts are definitely more firm and I hope to see them increase a bit with the next jar!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product but doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this cream only needs to be used 1-2 times a day. If you are looking to lift and firm your bust area then the fact that this is herbal is even better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and the jar is almost gone. I&#x27;ve seen no results. . Won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t  satisfied  didn&#x27;t  get tge results  I  expected  very disappointed  😢😢</li>
            <li> Did not work. Smells weird</li>
            <li> I have been using another bust firming cream for many years until it was discontinued.  I tried another cream, but did not see results.  I am on my second jar and love it.  It does make the breasts fill fuller and that creates some &amp;#34;uplifting&amp;#34;.  I plan to continue using this cream and definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Please do browse through my honest independent reviews on many various products to assess the credibility of this one. I have attempted couple of options to give my breast it&#x27;s fullness back. Some recommended pills did not work for me at all and I decided never to take anything orally again. I erred on the side of researching boob jobs...I am just not that kind of girl. I looked into creams, saw this modestly presented one, with no outrageous claims, and thought... what the heck? My expectation was not to grow breast in a very noticeable way, just to get some fullness, if possible. I have been using this consistently twice a day fro the past two weeks: BOY AM I SATISFIED. Fullness , roundness, fitting better into my bra cups, I am not measuring but I am sure I got some size. The cream is pleasant to use, absorbs quickly into the skin, no greasiness, smells nice. Sometimes during the day I fell a quick tingle here in there inside my breast but  absolutely nothing uncomfortable.  I don&#x27;t know how it goes when you stop using. I will update this post after one month use to let you know, but if like any other cream you have to keep using to maintain results, then I am up for it.  OK, this is an update after a little less than a month: they keep growing, I can&#x27;t believe it. I have my bras all filed up, it&#x27;s beautiful to watch in the mirror.  For someone who had such humble expectations, I am flabbergasted. However, this last couple of days I feel more breast tenderness than before, especially in the nipple area. It could also just be my period coming. I am observing the situation .So I am reducing the frequency to only once a day, using a little less and massaging a bit lighter. This being said,  it is absolutely nothing  painful or unbearable. I am still very happy with the cream, I have ordered more. I will keep updating you :)  Update after two months use: DUDE! DUDE!.... I made another order. The new batch came  a bit different, the consistency is more concentrated ,the smell slightly more pronounced...don&#x27;t know if it is just an impression but it seems even more effective. I only use once in the morning now.  I just LOVE looking at them, I could gaze for hours if I had the time, they look like I  had a wonderfully executed boobs job and it&#x27;s all me! Amazing, I never expect anything to perform to that level. I am totally-totally satisfied. Can you ask for more? Size only where you need it, no side effects visible. But I must tell you , on my last period they went down a bit, maybe it is the evening primrose oil I took. I am awaiting to see what happens during the next.</li>
            <li> Seen a difference is size and firmness within a couple of weeks. Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I ordered two, one was fine the other had the seal broken and some had leaked in the cover. It seemed like it was going to do something at first because my breasts felt a little tingly a few times. But after two months of using it twice a day it didn&#x27;t change my breast size.</li>
            <li> Just received 3 days ago (Aug 14).  I will update this review in about a month.  Seems to be working.</li>
