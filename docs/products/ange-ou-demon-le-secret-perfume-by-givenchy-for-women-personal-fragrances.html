            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with this seller.</li>
            <li>lesson learned... and I&#x27;m trying to return it and amazon isn&#x27;t letting me because they are classifying it as a hazardous material, but yet they mailed it out to me.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for going out but not for and nights with husbands, I am sure you know.</li>

            <li>We all have different preferences as for what kind of scents we like,so I am sure some people won&#x27;t find it as awesome as I find it to be.</li>

            <li>i take this :)</li>
            <li>Girl Equipment:)  </li>
            <li>It had more of an alcohol scent to it.</li>
            <li>I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
            <li>I like it and my wife love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing it now for a year and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this fragrance.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Just to make sure I wasn&#x27;t being paranoid, I went over to Ulta to compare with their tester --</li>
            <li>love Amazon</li>
            <li>I still love the smell</li>
            <li>This perfume is so feminine royal , really lovely, and the best this about it that it lasts till the next day.</li>
            <li>My favorite parfum.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this scent during a Sephora visit and came home to add it to my wish list.  </li>
            <li>Light and feminine but not grody girlie!</li>
            <li>Let me put it this way: I always keep 16 colognes in stock and the love of my life always keeps 10 perfumes in stock.</li>
            <li>This is the most amount of money that I have ever paid for a perfume online</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I love this item....</li>
            <li>and WE both fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>While trying to find Amarige, I cam across this scent and after wearing a sample for the evening fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I love this parfum, will</li>
            <li>so I knew I&#x27;d love the scent.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite fragrances.</li>
            <li>I did too :-)</li>
            <li>Have received many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perfume the same that is in the store, but for really cheap price!!!!</li>
            <li>Very light and easy to wear.  </li>
            <li>As is true with any scent, you need to see how it reacts to your own chemical balance before committing.</li>
            <li>Love this bottle and it was huge for a cheap price!</li>
            <li>and I was very hesitant to purchase it without smelling it on her to make sure it smells good on her.</li>
            <li>my shelf if full of the most famous brands of perfumes, so when I am giving you my opinion I am comparing it to many others that  I use..</li>
            <li>I have bought my wife many other perfumes that all smell wonderful, this perfume is another to add to the buy list.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>It has a nice and fresh citrus smell with hints of floral.</li>
            <li>It has the original scent, but its very light considering its parfum and not colonge.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more clean jasmine w/splashes of fruit when sprayed.</li>
            <li>and I believe it&#x27;s too strong maybe for work or going out</li>
            <li>I have no idea about parfums but this one seemed fancy and not expensive, and she liked it,</li>
            <li>I often purchase fine fragrances from around the world and online.</li>
            <li>I got many compliments from people about this one more than any other kind !</li>
            <li>Received a free sample swab at the Women&#x27;s Expo Show and happened to leave the swab on my counter.  </li>
            <li>Once I did get it I do enjoy the perfume.</li>
            <li>It is light and feminine, but not overly floral.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been one of my favourite fragrances for a heck of a long time now - I love using it, it has nice, kind of sweet scent</li>
            <li>The packaging is lovely, the service was great, but the perfume spray is like a watered down version of the Givenchy scent.</li>
            <li>I suspect this might be a replica of the original.  </li>
            <li>Perfume original tal cual la descripci√≥n, sumamente conforme</li>
            <li>I appreciate your replacing the original order, &amp; realize they cannot be returned, but I will not order any fragrance from Amazon again.  </li>
            <li>It is the original perfum.</li>
            <li>Clean.</li>
            <li>I have never been into the really sweet smelling perfumes, but instead prefer the woods.</li>
            <li>This one is light and fresh and stays with you.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume is very functional as well in both day and night.</li>
            <li>Delicious scent, not a long last.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find this item at such a great price and even more pleased that it would take just a few days to arrive.</li>
            <li>Many times ago i looking some new parfum for my girl and sister.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>It has turned into her new favorite.</li>
            <li>When I smelled this I absolutely fell in loooove!!</li>
            <li>The light scent stays all day long and has a very light clean scent.</li>
            <li>I really think it is simply a light scent.</li>
            <li>If you like fresh and floral/fruity</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and airy which was exactly what I was looking for, but I first tested it out in the store before purchasing.</li>
            <li>Very sexy without being too heavy or too strong.</li>
            <li>It was very well received, and the scent is rich without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>I disagree with the other posts that state that the scent wasn&#x27;t as good as it was when purchased through the store.</li>
            <li>You literally have to spray it right before going in some place for people to notice it.  </li>
            <li>Very sweet and light smelling that you just can&#x27;t get enough of!</li>
            <li>It has a very mild, pleasant fresh scent of flowers but long lasting.</li>
            <li>Might be worth sampling in store first though.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday use!</li>
            <li>Love this scent but usually pay $90 or more for a bottle.</li>
            <li>I  have used this parfum for several years and I love it.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I ordered it thru Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>I still love it, but the ONLY problem with this scent</li>
            <li>Product arrived exactly as described.</li>
            <li>From first day I tried it in store</li>
            <li>It has such a refreshing not-overpowering scent that it was a mandatory addition to my perfume collection.</li>
            <li>My first time with this scent.</li>
            <li>I know exactly what this parfum note should be.</li>
            <li>I really love it, so this time I ordered a bigger bottle !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, feminine, and fresh but with enough body to wear in the evening, as well.</li>
            <li>I certainly can&#x27;t understand what could have happened, twice.</li>
            <li>very feminine without being too girly.</li>
            <li>She loves it so much I bought her two.</li>
            <li>This scent is very  feminine not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I really just pay that price?&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Packaged very well.</li>
            <li>People often ask what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing and comment on how much they like it.  </li>
            <li>Upon further research, I found that the bottle I liked and had bought before was a floral version with the same name.</li>
            <li>The smell is very different and intriguing!</li>
            <li>and I wish they would bring back the original.</li>
            <li>Well, it was a Christmas gift along with 3 other gifts and this become her favorite gift.</li>
            <li>, it was exactly what she expected, soft and elegant floral fragrance</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long-lasting on me, even though I use it pretty frequently, I still smell it on me all day.</li>
            <li>and I thumb up Givenchy for this new fragrance which eventually will be a classic item!</li>
            <li>The fact that I was able to buy it on Amazon for less that in departments stores made me even happier.</li>
            <li>a spray on each wrist unfortunately confirmed that the one I received from Amazon is a knockoff, and the counterfeit version&#x27;s smell was completely gone by the time I walked the ~2 blocks back to work</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not into perfume too much and my nose is very sensitive to any scenes.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>nowhere near the true quality... if you think you are buying the same product as you purchase from quality retails think again...</li>
            <li>had received a smaller size as a gift (1.7oz) &amp; loved the scent, &amp; expected the same result.  </li>
            <li>I discovered Ange Ou Demon Le Secret a couple of years ago and have loved it ever since.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not overbearing even when you spray it right beforehand.  </li>
            <li>almost a deep fruity scent right when you spray it on.</li>
            <li>I am new to the world of fancy perfume, so it may be my fault.</li>
            <li>This is a new fragrance</li>
            <li>Next time, I&#x27;ll shell out the extra money for the genuine thing from a department store.</li>
            <li>The perfume was exactly the same that I have always purchased at department stores.</li>
            <li>I put it on at 4 this afternoon when I got home and found it on the porch and at nearly 9pm its still there!  </li>
            <li>It gives me an extra boost of confidence ;)</li>
            <li>(&amp;#34;it didn&#x27;t even last the hour&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>If the bottle is amber in color and not the clear with the white on front, then it is the newer formula, not necessarily a fake.</li>
            <li>It has an air of mystery, a secret that many will want to find out!</li>
            <li>Clearly the bottle has changed (refer to photo)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I shower, put it on and need to reapply it within another hour before going to work and then frequently though the day.</li>
            <li>but you must pay at least 30 or 40 dollars more for it in stores.</li>
            <li>Shipping took longer than I expected, but still worth it.</li>
            <li>(while I can still smell the genuine perfume on my other wrist several hours later.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, when the product arrived I found it contained two more surprises (a small Ange ou Demon Le Secret lotion and carrying case), which elevated this purchase all the more.</li>
            <li>While this product smells somewhat similar to the genuine Ange Ou Demon Le Secret, it&#x27;s definitely off, and it doesn&#x27;t last on skin or clothes for more than 5-10 minutes before disappearing completely.</li>
            <li>Not only that, but by ordering through Amazon, I was able to purchase twice the size for half the price, as compared to my local (chain) beauty retailer.</li>
            <li>I am not sure it is original.</li>
            <li>It is not strong but it is so fresh like wild flowers scent in gardens.</li>
            <li>Patterns on the package are totally different from the picture, and the smell is different from my previous genuine one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they changed the formula or something, but I want the old scent back.  </li>
            <li>This product has MUCH more of a perfume smell behind it...</li>
            <li>Givenchy is expensive and well known for its various amazing scents.</li>
            <li>I personally can smell the change but so far everyone else says it smells the same on me.</li>
            <li>She assured me it was not kept in the warehouse too long, but was shipped directly from</li>
            <li>I wish I had heeded the other reviewers who said this product is a fake, but hoping to save a fair bit of cash, I went ahead with the purchase anyway.</li>
            <li>When I first sprayed it on it was very reminiscent of Miss Cherie by Dior, but once it settled ( a few moments later) it became lighter.</li>
            <li>Literally costs HALF as much as if you were to get it at a department store such as *</li>
            <li>so so light and little frutty without being too heavy like a walking fruit salad.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> twice&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for quick delivery and best price.</li>
            <li> This scent is great, very woody - the times I can smell what seems to be cedar are divine - and it&#x27;s a perfect daytime scent.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied; lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume for years with it always being my very favorite.</li>
            <li> She was thrilled with the perfume and loved it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s kind of a good deal on amazon and</li>
            <li> Love this smell!</li>
            <li> This has got to be one of my favorite scents!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s warm and spicy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with this seller.</li>
            <li> lesson learned... and I&#x27;m trying to return it and amazon isn&#x27;t letting me because they are classifying it as a hazardous material, but yet they mailed it out to me.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for going out but not for and nights with husbands, I am sure you know.</li>
            <li> what kind of fragrance I am wearing.</li>
            <li> Liked the price.</li>
            <li> Smells great, sweet but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I recommend this perfume for a nice gift for someone you love.</li>
            <li> I loved the original.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product and will make a great Christmas present for a woman in her 20&#x27;s! :)</li>
            <li> We all have different preferences as for what kind of scents we like,so I am sure some people won&#x27;t find it as awesome as I find it to be.</li>
            <li> scent, quick shipping, good size bottle of perfume.</li>
            <li> I do LOVE this scent</li>
            <li> I bought the 1.7 oz yesterday and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance on my wife.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of her favorite.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for years and love it.</li>
            <li> This perfume just smells better and better the longer</li>
            <li> The fragrance holds a lovely level of intensity thru the day and night.</li>
            <li> wish the top of bottle stayed on better.</li>
            <li> i take this :)</li>
            <li> Girl Equipment:)  </li>
            <li> It had more of an alcohol scent to it.</li>
            <li> I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
            <li> I like it and my wife love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing it now for a year and love it.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of this fragrance.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Just to make sure I wasn&#x27;t being paranoid, I went over to Ulta to compare with their tester --</li>
            <li> love Amazon</li>
            <li> I still love the smell</li>
            <li> This perfume is so feminine royal , really lovely, and the best this about it that it lasts till the next day.</li>
            <li> My favorite parfum.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this scent during a Sephora visit and came home to add it to my wish list.  </li>
            <li> Light and feminine but not grody girlie!</li>
            <li> Let me put it this way: I always keep 16 colognes in stock and the love of my life always keeps 10 perfumes in stock.</li>
            <li> This is the most amount of money that I have ever paid for a perfume online</li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I love this item....</li>
            <li> and WE both fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> While trying to find Amarige, I cam across this scent and after wearing a sample for the evening fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I love this parfum, will</li>
            <li> so I knew I&#x27;d love the scent.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances.</li>
            <li> I did too :-)</li>
            <li> Have received many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perfume the same that is in the store, but for really cheap price!!!!</li>
            <li> Very light and easy to wear.  </li>
            <li> As is true with any scent, you need to see how it reacts to your own chemical balance before committing.</li>
            <li> Love this bottle and it was huge for a cheap price!</li>
            <li> and I was very hesitant to purchase it without smelling it on her to make sure it smells good on her.</li>
            <li> my shelf if full of the most famous brands of perfumes, so when I am giving you my opinion I am comparing it to many others that  I use..</li>
            <li> I have bought my wife many other perfumes that all smell wonderful, this perfume is another to add to the buy list.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and refreshing.</li>
            <li> It has a nice and fresh citrus smell with hints of floral.</li>
            <li> It has the original scent, but its very light considering its parfum and not colonge.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more clean jasmine w/splashes of fruit when sprayed.</li>
            <li> and I believe it&#x27;s too strong maybe for work or going out</li>
            <li> I have no idea about parfums but this one seemed fancy and not expensive, and she liked it,</li>
            <li> I often purchase fine fragrances from around the world and online.</li>
            <li> I got many compliments from people about this one more than any other kind !</li>
            <li> Received a free sample swab at the Women&#x27;s Expo Show and happened to leave the swab on my counter.  </li>
            <li> Once I did get it I do enjoy the perfume.</li>
            <li> It is light and feminine, but not overly floral.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been one of my favourite fragrances for a heck of a long time now - I love using it, it has nice, kind of sweet scent</li>
            <li> The packaging is lovely, the service was great, but the perfume spray is like a watered down version of the Givenchy scent.</li>
            <li> I suspect this might be a replica of the original.  </li>
            <li> Perfume original tal cual la descripci√≥n, sumamente conforme</li>
            <li> I appreciate your replacing the original order, &amp; realize they cannot be returned, but I will not order any fragrance from Amazon again.  </li>
            <li> It is the original perfum.</li>
            <li> Clean.</li>
            <li> I have never been into the really sweet smelling perfumes, but instead prefer the woods.</li>
            <li> This one is light and fresh and stays with you.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume is very functional as well in both day and night.</li>
            <li> Delicious scent, not a long last.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this item at such a great price and even more pleased that it would take just a few days to arrive.</li>
            <li> Many times ago i looking some new parfum for my girl and sister.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> It has turned into her new favorite.</li>
            <li> When I smelled this I absolutely fell in loooove!!</li>
            <li> The light scent stays all day long and has a very light clean scent.</li>
            <li> I really think it is simply a light scent.</li>
            <li> If you like fresh and floral/fruity</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and airy which was exactly what I was looking for, but I first tested it out in the store before purchasing.</li>
            <li> Very sexy without being too heavy or too strong.</li>
            <li> It was very well received, and the scent is rich without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> I disagree with the other posts that state that the scent wasn&#x27;t as good as it was when purchased through the store.</li>
            <li> You literally have to spray it right before going in some place for people to notice it.  </li>
            <li> Very sweet and light smelling that you just can&#x27;t get enough of!</li>
            <li> It has a very mild, pleasant fresh scent of flowers but long lasting.</li>
            <li> Might be worth sampling in store first though.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use!</li>
            <li> Love this scent but usually pay $90 or more for a bottle.</li>
            <li> I  have used this parfum for several years and I love it.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I ordered it thru Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> I still love it, but the ONLY problem with this scent</li>
            <li> Product arrived exactly as described.</li>
            <li> From first day I tried it in store</li>
            <li> It has such a refreshing not-overpowering scent that it was a mandatory addition to my perfume collection.</li>
            <li> My first time with this scent.</li>
            <li> I know exactly what this parfum note should be.</li>
            <li> I really love it, so this time I ordered a bigger bottle !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, feminine, and fresh but with enough body to wear in the evening, as well.</li>
            <li> I certainly can&#x27;t understand what could have happened, twice.</li>
            <li> very feminine without being too girly.</li>
            <li> She loves it so much I bought her two.</li>
            <li> This scent is very  feminine not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I really just pay that price?&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Packaged very well.</li>
            <li> People often ask what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing and comment on how much they like it.  </li>
            <li> Upon further research, I found that the bottle I liked and had bought before was a floral version with the same name.</li>
            <li> The smell is very different and intriguing!</li>
            <li> and I wish they would bring back the original.</li>
            <li> Well, it was a Christmas gift along with 3 other gifts and this become her favorite gift.</li>
            <li> , it was exactly what she expected, soft and elegant floral fragrance</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long-lasting on me, even though I use it pretty frequently, I still smell it on me all day.</li>
            <li> and I thumb up Givenchy for this new fragrance which eventually will be a classic item!</li>
            <li> The fact that I was able to buy it on Amazon for less that in departments stores made me even happier.</li>
            <li> a spray on each wrist unfortunately confirmed that the one I received from Amazon is a knockoff, and the counterfeit version&#x27;s smell was completely gone by the time I walked the ~2 blocks back to work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not into perfume too much and my nose is very sensitive to any scenes.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> nowhere near the true quality... if you think you are buying the same product as you purchase from quality retails think again...</li>
            <li> had received a smaller size as a gift (1.7oz) &amp; loved the scent, &amp; expected the same result.  </li>
            <li> I discovered Ange Ou Demon Le Secret a couple of years ago and have loved it ever since.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not overbearing even when you spray it right beforehand.  </li>
            <li> almost a deep fruity scent right when you spray it on.</li>
            <li> I am new to the world of fancy perfume, so it may be my fault.</li>
            <li> This is a new fragrance</li>
            <li> Next time, I&#x27;ll shell out the extra money for the genuine thing from a department store.</li>
            <li> The perfume was exactly the same that I have always purchased at department stores.</li>
            <li> I put it on at 4 this afternoon when I got home and found it on the porch and at nearly 9pm its still there!  </li>
            <li> It gives me an extra boost of confidence ;)</li>
            <li> (&amp;#34;it didn&#x27;t even last the hour&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li> If the bottle is amber in color and not the clear with the white on front, then it is the newer formula, not necessarily a fake.</li>
            <li> It has an air of mystery, a secret that many will want to find out!</li>
            <li> Clearly the bottle has changed (refer to photo)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I shower, put it on and need to reapply it within another hour before going to work and then frequently though the day.</li>
            <li> but you must pay at least 30 or 40 dollars more for it in stores.</li>
            <li> Shipping took longer than I expected, but still worth it.</li>
            <li> (while I can still smell the genuine perfume on my other wrist several hours later.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, when the product arrived I found it contained two more surprises (a small Ange ou Demon Le Secret lotion and carrying case), which elevated this purchase all the more.</li>
            <li> While this product smells somewhat similar to the genuine Ange Ou Demon Le Secret, it&#x27;s definitely off, and it doesn&#x27;t last on skin or clothes for more than 5-10 minutes before disappearing completely.</li>
            <li> Not only that, but by ordering through Amazon, I was able to purchase twice the size for half the price, as compared to my local (chain) beauty retailer.</li>
            <li> I am not sure it is original.</li>
            <li> It is not strong but it is so fresh like wild flowers scent in gardens.</li>
            <li> Patterns on the package are totally different from the picture, and the smell is different from my previous genuine one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they changed the formula or something, but I want the old scent back.  </li>
            <li> This product has MUCH more of a perfume smell behind it...</li>
            <li> Givenchy is expensive and well known for its various amazing scents.</li>
            <li> I personally can smell the change but so far everyone else says it smells the same on me.</li>
            <li> She assured me it was not kept in the warehouse too long, but was shipped directly from</li>
            <li> I wish I had heeded the other reviewers who said this product is a fake, but hoping to save a fair bit of cash, I went ahead with the purchase anyway.</li>
            <li> When I first sprayed it on it was very reminiscent of Miss Cherie by Dior, but once it settled ( a few moments later) it became lighter.</li>
            <li> Literally costs HALF as much as if you were to get it at a department store such as *</li>
            <li> so so light and little frutty without being too heavy like a walking fruit salad.</li>
            <li> I agree that the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> the fact that it does not last long at all.</li>
            <li> I have found that most parfumes containing musks have a dirty, overpowering scent about them, and they give me headaches.  </li>
            <li> It drove me crazy for about a week, my favorite perfume wasn&#x27;t smelling like it was suppose too.</li>
            <li> It DOES stay around for long.  </li>
            <li> After using for a few times I&#x27;ve noticed I developed headaches as soon as I put it on.  </li>
            <li> Boasts, green tea, jasmine, white peony and white musks.</li>
            <li> Had to order the right one after my big mistake when I ordered the wrong one.  </li>
            <li> My Ange Ou Demon Le Secret By Givenchy Parfum Spray smelled exactly as what I had tried @ Sephora.</li>
            <li> However the last two bottles I ordered was a bit off in the smell department to me, after some research, I see that Givenchy has ever so slightly reformatted the formula, along with the bottle color.</li>
            <li> that too for 25 dollars less than the actual price !</li>
            <li> It has a subtle  fragrance that is never overwhelming and is always appealingly  fresh .</li>
            <li> Only difference - half the price!</li>
            <li> yet Im going to buy my previous Chanel fragrance since it lasts three times as long.</li>
            <li> The scent on the swab lasted at least three days determining this would be a long lasting scent--Love the way it smells after it settles in.</li>
            <li> My wife has a little of her expensive bottle left over and the smell is MUCH sweeter.  </li>
            <li> And I always get questions from other people</li>
            <li> I also got one of the other Givenchy fragrances for her collection.</li>
            <li> Her nose ran across it at a major department store, but the price was ridiculous...</li>
            <li> Something is just not right with this.  </li>
            <li> I will NOT order it again through Amazon as the fragrance seems to be watered down.  </li>
            <li> Although the price is less than retail, I will not spend $70.00 for a replica.</li>
            <li> so I turned to Amazon and found it for half the price.  </li>
            <li> The second bottle unfortunately was the same.  </li>
            <li> I had a bottle of this that I used every drop of previously</li>
            <li> What I wasn&#x27;t expecting was this bottle is twice the size of the one I had before and half the price.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price is half of what I&#x27;ve paid in department stores.</li>
            <li> THIS PERFUME IS NOT ORIGINAL</li>
            <li> THIS PERFUME IS NOT ORIGINAL</li>
            <li> Fragrance lasts a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Also, it being sold directly by Amazon provided me with a comfort level that we would not be receiving a FAKE product.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife she has been using this Givenchy for a few years now and loves it.</li>
            <li> I wear this fragrance everyday to work.</li>
            <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but I will definitely buy it until they stop making it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why Givenchy felt the need to change</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not popular.</li>
            <li> As a gardener by hobby and as a serious fragrance collector and lover, I approve this scent</li>
            <li> We usually get 20% off., but still expensive.</li>
            <li> Very confusing.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when the stores didn&#x27;t carry this fragrance for so long.</li>
            <li> amazon sent me the wrong perfume.</li>
            <li> it is so expensive</li>
            <li> try the return of the product and the system tells me that it is a dangerous substance and can not return, so I feel cheated.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, perfume will no longer be one of them!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent price! Love this scent but usually pay $90 or more for a bottle.</li>
            <li> I was torn as to whether or not to get this through Amazon since reviews were mixed and some said they feel the product is diluted and that it isn&#x27;t  the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; thing. I agree that the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long. I shower, put it on and need to reapply it within another hour before going to work and then frequently though the day. SO, I went to Macy&#x27;s and paid $105 to try the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; version. That only lasted a couple of hours also. I do LOVE this scent yet Im going to buy my previous Chanel fragrance since it lasts three times as long.</li>
            <li> I bought the 1.7 oz yesterday and I love it. I have never been into the really sweet smelling perfumes, but instead prefer the woods. The light scent stays all day long and has a very light clean scent. When I first sprayed it on it was very reminiscent of Miss Cherie by Dior, but once it settled ( a few moments later) it became lighter. I reccommend this scent for those who are looking for something feminine yet not over bearing. This works well day or night!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragrance!!  It&#x27;s warm and spicy, I wish I could wear it all the time!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the scent an angel would have if she came in your window on a night you needed a hug.  Great shipping, price, and product!</li>
            <li> Love this smell! I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but I will definitely buy it until they stop making it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2015:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is my 2nd or 3rd time buying this product and the scent has changed...  I loved the original.  I don&#x27;t know if they changed the formula or something, but I want the old scent back.  Clearly the bottle has changed (refer to photo)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2016 update:&lt;br /&gt;I found out from a perfume store that this fragrance is discontinued..</li>
            <li> I  have used this parfum for several years and I love it.  This is the first time I ordered it thru Amazon.com.  I will NOT order it again through Amazon as the fragrance seems to be watered down.  It has the original scent, but its very light considering its parfum and not colonge.  Also, the scent seems to disapate after 30-40 minutes.  I suspect this might be a replica of the original.  Although the price is less than retail, I will not spend $70.00 for a replica.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance on my wife. It&#x27;s one of her favorite.</li>
            <li> The recipient of this gift asked specifically for this scent.  She was thrilled with the perfume and loved it.</li>
            <li> This has got to be one of my favorite scents! It works in summer or winter. Love it! It is definitely a parfum I would recommend. It mixes well with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> This was probably the quickest and simplest transaction EVER completed on Amazon!  My Ange Ou Demon Le Secret By Givenchy Parfum Spray smelled exactly as what I had tried @ Sephora. The only difference, a 1.7oz bottle @ Sephora is $77! I ordered a 3.4oz bottle, recieved it w/in 2-3 days and pd $57, I believe!! This Givenchy scent lasts throughout the day. It&#x27;s light and refreshing. Clean. Boasts, green tea, jasmine, white peony and white musks. I have found that most parfumes containing musks have a dirty, overpowering scent about them, and they give me headaches.  This Givenchy scent doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s more clean jasmine w/splashes of fruit when sprayed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this is a replica. 20 minutes, and it&#x27;s gone from your body.</li>
            <li> The picture shows a different bottle than the one I have. I am new to the world of fancy perfume, so it may be my fault. Upon further research, I found that the bottle I liked and had bought before was a floral version with the same name. Very confusing. And yes, the smell is different.</li>
            <li> I smelt this fragrance on someone while I was working.  I had to know what she was wearing!!   I absolutely love this perfume.  It grabbed me and my husband likes it too!  Very sweet and light smelling that you just can&#x27;t get enough of!</li>
            <li> The perfume was exactly the same that I have always purchased at department stores. Only difference - half the price!</li>
            <li> Most amazing smelling perfume ever! I can say that this scent singlehandedly sparked my perfume obsession. The smell is very different and intriguing!</li>
            <li> I am not sure it is original.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for years and love it. i always get compliments. very feminine without being too girly.</li>
            <li> Received a free sample swab at the Women&#x27;s Expo Show and happened to leave the swab on my counter.  The scent on the swab lasted at least three days determining this would be a long lasting scent--Love the way it smells after it settles in.</li>
            <li> This perfume just smells better and better the longer you have it on. By the end of the day I cant keep my nose off of my shirt lol The scent is there and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> For Christmas I received a perfume sample box from Sephora. When I smelled this I absolutely fell in loooove!! I still love it, but the ONLY problem with this scent it the fact that it does not last long at all. You literally have to spray it right before going in some place for people to notice it.  It&#x27;s definitely not overbearing even when you spray it right beforehand.  Delicious scent, not a long last. It&#x27;s woody almost a deep fruity scent right when you spray it on.</li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s signature perfume. She loves it so much I bought her two.</li>
            <li> Adore this smell. Perfect for the summer!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this item at such a great price and even more pleased that it would take just a few days to arrive. However, when the product arrived I found it contained two more surprises (a small Ange ou Demon Le Secret lotion and carrying case), which elevated this purchase all the more. I&#x27;m thrilled with this seller.</li>
            <li> Love this bottle and it was huge for a cheap price!</li>
            <li> this day was to remove the package. amazon sent me the wrong perfume. I pay by angel or demon givenchy and was received by marciano guess fragrance. which has a price difference of $ 40. try the return of the product and the system tells me that it is a dangerous substance and can not return, so I feel cheated.</li>
            <li> Product is great but company did not come thru on delivery date. Took an extra week then promised! A bit of a pain. Once I did get it I do enjoy the perfume.</li>
            <li> Something is just not right with this.  Fragrance lasts a few minutes.  Very disappointed.  I can&#x27;t help wonder if it is an imposter.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift(with very specific instructions). It was very well received, and the scent is rich without being overpowering. The fragrance holds a lovely level of intensity thru the day and night. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Smells great, sweet but not overpowering. If you like fresh and floral/fruity this is a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;Only wish the top of bottle stayed on better.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for a birthday gift and was very pleased because I had thought I had scored a great deal in comparison to the store.  Also, it being sold directly by Amazon provided me with a comfort level that we would not be receiving a FAKE product.  My wife has a little of her expensive bottle left over and the smell is MUCH sweeter.  This product has MUCH more of a perfume smell behind it... nowhere near the true quality... if you think you are buying the same product as you purchase from quality retails think again... lesson learned... and I&#x27;m trying to return it and amazon isn&#x27;t letting me because they are classifying it as a hazardous material, but yet they mailed it out to me.  Seems a bit sketchy there.... I WILL NEVER EVER BUY a fragrance from Amazon again!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife she has been using this Givenchy for a few years now and loves it. Great price and easy business!</li>
            <li> Had to order the right one after my big mistake when I ordered the wrong one.  This one is light and fresh and stays with you.</li>
            <li> Many times ago i looking some new parfum for my girl and sister.&lt;br /&gt;Now i take this :)Girl Equipment:)  twice&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for quick delivery and best price.</li>
            <li> Did not have the same scent to it as the one I bought at Ulta. It had more of an alcohol scent to it.</li>
            <li> Very good product as shown in the page for a very good price !! I recommend, and hope you enjoy like me !</li>
            <li> I like it and my wife love it but she will not go with something else and I believe it&#x27;s too strong maybe for work or going out it&#x27;s good for going out but not for and nights with husbands, I am sure you know. well I do not want to hurt my wifes feelings and always great smell for me!!</li>
            <li> I adore this scent. It is light and feminine, but not overly floral. Not only that, but by ordering through Amazon, I was able to purchase twice the size for half the price, as compared to my local (chain) beauty retailer. I disagree with the other posts that state that the scent wasn&#x27;t as good as it was when purchased through the store. I really think it is simply a light scent. I can definitely smell it on my clothes when I change at the end of the day. Might be worth sampling in store first though. As is true with any scent, you need to see how it reacts to your own chemical balance before committing.</li>
            <li> Patterns on the package are totally different from the picture, and the smell is different from my previous genuine one.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent ever! This is a great product and will make a great Christmas present for a woman in her 20&#x27;s! :)</li>
            <li> Very light and easy to wear.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it now for a year and love it.  On my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this scent! Literally costs HALF as much as if you were to get it at a department store such as *coff coff* Macy&#x27;s *coff coff*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great scent, quick shipping, good size bottle of perfume.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this fragrance. My wife loves it too, which is a plus. :)  It has turned into her new favorite.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter for Christmas.  Her nose ran across it at a major department store, but the price was ridiculous...so I turned to Amazon and found it for half the price.  This is the big bottle.  Shipping took longer than I expected, but still worth it.</li>
            <li> I wear this fragrance everyday to work. The scent is perfect and not over powering! Great for everyday use! I would continue to use this fragrance!</li>
            <li> I sampled this perfume in Sephora before ordering online with a b-day gift card. Very satisfied; lasts all day. It&#x27;s light, feminine, and fresh but with enough body to wear in the evening, as well. Amazon delivered three days before it&#x27;s estimated arrival so, that was awesome too.</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume for years with it always being my very favorite. However the last two bottles I ordered was a bit off in the smell department to me, after some research, I see that Givenchy has ever so slightly reformatted the formula, along with the bottle color. I personally can smell the change but so far everyone else says it smells the same on me. I&#x27;m not sure why Givenchy felt the need to change and I wish they would bring back the original. If the bottle is amber in color and not the clear with the white on front, then it is the newer formula, not necessarily a fake. I hope this helps anyone who may think they are getting cheated when ordering this. It drove me crazy for about a week, my favorite perfume wasn&#x27;t smelling like it was suppose too.</li>
            <li> I wish I had heeded the other reviewers who said this product is a fake, but hoping to save a fair bit of cash, I went ahead with the purchase anyway. While this product smells somewhat similar to the genuine Ange Ou Demon Le Secret, it&#x27;s definitely off, and it doesn&#x27;t last on skin or clothes for more than 5-10 minutes before disappearing completely. Just to make sure I wasn&#x27;t being paranoid, I went over to Ulta to compare with their tester -- a spray on each wrist unfortunately confirmed that the one I received from Amazon is a knockoff, and the counterfeit version&#x27;s smell was completely gone by the time I walked the ~2 blocks back to work (while I can still smell the genuine perfume on my other wrist several hours later.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Amazon -- I buy a lot of things from them. Unfortunately, perfume will no longer be one of them! Next time, I&#x27;ll shell out the extra money for the genuine thing from a department store. I recommend you do the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m prone to being a Givenchy fangirl, so I&#x27;ll keep it short. This scent is great, very woody - the times I can smell what seems to be cedar are divine - and it&#x27;s a perfect daytime scent. Very sexy without being too heavy or too strong.</li>
            <li> It DOES stay around for long.  I got the perfume sample on paper in my Macy&#x27;s catalogue and I loved the scent.  So I tried the perfume on my wrist and some got on my sleeve.  The sleeve still smells and it had been 7 days since I sprayed the perfume!  I&#x27;m not into perfume too much and my nose is very sensitive to any scenes.  I bought the perfume for my mom and she loved it.  So now I&#x27;m considering buying the product for myself.  This scent is very  feminine not overpowering.  I give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Additional info after using it for a while&lt;br /&gt; I did get this product on Amazon.  After using for a few times I&#x27;ve noticed I developed headaches as soon as I put it on.  I still love the smell but my head does not.  So I&#x27;ve stopped using it.  And now I&#x27;m giving it only 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I need more!!!! I loooovvveee this perfume!!!</li>
            <li> my shelf if full of the most famous brands of perfumes, so when I am giving you my opinion I am comparing it to many others that  I use.. This perfume is so feminine royal , really lovely, and the best this about it that it lasts till the next day. I got many compliments from people about this one more than any other kind !</li>
            <li> Wife loved it.  It was a very good buy.  Will be looking to purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> My favorite parfum. I love it. The fact that I was able to buy it on Amazon for less that in departments stores made me even happier.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume is very functional as well in both day and night. It has an air of mystery, a secret that many will want to find out!</li>
            <li> We all have different preferences as for what kind of scents we like,so I am sure some people won&#x27;t find it as awesome as I find it to be.I just loooove it!It so so light and little frutty without being too heavy like a walking fruit salad.And I always get questions from other people what kind of fragrance I am wearing.Awesome!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this scent during a Sephora visit and came home to add it to my wish list.  To my surprise, Amazon had it waaaaaay cheaper and it arrived ahead of schedule.  I put it on at 4 this afternoon when I got home and found it on the porch and at nearly 9pm its still there!  Light and feminine but not grody girlie!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been one of my favourite fragrances for a heck of a long time now - I love using it, it has nice, kind of sweet scent but it&#x27;s also perfect for the evening going outs. It&#x27;s long-lasting on me, even though I use it pretty frequently, I still smell it on me all day. On clothes, it stays even longer.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I decided to buy one for me and one for my friend. She loves it and so do I. We love the deal on amazon also! I used to buy it in the stores but it&#x27;s kind of a good deal on amazon and the scent is the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I bight my wife this perfume from Macy&#x27;s for $110. I brought it home and gave it to her for our anniversary. After price checking on Amazon I packed it back up and took it back to Macy&#x27;s wondering, &amp;#34;Did I really just pay that price?&amp;#34;. I have bought my wife many other perfumes that all smell wonderful, this perfume is another to add to the buy list. It has a nice and fresh citrus smell with hints of floral. I recommend this perfume for a nice gift for someone you love.</li>
            <li> I have no idea about parfums but this one seemed fancy and not expensive, and she liked it, so i guess that&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> Excelente calidad, se les recomienda 100%, llego en perfectas condiciones el pedido. Perfume original tal cual la descripci√≥n, sumamente conforme</li>
            <li> The perfume is great. It&#x27;s light and airy which was exactly what I was looking for, but I first tested it out in the store before purchasing.</li>
            <li> Product arrived exactly as described. Packaged very well. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Let me put it this way: I always keep 16 colognes in stock and the love of my life always keeps 10 perfumes in stock. I often purchase fine fragrances from around the world and online. I am a Givenchy fan and so is she. Givenchy has many wonderful fragrances. Givenchy is expensive and well known for its various amazing scents. This is one of those scents. This is a new fragrance and I was very hesitant to purchase it without smelling it on her to make sure it smells good on her. So I took a risk because it was by Givenchy. Well, it was a Christmas gift along with 3 other gifts and this become her favorite gift. She loved it. I held my breath until she actually put it on and she gave her blessing! This is the most amount of money that I have ever paid for a perfume online but I assure you that you can never find this perfume at department stores like Macy&#x27;s at this price. You can maybe find the item but you must pay at least 30 or 40 dollars more for it in stores. This item at this price can only be found in Amazon. You can&#x27;t lose with this one. It has a very mild, pleasant fresh scent of flowers but long lasting. It is not strong but it is so fresh like wild flowers scent in gardens. As a gardener by hobby and as a serious fragrance collector and lover, I approve this scent and I thumb up Givenchy for this new fragrance which eventually will be a classic item!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this fragrance!! This is my go to fragrance when I go out. It gives me an extra boost of confidence ;)</li>
            <li> LOVE IT AND I WILL BE ORDERING AGAIN, AND THE BOTTLE IS HUGE!!!!</li>
            <li> thank u was great product and great service</li>
            <li> I love this item.... My ex mother in law who I adore bought my daughter this perfume and WE both fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> One of my signature scents</li>
            <li> My original order was shipped &amp; received in excellent condition.  Upon using the perfume, I realized the fragrance did not last&lt;br /&gt;at all on my skin as well as on my clothing.  I called your customer service representative, who apologized &amp; immediately&lt;br /&gt;sent another.  The second bottle unfortunately was the same.  I just accepted the fact that it could be my chemistry,( although that did not explain the clothing)  She assured me it was not kept in the warehouse too long, but was shipped directly from the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;I had received a smaller size as a gift (1.7oz) &amp; loved the scent, &amp; expected the same result.  I asked a friend to try my perfume,  Her reaction was similar. (&amp;#34;it didn&#x27;t even last the hour&amp;#34;).  I appreciate your replacing the original order, &amp; realize they cannot be returned, but I will not order any fragrance from Amazon again.  The packaging is lovely, the service was great, but the perfume spray is like a watered down version of the Givenchy scent. I believe that your staff should investigate this product.  I certainly can&#x27;t understand what could have happened, twice.</li>
            <li> the price is good and smells very nice in europe it is so expensive but here good 1 2 3</li>
            <li> On-time and packaged well.</li>
            <li> I love it. From first day I tried it in store I wear this wonderful fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Perfume the same that is in the store, but for really cheap price!!!!</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when the stores didn&#x27;t carry this fragrance for so long. It has such a refreshing not-overpowering scent that it was a mandatory addition to my perfume collection. I was so happy that Amazon carried it and that too for 25 dollars less than the actual price ! Get it before it runs out !</li>
            <li> Wife loves this stuff. Got for Christmas gift and she wears this almost daily. I also got one of the other Givenchy fragrances for her collection.</li>
            <li> While trying to find Amarige, I cam across this scent and after wearing a sample for the evening fell in love with it. I ended up buying Amarige for evening and this one for day, although works well for evening scent as well. Love it!!</li>
            <li> My first time with this scent. very nice.</li>
            <li> THIS PERFUME IS NOT ORIGINAL IT&#x27;S LIKE WATER and the fragrance only lasts about 10 minutes. Well not buy again.</li>
            <li> I am a sales of Macy&#x27;s Fragrances department. I know exactly what this parfum note should be. It&#x27;s $99 in Macy&#x27;s,plus tax. We usually get 20% off., but still expensive. I love this parfum, will but it again at amazon.com.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommended this cologne a couple of years ago. I really love it, so this time I ordered a bigger bottle !</li>
            <li> THIS PERFUME IS NOT ORIGINAL IT&#x27;S LIKE WATER  and the fragrance only lasts about 10 minutes. Well not buy again.</li>
            <li> Receive lots of compliments on this scent. Doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I had a bottle of this that I used every drop of previously so I knew I&#x27;d love the scent. What I wasn&#x27;t expecting was this bottle is twice the size of the one I had before and half the price. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I discovered Ange Ou Demon Le Secret a couple of years ago and have loved it ever since.  People often ask what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing and comment on how much they like it.  It has a subtle  fragrance that is never overwhelming and is always appealingly  fresh . Amazon&#x27;s price is half of what I&#x27;ve paid in department stores.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances. Liked the price.</li>
            <li> This perfume doesn&#x27;t last. I think that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not popular. It smells really good though.</li>
            <li> my girlfriend faithful fan of Givenchy, she loved this fragrance, it was exactly what she expected, soft and elegant floral fragrance</li>
            <li> It is the original perfum. The scent is very nice. My wife just loves it.&lt;br /&gt;And the price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> Wife loved it .. I did too :-)</li>
            <li> This scent is so beautiful. I&#x27;d suggest it for spring and summer. Have received many compliments on it. One day I put it on in the morning and at 6:30pm I met my friend for coffee and she complimented me on it. She bought on herself!!</li>
