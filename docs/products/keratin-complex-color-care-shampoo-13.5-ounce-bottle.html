            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying how amazing amazon is.</li>
            <li>great product, it works fantastic, and its price is aceptable, i will buy another one.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has been a nice complement to my keratin treated hair.  </li>
            <li>I so liked it that I bought 4 bottles</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>so I mix it with another sulfate free shampoo and that seems to do the trick!</li>
            <li>I am using it, but will go back to the store bought for the best results.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;) I will buy this again.</li>
            <li>love the Keratin treatment and this helps its longevity.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I hope I can purchase more from you as I need it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with product after getting keratin treatment.</li>
            <li>The bottle was not secured shut when it was shipped and most of the contents had spilled out and all over the box by the time I opened it.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used another kind of sulfate free shampoo</li>
            <li>have used the shampoo before with great results and am very upset at this batch.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>I experienced this shampoo from my old salon.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a couple of years and my hair WAS healthy and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is reasonably priced, smells good and washes my hair well.</li>
            <li>The product was great as I have used it before, but for the price and shipping better to buy it at a local  store</li>
            <li>I, then, went back to the Coppola Keratin shampoo and I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Price was great, but not the same product bought at the store.</li>
            <li>I order this shampoo because it states that it is sulfate free, when I received it, it was not sulfate free.</li>
            <li>The first link describes hundreds of cases of healthy women going bald after using the Coppola products.</li>
            <li>Thanks for everythings :) .</li>
            <li>so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.</li>
            <li>It helps keep my color longer and has a nice soft scent.</li>
            <li>and I mean excellent!</li>
            <li>Great product - much less than what I would pay buying it at the salonr.</li>
            <li>The product I am happy with (I&#x27;ve only used it once so far) but the bottle was leaking when I received it..</li>
            <li>Nice shampoo but not personally buying again.</li>
            <li>It may be the right shampoo</li>
            <li>Why don&#x27;t you just let people right</li>
            <li>Now I need to find a new sulfate free shampoo.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found the shampoo doesn&#x27;t clean my hair as well as it use to when the Keratin was new.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many products and none have had lasting results.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>and this is the first time that the shampoo feels like</li>
            <li>has more water or maybe is not well mixed.</li>
            <li>It did exactly what it said it would do, however, after it ran out</li>
            <li>I totally forgot to order some more</li>
            <li>When I first had a Keratin Treatment I was using this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Compared it to the store it was extremly running, have to use more and my hair is very long.</li>
            <li>I really like it and has helped my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Regardless, I won&#x27;t be purchasing this shampoo or conditioner until I can get some straight answers.</li>
            <li>The consistency of this shampoo is much thinner and runnier than it should be.  </li>
            <li>This product is not the real coppola Keratin shampoo.</li>
            <li>Plus it is really runny and does not lather.</li>
            <li>I really want the real thing and will probably have to go to a salon.</li>
            <li>My hair color isn&#x27;t fading nearly as fast using this product.</li>
            <li>I noticed the product was very water/runny.  </li>
            <li>This particular bottle was stamped &amp;#34;July 2012,&amp;#34; so now I&#x27;m wondering if the formula has changed since then.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t return it back to the buyer because by the time I ship back and forth it would cost more than buying it at my hair dresser&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>yet so I have nothing to compare it to, however this seems decent to me.</li>
            <li>The most recent bottle I purchased is completely different.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>well, maybe a little bit after i had used a huge palmful &amp; rinsed 4 times!</li>
            <li>It gets a little bit better if I shake it before use it</li>
            <li>Normally is thicker.</li>
            <li>I just started using this shampoo along with the conditioner and so far I am liking the results!</li>
            <li>Why does Amazon list (under &amp;#34;Important Information&amp;#34;) this shampoo&#x27;s second and fifth ingredients as Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate and Ammonium Laureth Sulfate, yet advertise it as &amp;#34;sulfate free&amp;#34;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Now I end it up using more shampoo than usual every time I shower.</li>
            <li>They did exactly the same for a fraction of the cost of this.</li>
            <li>used the SHAMPOO for the first time last night.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be formulated somewhat differently than what I was purchasing in the store even though the bottle looked the same, so my hair didn&#x27;t get as clean nor feel as soft as before.  </li>
            <li>, I can not get this shampoo to lather unless I use large amounts, it then only lathers for a minute or two before it fades out.</li>
            <li>This shampoo makes your keratin last longer and my hair feels much healthier.</li>
            <li>One bottle of shampoo that I bought was so runny that it was completely unusable.</li>
            <li>Ive used it for years and generally love it, but this Product is seriously out of date.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My old bottle from the store has a regular date printed of produced in Dec 2012.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product and it was extremely watery, so I called and they sent a new one.</li>

            <li> I ordered this product and it was extremely watery, so I called and they sent a new one.</li>
            <li> as a result I not only lost a good chunk of expensive shampoo, other items in my mailbox got spoiled because the shampoo had leaked through the flimsy envelope it was packaged in and had damaged other envelopes.</li>
            <li> I use this product regularly and know what the consistency should be, and the vendor clearly watered down the product.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> It appears that the cap was opened and did not get put back on properly and almost half of the shampoo spilled out during shipment.  </li>
            <li> For the past two years, however, I have been purchasing the Coppola Keratin Complex shampoo and conditioner on Amazon and have been more than just a little concerned about the quality.</li>
            <li> I have read other post on this product and it is the same problems.</li>
            <li> Please see this link of Coppola knowingly putting customers at risk and the very same products  being recalled in other countries:  </li>
            <li> This Coppola Keratin Complex Color Care Shampoo left my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> have been getting professional salon Coppola Keratin smoothing treatments for the past four years and have faithfully been using the Coppola shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the replacement item was exactly the same thing.</li>
            <li> I blow dry and straighten my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Coppola Keratin Complex Color Care Shampoo and it clearly shows the correct product online</li>
            <li> It is as expected....</li>
            <li> This time, the product seemed diluted or just a different formulation... but my hair felt like a straw during and after using this shampoo, and the keratine treatment didn&#x27;t last even half of the time it usually does.</li>
            <li> every other way the delivery was as expected, on time with no delays.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other Coppola shampoos on amazon and did not have this problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey but cheaper than any other store.</li>
            <li> All of the other reviewers are correct in what they say.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed with this vendor.  </li>
            <li> I have used for a long time (had a few keratine treatments done).</li>
            <li> This shampoo did not wash out my hair color like some other shampoos do.</li>
            <li> This product is watered down.</li>
            <li> This product appeared to be watered down and not the typical product that I have used from this brand.</li>
            <li> but it is probably half shampoo and half water.</li>
            <li> I previously bought one from from the salon I use.  </li>
            <li> Two, it is a watery mess.</li>
            <li> I have previously tried it and, although I was fairly satisfied, decided to try the Brazilian Blowout shampoo, which proved to be a bad choice of replacement (more expensive and bad results).</li>
            <li> I feel like this leaves my hair a little greasier than I would like</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t get it to lather up even a little bit!  </li>
            <li> Additionally, the packaging has changed rather dramatically, so I&#x27;m not entirely sure</li>
            <li> Recently moved to another state and found the wrong salon.</li>
            <li> REAL STORIES OF WOMEN BALDING BECAUSE OF COPPOLA KERATIN PRODUCTS:  [...]  </li>
            <li> Use this shampoo for at least 3 years in combination with coppola conditioner.</li>
            <li> you will find the color lasts longer using both the Coppola Keratin Complex Care Shampoo and companion Condition.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled with that.  </li>

            <li> The worst thing is that since I&#x27;ve been purchasing through Amazon, my smoothing treatments are lasting half as long (nothing has changed except where I buy the shampoo and conditioner).&lt;br</li>

            <li> It is so thin it runs out of my hand before I can even get it to my hair.  </li>

            <li> Not at all happy I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for years and I do not remember it being watery, I can not get this shampoo to lather unless I use large amounts, it then only lathers for a minute or two before it fades out. Not happy</li>
            <li> It is as expected....</li>
            <li> Use this shampoo for at least 3 years in combination with coppola conditioner. excellent support for my keratin treated hair.</li>
            <li> The product I am happy with (I&#x27;ve only used it once so far) but the bottle was leaking when I received it..as a result I not only lost a good chunk of expensive shampoo, other items in my mailbox got spoiled because the shampoo had leaked through the flimsy envelope it was packaged in and had damaged other envelopes.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product. I have previously tried it and, although I was fairly satisfied, decided to try the Brazilian Blowout shampoo, which proved to be a bad choice of replacement (more expensive and bad results). I, then, went back to the Coppola Keratin shampoo and I am happy with my purchase. This shampoo is reasonably priced, smells good and washes my hair well. I like it!</li>
            <li> This shampoo has been a nice complement to my keratin treated hair.  I like that it has keratin in it which will help extend the treatment.  I feel like this leaves my hair a little greasier than I would like so I mix it with another sulfate free shampoo and that seems to do the trick!</li>
            <li> I just started using this shampoo along with the conditioner and so far I am liking the results! As I said with the conditioner, this shampoo does everything it claims. Softer and shinier, feel good to the touch hair. I am hoping these results will continue. I have tried many products and none have had lasting results. Hopefully my search stops here. I am so sick and tired of trying different products with unhappy results. So far, so good! The packaging of this item was excellent and I mean excellent!</li>
            <li> The product was great as I have used it before, but for the price and shipping better to buy it at a local  store</li>
            <li> great product and great service</li>
            <li> I used to use Pureology Nanoworks.......then I realized I was not financially inclined to be doing so! This stuff makes my thick/course/tangly/highlighted/dry end/oily roots hair manageable. Amen.</li>
            <li> I have the Keratin Straightening Treatment done regularly and my stylist uses this product line - so it is what is recommended for maintenance. It works great and the prices on Amazon are the best around!</li>
            <li> does not seem the same as the drug store version...</li>
            <li> Price was great, but not the same product bought at the store. Compared it to the store it was extremly running, have to use more and my hair is very long. I am using it, but will go back to the store bought for the best results.</li>
            <li> After completing an at home keratin treatment, this is the only product I will use on my hair! It&#x27;s a must have for Keratin treatments!</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying how amazing amazon is. I ordered this product and it was extremely watery, so I called and they sent a new one. Unfortunately the replacement item was exactly the same thing. Hopefully amazon will drop this product. I&#x27;ve purchased other Coppola shampoos on amazon and did not have this problem. I&#x27;m going back to the Global Kertain color shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great product - much less than what I would pay buying it at the salonr.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is just lovely! Perfect for my coloured hair, smells wonderful. &#x3D;) I will buy this again. A bigger bottle! ;)</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo with the conditioner. I love it! It&#x27;s pricey but cheaper than any other store. I really like it and has helped my hair. I use it along with Coppola Keratin serum.</li>
            <li> love the Keratin treatment and this helps its longevity.</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes your keratin last longer and my hair feels much healthier.</li>
            <li> Love it I hope I can purchase more from you as I need it.</li>
            <li> This product is watered down. It may be the right shampoo but it is probably half shampoo and half water.</li>
            <li> Why does Amazon list (under &amp;#34;Important Information&amp;#34;) this shampoo&#x27;s second and fifth ingredients as Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate and Ammonium Laureth Sulfate, yet advertise it as &amp;#34;sulfate free&amp;#34;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been getting professional salon Coppola Keratin smoothing treatments for the past four years and have faithfully been using the Coppola shampoo and conditioner. For the past two years, however, I have been purchasing the Coppola Keratin Complex shampoo and conditioner on Amazon and have been more than just a little concerned about the quality. One bottle of shampoo that I bought was so runny that it was completely unusable. Additionally, the packaging has changed rather dramatically, so I&#x27;m not entirely sure it&#x27;s a Coppola product. The worst thing is that since I&#x27;ve been purchasing through Amazon, my smoothing treatments are lasting half as long (nothing has changed except where I buy the shampoo and conditioner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just checked my bottle of the Smoothing Therapy Keratin Complex Color Care Shampoo and do not see any sulfates listed, although there is an olefin sulfonate, which is supposedly just as bad. This particular bottle was stamped &amp;#34;July 2012,&amp;#34; so now I&#x27;m wondering if the formula has changed since then. Or worse, have the products contained sulfates for a couple of years and the company is now being forced to disclose it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, I won&#x27;t be purchasing this shampoo or conditioner until I can get some straight answers.</li>
            <li> If you like lather, this is not the shampoo for you.  However, if you color your hair (especially wash in dyes) you will find the color lasts longer using both the Coppola Keratin Complex Care Shampoo and companion Condition.</li>
            <li> great product, it works fantastic, and its price is aceptable, i will buy another one. Thanks for everythings :) .</li>
            <li> Very safe for color treated hair and straightened hair.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> Loved the Coppola Keratin products that I bought from my hair dresser&#x27;s salon.  But the one ordered online had a different feel (feels like dish detergent).  It appears that the cap was opened and did not get put back on properly and almost half of the shampoo spilled out during shipment.  Didn&#x27;t return it back to the buyer because by the time I ship back and forth it would cost more than buying it at my hair dresser&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t get it to lather up even a little bit!  well, maybe a little bit after i had used a huge palmful &amp; rinsed 4 times!</li>
            <li> I get regular Coppola Keratin treatments done to my hair. I have used this product for a long time. What Amazon is selling is not what I am used to purchasing. One, there is no seal on the product. Every bottle of shampoo I have purchased has a seal (and the conditioner I purchased from Amazon did!). Two, it is a watery mess. This is not the texture it should be. I contacted Amazon and they were prompt to refund me fully. If you pay the money for Keratin treatments to your hair, DO NOT USE this product purchased or fulfilled from Amazon. All of the other reviewers are correct in what they say. I should have listened and not purchased this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years after a Keratin treatment. This was a great price and easy delivery!</li>
            <li> Satisfied with product after getting keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> Seems to be formulated somewhat differently than what I was purchasing in the store even though the bottle looked the same, so my hair didn&#x27;t get as clean nor feel as soft as before.  Not thrilled with that.  Wish I&#x27;d read the reviews of the product before I&#x27;d made the purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for a while now  and this is the first time that the shampoo feels like has more water or maybe is not well mixed. Normally is thicker. I felted a lot of difference because I was in the shower using the last part of another bottle and then opened this one to use it. It gets a little bit better if I shake it before use it but I think it doesn&#x27;t suppose to work that way. Now I end it up using more shampoo than usual every time I shower. It is still a good brand tho. Keratin is great for my hair!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed with this vendor.  The bottle was not secured shut when it was shipped and most of the contents had spilled out and all over the box by the time I opened it.  I use this product regularly and know what the consistency should be, and the vendor clearly watered down the product.  The consistency of this shampoo is much thinner and runnier than it should be.  I will never use this vendor again.</li>
            <li> The shampoo was great. Unfortunately some had leaked out due to the packaging. I recommend the product to anyone who woud like&lt;br /&gt;sleek hair</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used another kind of sulfate free shampoo yet so I have nothing to compare it to, however this seems decent to me.</li>
            <li> Great Price!For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.</li>
            <li> This Coppola Keratin Complex Color Care Shampoo left my hair soft and manageable.  i didn&#x27;t even have to use conditioner.  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This is normally a really good shampoo for keratin treated hair. This product appeared to be watered down and not the typical product that I have used from this brand. Supplier issue maybe?</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product after I had a keratin treatment on my hair.  It did exactly what it said it would do, however, after it ran out I totally forgot to order some more and I saw the Suave Keratin shampoo and conditioner in the supermarket.  They did exactly the same for a fraction of the cost of this.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo....great price for it!</li>
            <li> I experienced this shampoo from my old salon. Recently moved to another state and found the wrong salon. Total damaged my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo corrected all my damage.</li>
            <li> This product is not the real coppola Keratin shampoo. It was not sealed and smelled bad. Plus it is really runny and does not lather. I called customer service from Amazon and they were great. They refunded me the money. I have read other post on this product and it is the same problems. I really want the real thing and will probably have to go to a salon.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair in great condition. I blow dry and straighten my hair every other day. Highly recommend. My hairdresser suggested it.</li>
            <li> When I first had a Keratin Treatment I was using this shampoo and conditioner.  It&#x27;s been 6 months since my treatment and I&#x27;ve found the shampoo doesn&#x27;t clean my hair as well as it use to when the Keratin was new.  I will use again after another Kertain treatment, but not before then.</li>
            <li> Great product. My hair color isn&#x27;t fading nearly as fast using this product.</li>
            <li> I have used for a long time (had a few keratine treatments done). This time, the product seemed diluted or just a different formulation... but my hair felt like a straw during and after using this shampoo, and the keratine treatment didn&#x27;t last even half of the time it usually does. I stopped using it and switched brands.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Coppola Keratin Complex Color Care Shampoo and it clearly shows the correct product online but when it arrived it was a completely different product \\&quot;Smoothing Therapy Keratin Complex\\&quot;.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s even made by Coppola.  I am returning it tomorrow.</li>
            <li> I order this shampoo because it states that it is sulfate free, when I received it, it was not sulfate free. The bottle being shown is not what I received.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for awhile. It helps keep my color longer and has a nice soft scent.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend swears by this stuff, so I guess it&#x27;s good. I&#x27;m a guy, so...</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would help my hair feel silkier, maybe its just my hair/diet. Nice shampoo but not personally buying again.</li>
            <li> VERY UNHAPPY WITH this product.  Ive used it for years and generally love it, but this Product is seriously out of date.&lt;br /&gt;I used the SHAMPOO for the first time last night.  I noticed the product was very water/runny.  But put in my hair anyway.  Then I noticed that it had a foul odor to it.  I mean foul!&lt;br /&gt;I checked the bottom of container and noticed that it is Julian coded with beginning with 07 (Meaning produced in 2007!)  Shelf life printed on the bottle says 24 months.  That would indicate it went out of date 4 ½ years ago!  My old bottle from the store has a regular date printed of produced in Dec 2012. Be carful buying this product here.</li>
            <li> Item pictured is not item received  in addition to that the item cannot be returned&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;waste of money</li>
            <li> The product received is NOT COPPOLA branded.  It is probably a fake.  The bottle wasn&#x27;t sealed and leaked inside the box.  I am returning it.  Frustrated that I must take the time to pack and return.  Not paying for product or shipping!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they changed their formula, but it doesn&#x27;t foam and doesn&#x27;t rinse clean.&lt;br /&gt;I have used the shampoo before with great results and am very upset at this batch.  I so liked it that I bought 4 bottles and it turns out to be a bad batch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In every other way the delivery was as expected, on time with no delays.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years and my hair WAS healthy and smooth.  The most recent bottle I purchased is completely different.  It is so thin it runs out of my hand before I can even get it to my hair.  It smells different and behaves different.  My hair is not happy with this change and I will not buy it again.  Very disappointing.  Now I need to find a new sulfate free shampoo.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> A diluted version of what I&#x27;ve bought at the salon. Will not buy again from this seller on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love it!  I previously bought one from from the salon I use.  It was awful.  So watery, had to use a lot, and it had no suds. She said the formula had changed.  I hope I get the same shampoo next time I order which will, again, be online.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 6 years and it is excelent !!!!</li>
            <li> Please see the extensive proof cited below about how this company has knowingly put customers at risk.  The first link describes hundreds of cases of healthy women going bald after using the Coppola products. Please do  not purchase their product until you at least look at this link.    REAL STORIES OF WOMEN BALDING BECAUSE OF COPPOLA KERATIN PRODUCTS:  [...]  Please see this link of Coppola knowingly putting customers at risk and the very same products  being recalled in other countries:  [...]    Please see Coppola (AKA Copomon) cited for violation of OSHA guidelines:  [...]</li>
            <li> Great shampoo.  Conditions my hair, makes it shiny, feels good!  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Why don&#x27;t you just let people right and then thats it!!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo did not wash out my hair color like some other shampoos do. I like the shampoo, and I will buy it again.</li>
