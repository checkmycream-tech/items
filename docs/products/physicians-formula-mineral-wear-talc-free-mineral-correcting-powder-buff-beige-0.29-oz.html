            <li>BEST THING IN THE WORLD!!!!  </li>
            <li>hides everything wonderful</li>
            <li>Physicians Formula is excellent.</li>
            <li>Formula Mineral Wear Bronzer and the two together are perfect.</li>
            <li>LOVE!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair, and this is a medium, buildable coverage that matches perfectly to my almost &amp;#34;glow in the dark&amp;#34; skin.</li>
            <li>This powder helps her skin tone a great deal.</li>
            <li>This works great for evening out the skin tone</li>
            <li>Otherwise VERY nice product.</li>
            <li>Best ever thanks for coming up with something that work and is wonderful to the touch.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s cute, but it&#x27;s incredibly flimsy.  </li>
            <li>I loved Physician Formula products.  </li>
            <li>If you have relatively perfect skin, then this powder should be fine since it does lighten your skin if you need that and does have a nice consistency.</li>
            <li>I love Physicians Formula powder products!  </li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I love this brand of face powder!</li>
            <li>That said, I thought the the consistency was quite light and silky and great for withstanding sweat and oily skin.  </li>
            <li>thinking I was going to get an amazing finishing powder</li>
            <li>and it looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Use your own powder brush.</li>
            <li>I own this.  </li>
            <li>I had liked it</li>
            <li>It did not blend in and just kind of sat on top of my skin and did not look good at all.</li>
            <li>No longer do I have the dreaded make up line along my chin where you can see how yellow/orange some make up foundations are compared to my pale/pink skin tone, it blends in perfectly and covers really well</li>
            <li>This is by far the best powder I have ever used, it blends</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, silky, and does a good job of evening skin tone when worn over makeup or alone.  </li>
            <li>Good light powder for touchups during the day.  </li>
            <li>and now I am not so sure.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 2 stars because before the trip it was okay.  </li>
            <li>must buy&lt;br /&gt;in love ....</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t make me breakout at all, while most makeup gives me blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It makes an excellent finishing powder after I put on my regular foundation to get rid of the shine.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite powder.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I really love they do not test on animals.</li>
            <li>The packaging was surprisingly cute and easy to use</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin while my daughter, who is mixed race, has darker skin.</li>
            <li>The product works very well with fair skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it is overall a great powder.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product if you are looking for a natural product and have fair to light skin.</li>
            <li>The translucent shade of this product is PERFECT for people who have pale skin like I do.</li>
            <li>This is the third time I&#x27;ve purchased this product and I am very pleased with the shine free look</li>
            <li>creamy natural is only a hair more full-coverage than the translucent, and it seems to me that both are made for quite fair skin.  </li>
            <li>But even so, this stuff is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>this covered everything and left a nice glow.</li>
            <li>Perfect for settling under eye concealer and if you&#x27;re especially pale (like me), can be used as an all over face powder to set your foundation.</li>
            <li>Will continue to buy as long as they are available hopefully for many years to come.</li>
            <li>The product does a great job covering facial flaws especially redness.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what I&#x27;d hoped it would: reduce shine and minimize redness.</li>
            <li>My favorite must need in my daily make up</li>
            <li>I use a blush brush to dust it over my face to soak up oil throughout the day and it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the PF line for over 10 years, and this is the first product I tried.</li>
            <li>it gives me since sunscreen tends to be a bit greasy but an absolute MUST!</li>
            <li>I first heard of this powder in a magazine.  </li>
            <li>This is more grainy than their other pressed powders but its great for really really pale skin (translucent).</li>
            <li>It is slightly lighter and more &#x27;white&#x27; in colour compared to the Physicians Formula Super CC+ Powder in Light.</li>
            <li>Maybelline loose translucent powder is much better.</li>
            <li>I have tried DOZENS of different foundations and powders in the lightest shades available.</li>
            <li>I have VERY oily skin</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>Without this powder, you can really see a difference.</li>
            <li>I was really upset when Target and Walmart in my area stopped carrying PF products.</li>
            <li>It has no scent or shimmer; it&#x27;s matte but not so much that it imparts an unnatural look.  </li>
            <li>It stays on reasonably well and absorbs oil without being overly drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was definitely light enough for my skin, almost to a fault.</li>
            <li>I also found that it looked VERY powdery on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, and I prefer powders over liquids, so I thought I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li>The product is packaged nicely and has a small brush and compact mirror.</li>
            <li>You get a cute little brush and a mirror in the compact.  </li>
            <li>and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try to return it, but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll be able to.</li>
            <li>It does even your skin tone, but it does not blend in with your natural skin tone.</li>
            <li>It can be taken with you and small enough to fit in your purse or pocket.</li>
            <li>--- I guess, in the end, \\&quot;translucent\\&quot; still only goes so far on the color spectrum.  </li>
            <li>The product is lighter than I had expected it to be, but still works very well.</li>
            <li>So far it is the only powder I can use that</li>
            <li>The rainbow colored effect of the makeup is just for looks, when used it is a very, very pale cream/tan color, even if you don&#x27;t make any special effort to mix the colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I chose a light color and it is a TAD light, but not too bad.  </li>
            <li>This looks chalky at first, but don&#x27;t let that scare you off-- add a little bit of blush and let it set</li>
            <li>The different colors didn&#x27;t do much to correct whatever other color issues I have with my face.</li>
            <li>As an older woman, I have hormonal changes, blotchiness, and dark areas around my eyes.</li>

            <li> I would love to just be able to toss this in my purse, but the thin plastic latch that holds the compact lid shut has broken on every one of these I have ever purchased, usually within a short time.  </li>
            <li> Like the other brushes, I&#x27;d suggest staying far away from the applicator that comes with this.</li>
            <li> I just used for a couple of days and no more, it really didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Very flat pasty &amp;#34;unwell&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> powder has saved me, and I will be buying it for as long as it is made.</li>
            <li> very pale skin and powder normally turns my face orange.</li>
            <li> With the dozens of other powders I have tried, this is the only one that lasts all day!</li>
            <li> I use the Organic Mineral Correcting Powder instead of foundation after I apply sunscreen &amp; let it dry.</li>
            <li> (once I figured it out, it was rather mystifying) --- completely clear acrylic with a small compartment under the powder for the brush.  </li>
            <li> no matter how pink it is compared to the other shades in the same line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale and have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Its rough</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any helpful effect from the green, pink, and yellow.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, ridiculously pale white, then this is for you.</li>
            <li> I have extremely pale, cool toned skin and finding foundations that match me is difficult.</li>
            <li> Every other make up</li>
            <li> They each compliment the other.</li>
            <li> Also it cakes really badly even when I just put one light layer on.</li>
            <li> BUT, when I put this on over it all, it lightens my other foundations and I become my naturally white self :&#x27;) and not to mention the airbrushed look that is left behind!</li>
            <li> Slightly lighter than in the image shown, but it works well as a finishing powder.</li>
            <li> I found that I could only use it if my face was looking especially red that day, or else my face would look weird and washed out.</li>
            <li> I always have to get the lightest shade in any makeup I buy, and usually that shade is still too dark.</li>
            <li> It makes me look dead.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen lots of expensive expensive makeup lines try to copy this PF original product, and they do not work as well as this PF product.</li>
            <li> If you are a pale princess, you NEED this.</li>
            <li> but I look pale all day.</li>
            <li> So my skin is extremely pale.</li>
            <li> you aren&#x27;t as pale, you could always look in to using this as a highlight, too--</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pale powder and not translucent.</li>
            <li> They just mix to make a pale skin tone.</li>
            <li> I got another brush and am much happier, but of course my brush does not fit in the compact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loses a star for the bad quality brush.  </li>
            <li> I apply my liquid and powder foundation as I usually would (for flaw and blemish coverage), and have a tint of orange on my face as always.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my face is really red in patches</li>
            <li> That is usually my problem.  </li>
            <li> Usually I like the Physicians Formula products but not this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m officially obsessed and I&#x27;ve only been using this a week.</li>
            <li> I have purchased quite a few in the last few years and have never been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I order off of amazon because PF is a little too expensive for my taste for the drugstore.</li>
            <li> The packaging is pretty awful.  </li>
            <li> When it did settle into my skin, it accentuated whatever dry spots I had :(</li>
            <li> Overall, the color was awful for me.  </li>
            <li> It erases a lot of my redness (though it doesn&#x27;t cover nasty pimples by itself) and acts as a matte highlighter if I add a second layer in areas</li>
            <li> The brush it comes with is also HORRIBLE-- the wrong shape to be used with the powder, scratchy and hard and just not effective.  </li>
            <li> and it has bad coverage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally disappointed with this product.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> It does exactly what I&#x27;d hoped it would: reduce shine and minimize redness. The brush wastes too much powder, so I switched to a powder puff instead. I plan to purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is more grainy than their other pressed powders but its great for really really pale skin (translucent). Like the other brushes, I&#x27;d suggest staying far away from the applicator that comes with this. Its rough and it has bad coverage.Use your own powder brush.</li>
            <li> Overall, the color was awful for me.  Too white/pink for my fair/yellow skin --- I guess, in the end, \\&quot;translucent\\&quot; still only goes so far on the color spectrum.  That said, I thought the the consistency was quite light and silky and great for withstanding sweat and oily skin.  The packaging was surprisingly cute and easy to use (once I figured it out, it was rather mystifying) --- completely clear acrylic with a small compartment under the powder for the brush.  I&#x27;m not at all keen on rainbow colors but, strictly speaking, the brush did match the color scheme.  Also, the bristles were way softer than the brushes included in the Neutrogena powder.</li>
            <li> My favorite must need in my daily make up</li>
            <li> I own this.  I bought it in Walmart with a coupon for about $10.  Recently I went on a vacation and took this with me.  When I got home I realized that it had disintegrated to bits and pieces instead of the intact version I purchased.  I had liked it and now I am not so sure.  So beware, don&#x27;t take it on a trip/vacation because it is too unstable to do that.  I gave it 2 stars because before the trip it was okay.  Now it is almost unusable.</li>
            <li> No that I was expecting, my face still shine like grease on it.  I just used for a couple of days and no more, it really didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves this makeup</li>
            <li> BEST THING IN THE WORLD!!!!  hides everything wonderful must buy&lt;br /&gt;in love .... if i could mary it trust me i would</li>
            <li> Slightly lighter than in the image shown, but it works well as a finishing powder.</li>
            <li> I use this as my finishing powder and it&#x27;s terrific.  I purchased the Guerlain Meteorites finishing powder for $60 thinking I was going to get an amazing finishing powder - I returned it the day after purchase.  Physicians Formula is excellent.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, ridiculously pale white, then this is for you. I have tried DOZENS of different foundations and powders in the lightest shades available. And no matter what, I turn orange! But with this powder, I finally have my solution.&lt;br /&gt; I apply my liquid and powder foundation as I usually would (for flaw and blemish coverage), and have a tint of orange on my face as always. BUT, when I put this on over it all, it lightens my other foundations and I become my naturally white self :&#x27;) and not to mention the airbrushed look that is left behind! With the dozens of other powders I have tried, this is the only one that lasts all day! I have VERY oily skin so I may need to touch up after several hours, but I don&#x27;t think a girl with not-so-oily skin would have a problem. It also doesn&#x27;t make me breakout at all, while most makeup gives me blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;This powder has saved me, and I will be buying it for as long as it is made. I don&#x27;t plan on ever giving up my Snow White look!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it about a week and so far I really like it. I use a blush brush to dust it over my face to soak up oil throughout the day and it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best powder I have ever used, it blends really well you don&#x27;t even know you have it on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the PF line for over 10 years, and this is the first product I tried. I&#x27;ve seen lots of expensive expensive makeup lines try to copy this PF original product, and they do not work as well as this PF product. I have very fair skin while my daughter, who is mixed race, has darker skin. We both use this product underneath the PF mineral powder than matches our skin tone. As an older woman, I have hormonal changes, blotchiness, and dark areas around my eyes. This product works well for all these issues. Before this product, my daughter had to use three different colors of foundation on her face. This powder helps her skin tone a great deal. Without this powder, you can really see a difference. We wouldn&#x27;t go anywhere without this product. This is our &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; face rescue powder. The spf is an added benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS I was really upset when Target and Walmart in my area stopped carrying PF products. Amazon, you pulled through for me.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re fair-skinned, this is for you. It makes an excellent finishing powder after I put on my regular foundation to get rid of the shine. FAIR-SKINNED is the key word though.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite powder.  It&#x27;s light, silky, and does a good job of evening skin tone when worn over makeup or alone.  It has no scent or shimmer; it&#x27;s matte but not so much that it imparts an unnatural look.  You get a cute little brush and a mirror in the compact.  The rainbow colored effect of the makeup is just for looks, when used it is a very, very pale cream/tan color, even if you don&#x27;t make any special effort to mix the colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The creamy natural is only a hair more full-coverage than the translucent, and it seems to me that both are made for quite fair skin.  It works well as a primer or finishing powder, and can be worn alone.  It stays on reasonably well and absorbs oil without being overly drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why 4 stars and not 5?  The packaging is pretty awful.  Yes, it&#x27;s cute, but it&#x27;s incredibly flimsy.  I would love to just be able to toss this in my purse, but the thin plastic latch that holds the compact lid shut has broken on every one of these I have ever purchased, usually within a short time.  The brush it comes with is also HORRIBLE-- the wrong shape to be used with the powder, scratchy and hard and just not effective.  (I noticed a few people have said they did not get a very scratchy brush, so it may be that I am just unlucky.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still reccomend this product, but with a different brush, even a different brush from this brand!</li>
            <li> I use the Organic Mineral Correcting Powder instead of foundation after I apply sunscreen &amp; let it dry. This is the third time I&#x27;ve purchased this product and I am very pleased with the shine free look it gives me since sunscreen tends to be a bit greasy but an absolute MUST!</li>
            <li> LOVE!!! Seriously. I love it. If you are a pale princess, you NEED this. Perfect for settling under eye concealer and if you&#x27;re especially pale (like me), can be used as an all over face powder to set your foundation. Lasts all day - through walking in rain and snow and heat. You can&#x27;t beat this stuff! I order off of amazon because PF is a little too expensive for my taste for the drugstore. But even so, this stuff is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I bought this in Translucent color but I look pale all day. It does even your skin tone, but it does not blend in with your natural skin tone. They should change the color description.  Translucent  is misleading.</li>
            <li> It works. Even on aging skin. 😊</li>
            <li> I have extremely pale, cool toned skin and finding foundations that match me is difficult. This powder is a godsend! It erases a lot of my redness (though it doesn&#x27;t cover nasty pimples by itself) and acts as a matte highlighter if I add a second layer in areas I want to be lighter. It is slightly lighter and more &#x27;white&#x27; in colour compared to the Physicians Formula Super CC+ Powder in Light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair, and this is a medium, buildable coverage that matches perfectly to my almost &amp;#34;glow in the dark&amp;#34; skin.</li>
            <li> So my skin is extremely pale. I always have to get the lightest shade in any makeup I buy, and usually that shade is still too dark. Unfortunately, my face is really red in patches so I bought this in the translucent color to help that. Turns out this makeup is practically white! It was definitely light enough for my skin, almost to a fault. I found that I could only use it if my face was looking especially red that day, or else my face would look weird and washed out. The different colors didn&#x27;t do much to correct whatever other color issues I have with my face. I also found that it looked VERY powdery on my skin. It did not blend in and just kind of sat on top of my skin and did not look good at all. When it did settle into my skin, it accentuated whatever dry spots I had :( If you have relatively perfect skin, then this powder should be fine since it does lighten your skin if you need that and does have a nice consistency. If you&#x27;re not ghost white though, then get the darker color.</li>
            <li> The translucent shade of this product is PERFECT for people who have pale skin like I do. Every other make up I&#x27;ve tried has always looked orange or yellowy on my skin no matter how pink it is compared to the other shades in the same line. This looks chalky at first, but don&#x27;t let that scare you off-- add a little bit of blush and let it set and it looks amazing. No longer do I have the dreaded make up line along my chin where you can see how yellow/orange some make up foundations are compared to my pale/pink skin tone, it blends in perfectly and covers really well (I&#x27;ve literally reduced the amount of make up I wear by like 2/3 by switching to this instead of a liquid/powder combination.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you aren&#x27;t as pale, you could always look in to using this as a highlight, too-- otherwise, buy a shade darker than you think you might need.&lt;br /&gt;I hope they never discontinue this!</li>
            <li> Good light powder for touchups during the day.  I chose a light color and it is a TAD light, but not too bad.  Not too orange.  That is usually my problem.  I&#x27;d say it is overall a great powder.  My only gripe is the brush, which is made of COARSE bristles.  I got another brush and am much happier, but of course my brush does not fit in the compact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loses a star for the bad quality brush.  Otherwise VERY nice product.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this acts as well as primer.  It doesn&#x27;t but it does soften discolorations after you finish your foundation.  I loved Physician Formula products.  I really love they do not test on animals.</li>
            <li> It makes me look dead.  Very flat pasty &amp;#34;unwell&amp;#34;  look.  Usually I like the Physicians Formula products but not this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale and have sensitive skin. This works great for evening out the skin tone so i don&#x27;t have to wear liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I love Physicians Formula powder products!  I have purchased quite a few in the last few years and have never been disappointed.  The product does a great job covering facial flaws especially redness.  Will continue to buy as long as they are available hopefully for many years to come.</li>
            <li> Best ever thanks for coming up with something that work and is wonderful to the touch.</li>
            <li> I first heard of this powder in a magazine.  It was described as a BB cream in powder form.  I have very oily skin, and I prefer powders over liquids, so I thought I would give it a try.  I love it!  I have acne prone skin and some scarring and this covered everything and left a nice glow.</li>
            <li> The product is lighter than I had expected it to be, but still works very well. I use it will the Physicians Formula Mineral Wear Bronzer and the two together are perfect. They each compliment the other. I only had to apply the product once and it stayed throughout the day. The product is packaged nicely and has a small brush and compact mirror. It can be taken with you and small enough to fit in your purse or pocket. The product works very well with fair skin. I would recommend this product if you are looking for a natural product and have fair to light skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pale powder and not translucent. I didn&#x27;t see any helpful effect from the green, pink, and yellow. They just mix to make a pale skin tone. Also it cakes really badly even when I just put one light layer on. I&#x27;m going to try to return it, but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll be able to. I&#x27;m totally disappointed with this product. Maybelline loose translucent powder is much better.</li>
            <li> I love this brand of face powder! So far it is the only powder I can use that wont make my skin break out. Will definitely be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m officially obsessed and I&#x27;ve only been using this a week. I have very pale skin and powder normally turns my face orange. This makes my skin very white and hides all of the red!</li>
