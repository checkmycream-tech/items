    <ol>
            <li>It is great!!</li>
            <li>great for hands and chest area.</li>
            <li>Good find here on Amazon compared to the price in the physician&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I love love LOVE this product!!  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t order any more of it to use.</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>Some days seem better than others.  </li>
            <li>and I think it might have given better results.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Crepiness gone and color more uniform.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that really shows results over time.</li>
            <li>I think most importantly is to hydrate alot inside, and out.  </li>
            <li>My Dermatologist recommended this for use on my forearms and chest to help prevent fine lines and sun damaged skin.  </li>
            <li>but since I love Skinceuticals Hydraphase moisturizer I thought this would be worth a try.</li>
            <li>I was so excited with the results, that I used it up too soon.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves a silky feeling on the skin.</li>
            <li>I like this lotion because it is not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not crazy about this one.  </li>
            <li>It really worked!  </li>
            <li>I will keep using it to see if it works after several more weeks.</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li>Of course the lines aren&#x27;t gone, but they aren&#x27;t the first thing I see when I look in the mirror now</li>
            <li>This time I am being very conservative; putting only two squirts on my neck and rubbing it in with the backs of my hands (which are looking better also).  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping that it would help with the chest area, but there were no results.</li>
            <li>This stuff absolutely works and I will continue to purchase it.  </li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>Skinceuticals products that I have tried all seem to live up to the hype.  </li>
            <li>I am 69 years old and I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Just started using the product based on a recommendation from my skin care professional.</li>
            <li>So far I like the texture and scent of the lotion, which is applied twice daily.</li>
            <li>I read in a book at the doctor&#x27;s office that you are only as young as your neck looks.  </li>
            <li>After having had two surgeries on my neck in 1989 and 1992 ~ due to accidents, the cream is making the wrinkles disappear fast.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is a miracle for me! I have damaged &amp;#34;crepey&amp;#34; skin from tanning  (not from aging yet I&#x27;m 27) and I saw visible results after 2 days! It may have been easier to fix being from tanning but still other products didn&#x27;t work so I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> My Dermatologist recommended this for use on my forearms and chest to help prevent fine lines and sun damaged skin.  After a month I do see a difference and will continue to use it.  Skinceuticals products that I have tried all seem to live up to the hype.  Good find here on Amazon compared to the price in the physician&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Just started using the product based on a recommendation from my skin care professional. Buying on Amazon saved $20 off retail prices and delivery was within 2 days. So far I like the texture and scent of the lotion, which is applied twice daily. It absorbs quickly and leaves a silky feeling on the skin. Don&#x27;t know the long term benefits yet, but since I love Skinceuticals Hydraphase moisturizer I thought this would be worth a try.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream to address discoloration from sun damage on my neck, chest and hands.  I noticed immediate improvement, like within 24 hours of using the cream on my neck and chest.  Age spots are still visible on my hands, but i haven&#x27;t even had the product a week yet, so I&#x27;m still optimistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion because it is not greasy and absorbs quickly. I would buy it again if it weren&#x27;t so expensive and did more to improve my skin.</li>
            <li> I like their products but I&#x27;m not crazy about this one.  I won&#x27;t order any more of it to use.</li>
            <li> According to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;It repaired my skin in the regions where I had some problems.&lt;br /&gt;I will go on with it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> great for hands and chest area. Have only used a little bit but will continue</li>
            <li> I saw absolutely NO difference on any of the areas.  I was really hoping that it would help with the chest area, but there were no results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks (sagging skin in the throat and neck area) and not a huge difference but its okay.  Some days seem better than others.  Dont know if this is a win-all for me...I think most importantly is to hydrate alot inside, and out.  I tried a sample of the body texturizer and I think it might have given better results.</li>
            <li> Using this product has helped improve skin texture somewhat..</li>
            <li> This is my second tube of skinceuticals neck, chest and hand repair treatment.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 5 weeks and I love it.  I could see a difference after only 2 weeks, especially on my neck.  I read in a book at the doctor&#x27;s office that you are only as young as your neck looks.  After leaving the doctor&#x27;s office, I went to a shop that sold cosmetics, cleansers, etc., and asked the clerk if she had anything for a badly wrinkled neck.  She suggested this cream which cost $70.00.  It really worked!  I was so excited with the results, that I used it up too soon.  So when I saw it on Amazon for $39.00, I bought it.  This time I am being very conservative; putting only two squirts on my neck and rubbing it in with the backs of my hands (which are looking better also).  After having had two surgeries on my neck in 1989 and 1992 ~ due to accidents, the cream is making the wrinkles disappear fast.  I am 69 years old and I highly recommend it.  It is great!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks but it seems to be helping my neck look a little less &amp;#34;crepey&amp;#34;. I will keep using it to see if it works after several more weeks.</li>
            <li> This stuff works! I&#x27;ve been using it on my hands for about a month and have seen a dramatic improvement in the texture of my skin. Crepiness gone and color more uniform. I just bought my second bottle.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle.  This stuff absolutely works and I will continue to purchase it.  I use it on my neck, chest and hands.  Immediate results.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> The woman that does my facials took before and after pictures. This product really works. She&#x27;s a manager at a spa. She forwarded the pics to her contact at Skinceuticals. This is a great product that really shows results over time.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing! I used it as directed but nothing…no results!</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE this product!!  My neck has some bad horizontal lines in it, and after using this for only two weeks, I see a huge difference!!  Of course the lines aren&#x27;t gone, but they aren&#x27;t the first thing I see when I look in the mirror now</li>
            <li> After a few days of using this product I saw a difference in my hands.  It is unreal to say the least especially at my age.</li>
