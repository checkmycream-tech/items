    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect texture, it added the perfect amount of shine, and even added volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is the best way I have found to get even dispersion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you for providing this excellent experience.</li>
            <li>This product delivers on both counts beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased to say that this Texture lotion does the job perfectly, this product is truly the Übermensch of hair products in my book.</li>
            <li>/&gt;What makes this product great is that when it dries, it dries flexible and provides hold without having to stay \\&quot;glued\\&quot; together.  </li>
            <li>Truly a great</li>
            <li>Great product I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li>Plus, it smells great.  </li>
            <li>Good product and the price was great.</li>
            <li>It also seems to provide a good deal of moisture to hair, without being oily.  </li>
            <li>If it wasn&#x27;t for a good customer wanting this, I (myself) never would have paid this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found its a good idea to run your fingers through your hair to get that \\&quot;wet\\</li>
            <li>has a nice hold for your style without resulting in the \\&quot;helmet head\\</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very light, so doesn&#x27;t compete with your perfume.</li>
            <li>it was $17 or so plus tax (years ago), I am sure the MSRP is more now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I plan on using it for many more years.  </li>
            <li>None of that &amp;#34;wet concrete&amp;#34; look that so many gels give you.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I could not be more satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Does it get any better than this?</li>
            <li>I love saving money and not having to go to a store.</li>
            <li>USE IT EVERY DAY AND MY HAIR LOOKS BETTER.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s a pretty good trick.</li>
            <li>that &amp;#34;sculpted + molded&amp;#34; -- American Crew Light Hold Texture Lotion is the best.</li>
            <li>This American Crew light lotion was perfect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is truly a great product if you are looking for a natural hold that does not flake, get crispy or wear off.  </li>
            <li>Received my crew very quickly and as advertized.</li>
            <li>But she explained that I had really fine hair and needed something to help keep it in place.  </li>
            <li>price on Amazon is great at the moment, Last time I saw this product in stores</li>
            <li>too light and liquid poors out</li>
            <li>The hair isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;pasted down&amp;#34; although I thought it didn&#x27;t look as clean as if I used nothing to hold it in place but water.</li>
            <li>It smells good and only takes a drop to do the trick.</li>
            <li>and I know the true cost to make this product.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product at all, I am just still learning how to use it.  </li>
            <li>And my wife likes the mild scent, too...</li>
            <li>This product is nice it will work great for my hair for all occasions, my hair is thin</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product, as it has served my hair well for many years</li>
            <li>American Crew makes a great product for hair control that looks very natural.</li>
            <li>My hair is that of a gods, fine and silky, so I really needed a product that can help me mold and shape this godliness to what I desire.</li>
            <li>This is just right.</li>
            <li>She was right.  </li>
            <li>Just what I wanted, delivered right on time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great if you want a matte, natural look, as opposed to a super shiney, every hair in order slicked down look.  </li>
            <li>I only use a few drops after each shampoo and it holds wonderfully without looking like I have anything in my hair.  </li>
            <li>gave me exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>And if you want what I wanted from this product, (which is what it is meant for,) it is most definitely a 5 star all around.  </li>
            <li>It makes my husband and son smell like a man who wears way too much cologne -- you know, the ones you can smell coming before they get there!  </li>
            <li>Sure enough, it tames my hair.</li>
            <li>When the barber first offered this product to me, I thought it was one of those up-sell items.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to be able to have a little bit more control over my hair, to be able to put it in a style and have it loosely stay that way.  </li>
            <li>American Crew&#x27;s Light Hold Texture Lotion is that miracle product I&#x27;ve been looking for all these eyars.</li>
            <li>I rinse my hair with hot water and a comb, and it is soft as can be and ready for this product to make it perform as I want it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The magnificence of my hair is never more accentuated then when this quintessential product bathes my hair in spectacular radiance.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for giving your hair a slight wet look so I can quickly mold, style and add a few blasts of hair spray to hold in place.  </li>
            <li>Gels and pomades normally make my hair shiny and greasy.</li>
            <li>But the hair has to be super dry for it to do anything.</li>
            <li>Is it more dry, thick and frizzy than smooth, soft and luxurious?</li>
            <li>Using it prior to blow drying works as a nice way get the hair some volume and start styling it prior to the other products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a variety of plebeian products from pomade to light hairspray, all of which were simply mediocre or to strong to touch the beauty that is my hair.</li>
            <li>Although I imagine it will run out quick due to the amount needed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take much product either, my hair is nearly 2 inches all around and it only took a penny size dab.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The subtle fragrance is a nice extra.</li>
            <li>Thankfully it hasn&#x27;t made my hair crusty or hard or gelled as long as I use the appropriate amount</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and under a few different names, as American Crew has changed their marketing a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hair won&#x27;t stick up straight, but it has just enough hold to give it a little motion and life.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have dry, coarse Asian hair.</li>
            <li> Hair gels are too strong, and other texture products are too weak.</li>
            <li> which I would describe as not being flat and lifeless hair.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only minor drawback I see.</li>
            <li> I work it in when my hair is still fairly wet, then give it a short blow dry.</li>
            <li> &quot; look once the lotion is dry.  </li>
            <li> I apply it to wet hair, then blow dry.  </li>
            <li> thing I&#x27;ve experimented with is getting my hair VERY dry, and then using this product all by itself.</li>
            <li> It also made my son&#x27;s forhead break out with all these little bumps and a red rash.  </li>
            <li> If you use wet hair, it will dry slightly stiff, but when you \\&quot;break up\\&quot; your hair, it will retain the same shape (or whatever shape you want).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Naturally, ratings of this product are going to be based off of what people wanted or expected, not what it does.  </li>
            <li> It adds moisture and pliability to my normally rough and unmanageable hair without weighing it down and making it look like it&#x27;s been loaded up with product.</li>
            <li> &quot; that can occur with other product; you know the bullet proof crunchy hair that can occur with other!</li>
            <li> Gels are too firm or leave my hair wet looking.</li>
            <li> It gives it a little \\&quot;texture,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I need a product that smooths and adds just a little weight to my hair.  </li>
            <li> so it isnt too heavy.</li>
            <li> I use it with slightly damp hair, a small amount of product spread all over my palms by rubbing my hands together, and then running them through my hair.  </li>
            <li> We are going to chuck the bottle out if it isn&#x27;t too late to return it.</li>
            <li> Has a little less medicine smell than the shampoo but doesn&#x27;t do a bad job of keeping your hair in place.</li>
            <li> This product works very well in this regard, as it doesn&#x27;t leave anything nasty in your hair from day to day.  </li>
            <li> Go ahead buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I just noticed a package sitting on the table that my dad had left, and realized it was this lotion.  It&#x27;s 2:28 am and I decided I&#x27;m not waiting until tomorrow, I&#x27;ll use it now.&lt;br /&gt;It gave me exactly what I wanted.  I wanted to be able to have a little bit more control over my hair, to be able to put it in a style and have it loosely stay that way.  (This doesn&#x27;t have enough hold for \\&quot;up\\&quot; hair styles, so I&#x27;d go with something stronger if you&#x27;re looking for that.)  I also didn&#x27;t want it to look like it was overloaded with product- or to feel like it for that matter.  It&#x27;s the perfect texture, it added the perfect amount of shine, and even added volume.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take much product either, my hair is nearly 2 inches all around and it only took a penny size dab.&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, ratings of this product are going to be based off of what people wanted or expected, not what it does.  And if you want what I wanted from this product, (which is what it is meant for,) it is most definitely a 5 star all around.  Not a mistake.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and under a few different names, as American Crew has changed their marketing a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a disclaimer, I am a proponent of the \\&quot;no poo\\&quot; movement, which advocates minimal hair washing and allowing your natural hair oil to condition your hair as nature intended.  This product works very well in this regard, as it doesn&#x27;t leave anything nasty in your hair from day to day.  I rinse my hair with hot water and a comb, and it is soft as can be and ready for this product to make it perform as I want it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is truly a great product if you are looking for a natural hold that does not flake, get crispy or wear off.  I use it with slightly damp hair, a small amount of product spread all over my palms by rubbing my hands together, and then running them through my hair.  It is the best way I have found to get even dispersion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes this product great is that when it dries, it dries flexible and provides hold without having to stay \\&quot;glued\\&quot; together.  If you use wet hair, it will dry slightly stiff, but when you \\&quot;break up\\&quot; your hair, it will retain the same shape (or whatever shape you want).  It&#x27;s great if you want a matte, natural look, as opposed to a super shiney, every hair in order slicked down look.  It also seems to provide a good deal of moisture to hair, without being oily.  Truly a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on Amazon is great at the moment, Last time I saw this product in stores it was $17 or so plus tax (years ago), I am sure the MSRP is more now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product, as it has served my hair well for many years and I plan on using it for many more years.  I hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> too light and liquid poors out</li>
            <li> I have dry, coarse Asian hair. Gels and pomades normally make my hair shiny and greasy. American Crew&#x27;s Light Hold Texture Lotion is that miracle product I&#x27;ve been looking for all these eyars. It adds moisture and pliability to my normally rough and unmanageable hair without weighing it down and making it look like it&#x27;s been loaded up with product. The subtle fragrance is a nice extra. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> I use this product every time I wash my hair!  It&#x27;s not gummy or sticky.  My hair, holds a style, when I use it. I apply it to wet hair, then blow dry.  The fragrance is very light, so doesn&#x27;t compete with your perfume.</li>
            <li> This product is WAY overly fragranced.  It makes my husband and son smell like a man who wears way too much cologne -- you know, the ones you can smell coming before they get there!  It also made my son&#x27;s forhead break out with all these little bumps and a red rash.  We are going to chuck the bottle out if it isn&#x27;t too late to return it.</li>
            <li> Hair is like a fingerprint, we&#x27;re all different. Does your mop grow in &amp;#34;volume&amp;#34; not length? Is it more dry, thick and frizzy than smooth, soft and luxurious? Then this is the product for you. I&#x27;ve tried them all -- mousse (in the 90s), gels, creams, products that &amp;#34;sculpted + molded&amp;#34; -- American Crew Light Hold Texture Lotion is the best. None of that &amp;#34;wet concrete&amp;#34; look that so many gels give you. This stuff turns Will Ferrell into Leo DiCaprio -- and that&#x27;s a pretty good trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for probably the last 8 years. Perfect for giving your hair a slight wet look so I can quickly mold, style and add a few blasts of hair spray to hold in place.  No greasy or sticky feeling. Absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been working this through my hair prior to using the American Crew Pomade or Forming Cream. I work it in when my hair is still fairly wet, then give it a short blow dry. It gives it a little \\&quot;texture,\\&quot; which I would describe as not being flat and lifeless hair. Using it prior to blow drying works as a nice way get the hair some volume and start styling it prior to the other products. My hair is longer (3-4 inches now). When I had shorter hair (1-2 inches), this product wasn&#x27;t necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I&#x27;ve experimented with is getting my hair VERY dry, and then using this product all by itself. It gives a much different look than using the pomade or a wax. The hair won&#x27;t stick up straight, but it has just enough hold to give it a little motion and life. But the hair has to be super dry for it to do anything.</li>
            <li> Has a little less medicine smell than the shampoo but doesn&#x27;t do a bad job of keeping your hair in place. The hair isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;pasted down&amp;#34; although I thought it didn&#x27;t look as clean as if I used nothing to hold it in place but water.</li>
            <li> One of my female friends grabbed this and told me to try it. Sure enough, it tames my hair. Hair gels are too strong, and other texture products are too weak. This is just right. And please, no Goldilocks and The Three Bears jokes!!</li>
            <li> When the barber first offered this product to me, I thought it was one of those up-sell items.  But she explained that I had really fine hair and needed something to help keep it in place.  She was right.  This product does not matt my hair...I only use a few drops after each shampoo and it holds wonderfully without looking like I have anything in my hair.  And my wife likes the mild scent, too...so that&#x27;s a bonus.  Obviously I&#x27;m a fan because this is my 2nd bottle.  Lasts me almost a year.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to give some body to my hair; but I didn&#x27;t want gel. Gels are too firm or leave my hair wet looking. My hair is thin/fly-away type......This American Crew light lotion was perfect. It holds, give body, and makes my hair look thicker. It smells good and only takes a drop to do the trick. Great product I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> This product is nice it will work great for my hair for all occasions, my hair is thin so it isnt too heavy. Although I imagine it will run out quick due to the amount needed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on the weekend and it showed up on Monday morning - how dey do dat? I could not be more satisfied with this purchase. Thank you for providing this excellent experience.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted, delivered right on time. Does it get any better than this? I love saving money and not having to go to a store.</li>
            <li> This is a repeat purchase. American Crew makes a great product for hair control that looks very natural. Go ahead buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> WHat I like about this product is that is has a nice hold for your style without resulting in the \\&quot;helmet head\\&quot; that can occur with other product; you know the bullet proof crunchy hair that can occur with other!</li>
            <li> My hair is that of a gods, fine and silky, so I really needed a product that can help me mold and shape this godliness to what I desire. I&#x27;ve tried a variety of plebeian products from pomade to light hairspray, all of which were simply mediocre or to strong to touch the beauty that is my hair. I&#x27;m very pleased to say that this Texture lotion does the job perfectly, this product is truly the Übermensch of hair products in my book. The magnificence of my hair is never more accentuated then when this quintessential product bathes my hair in spectacular radiance.  10/10 would recommend.</li>
            <li> Way overpriced. If it wasn&#x27;t for a good customer wanting this, I (myself) never would have paid this. I am a hairdresser and I know the true cost to make this product. I actually will try to find him something else to use.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, wavy hair that has LOTS of volume and body.  I need a product that smooths and adds just a little weight to my hair.  This product delivers on both counts beautifully.  Plus, it smells great.  You apply to damp hair and then it \\&quot;dries\\&quot;.  I&#x27;ve found its a good idea to run your fingers through your hair to get that \\&quot;wet\\&quot; look once the lotion is dry.  That&#x27;s the only minor drawback I see.</li>
            <li> Good product and the price was great. Received my crew very quickly and as advertized.Even with S&amp;H charges, this item was cheaper than buying off the shelf.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my hair dresser and I&#x27;ve used ever since. Works well not greasy, but not offshelf product so I order on line.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product at all, I am just still learning how to use it.  Thankfully it hasn&#x27;t made my hair crusty or hard or gelled as long as I use the appropriate amount</li>
            <li> USE IT EVERY DAY AND MY HAIR LOOKS BETTER.</li>
