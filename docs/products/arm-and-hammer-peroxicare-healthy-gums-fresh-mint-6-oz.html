            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite brand of toothpaste</li>

            <li>What could be better?  </li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>which is what I now use and love.</li>
            <li>Like the toothpaste OK, but don&#x27;t like the aftertaste in my mouth.</li>
            <li>It does an excellent job and after my initial use I was pleased by the result.</li>
            <li>makes your mouth feel good and clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>This is probably the most important ingredient in any toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>More importantly for me, it also has no baking soda.  </li>
            <li>Excellent, I have a slight problem with gluten.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years with a high-end electric toothbrush, brushing with it twice daily and flossing at night - evidently the perfect combination.  </li>
            <li>want to thank the people who had sensitivity to this product and were brave enough to post a review.  </li>
            <li>cause I&#x27;m comfortable with the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come to depend on this intensity to feel comfortable post-brushing.</li>
            <li>Now that I wear the &#x27;invisible&#x27; style of aligners, it&#x27;s even more important that I keep my teeth meticulously clean to avoid the higher risk of cavities.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny that I was a loyal customer of PeroxiCare for so many years, and now I would steer anyone I know away from this product.  </li>
            <li>A word of caution if you have allergies be careful, otherwise a great product.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great product that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and I love the opportunity to buy it in bulk and not have to think about reprlenishing it frequently.</li>
            <li>This is the main ingredient that leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>After you get past the strong taste, it really does a good job.</li>
            <li>I find their use of natural mint oils to be refreshing and effective at cleaning out other flavors that can linger.</li>
            <li>I actually enjoyed brushing my teeth more, as odd as that may sound, because I felt like my teeth were actually getting clean.</li>
            <li>Since tartar formation requires at least 24 hours to begin, brushing 2-3 times a day with this toothpaste should greatly reduce tartar deposits.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll notice the difference the first time you use this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>So if you have allergies, be aware of your body&#x27;s tolerance of this product.</li>
            <li>my top front teeth actually stuck to my gum.</li>
            <li>Well, after using it for about a week, I first noticed that inside my lips, by my gums, seemed to be lacking sensation -- a bit numbish.  </li>
            <li>and when I first tried Arm &amp; Hammer (because my husband likes it)</li>
            <li>A very convenient way to get household essentials!</li>
            <li>I used this toothpaste for many years (5+), and recently changed to Sensodyne Pronamel.  </li>
            <li>We use less toothpaste and get great white results!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste for several years and about 2 years ago I noticed a huge change.  </li>
            <li>Either way, the idea that a toothpaste could cause so much pain in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Paste cleans very well, though.</li>
            <li>After years of peeling, my lips are still in quite rough shape, but hopefully they will continue to heal and become more &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; with time.  </li>
            <li>Any tartar that does form, should be minor and easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>No unnecessary flavors or coloring, keeps my teeth clean and white.  </li>
            <li>Of course, the active ingredient is sodium bicarbonate, better known as baking soda.  </li>
            <li>My gums are bright red and my tongue is a mess....</li>
            <li>I used to use mainly crest</li>
            <li>Although at first the baking soda texture is a bit chalky at first and has a different flavor compared to the normal minty toothpaste I grew up on, I find that it keeps my teeth whiter and cleaner feeling in between cleanings.</li>
            <li>I gave 4 stars because I believe the price is too high for the amount purchased.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I really thought that Arm &amp; Hammer Complete Care would be the cat&#x27;s meow -- baking soda,tartar control and peroxide.  </li>
            <li>And now I really dislike the taste of my old toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The corners of my mouth felt &amp;#34;burnt&amp;#34;; my lips also felt burnt; my mouth was very sensitive and my taste buds were gone.  </li>
            <li>I bought it last week in the US, I used it Thursday morning for the first time.</li>
            <li>Some people are sensitive to sodium lauryl sulfate, with it causing mouth burning or sores.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s toothpaste, and it&#x27;s exactly as marked.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to whiten my teeth nearly as often as well.</li>
            <li>Then today, while drinking some red wine, it really burned in those areas.  </li>
            <li>flavor is not lovely, but it&#x27;s easy to get used to.  </li>
            <li>The same high quality toothpaste I&#x27;ve been using for years now.  </li>
            <li>This is not the case with me, but it got me thinking about the extremely high baking soda content in this toothpaste (I believe it&#x27;s the highest on the market, which was initially why I bought it).  </li>
            <li>And honestly, he is very lackadaisical about how long he brushes his teeth.  </li>
            <li>That was at least ten years ago and his gums are much better without any treatment.  </li>
            <li>Several people in the reddit posting recommended Pronamel, since it&#x27;s one of the few toothpaste options available that doesn&#x27;t have sodium laurel sulphate, but still has fluoride.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember the last time I used other brands of toothpaste, such as Aim, Crest, Colgate, Aqua Fresh, etc.  </li>
            <li>After a few months of using the Pronamel toothpaste, my lips have become noticeably less chapped / irritated, and are starting to feel much better.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be going near Arm &amp; Hammer Complete Care (or any other Arm &amp; Hammer product) again.</li>

            <li> My gums are sensitive, I can hardly eat normal not that I taste anything</li>
            <li> I first bought Arm &amp; Hammer Peroxi-Care toothpaste in the late 1990s and have been using it ever since.  </li>
            <li> I had only used it for a couple of days when I noticed little bumps around the corners of my mouth and above my lips.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The toothpaste was just what I ordered and it arrived when expected.  </li>
            <li> Also, I have bumps on my tounge so its rough.</li>
            <li> it was minimal.</li>
            <li> Perhaps some people&#x27;s lips can handle this product, but not mine (again, I had no problems inside my mouth like some other reviews had, but my lips are in rough shape due to use of this product).  </li>
            <li> Baking soda can be very drying and irritating, but I never put two and two together previously, as to why my lips may be so chapped.  </li>
            <li> After JUST ONE USE, my teeth felt cleaner with this toothpaste than any other brand I have ever used in my life.  </li>
            <li> Two other ingredients, sodium fluoride and sodium lauryl sulfate, deserve comment.  </li>
            <li> I bought it on Amazon because i was here buying other things.</li>
            <li> I recently came across a reddit posting where people where explaining the problems they had with toothpaste containing sodium laurel sulphate (usually sores in the mouth).  </li>
            <li> Peroxi-Care is mint flavored, controls tartar, removes plaque, kills germs, supposedly whitens teeth (debatable), contains flouride, and is less abrasive than other toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, after reading about the various side effects as I can have bad reactions to certain products</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t find the Non-tartar control version of this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This product does whiten the teeth, but my side effects were not worth it.</li>
            <li> My lips are swollen, slightly cracked, and peeling -</li>
            <li> The paste itself is a little grainy, but doesn&#x27;t feel too abrasive.</li>
            <li> So I took an antihistamine and stopped using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> The issue I have is after a few days of use, my lips are swollen, there is peeling of skin and even after a week after discontinuation, my mouth is sore.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> My lips are completely raw with sores on the side of my mouth...</li>
            <li> Others have complained on here about how harsh Armond&#x27;s toothpaste flavors are.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It appears from the reviews that not every user suffers these side effects, but I would caution new users to introduce it slowly and stop if symptoms occur.</li>
            <li> Additionally, there is just enough Peroxide in the toothpaste to ward off those annoying gum infections that I used to get before I started to use it daily.  </li>
            <li> Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is a lathering agent commonly used in toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> It makes the lathering foam common to toothpastes.</li>
            <li> my lips were much less chapped (they chapped only when it got very cold in the winter).  </li>
            <li> but VERY uncomfortable, my teeth felt strange.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had such horribly chapped lips the past few years</li>
            <li> but the mere fact of opening my mouth and biting in something hard, sends agony thru my bones.  </li>
            <li> My tongue got swollen and very uncomfortable and heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rushing to rinse in less than a minute when Peroxicare, it&#x27;s just that bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry this toothpaste I have been in hell since Friday.</li>
            <li> My lips are itchy and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This is so unbelievable that they could put this product on store shelves!!!!  </li>
            <li> The treatment can be painful and is not cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Arm and Hammer Peroxicare baking soda and peroxide toothpaste has an added ingredient, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, that helps retard tartar formation on teeth.  </li>

            <li> After JUST ONE USE, my teeth felt cleaner with this toothpaste than any other brand I have ever used in my life.  Switch to this brand and I promise it will be the only one you will ever need.  Highest possible recommendation.</li>
            <li> Arm and Hammer Peroxicare baking soda and peroxide toothpaste has an added ingredient, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, that helps retard tartar formation on teeth.  Tetrasodium pyrophosphate interferes with tartar formation by inhibiting calcium deposition, discouraging tartar deposits.  Since tartar formation requires at least 24 hours to begin, brushing 2-3 times a day with this toothpaste should greatly reduce tartar deposits.  Any tartar that does form, should be minor and easy to remove.  Tetrasodium pyrophospate is an approved ingredient of the American Dental Association, so it works as advertized.      Arm and Hammer Peroxicare uses two whiteners: silica and baking soda, to effectively remove plaque and brighten teeth.  This toothpaste has a low abrasivity rating, so it will not scratch your enamel.      Two other ingredients, sodium fluoride and sodium lauryl sulfate, deserve comment.  This toothpaste has the recommended concentration of fluoride (in the form of sodium fluoride), which helps infuse the enamel and root surfaces with strengthening fluoride ion.  Fluoride incorporated into tooth surfaces are resistant to acid attacks by plaque, thus resistant to cavities.  This is probably the most important ingredient in any toothpaste.  Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is a lathering agent commonly used in toothpaste.  It makes the lathering foam common to toothpastes. Some people are sensitive to sodium lauryl sulfate, with it causing mouth burning or sores.  In those who develop mouth soreness after brushing, all toothpastes with sodium lauryl sulfate should be avoided.      konedog  (dentist)</li>

I can&#x27;t remember the last time I used other brands of toothpaste, such as Aim, Crest, Colgate, Aqua Fresh, etc.  Peroxi-Care is mint flavored, controls tartar, removes plaque, kills germs, supposedly whitens teeth (debatable), contains flouride, and is less abrasive than other toothpastes.  Of course, the active ingredient is sodium bicarbonate, better known as baking soda.  This is the main ingredient that leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean.  You&#x27;ll notice the difference the first time you use this toothpaste.  I predict you&#x27;ll ditch your current toothpaste for this one.    Overall, a great product that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price and I didn&#x27;t have to leave home to get it.  I love shopping this way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste for several years and about 2 years ago I noticed a huge change.  The corners of my mouth felt &amp;#34;burnt&amp;#34;; my lips also felt burnt; my mouth was very sensitive and my taste buds were gone.  At the time I had no idea it was the toothpaste.  I&#x27;ve read the reviews and I&#x27;m seeing people saying &amp;#34;it&#x27;s not the toothpaste it&#x27;s the fact that you&#x27;re allergic to the ingredients&amp;#34;.  Well, in that case it IS THE TOOTHPASTE.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not like you can take the tube out of the box and remove the harmful ingredients before you use it.  Some people need to know that you can use this for several years and then one day you may have a reaction to it.&lt;br /&gt;I want to thank the people who had sensitivity to this product and were brave enough to post a review.  It will help others realize it&#x27;s not an infection or a virus, it&#x27;s actually the toothpaste causing you discomfort.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like how Crest and Colgate were putting bits of junk in their toothpaste so I thought I&#x27;d go with something oldschool and boy was it a mistake. This toothpaste tastes like salt. I&#x27;m rushing to rinse in less than a minute when Peroxicare, it&#x27;s just that bad. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent, I have a slight problem with gluten. I have noticed that when I brush my teeth with this tooth paste it removes the discomfort in my mouth. I gave 4 stars because I believe the price is too high for the amount purchased.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s toothpaste, and it&#x27;s exactly as marked. There are multiple tubes of it.&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is only having one mouth of teeth to brush, I now need to figure out a way to store 4 tubes of Toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is an amazing deal and works great. Although at first the baking soda texture is a bit chalky at first and has a different flavor compared to the normal minty toothpaste I grew up on, I find that it keeps my teeth whiter and cleaner feeling in between cleanings. I don&#x27;t have to whiten my teeth nearly as often as well.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste was just what I ordered and it arrived when expected.  My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t find the Non-tartar control version of this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I received this promptly and have been using it. I love the price I was able to obtain this product for, and it is a very great deal.  I prefer to use this product cause I&#x27;m comfortable with the results.</li>
            <li> Guys this is toothpaste.  this is the same toothpaste i have used for years.  I bought it on Amazon because i was here buying other things.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste ever.  No unnecessary flavors or coloring, keeps my teeth clean and white.  Taste takes a while to get used to, but I&#x27;ll never go back to regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry this toothpaste I have been in hell since Friday. I bought it last week in the US, I used it Thursday morning for the first time. By Friday morning I had a reaction. My tongue got swollen and very uncomfortable and heavy. My taste buds were gone and around my mouth I broke out in a rash. The corner of my mouth was as it were, burnt. I think. I don&#x27;t know...but VERY uncomfortable, my teeth felt strange. I have a layer of skin in my mouth that seems to never ends and my tongue is white. Also, I have bumps on my tounge so its rough. I feel like an animal. My gums are sensitive, I can hardly eat normal not that I taste anything but the mere fact of opening my mouth and biting in something hard, sends agony thru my bones.  I didn&#x27;t go out the entire weekend because I felt looked at, although my friend told me no it was minimal. I could see it in the mirrow though. Either way, the idea that a toothpaste could cause so much pain in my mouth. I WILL NEVER EVER NEVER use this again. I am not unfamiliar with Arm&amp;Hammer, its my best paste the bakingsoda/mint. But this... NEVER ever again.</li>
            <li> Others have complained on here about how harsh Armond&#x27;s toothpaste flavors are. I find their use of natural mint oils to be refreshing and effective at cleaning out other flavors that can linger. I&#x27;ve come to depend on this intensity to feel comfortable post-brushing. The paste itself is a little grainy, but doesn&#x27;t feel too abrasive. I use this with a Sonicare and the combo works well--I think my teeth are brighter, even though that&#x27;s not how this stuff is marketed.</li>
            <li> My hygienist recommended the A&amp;H paste with baking soda and peroxide and this product does a superior job of cleaning and removing stains.</li>
            <li> My gums get agitated by whitening agents and so this is great toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t bother my gums.  I suggest to anyone that has that same problem.</li>
            <li> The same high quality toothpaste I&#x27;ve been using for years now.  I&#x27;ll probably keep using the stuff until it eventually gets discontinued.</li>
            <li> once about a time i bought these and all is o.k.  today .  now i can buy more  now i&#x27;m done</li>
            <li> I started using this tooth paste at my dental hygienists suggestion. It was great, my teeth felt well cleaned, but. I had only used it for a couple of days when I noticed little bumps around the corners of my mouth and above my lips.&lt;br /&gt;  Hives. . . So I took an antihistamine and stopped using it for a few days. After it cleared up I decided to try it again. The next day the hives were back. My lips are itchy and uncomfortable. So if you have allergies, be aware of your body&#x27;s tolerance of this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years with a high-end electric toothbrush, brushing with it twice daily and flossing at night - evidently the perfect combination.  My dentist loves that I use this product since my teeth are virtually plaque-free when I come in for my 6 month dental cleaning.  Additionally, there is just enough Peroxide in the toothpaste to ward off those annoying gum infections that I used to get before I started to use it daily.  Now that I wear the &#x27;invisible&#x27; style of aligners, it&#x27;s even more important that I keep my teeth meticulously clean to avoid the higher risk of cavities.  Can&#x27;t remember the last time I had a cavity!</li>
            <li> This product does whiten the teeth, but my side effects were not worth it. I used it daily about six weeks. My mouth feels like I have licked cardboard. My lips are swollen, slightly cracked, and peeling - as though I&#x27;ve had a fever. I am awaken at night with my top front teeth actually stuck to my gum. Sense of taste is diminished.&lt;br /&gt;It appears from the reviews that not every user suffers these side effects, but I would caution new users to introduce it slowly and stop if symptoms occur.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite brand of toothpaste and I love the opportunity to buy it in bulk and not have to think about reprlenishing it frequently.</li>
            <li> We love this product. We use less toothpaste and get great white results!</li>
            <li> I started using PeroxiCare toothpaste when our dentist told my husband that this toothpaste combined with using dental floss, an electric toothbrush, and Listerine standard mouthwash (or any approved by the ADA--like Kirkland from Costco) will discourage gum disease.  My husband was on the verge of having to have treatment for gum disease.  That was at least ten years ago and his gums are much better without any treatment.  And honestly, he is very lackadaisical about how long he brushes his teeth.  I have also been doing all these things and haven&#x27;t had any sign of gum disease and two of my younger sisters have.  The treatment can be painful and is not cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flavor is not lovely, but it&#x27;s easy to get used to.  A lot easier than Listerine which after all these years still shocks my mouth.</li>
            <li> Great product and packaging from the shipper</li>
            <li> I really thought that Arm &amp; Hammer Complete Care would be the cat&#x27;s meow -- baking soda,tartar control and peroxide.  What could be better?  Well, after using it for about a week, I first noticed that inside my lips, by my gums, seemed to be lacking sensation -- a bit numbish.  Then today, while drinking some red wine, it really burned in those areas.  On looking inside my mouth I saw that those area were red, as opposed to the rest of my mouth, which was pinkish.  I checked on the internet, and found a number of customer complaints about this toothpaste burning the inside of the mouth.  I won&#x27;t be going near Arm &amp; Hammer Complete Care (or any other Arm &amp; Hammer product) again.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  I have a failing bridge, but it handles the side affects well.......</li>
            <li> Reccomended by my dentist.  After you get past the strong taste, it really does a good job.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, after reading about the various side effects as I can have bad reactions to certain products but I went ahead and bought it and i&#x27;m  very glad I did, it has whitened my teeth to a level I haven&#x27;t seen before. I would highly recommend this toothpaste. A word of caution if you have allergies be careful, otherwise a great product.</li>
            <li> I used to use mainly crest and when I first tried Arm &amp; Hammer (because my husband likes it) I thought it tasted yucky and wasn&#x27;t a fan. However, at one point I was out of my toothpaste and used his A&amp;H for about a week and it grew on me. I also noticed that my mouth felt cleaner and stayed cleaner longer. I actually enjoyed brushing my teeth more, as odd as that may sound, because I felt like my teeth were actually getting clean. And now I really dislike the taste of my old toothpaste. One word of caution, though-- I tried A&amp;H &amp;#34;dental care&amp;#34;, the one that says maximum strength baking soda, and got a canker sore which seems like it may have been linked to that. I don&#x27;t have that issue with &amp;#34;peroxicare&amp;#34; which is what I now use and love.</li>
            <li> The best toothpaste out there at the best price.</li>
            <li> Like the toothpaste OK, but don&#x27;t like the aftertaste in my mouth. Paste cleans very well, though.</li>
            <li> Granted, this product performs well as an agent of dental hygiene. It does an excellent job and after my initial use I was pleased by the result. The issue I have is after a few days of use, my lips are swollen, there is peeling of skin and even after a week after discontinuation, my mouth is sore.&lt;br /&gt;This product has its benefits, but it is not for some people, and I guess I am one/</li>
            <li> makes your mouth feel good and clean and fresh. tastes good, lots of foam. this is the best toothpaste ever.</li>
            <li> A very convenient way to get household essentials!</li>
            <li> I used this toothpaste for many years (5+), and recently changed to Sensodyne Pronamel.  I&#x27;ve always had such horribly chapped lips the past few years (that now, thinking back, likely coincided with starting the use of this product), and recall that when I was younger my lips were much less chapped (they chapped only when it got very cold in the winter).  I recently came across a reddit posting where people where explaining the problems they had with toothpaste containing sodium laurel sulphate (usually sores in the mouth).  This is not the case with me, but it got me thinking about the extremely high baking soda content in this toothpaste (I believe it&#x27;s the highest on the market, which was initially why I bought it).  Baking soda can be very drying and irritating, but I never put two and two together previously, as to why my lips may be so chapped.  Several people in the reddit posting recommended Pronamel, since it&#x27;s one of the few toothpaste options available that doesn&#x27;t have sodium laurel sulphate, but still has fluoride.  More importantly for me, it also has no baking soda.  After a few months of using the Pronamel toothpaste, my lips have become noticeably less chapped / irritated, and are starting to feel much better.  After years of peeling, my lips are still in quite rough shape, but hopefully they will continue to heal and become more &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; with time.  It&#x27;s funny that I was a loyal customer of PeroxiCare for so many years, and now I would steer anyone I know away from this product.  Perhaps some people&#x27;s lips can handle this product, but not mine (again, I had no problems inside my mouth like some other reviews had, but my lips are in rough shape due to use of this product).  If you just started using this product, and find that your lips are getting increasingly chapped, please consider making a switch to another product that doesn&#x27;t contain baking soda.</li>
            <li> I used this Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste and my mouth feels like I put a lit match inside...my taste is gone and the burning is not subsiding since I used it on Saturday...My lips are completely raw with sores on the side of my mouth...My gums are bright red and my tongue is a mess....I called the company and they acted like I am the only one complaining...I told them to check the internet to see that their is no way I am buying that I am the only one complaining...So please if you have experienced this please call the number on the toothpaste...This is so unbelievable that they could put this product on store shelves!!!!  Please don&#x27;t let a child use this...I don&#x27;t know when I am going to finally get some relief...</li>
