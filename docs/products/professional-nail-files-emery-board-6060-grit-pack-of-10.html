            <li>Really a 100/100 or finer is best for acrylic nails.</li>

            <li>i think it works pretty good for pedicure scrub.</li>
            <li>as a cosmetologist its always good to have stock and be ready.</li>
            <li>Great deal for a lot of very coarse files.  </li>
            <li>So using the finer grain nail file will smooth the grooves out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very  quickly!I wouldn&#x27;t use them on my own fingernails.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s right!  </li>
            <li>I think this is too rough for finger nails, but GREAT for pedicures....</li>

            <li>the right size and grit, I use them on my heels, and my dogs nails.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a great alternative to you traditional nail file for reasons mentioned above.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what i want.</li>
            <li>boards absolutely do the trick!  </li>
            <li>I got ten of these and while I am able to use it feels like it breaks my nails</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I use these on my pitbull and they grind FAST !  </li>
            <li>These are exactly how they&#x27;re described- very large and very coarse!I use them to sand some of my woodworking projects.</li>
            <li>He still doesn&#x27;t like being filed, but it&#x27;s easier than a small file to work with, and the grit does a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li>Do I get a discount for posting this positive review ??  </li>
            <li>Very gritty and strong.</li>
            <li>The grit on the boards does not break off easy and maintains it overall integrity very well.  </li>
            <li>This works very well.</li>
            <li>would absolutely recommend them to pet owners and YES, people use them too...</li>
            <li>so much time filing, shaping, and buffing all of my nails.  </li>
            <li>files really are an all in one product.</li>
            <li>HAHA......</li>
            <li>They are very rigid in hand and plenty rough to remove long doggie toe nails, smooth off rooster beaks and toenails, without wearing out</li>
            <li>However, I really didn&#x27;t realize how gritty they were.  </li>
            <li>For problem nails (soft, brittle, cracking, lines) see a manicurist and learn how to care for nails over time.</li>
            <li>The boards themselves are made of a good durable and thick material so that even if you are being rough with the boards while using them they will NOT bend unless you forcefully try to bend them.  </li>
            <li>I use them to smooth off upper sharp beaks of Roosters and also after clipping bird toenails, I finish them off with these emery boards.  </li>
            <li>My nails grow fast and I am very tedious in making sure my nails stay a certain shape/length</li>
            <li>I certainly don&#x27;t think the grit is too rough for this job.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a more abrasive board(for callouses as well at tough nails), this is what you want.  </li>
            <li>Very coarse - use caution with natural nails.  </li>
            <li>Very course and rough.</li>
            <li>Need to smooth after since the grit is so thick.</li>
            <li>Stiff with just the right amount of flexibility.</li>
            <li>I only use them to file the ends of my nails but never ever on top because my nails are way to thin for that</li>
            <li>I use these to grind down my large dog&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li>I use it on my feet and it works very well to file the nails down.</li>

            <li> I use it on my feet and it works very well to file the nails down.</li>
            <li> I typically used them on the heels of my feet to slough dry skin, but these don&#x27;t hold up well, they are not stiff, but pliable and soft.  </li>
            <li> Now I have enough to last a long while.</li>
            <li> This fits the bill, and 10 of them should last me a very long time!</li>
            <li> These are very very gritty but with them being 60 grit I should have expected that.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for these for a long time.</li>
            <li> These would also be very beneficial for those who have thick fingernails or toenails.  </li>
            <li> I bought these for my Boston Terrier, so I could file down his toenails without the dangers of cutting/clipping and possibly going too far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, I have very tough callouses and cuticles from hard work, so I need something more abrasive on my fingers.  </li>
            <li> These are thin, I thought I had brought these before from Amazon, but this quality is very flimsy.</li>
            <li> I do have to use a finer grain nail file on my nails when it comes to shaping because these nail files will leave rough grooves and edges on my nails.  </li>
            <li> Her nails are harder to file</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them on my toenails - carefully - and they work well.</li>
            <li> This is what my foot doctor suggested to use for those rough heels.</li>
            <li> These are thick enough they don&#x27;t bend or snap like smaller files.  </li>
            <li> Way too rough for fingernails!</li>
            <li> I have used this to file down fake/gel nails, buff dry skin off my heels, and file my dog&#x27;s nails down.  </li>
            <li> Less time spent filing.</li>
            <li> You can file your nails down and/or file down calluses and dead/hard skin on your feet.  </li>
            <li> I use this to file down toenails rather than clip them because it is safer for me to do it this way.  </li>
            <li> I just &amp;#34;sand&amp;#34; &#x27;em down twice a week, and</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews on this product I figured I would give them a try because they were heavier grit than what I typically buy.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily recommend them for thin or brittle nails as these may damage them if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> have been looking long and hard for Professionaly Quality,</li>
            <li> to rough and hard to use.</li>
            <li> works well on nails but is quite hard and rough</li>
            <li> Let me just say that 5 - 6 hard grinds on my nails and</li>
            <li> she has a hard time sitting still.</li>
            <li> These are not for fingernails unless you got tough fingernails.  </li>
            <li> The grit on this is serious!</li>
            <li> get them, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is exactly what i want. as a cosmetologist its always good to have stock and be ready. I will recommend this product. i think it works pretty good for pedicure scrub.</li>
            <li> Great deal for a lot of very coarse files.  I use these to grind down my large dog&#x27;s nails. These are thick enough they don&#x27;t bend or snap like smaller files.  I don&#x27;t find that I need to use a finer file afterwards, but that&#x27;s my preference.</li>
            <li> Very coarse - use caution with natural nails.  Good for taking off gel layers/polish that won&#x27;t soak off.</li>
            <li> These are more like sand paper than for your nails. Way too rough for fingernails!</li>
            <li> I wanted it to file my Boston Terrier&#x27;s nails. This works very well. He still doesn&#x27;t like being filed, but it&#x27;s easier than a small file to work with, and the grit does a pretty good job.  I certainly don&#x27;t think the grit is too rough for this job.</li>
            <li> PERFECT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking long and hard for Professionaly Quality, well made emery boards that can be used on my pet toe nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THESE boards absolutely do the trick!  They are very rigid in hand and plenty rough to remove long doggie toe nails, smooth off rooster beaks and toenails, without wearing out fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s right!  I bought these for my Boston Terrier, so I could file down his toenails without the dangers of cutting/clipping and possibly going too far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also carry them in my poultry technician pouch.  I use them to smooth off upper sharp beaks of Roosters and also after clipping bird toenails, I finish them off with these emery boards.  You don&#x27;t have a lot of time to fool around when dealing with chickens, or doggies that don&#x27;t like having their feet &amp;#34;touched&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;60 grit is absolutely PERFECT, makes fast work of beaks and claws.  I recommend them for your cats also, in my opinion, way better than clipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend them to pet owners and YES, people use them too... but that&#x27;s not why I bought them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy... I don&#x27;t even hear my dog&#x27;s toenails on the kitchen floor anymore as he scampers through... get them, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> to rough and hard to use. I got ten of these and while I am able to use it feels like it breaks my nails everytime I do use.</li>
            <li> These nail files are the girttiest I have ever had.. I only use them to file the ends of my nails but never ever on top because my nails are way to thin for that</li>
            <li> Great for fast shortening of nail. Need to smooth after since the grit is so thick. Great for callus on feet and dog toe nails too. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> These are thin, I thought I had brought these before from Amazon, but this quality is very flimsy. they bend to the point of almost breaking.  I typically used them on the heels of my feet to slough dry skin, but these don&#x27;t hold up well, they are not stiff, but pliable and soft.  I will not re-order</li>
            <li> I purchased these with the intent of using them as nail files.  My nails grow fast and I am very tedious in making sure my nails stay a certain shape/length otherwise it will bug me.  However, I hated spending so much time filing, shaping, and buffing all of my nails.  After reading some of the reviews on this product I figured I would give them a try because they were heavier grit than what I typically buy.  Let me just say that 5 - 6 hard grinds on my nails and they are at my desired length.  These are very very gritty but with them being 60 grit I should have expected that.  However, I really didn&#x27;t realize how gritty they were.  I do have to use a finer grain nail file on my nails when it comes to shaping because these nail files will leave rough grooves and edges on my nails.  So using the finer grain nail file will smooth the grooves out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These files really are an all in one product. You can file your nails down and/or file down calluses and dead/hard skin on your feet.  The boards themselves are made of a good durable and thick material so that even if you are being rough with the boards while using them they will NOT bend unless you forcefully try to bend them.  These would also be very beneficial for those who have thick fingernails or toenails.  The grit on the boards does not break off easy and maintains it overall integrity very well.  Both sides have grit on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great alternative to you traditional nail file for reasons mentioned above.  I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily recommend them for thin or brittle nails as these may damage them if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> Very gritty and strong. Does the job! I use it on my feet and it works very well to file the nails down.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for heavy-duty emery boards, this is what you want.</li>
            <li> Wow love these files to remove acrylic nails. Less time spent filing. I have been looking for these for a long time. Had only one that I bought but could not remember where it was purchased. Now I have enough to last a long while.</li>
            <li> files are perfect. Didn&#x27;t realize they were so course. Can&#x27;t use them much, but they&#x27;re perfect for what they are.  Stiff with just the right amount of flexibility. Really a 100/100 or finer is best for acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> the right size and grit, I use them on my heels, and my dogs nails. Her nails are harder to file she has a hard time sitting still.</li>
            <li> works well on nails but is quite hard and rough</li>
            <li> Did not like the color</li>
            <li> They got strength and plenty of grit.  These are not for fingernails unless you got tough fingernails.  Good for scraping callous.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a more abrasive board(for callouses as well at tough nails), this is what you want.  I use this to file down toenails rather than clip them because it is safer for me to do it this way.  I just &amp;#34;sand&amp;#34; &#x27;em down twice a week, and they stay nice and short with no danger of cutting into my flesh.  Also, I have very tough callouses and cuticles from hard work, so I need something more abrasive on my fingers.  This fits the bill, and 10 of them should last me a very long time!</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, I was pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Very course and rough.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT, THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> If you are planning to use these for your fingernails, it is way too coarse. I&#x27;ve used them on my toenails - carefully - and they work well. I&#x27;ll also be able to use them on my dog&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li> I think this is too rough for finger nails, but GREAT for pedicures....</li>
            <li> Way too rough for natural nails, but these are a must for craft projects.</li>
            <li> I use these on my pitbull and they grind FAST !  I may order more.  Do I get a discount for posting this positive review ??  HAHA......</li>
            <li> I had hoped to get a finer grit. This is a heavy grit which could used for fast adjustment to nails of men, but may leave an irregular edge.&lt;br /&gt;I happened to go to a manicurist who advised a lesser grit. For problem nails (soft, brittle, cracking, lines) see a manicurist and learn how to care for nails over time.</li>
            <li> The size and grit level of these emery boards are perfect for keeping the skin on my heels nice and smooth. This is what my foot doctor suggested to use for those rough heels. They will also file your nails but a very gritty on both sides.</li>
            <li> These are exactly how they&#x27;re described- very large and very coarse!I use them to sand some of my woodworking projects.They are very effective in removing wood very  quickly!I wouldn&#x27;t use them on my own fingernails.</li>
            <li> The grit on this is serious! I have used this to file down fake/gel nails, buff dry skin off my heels, and file my dog&#x27;s nails down.  Like I said, the grit is amazing!  Great value.  Will recommend without hesitation.</li>
