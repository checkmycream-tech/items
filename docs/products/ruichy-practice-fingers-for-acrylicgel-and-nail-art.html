            <li> While the item arived promptly, it was frustraiting because the tracking number I was sent was not real and left me waiting by the door on pins and needles for it to arrive.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s normal or I have really small hands.</li>
            <li> Item arrived when expected fingers are flexible and hold pose</li>
            <li> is flesh tone nail sockets are narrow and deep</li>
            <li> It took a little longer than expected to arrive but it works.</li>
            <li> The nail bed is very flat and a little hard to apply nails...</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not really important to me because I just bought it to model rings on</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little flexible but its hard to get anything to stay in the nail beds</li>
            <li> It ended up coming a little after the date it said but at least I got it</li>
            <li> Others are saying how small this hand is</li>
            <li> It is flexible like I wanted and some people have small hands.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m so disappointed because i was actually looking forward to it .</li>
            <li> I needed it for state boards and had a difficult time finding an adhesive that would adhear to the hand to hold a set of nails on.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Just what we needed for my grandson&#x27;s science project.</li>
            <li> While the item arived promptly, it was frustraiting because the tracking number I was sent was not real and left me waiting by the door on pins and needles for it to arrive.  I needed it for state boards and had a difficult time finding an adhesive that would adhear to the hand to hold a set of nails on.  The picture was misleading in that is looks line the \\&quot;nail bed\\&quot; is designed to help a nail seat into it when that is not at all the case.  It is also discribed as \\&quot;flexible\\&quot; though that was not my experence.  While I found it frustraiting to work with and not what I thought I was getting, it did arrive quickly and served it&#x27;s purpose.  I don&#x27;t feel that the seller over charged or gave substandard customer service.  If I needed another hand for boards I would probubaly still order this one, but now I know I need to use \\&quot;Liquid Nails\\&quot; to attach nails to it.</li>
            <li> As advertised Is low end</li>
            <li> Others are saying how small this hand is but I placed it palm down on my own hand and it&#x27;s even bigger than mine. :) so it&#x27;s normal or I have really small hands. It&#x27;s a little flexible but its hard to get anything to stay in the nail beds but that&#x27;s not really important to me because I just bought it to model rings on</li>
            <li> when my sister doesn&#x27;t let me practice on her hand I&#x27;ve got this one to use</li>
            <li> It is ok for practicing especially if you are a beginner. Quality could be better, but for the price is ok.</li>
            <li> Perfect and I would order it again</li>
            <li> Has anyone tried this with tattoo gun?</li>
            <li> Really nice to work with it.</li>
            <li> The fingers flex, and both my girls age 7 and 13 love the hands (we had ordered 1 for each).  They paint and design the nails and then clean off is easy, and then they do it all over again.  The finger cuticles are pretty deep and we have had to use a Qtip to clean up underneath, but the advantage is that it seems to hold thick fake nails very nicely.  Highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> This was my first practice hand and it did what I needed it to do. You can&#x27;t beat it for the price</li>
            <li> We use it to display gloves, works great</li>
            <li> Item arrived when expected fingers are flexible and hold pose the palm is kind of puffy like a balloon color is flesh tone nail sockets are narrow and deep</li>
            <li> Good quality and literally got it with in a day love it so much. Recently got my nail technician license this is a great hand for display of designs.</li>
            <li> Very handy&lt;br /&gt;working  for nail salon</li>
            <li> Using this as an art model for drawing. Works good for the price.</li>
            <li> It was perfect for what I needed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome and flexible. Super fast delivery too! The only thing is it&#x27;s way smaller than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> It was cheap, but that was ok because only looking for a cheap prop.  took almost 30 days to ship.</li>
            <li> It took a little longer than expected to arrive but it works. I bought it for my wife since she likes doing nails.</li>
            <li> my daughter loves it...</li>

            <li> Overall this hand is good. It is flexible like I wanted and some people have small hands. The nail bed is very flat and a little hard to apply nails... Use lots of glue! Communication with the seller was GREAT. I needed this hand for my Cosmetology bored and they made sure I received it in time.</li>
            <li> The hand is small and flexible and an excellent model for nail practice. The fingernails on this model are small which I like since it will allow me to make more realistic sized nails.</li>

            <li> I used this for a science project at school that had something to do with nail polish. I can like move the fingers and stuff so that really helped and I glued fake nails on because I wanted to get the best results possible. If u put nail polish on it though, it&#x27;ll come off as soon as you put nail polish on it. But during shipping it like got lost kinda. It ended up coming a little after the date it said but at least I got it ya know? Pretty good experience</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness...top quality and just perfect....</li>
