    <ol>
            <li>This cuts beautifully!!  </li>
            <li>and it greatly facilitaztes avoiding ingrown toe nails.  </li>
            <li>A great buy</li>
            <li>The nipper is of a good size</li>
            <li>Otherwise seams to a good quality material.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They arrived on time and as described and the performance is exceptional.</li>
            <li>This a beautiful clipper and works very well.</li>
            <li>More &amp;#34;not touch&amp;#34;  than&amp;#34; touch&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>; I purchased 40 years ago are better.  </li>
            <li>Those thickend, discolored fugus toenails that grown thicker, more than longer.  </li>
            <li>Doesn’t appear to be a better choice</li>
            <li>They are very sharp, and curved perfectly,</li>
            <li>The old way of telling if any cutter is good, is to close the blades, and hold it up to a light source to see where the blades touch or not….  </li>
            <li>, that is, it&#x27;s a clean cut of the toe nail</li>
            <li>These nippers were exactly what I needed to clip my toenails!</li>
            <li>Well made with a smooth action that should insure a quick and smooth sooth cut,  wish they ere a bit sharper though.</li>
            <li>When I get a chance and find a vendor I intend to have these clippers professionally sharpened because it is obvious the factory did not do as good a sharpening job as I am used to.  </li>
            <li>Rusted after the first autoclaving.</li>
            <li>Most of those are made in Germany or from German companies with higher quality standards and costing hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li>Extremely satisfied will keep watch for similar items from you!  </li>
            <li>It works best if you cut a little at a time, not a whole nail</li>
            <li>would recommend them to anyone who wants nippers that work.</li>
            <li>You shouldn&#x27;t feel much at all.</li>
            <li>They are curved but you can also find straight cutters that might be easier to use on some nails.</li>
            <li>I really works well.</li>
            <li>Be careful to make sure you intend to cut whatever in jaws before you squeeze the handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The one redeeming feature though is the double action is a force magnifier making cuts easier than they otherwise would be.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t came anywhere near sharp, have to do on your own or ship back+hassle, ..  </li>
            <li>Mine are particularly stubborn, so without the foot bath, it would be foolish.</li>
            <li>When sharpened, these do a decent job.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think I should have to a do that for a new clipper.</li>
            <li>Heavy duty, but easy to handle</li>
            <li>My lack of stars are due to my finding that the edges are much duller then expected and it does not make a clean edges unless the blades are completely straight against the nail.</li>
            <li>Work a little at a time, then holding the blades shut and up to a light to see if it&#x27;s even.</li>
            <li>my old Revlon 4&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Very smooth, and took a lot less strength to cut than I expected.  </li>
            <li>It is especially effective cutting down</li>
            <li>are well built and are able to neatly trim my very thick toenails.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I do not have special needs (heavy nails or medical condition) but like quality tools.</li>
            <li>Look for &amp;#34;Straight Edge&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Straight jaw&amp;#34; Mycotic Nail Nipper Double Action Jaws, Barrel Spring.</li>
            <li>and I’ve tried the other large cutters on Amazon</li>
            <li>These clippers easily cut through my thick nails, as well as my regular nails.  </li>
            <li>Our household uses these, and very sharp, and the extra half inch length helps smaller hands use this with more leverage.  </li>
            <li>but you can try other tools that can fit the tight space.</li>

            <li> They are much too thick for a regular toenail clippers to deal with; however this product cut through them like butter.</li>
            <li> Had them a long time, and still working well.</li>
            <li> May not have retained its edge - hard to tell on old man’s diabetic nails.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic, but you do have to be careful of what you&#x27;re cutting or you may get skin (and resultant bleeding).</li>
            <li> used a round diamond jewelers file as well as a flat one</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s not as sharp as it should be.</li>
            <li> A sharp cutter will push the cut nail bits away from the toe</li>
            <li> There should be little or no light coming through the closed blades when you are done.</li>
            <li> If you have densely thickening toenails, just snip a little at a time, and these nippers will do the job.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Makes dealing with difficult nails simple.</li>
            <li> The blades are dull and the handles were not well finished.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Don&#x27;t use dull nippers.</li>
            <li> dull blades on these cutters can cause a noticeable kick-back when you cut a nail.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> I just never knew how bad my old nippers were until I got this one.</li>
            <li> No good.</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;First thing I did was put the grip parts of the handles onto a grinding wheel to lower the sharp parts on the handles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This thing cuts tough toenails without shattering them.</li>
            <li> and I would expect to use little force in cutting but substantial force</li>
            <li> Poor quality</li>
            <li> Would not cut even thin toenails.</li>
            <li> Too bad !!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Rusted after the first autoclaving. Poor quality</li>
            <li> It works well. It is especially effective cutting down t o the tip of the Nipper, that is, it&#x27;s a clean cut of the toe nail and it greatly facilitaztes avoiding ingrown toe nails.  I just never knew how bad my old nippers were until I got this one.</li>
            <li> The nipper is of a good size and I would expect to use little force in cutting but substantial force was needed.  I think it&#x27;s not as sharp as it should be.</li>
            <li> When I get a chance and find a vendor I intend to have these clippers professionally sharpened because it is obvious the factory did not do as good a sharpening job as I am used to.  The one redeeming feature though is the double action is a force magnifier making cuts easier than they otherwise would be.</li>
            <li> The Mycotic Toenail Nippers meet and exceed my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;They are well built and are able to neatly trim my very thick toenails.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend them to anyone who wants nippers that work.</li>
            <li> I do not have special needs (heavy nails or medical condition) but like quality tools. These clippers are well made, blades aligned, feels both sturdy and fits the hand well. My lack of stars are due to my finding that the edges are much duller then expected and it does not make a clean edges unless the blades are completely straight against the nail. I may have them sharpened but I don&#x27;t think I should have to a do that for a new clipper.</li>
            <li> The old way of telling if any cutter is good, is to close the blades, and hold it up to a light source to see where the blades touch or not….  More &amp;#34;not touch&amp;#34;  than&amp;#34; touch&amp;#34; on these.  Too bad !!</li>
            <li> My kids say that my toenails resemble the claws of a Dinosaur. They are much too thick for a regular toenail clippers to deal with; however this product cut through them like butter.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic, but you do have to be careful of what you&#x27;re cutting or you may get skin (and resultant bleeding). If you have densely thickening toenails, just snip a little at a time, and these nippers will do the job. Recommend that you always do a foot bath immediately prior to clipping to make toenails softer. Mine are particularly stubborn, so without the foot bath, it would be foolish.</li>
            <li> These are not as well made as the ones doctors use. Most of those are made in Germany or from German companies with higher quality standards and costing hundreds of dollars. Mine says Pakistan on it. The blades are dull and the handles were not well finished. Yours may be different. Mine were like nails digging into my hands. Very uncomfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;First thing I did was put the grip parts of the handles onto a grinding wheel to lower the sharp parts on the handles.&lt;br /&gt;That made it bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use dull nippers. A sharp cutter will push the cut nail bits away from the toe and you will feel nothing.&lt;br /&gt;But dull blades on these cutters can cause a noticeable kick-back when you cut a nail.&lt;br /&gt;They will push the nail bits AND push against your toenail possibly causing discomfort or pain.&lt;br /&gt;Especially if you have a sore toe or nail. It&#x27;s like someone hitting your toe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Test it on a fingernail or toenail and see if you can feel the cut. You shouldn&#x27;t feel much at all. It works best if you cut a little at a time, not a whole nail across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carefully sharpen the blade from the under side (opposite from the side pictured in the ad).&lt;br /&gt;Do not try to sharpen the side that faces the toenail!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a round diamond jewelers file as well as a flat one but you can try other tools that can fit the tight space. Work a little at a time, then holding the blades shut and up to a light to see if it&#x27;s even. There should be little or no light coming through the closed blades when you are done. Test it on a toe or fingernail. When sharpened, these do a decent job. They are curved but you can also find straight cutters that might be easier to use on some nails. Look for &amp;#34;Straight Edge&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Straight jaw&amp;#34; Mycotic Nail Nipper Double Action Jaws, Barrel Spring.</li>
            <li> Met all expectations.</li>
            <li> This a beautiful clipper and works very well.</li>
            <li> Our household uses these, and very sharp, and the extra half inch length helps smaller hands use this with more leverage.  Had them a long time, and still working well. Getting another pair for the motor home. Makes dealing with difficult nails simple.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty, but easy to handle</li>
            <li> This cuts beautifully!!  A great buy</li>
            <li> Well made bur won&#x27;t cut anything.  No good.</li>
            <li> Well made with a smooth action that should insure a quick and smooth sooth cut,  wish they ere a bit sharper though.</li>
            <li> Would not cut even thin toenails. What a waste of money. I even soaked my feet for two hours to soften nails and nothing! Junk.</li>
            <li> I figured these would breeze through my toenails of &amp;#34;iron&amp;#34;,not the case....my old Revlon 4&amp;#34; I purchased 40 years ago are better.  They do cut but not what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Extremely satisfied will keep watch for similar items from you!  These nippers were exactly what I needed to clip my toenails! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t came anywhere near sharp, have to do on your own or ship back+hassle, ..  Otherwise seams to a good quality material.</li>
            <li> This thing cuts tough toenails without shattering them. I really works well. Be careful to make sure you intend to cut whatever in jaws before you squeeze the handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They arrived on time and as described and the performance is exceptional.</li>
            <li> The word \\&quot;mycotic\\&quot; in the title caught my eye.  Those thickend, discolored fugus toenails that grown thicker, more than longer.  These clippers easily cut through my thick nails, as well as my regular nails.  Very smooth, and took a lot less strength to cut than I expected.  They are very sharp, and curved perfectly,</li>
            <li> Same design as my podiatrist uses. May not have retained its edge - hard to tell on old man’s diabetic nails. Doesn’t appear to be a better choice and I’ve tried the other large cutters on Amazon</li>
