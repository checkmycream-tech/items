            <li>Nice quality eye cream.</li>
            <li>I have to say, the texture of these creams is nice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many eye creams and this one is not on my list of good skin care products.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with this product and the cost is so inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Nice price.</li>
            <li>I purchased this eye cream based on the organic ingredients, excellent reviews, and reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, smooth cream - and a good buy for the price.  </li>
            <li>Simply the best and most effective eye cream ever.  </li>

            <li>I love everything about this product.  </li>
            <li>An okay product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure given more time they will improve even more.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this eye cream.</li>
            <li>It is moisturizing but not oily or greasy like so many others that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It always spills more than needed.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes, wears okay under make up.</li>
            <li>I have had it before and was satisfied with it, but I won&#x27;t be ordering it again.</li>
            <li>Stumbled on this product at an organic store and love it.  </li>
            <li>And the fact that it is organic just makes this eye cream that much better.</li>
            <li>Most of the fine lines under my eyes have deminished and my eyes look so much better.</li>
            <li>They work great with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>, I love that it&#x27;s light, easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes when I apply it</li>
            <li>Easily absorbant without being greasy, it has made a world of difference for me in both comfort and appearance.  </li>
            <li>and there isn&#x27;t a strong scent, I would buy again and thinking of getting this as a gift for my mom</li>
            <li>It absorbs well in the morning and works fine under my foundation.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t oily and the fragrance is light.</li>
            <li>Skin looks and feels healthy and fresh using this product, though.</li>
            <li>I tried many eye creams to help hydrate the skin around my eyes, and this is the only one that I have found that I was able to see results with overnight!  </li>
            <li>I am excited to see if does anything for the beginning signs of aging around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I will recommend this mostly to those who have much more mature skin.</li>
            <li>The eye cream is just the right consistency to absorb easily and quickly.</li>
            <li>(I am very oily) and the fragrances are not horrible.</li>
            <li>I love the whole line of product by Acure.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen any real improvement yet, but love the moisture and how it soften my skin without any buildup.</li>
            <li>I was hopeful, but wasn&#x27;t expecting to love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and absorbs right away.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t sting or burn my eye area and it soaks in quickly and is not greasy ....</li>
            <li>I put a small amount on in the morning and before bed, and I am good to go!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this eye cream, no scent for those with sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>just started using this, so far I love it</li>
            <li>I was so excited for this as I&#x27;d heard from others (in real life not just Amazon reviews)</li>
            <li>I feel really good about the ingredients in this and all Acure products and the money is well spent!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nothing special.</li>
            <li>This is a nice eye cream - you don&#x27;t need much and it absorbs instantly.</li>
            <li>Fast ship!</li>
            <li>The first day I tried it and my eyes started to burn.</li>
            <li>I use a good amount and let is absorb within a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the results, especially considering that I was somewhat apprehensive as to how well these natural (less touted) ingredients would work.</li>
            <li>Within 3 days there was a very noticeable difference in how &amp;#34;awake&amp;#34; my eyes looked - brighter, less sunken in, and more supple and smooth.</li>
            <li>though acure eye cream is not expensive, it is very good.&lt;br /&gt;also</li>
            <li>I first came across the Acure line at Whole Foods, so</li>
            <li>I recently switched my daily face cleanser to Acure and loved it so much that I thought I would also try their eye cream.</li>
            <li>No dramatic change - or really any change at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t notice much of a smell from it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This eye cream is very moisturizing &amp; brightens the eye area.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, my skin cleared up within several hours, and the product didn&#x27;t cause a long-lasting breakout.</li>
            <li>and this really helps the skin under my eyes.</li>
            <li>and I think the one person was using too much</li>
            <li>i really like it purchased the day and night moisturiser</li>
            <li>It helps reduce puffiness and dark circles, though I&#x27;m sure not as much as products specifically made for those issues would.  </li>
            <li>I tend to put this on before I go to sleep when I&#x27;m up for how many hours doing work, I&#x27;ll get dark circles and then kinda red-puffy eyes when I wake up, but when I use this they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed any decrease in fine lines or dark circles after using up the tube.</li>
            <li>However it does nothing for the fine lines, pufiness or dark circles.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I saw dramatic improvements, but this is probably because my skin is in rather good condition after years of using high-quality organic products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very young.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Goes on easily, absorbs quickly, NO stinging or irritation!</li>
            <li>It soaks in quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy, only a tiny bit of product is needed.   </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any physical difference since I&#x27;ve started using this, but it does help make concealer much MUCH easier to apply.</li>
            <li>I am 28 years old and have been using this for a couple months.  </li>
            <li>Yet eye creams theoretically are supposed to be so gentle, that you can use them anywhere on your face without any problem.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product nearly daily for about 5 months now, and really like it.</li>
            <li>So far I like this eye cream...</li>
            <li>I appreciate that it&#x27;s a natural skin care product, but it just doesn&#x27;t work the way an eye cream should.</li>
            <li>I have been pleasantly surprised by the results in just two weeks.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m sensitive to a particular essential oil in the formula or what the problem is.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, especially  for mature skin.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t do much besides hydrate a little.</li>
            <li>I have hereditary dark circles, and no product can ever eliminate them, but this product makes them less noticeable for sure.</li>
            <li>Smell is not really noticeable and it blends in really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using all of the dept store products (Lancome, Estee Lauder, Bare Escentials, Clinique, etc.)</li>
            <li>Now I need to use extensively vitamin e oil to have my skin got back to normal.</li>
            <li>(my undereye area is dry) but doesn&#x27;t do much else that a regular face cream wouldn&#x27;t.   </li>
            <li>I am 41 with very oily skin and pretty bad fine lines under and around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for a little under a year and the fine lines around my eyes are less noticeable.</li>

            <li> (my undereye area is dry) but doesn&#x27;t do much else that a regular face cream wouldn&#x27;t.   </li>
            <li> I am 41 with very oily skin and pretty bad fine lines under and around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a little under a year and the fine lines around my eyes are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> good product, but a little bit expensive than other websites.</li>
            <li> as well my skin feels soft and supple and a little firmer.</li>
            <li> Because it is so creamy, it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> If I use this cream on other areas of my face, my skin will become red, blotchy, and irritated.  </li>
            <li> Although this product is designed as an eye cream, I&#x27;m hesitant to use it at all if it causes skin irritation on other parts of my facial skin and am planning on returning this product.  </li>
            <li> Also, one tube of this goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 38, with dry skin</li>
            <li> I had been paying $100 for a single eye cream that didn&#x27;t work and often burned.</li>
            <li> 1 week in and the dark circles are starting to fade also.</li>
            <li> My skin started feeling very dry since I started using it.</li>
            <li> have tried other vegan eye creams that have worked a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizing but takes too long to absorb.</li>
            <li> Within a few minutes after applying this cream, my eye lids were red and burning.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> and it is the only product that has made inroads against years of serious frown lines at the inner corners of my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it, especially if you&#x27;re tired of spending big dollars for a little tiny jar of name-brand eye creams.  </li>
            <li> Be warned a tiny bit goes a long way, it is a little bit thinner than eye creams I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> &quot; I&#x27;ve never noticed that statement on my other eye creams, so</li>
            <li> And the other lady might have used it too close to her eyes or is maybe allergic to one of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Other than that, eh.</li>
            <li> It is not moisturizing enough and it leaves a whitish residue around the corners of my eyes that is very uncomfortable (it feels like how your eyes feel when you first wake up if you have \\&quot;sleep\\&quot; in them).</li>
            <li> I am 27 years old and have been noticing my eye area starting to look very tired, sunken in and worsening dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li> I was prepared for a miracle here, but there is something in this and a few of the other Acure products I tried.</li>
            <li> i have used expensive and high quality eye cream so far.&lt;br /&gt;even</li>
            <li> No more tight feeling of eyelid skin</li>
            <li> On top of that the bottle is terrible to get the cream out.</li>
            <li> I can usually apply my under eye concealer within minutes of application.</li>
            <li> My eyes look less tired when I use this in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I discovered this after it was too late to return the product.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this eye cream hands down over any of the expensive department store brands I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t Work for Me, unfortunately  I like Acure products, but this one didn&#x27;t do anything for me except irritate my eyes a little.  </li>
            <li> This is not a good eye cream.</li>
            <li> It is not a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I would never dream of putting this on under concealer because the white \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; that it leaves behind would make my concealer look bad.</li>
            <li> So irritating...</li>
            <li> Tried again the next day and they itched terribly, which I again blamed on makeup, i so wanted this to work.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Absolutely love this eye cream, no scent for those with sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> Fast ship! Goes on easily, absorbs quickly, NO stinging or irritation!</li>
            <li> This is a nice eye cream - you don&#x27;t need much and it absorbs instantly. Isn&#x27;t oily and the fragrance is light. Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any physical difference since I&#x27;ve started using this, but it does help make concealer much MUCH easier to apply. The package states to avoid getting into your eyes and states that if you do get into your eyes, to \\&quot;wash your eyes for 15 minutes.\\&quot; I&#x27;ve never noticed that statement on my other eye creams, so something in this product must cause a lot of eye irritation. I probably wouldn&#x27;t use too close to your eyes or lids as a result. In any event, it&#x27;s a nice soothing cream, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect any miracles. Then again, I&#x27;ve never found an eye cream that ever lived up to its age-reversing claims, so there you have it. Perfect if for use prior to your concealer.</li>
            <li> This is a nice eye cream. It doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes and I wear contacts. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or oily. I do wish it came in a glass container though. It&#x27;s a good size for an eye cream bottle and I don&#x27;t notice much of a smell from it.</li>
            <li> I am 28 years old and have been using this for a couple months.  I love everything about this product.  It helps reduce puffiness and dark circles, though I&#x27;m sure not as much as products specifically made for those issues would.  It goes on smooth and absorbs right away.  My eyes look less tired when I use this in the morning.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Nice quality eye cream. I use it at night and it&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Simply the best and most effective eye cream ever.  Easily absorbant without being greasy, it has made a world of difference for me in both comfort and appearance.  No more tight feeling of eyelid skin and it is the only product that has made inroads against years of serious frown lines at the inner corners of my eyes.  If there was only one beauty aid I could have, this would be it.</li>
            <li> An okay product. Hydrates well (my undereye area is dry) but doesn&#x27;t do much else that a regular face cream wouldn&#x27;t.   It soaks in quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy, only a tiny bit of product is needed.   Haven&#x27;t noticed any decrease in fine lines or dark circles after using up the tube. I don&#x27;t think I would repurchase.</li>
            <li> i have used expensive and high quality eye cream so far.&lt;br /&gt;even though acure eye cream is not expensive, it is very good.&lt;br /&gt;also its ingredient is excellent.</li>
            <li> Really happy with this lotion.  Be warned a tiny bit goes a long way, it is a little bit thinner than eye creams I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> good product, but a little bit expensive than other websites.</li>
            <li> Today is the 1-week mark of using this eye cream. I am 27 years old and have been noticing my eye area starting to look very tired, sunken in and worsening dark under eye circles. I recently switched my daily face cleanser to Acure and loved it so much that I thought I would also try their eye cream. WOW! Within 3 days there was a very noticeable difference in how &amp;#34;awake&amp;#34; my eyes looked - brighter, less sunken in, and more supple and smooth. 1 week in and the dark circles are starting to fade also. I&#x27;m sure given more time they will improve even more. I am very happy with the results, especially considering that I was somewhat apprehensive as to how well these natural (less touted) ingredients would work. They do!</li>
            <li> This eye cream is very moisturizing &amp; brightens the eye area.  I highly recommend this product, especially  for mature skin.</li>
            <li> noticeable brighter eyes and reduced wrinkles around the eyes.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> I tend to put this on before I go to sleep when I&#x27;m up for how many hours doing work, I&#x27;ll get dark circles and then kinda red-puffy eyes when I wake up, but when I use this they don&#x27;t. I&#x27;m very young. I will recommend this mostly to those who have much more mature skin.</li>
            <li> If I use this cream only under my eyes, then I don&#x27;t experience any untoward reaction.  Yet eye creams theoretically are supposed to be so gentle, that you can use them anywhere on your face without any problem.  If I use this cream on other areas of my face, my skin will become red, blotchy, and irritated.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m sensitive to a particular essential oil in the formula or what the problem is.  I can use the Acure Night Cream without any problem, but the eye cream will irritate my skin if I use it beyond the eye area.  Although this product is designed as an eye cream, I&#x27;m hesitant to use it at all if it causes skin irritation on other parts of my facial skin and am planning on returning this product.  Fortunately, my skin cleared up within several hours, and the product didn&#x27;t cause a long-lasting breakout.</li>
            <li> So irritating...I was so excited for this as I&#x27;d heard from others (in real life not just Amazon reviews) how great it was. The first day I tried it and my eyes started to burn. I though I had just gotten something in them. Tried again the next day and they itched terribly, which I again blamed on makeup, i so wanted this to work. Day three and I used nothing but this and had the same burning and now I have red, irritated swollen skin around my eyes. I&#x27;ve never reacted like this to any eye cream, even retinols don&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a little under a year and the fine lines around my eyes are less noticeable. I&#x27;m 38, with dry skin and this really helps the skin under my eyes. Also, one tube of this goes a very long way. It lasts months and I apply it twice (sometimes three) times a day.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect moisturizer. I use it under both liquid and powder foundations and neither gets clumpy or streaky. I first came across the Acure line at Whole Foods, so I know it is well-vetted regarding animal claims.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product nearly daily for about 5 months now, and really like it. I have hereditary dark circles, and no product can ever eliminate them, but this product makes them less noticeable for sure. My eyes feel so hydrated when using this, and I use it both morning and night. I feel really good about the ingredients in this and all Acure products and the money is well spent!</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months. It is moisturizing but not oily or greasy like so many others that I&#x27;ve used. I use it day and night and I apply it on my upper eye lid as well. Smell is not really noticeable and it blends in really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the two one star reviews and I think the one person was using too much, I&#x27;ve never had any white residue left over. And the other lady might have used it too close to her eyes or is maybe allergic to one of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I was prepared for a miracle here, but there is something in this and a few of the other Acure products I tried. I broke out in hives all around my eyes. Not what I was hoping for. I have to say, the texture of these creams is nice, they absorb well (I am very oily) and the fragrances are not horrible. But the company might want to try to figure out what is causing the break outs. I am not the only one....</li>
            <li> So far I like this eye cream...it doesn&#x27;t sting or burn my eye area and it soaks in quickly and is not greasy ....</li>
            <li> The good things about this eye cream are organic and moisturizing. However it does nothing for the fine lines, pufiness or dark circles. On top of that the bottle is terrible to get the cream out. It always spills more than needed. A pump would be so much better!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice, smooth cream - and a good buy for the price.  I&#x27;d recommend it, especially if you&#x27;re tired of spending big dollars for a little tiny jar of name-brand eye creams.  This works well for me.</li>
            <li> This is not a good eye cream. I appreciate that it&#x27;s a natural skin care product, but it just doesn&#x27;t work the way an eye cream should. It is not moisturizing enough and it leaves a whitish residue around the corners of my eyes that is very uncomfortable (it feels like how your eyes feel when you first wake up if you have \\&quot;sleep\\&quot; in them). I would never dream of putting this on under concealer because the white \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; that it leaves behind would make my concealer look bad. I&#x27;ve tried many eye creams and this one is not on my list of good skin care products.</li>
            <li> Because it is so creamy, it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I tried many eye creams to help hydrate the skin around my eyes, and this is the only one that I have found that I was able to see results with overnight!  I put a small amount on in the morning and before bed, and I am good to go!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an eye cream. It moisturizes, wears okay under make up. It&#x27;s really nothing special. It really doesn&#x27;t do much besides hydrate a little. I like it enough, but I&#x27;ll probably try something else when it&#x27;s done. I do like the size, the packaging, the brand, and the fact that its organic. Other than that, eh.</li>
            <li> my wife swears by it....so I buy it for her</li>
            <li> This is another great skin care product from Acure. I can&#x27;t say I saw dramatic improvements, but this is probably because my skin is in rather good condition after years of using high-quality organic products. Skin looks and feels healthy and fresh using this product, though. There are still fine lines, but I&#x27;m not looking for an unrealistically perfect appearance.</li>
            <li> No dramatic change - or really any change at all.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other vegan eye creams that have worked a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizing but takes too long to absorb.</li>
            <li> Just been using this product for a couple of weeks i really like it purchased the day and night moisturiser as well my skin feels soft and supple and a little firmer.</li>
            <li> Within a few minutes after applying this cream, my eye lids were red and burning.&lt;br /&gt;If you can,  test the product prior to purchasing, NaturalBodyCare doesn&#x27;t accept returns.</li>
            <li> This is a good eye cream for someone who just needs moisture around the eye.&lt;br /&gt;It just doesn&#x27;t fill my needs.</li>
            <li> It is not a good moisturizer. My skin started feeling very dry since I started using it. Now I need to use extensively vitamin e oil to have my skin got back to normal.</li>
            <li> I am 41 with very oily skin and pretty bad fine lines under and around my eyes. I have been using all of the dept store products (Lancome, Estee Lauder, Bare Escentials, Clinique, etc.) under my eyes for years to prevent and hydrate my eyes. Some products actually burned. I decided to try Acure Eye Cream when I noticed it on the shelf at the health food store. I have been pleasantly surprised by the results in just two weeks. Most of the fine lines under my eyes have deminished and my eyes look so much better. I use this morning and night. I use a good amount and let is absorb within a few minutes. I occasionally reapply before bed. It absorbs well in the morning and works fine under my foundation. I have been looking for a product like this for years. I had been paying $100 for a single eye cream that didn&#x27;t work and often burned. I am thrilled with this product and the cost is so inexpensive. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love the whole line of product by Acure. They work great with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any real improvement yet, but love the moisture and how it soften my skin without any buildup. Will keep using cream to see if any wrinkle improvement happens.</li>
            <li> just started using this, so far I love it, I love that it&#x27;s light, easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes when I apply it and there isn&#x27;t a strong scent, I would buy again and thinking of getting this as a gift for my mom</li>
            <li> The product I received was like water with grains of sand.  Trying to mix it did not making a difference.  I discovered this after it was too late to return the product.  I have had it before and was satisfied with it, but I won&#x27;t be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results from it, but it gives a cooling sensation when used. Acure- Organics Eye Cream. Nice price.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t Work for Me, unfortunately  I like Acure products, but this one didn&#x27;t do anything for me except irritate my eyes a little.  UPDATE:  I continued to use product until I could get something else (on payday).  Cream was actually drying out the skin around my eyes and inflamed it.  My eyes turned red, the skin looked like crepe,  I looked horrid.  I like Acure skin moisterizers, but this eye cream was a mistake for me. I guess this didn&#x27;t happen to anyone else.</li>
            <li> Stumbled on this product at an organic store and love it.  I found that it was easier and cheaper to order it online.</li>
            <li> I have been using Acure Organic&#x27;s Eye Cream for just over a week now and I am loving the results! I was using rosehip seed oil on my eyes for the last year, but found it wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough during these winter months. I purchased this eye cream based on the organic ingredients, excellent reviews, and reasonable price. I was hopeful, but wasn&#x27;t expecting to love it as much as I do. The eye cream is just the right consistency to absorb easily and quickly. I can usually apply my under eye concealer within minutes of application. I am excited to see if does anything for the beginning signs of aging around my eyes. I would recommend this eye cream hands down over any of the expensive department store brands I have purchased in the past. And the fact that it is organic just makes this eye cream that much better. It&#x27;s nice to know that organic doesn&#x27;t have to cost a fortune!</li>
