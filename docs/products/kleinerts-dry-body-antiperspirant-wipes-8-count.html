            <li>this is a great product!!</li>
            <li>They work but not so perfectly.</li>
            <li>Love it!!!</li>
            <li>A family member told me how great they were.  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I used this product on my underarms and love the results!  </li>
            <li>These are amazing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I say it&#x27;s an effective way to reduce body sweat.  </li>
            <li>Glad to find these.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since there aren&#x27;t many options, I&#x27;ll keep using this product.</li>
            <li>So glad I did.</li>
            <li>when they do work, it&#x27;s pretty amazing!</li>
            <li>I love this product..</li>
            <li>She was so pleased I decided to give them a try.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a month now and am satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>She claims they are only good for about five days and still was sweating a fair amount at school (indoors and air conditioned,</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t irritate the skin and are pretty effective.  </li>
            <li>People notice me in a good way and some thought I was a new employee</li>
            <li>So just, you know, don&#x27;t get overzealous with it, and you&#x27;ll probably be fine.</li>
            <li>I am a loyal customer now, too!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m significantly dryer than without using this product, and we&#x27;re going through a heat wave in California.  </li>
            <li>though it doesn&#x27;t come off when swimming, I found that swimming the morning after application caused additional itching, so I wait a full day before swimming.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If applied sparingly, however, it&#x27;s not bad at all.  </li>
            <li>Exactly like sweat block but cheaper!</li>
            <li>These work pretty well and definitely work much better than any of the roll-on types.  </li>
            <li>Overall pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>still &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; hot and sweaty</li>
            <li>The first one worked for 2 days and then the effect wore off.</li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li>Using this product I now sweat like a normal person, which means that it takes significant heat and activity before I really start to sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, but this product worked better than expected.  </li>
            <li>So, pretty much it didn&#x27;t work on me because, yes, it drys out my hand when I&#x27;m not sweating...</li>
            <li>The first application made a mild difference, but after the second application I was pretty amazed at how well it worked.  </li>
            <li>I really REALLY want this to work.</li>
            <li>This has made me feel so confident that I let down my hair for the first time in years.  </li>
            <li>this product has stopped my underarm sweat completely!!!</li>
            <li>I do feel like a new person!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have had a huge problem with underarm sweat my entire adult life and as a female that is very embarrassing..</li>
            <li>and I needed a way to prevent becoming a sweaty mess.  </li>
            <li>It dose reduce the sweating in normal circumstances, however when I work outside or am out in the heat I do not notice much difference.  </li>
            <li>I am very please with the wipes, they do what they say and last up to 10 days protection.</li>
            <li>Bought for my 13-year old daughter for hyperhydrosis of the hands and feet.</li>
            <li>She says they help, but do not stop the sweating completely.</li>
            <li>when i&#x27;m out, but I&#x27;m actually not sweating as much</li>
            <li>They worked better for underarms and not as well on excessive back sweating.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> (I normally put firm grip on my hands, but I figure I&#x27;ll give Dry Body a try....and guess what...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worked for long.</li>
            <li> It is not an issue anymore since I started using the Kleinerts Dry Body Wipes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After applying Dry Body, my hands are either REALLY dry when I&#x27;m not sweating, or when I sweat it just drips.  </li>
            <li> My only suggestion would be to have them in smaller size packets because there seems to be some waste if just using one wipe for underarms.  </li>
            <li> /burns a little when applying and then later when I do</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a profuse sweater, I don&#x27;t saturate clothing, I just wanted a little extra coverage under my bust and face and neck</li>
            <li> did not work as well as expected.</li>
            <li> I am dry and so is my hair! !  </li>
            <li> I followed directions exactly to no avail.</li>
            <li> I read there are 2 other brands...</li>
            <li> Reduces sweat very well, but if you apply too much or to sensitive skin, settle in for a night of itching, burning, and thinking, &amp;#34;Maybe pit stains aren&#x27;t so bad....</li>
            <li> She typically doesn&#x27;t use them on weekends due to sleepovers, etc.</li>
            <li> I swear a lot less in those areas</li>
            <li> itches like mad for me for the first hour after application.  </li>
            <li> It is not easy to get it to the scalp through all the hair.  </li>
            <li> I am truly a firm believer in this product!    </li>
            <li> She usually uses them nightly on school nights.</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;m anxious at all</li>
            <li> I recommend that you put it on at least an hour before bed to let the itching pass</li>
            <li> It did nothing...and worse..</li>
            <li> I got a big, nasty, scabby patch of dermatitis around my armpit that lasted for at least 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I would soak my clothes with sweat even in the cold months.  </li>
            <li> I do pole and lyra but my hands and feet sweat like crazy.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping this would work, but sadly it did not :(</li>
            <li> So sad that this one didn&#x27;t work on me &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think she smells bad, but I do visibly see severe sweat stains in her garments.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>

            <li> Glad to find these. Bringing them to Arizona.</li>
            <li> this is a great product!!</li>
            <li> I am very please with the wipes, they do what they say and last up to 10 days protection.</li>
            <li> It is not work well. Still has a sweat hand and feet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still waiting for this to work. I think it does work but my sweaty face is a severe case  Update: July 28, 2015 I am truly a firm believer in this product!    It works on my sweaty face!  I am dry and so is my hair! !  This has made me feel so confident that I let down my hair for the first time in years.  People notice me in a good way and some thought I was a new employee so they had to check me out.  I do feel like a new person!</li>
            <li> Bought for my 13-year old daughter for hyperhydrosis of the hands and feet. She says they help, but do not stop the sweating completely. She usually uses them nightly on school nights. She typically doesn&#x27;t use them on weekends due to sleepovers, etc.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but this product worked better than expected.  I sweat a lot from my chest and back.  If it&#x27;s warmer than 72 outside or I&#x27;m anxious at all, I&#x27;ll end up with sweat spots all over the front/back of my shirt.  I was headed to Hong Kong in August for business and I needed a way to prevent becoming a sweaty mess.  The first application made a mild difference, but after the second application I was pretty amazed at how well it worked.  Using this product I now sweat like a normal person, which means that it takes significant heat and activity before I really start to sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a couple of applications, each a week apart, before it was fully effective.&lt;br /&gt;It itches like mad for me for the first hour after application.  I recommend that you put it on at least an hour before bed to let the itching pass or you&#x27;ll never fall asleep.&lt;br /&gt;I still &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; hot and sweaty when i&#x27;m out, but I&#x27;m actually not sweating as much and my shirt isn&#x27;t wet.&lt;br /&gt;Even though it doesn&#x27;t come off when swimming, I found that swimming the morning after application caused additional itching, so I wait a full day before swimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I say it&#x27;s an effective way to reduce body sweat.  I&#x27;ve reordered.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t decide to rate it a 3 or 4.  I do not like the clove smell when applying.  I have sweating on my face and scalp.  It dose reduce the sweating in normal circumstances, however when I work outside or am out in the heat I do not notice much difference.  It is not easy to get it to the scalp through all the hair.  My skin tingles/burns a little when applying and then later when I do sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since there aren&#x27;t many options, I&#x27;ll keep using this product.</li>
            <li> Bought these for a camping trip. So glad I did. I wasn&#x27;t about to allow my body to utilize the same evaporative cooling technology that a Nigerian Zeer Pot uses. What am I, Amish? No. I have science and Kleinerts and a battery powered fan.</li>
            <li> Exactly like sweat block but cheaper! I love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 2 wipes in 3 days. The first one worked for 2 days and then the effect wore off. Second wipe didn&#x27;t last a day. I&#x27;m not a profuse sweater, I don&#x27;t saturate clothing, I just wanted a little extra coverage under my bust and face and neck it&#x27;s not worked for long. I followed directions exactly to no avail. Disappointed. I will say this though...when they do work, it&#x27;s pretty amazing!</li>
            <li> Reduces sweat very well, but if you apply too much or to sensitive skin, settle in for a night of itching, burning, and thinking, &amp;#34;Maybe pit stains aren&#x27;t so bad....&amp;#34;.  I got a big, nasty, scabby patch of dermatitis around my armpit that lasted for at least 2 weeks.  If applied sparingly, however, it&#x27;s not bad at all.  So just, you know, don&#x27;t get overzealous with it, and you&#x27;ll probably be fine.</li>
            <li> I love this product..I have had a huge problem with underarm sweat my entire adult life and as a female that is very embarrassing..this product has stopped my underarm sweat completely!!! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s meant to do</li>
            <li> I guess we have an extra sweaty family.  I used this product on my underarms and love the results!  I would soak my clothes with sweat even in the cold months.  It is not an issue anymore since I started using the Kleinerts Dry Body Wipes.  A family member told me how great they were.  She was using them for her extra sweaty hands.  She was so pleased I decided to give them a try.  I am a loyal customer now, too!</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would work, but sadly it did not :(</li>
            <li> Purchased for my sister who claims she has hypohydrosis... whatever. So she wanted to try some of these wipes. She claims they are only good for about five days and still was sweating a fair amount at school (indoors and air conditioned, no idea why she is so sweaty).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my personal opinion I don&#x27;t think she smells bad, but I do visibly see severe sweat stains in her garments.</li>
            <li> They work but not so perfectly. I need something for my face cause I sweat a lot there. These wipes sting when I apply them but they reduce sweat about 70% . For quite sometime afterwards.</li>
            <li> These are amazing.  Will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it can be applied anywhere on your body to inhibit sweating. When used before going to bed, as directed, it keeps you dry for several days. It has larger wipes than the Sweat Shield, and one wipe is enough to apply to your face, chest, armpits and back.  It&#x27;s been 4 days since I applied it and I&#x27;m significantly dryer than without using this product, and we&#x27;re going through a heat wave in California.  I recommend this product because you can apply it to areas where a deodorant stick doesn&#x27;t go.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month now and am satisfied with the results. My biggest problem areas were underarm and face and neck area. This product has done wonders for me. I swear a lot less in those areas and I&#x27;m so greatful for this product. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My husband has searched for a product to help reduce underarm sweat.  We stumbled across this product while browsing the internet and decided to give it a try.  All I have to say is &amp;#34;Wow&amp;#34;!!! It does the job! I even recommended it to a friend who also says it has worked wonders for her.</li>
            <li> I really REALLY want this to work. I do pole and lyra but my hands and feet sweat like crazy.  I got a sample of this from another supplier and I applied it the night before my class...dabbed all over my hands and feet.  It did nothing...and worse.. (I normally put firm grip on my hands, but I figure I&#x27;ll give Dry Body a try....and guess what...I slipped off my extended butterfly because my hands were dripping...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying Dry Body, my hands are either REALLY dry when I&#x27;m not sweating, or when I sweat it just drips.  So, pretty much it didn&#x27;t work on me because, yes, it drys out my hand when I&#x27;m not sweating...but it doesn&#x27;t prevent me from sweating either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sigh.  I read there are 2 other brands...I think I&#x27;ll give those a try.  So sad that this one didn&#x27;t work on me &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> did not work as well as expected. I was disappointed. will not purchase again</li>
