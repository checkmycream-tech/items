            <li>so hey this is my honest review.</li>
            <li>No stains, great, fresh scent!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, but WAY too strong!</li>
            <li>I smooth it on, and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>but was surprised at the great results!</li>
            <li>This deodorant keeps me fresh and feeling great.</li>
            <li>No white marks, smell is excellent, no sticky feeling after applying it, and the best part is it really does provide protection for 48 hours.</li>
            <li>I loved the sport fresh scent and have since bought the powder scent which is also a very nice light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to apply, smooth, and smells great (in my opinion).</li>
            <li>This is a very nice product, the moment you apply it you feel fresh....</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>so I wouldnt know if it lasts the whole 48 lol.</li>
            <li>But I love this deodorant.</li>
            <li>I liked the smell and it didn&#x27;t irritate my under arms which is a huge plus for me</li>
            <li>love this deodorant -</li>
            <li>I received this free to try in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be able to buy the deodorant because of this.</li>

            <li>Love this deo.</li>
            <li>I was given a sample to try for free in exchange for my honest opinion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>scent &amp;#34;Completely Clean&amp;#34; was completely overwhelming.</li>
            <li>and they didn&#x27;t make me feel confident when sweating.</li>
            <li>and it is a lot more affordable</li>
            <li>Great antiperspirant, leaves you feeling fresh and streak free.</li>
            <li>This scent is nice and clean and the gel works well for me.</li>
            <li>I liked the scent and the fact that it dries quickly without leaving marks on my clothes.</li>
            <li>Great news for sleeveless summer shirt action!</li>
            <li>Goes on clear, no residue and works great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of strong scents, so I love that this one is very light and fresh.</li>
            <li>It is pleasantly noticeable, and you can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s clean clothes, a body spray or a deodorant</li>
            <li>No problems running around outside with the kiddos this summer in the heat, I&#x27;m smelling fresh and feeling great!</li>
            <li>I was happy to be able to try this and still have clinical strength on back up just in case</li>
            <li>scent was strong in the container but</li>
            <li>The gel is easy to apply and it&#x27;s a cool refreshing feeling too.</li>
            <li>First, it smells really really nice.</li>
            <li>The best one hands down.</li>
            <li>i absolutely LOVE this deodorant - it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my underarms feeling sticky or filmy.</li>
            <li>I love wearing cute cap sleeve shirts and when you can tell you&#x27;ve had wetness going on, it certainly is embarrassing.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of gel deodorants in the spring and summer months.</li>
            <li>So this product was just ok, because I can&#x27;t trade the security of smelling fresh for no stains.  </li>

            <li>( I  received this product free from clearlybetterchallenge.com  as a member of One2One Network)</li>
            <li>It is a great product if you are fighting the white!</li>
            <li>I got this product free through Bzzagent.com -</li>
            <li>I got a chance to try this product for free.  </li>
            <li>I found that the scent of the Sport Fresh is very clean and light.</li>
            <li>Fresh, clean scent with outstanding odor protection.  </li>
            <li>It was incredible, kept me fresh all day long.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product and I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>i got a free full sized sample from bzzagent and some coupons</li>
            <li>I had fun!</li>
            <li>One thing that really impressed me particularly with this deodorant is that it didn&#x27;t cause itchiness, smelled great, and dried clear AND quickly.</li>
            <li>They smell amazing and because of the gel formula, they do not leave white marks which is a huge deal to me!</li>
            <li>I was super excited to try this campaign to see if science had progressed since then</li>
            <li>I received a full sized sample in exchange of a review, as part of a BzzAgent</li>
            <li>all while smelling good and leaving no white marks.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m a mom, I&#x27;ve got a full time job</li>
            <li>If you need good protection and are worried about white marks (I wear black shirts for my job) then this product will work great for you.  </li>
            <li>Also dries quickly...</li>
            <li>I love how it goes on clear and has a great scent that keeps me fresh all day long .  </li>
            <li>I found that claim to be pretty close to accurate.</li>
            <li>so I love trying out their new items.  </li>
            <li>If most antiperspirants work for you, you&#x27;ll be dry, and if you end up with sweaty armpits most of the time, you still will.</li>
            <li>Most of the time regular strength deodorant does just fine for me.</li>
            <li>As far as the antiperspirant/deodorant it was just ok, I found that I sweat faster (about 4 hours after applying) with this product than with others, and of course the sweat brought the smell.  </li>
            <li>I cannot attest to how well this will work for anyone who experiences perspiration or body odors that are different from my own.</li>
            <li>I found secret outlast to be a good product, it smells really nice.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to another deodorant.</li>
            <li>I love the clear gel it is so nice not to have white streaks on my clothing and armpits.</li>
            <li>not so fresh feeling</li>
            <li>I also liked that there were no issues with white marks.  </li>
            <li>Secret makes excellent quality products.</li>
            <li>and I love the clear gel formula.  </li>
            <li>Fresh Smelling, but not over powering.</li>
            <li>I love the variety of products that they offer to cater to the individual preferences and unique needs of everyone who purchases odor protection products.</li>
            <li>Overall, I feel fresh, clean and confident while wearing the deodorant.</li>
            <li>I can use it right after shaving and it does not stain my clothes.</li>
            <li>Even at the end of a long day I still had a nice fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>She liked this one and believes it works well and lasts long too.</li>
            <li>Lasts a LONG time even in the warm Florida winters.  </li>
            <li>Everyone around me was impressed with my bulletproof and sweat-proof Secret OutlastÂ® Completely Clean Clear Gel!</li>
            <li>I think it is a tremendous value for the money, and I would absolutely recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh and clean, but not so overwhelming that it will give you a head ache like some other brands out there.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is very reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li>also appreciate that the fragrance is very light and that there are no white streaks on my clothes.  </li>
            <li>and i am very thankful because i wouldn&#x27;t have tried the gel otherwise!</li>
            <li>And, it smells pretty androgynous, which is a pro for me.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>scent &amp;#34;Completely Clean&amp;#34; smelled just like laundry soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no white residue after getting dressed, after a day of sweating in a tank top (call it &amp;#34;ring around the armpit&amp;#34;) or on my husband&#x27;s work uniform after his &amp;#34;Welcome Home&amp;#34; hug even though I was the &amp;#34;arms around the neck&amp;#34; participant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this deodorant and if you are in my situation, totally try it out</li>
            <li>Especially with the colder weather I am wearing more layers and that&#x27;s when the sweating starts.</li>
            <li>It goes on clear and smoothly and doesn&#x27;t stain you clothes.</li>
            <li>When wearing it to play basketball outside, I would catch brief whiffs of it, and I liked to know that I smelled clean and not sweaty.</li>
            <li>Secret Outlast clear gel fresh has an amazing fragrance that reminds me of a vacation, like a warm breeze at the ocean.  </li>
            <li>Purchased for my wife who had used other scents before and liked them.</li>
            <li>only issue with it is that it uses up very quickly</li>
            <li>It really IS strong enough for a man, and whether or not it&#x27;s made for a woman or not, I use it, and am NOT a woman.</li>
            <li>I liked that the gel dried pretty fast</li>
            <li>kept me feeling clean and fresh all day long.</li>
            <li>Keeps me fresh, clean, and dry even while I am working in the kitchen.</li>
            <li>it dries fast too.</li>
            <li>but this works really well.</li>
            <li>It dries surprisingly fast and does not leave ANY marks.</li>
            <li>Smells better than I expected and it lived up to the hype throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Secret is  a great brand</li>
            <li>I tried it then and have been a white solid kind of lady ever since.</li>
            <li>It dries quick, no messy feeling or white marks right after you put your shirt on!</li>
            <li>The product is super affordable too, which means I&#x27;m going to easily make the switch from the more expensive one I was wasting $$$ on!&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Worth it for the lasting protection and clean look in my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing Secret&#x27;s new Active Fresh for about a week, and I am truly impressed with the long-lasting scent.</li>
            <li>Tried Secret Outlast Sport Fresh Clear Gel as a free sample and fell in love.</li>
            <li>It takes a few minutes to dry which is a pain, but it kept me fresh throughout the whole day, maybe not 48 hours but the full day at least!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a lovely smooth application and delivers on every promise-- which was thoroughly tested after a long marathon day.</li>
            <li>I think Secret Outlast is amazing!</li>
            <li>It goes on totally dry (wetness was my main initial concern) and easily making it super</li>
            <li>This is now my new deodorant!  </li>
            <li>I wear black a lot, so I need something that is not going to transfer, as it is much more noticeable on darker clothes.</li>
            <li>, overall, I will keep this product on hand for tank top days and dress up days, but I will keep my solid for my sweaty stink</li>
            <li>I have had a complicated relationship with gel deodorant since the first day it was presented as a brilliant idea way back forever ago.</li>
            <li>I highly recommed this to anyone.</li>
            <li>highly recomend it</li>
            <li>It dries fast and really gives you a dry and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>The fresh scent lasted all day and no white marks  </li>
            <li>I also never go 48 hours without re-applying deodorant, so I cannot attest to it&#x27;s ability to keep you smelling fresh for an entire 48 hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Secret Outlast in clear gel worked great for an average day, but you&#x27;ll need to use more than one or two clicks of the gel if you&#x27;re hoping it will last during an intense workout.</li>
            <li>After reviewing the deodorant for a few days, I was pleased that it does what it says it will.</li>
            <li>scent is good, not overwhelming, but enough to be noticable.</li>
            <li>I find that Secret Outlast Sport Fresh scent does a really good job of covering up BO and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing (unlike all the solid deodorants).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh, smells lovely and doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my black shirts!</li>
            <li>this dried quickly and smelled fresh.</li>
            <li>I do get a sticky feeling from it that I could live without.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Fantastic product that really does last all day long!</li>
            <li>It did dry quickly though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am super busy all day long from chasing my two boys, going to work, and running errands.  </li>
            <li>Works well all day long to keep odor at bay and the fragrance last strong.</li>
            <li>At the end of the first day, I could still smell the product, but about halfway into the second day, I began to notice some perspiration.</li>
            <li>There are no nasty white residues from it like other deodorants may have.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing this again in the future and I am excited to try all of the different scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It last in the hot south Texas heat even outdoors chasing kids.  </li>
            <li>Secret is great Deodorant, it&#x27;s been around for a long time, my mom used it, and I&#x27;ve used it on and off over the years.  </li>
            <li>I remained dry and fresh.</li>
            <li>Both the stickiness and coldness went away quickly and were not much of an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried many deodorants in the past and a lot of my tops and tees really got ruined because of sweat marks and white marks from deodorants</li>
            <li>I was hesitant about using a gel, but it really does dry fast and isn&#x27;t sticky at all.</li>
            <li>This product is a clear gel that you click up.</li>
            <li>It keeps me clean smelling and dry without leaving white marks.  </li>
            <li>Clear Gel-outlast</li>
            <li>/&gt;Generally, clear deodorants don&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>Goes on clear</li>
            <li>It goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is in the clear gel form.  </li>
            <li>I was so surprised when trying this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had an issue with sweating, all of my adult life.</li>
            <li>morning after application, my armpits smelled like a mix of residual &amp;#34;Completely Clean&amp;#34; and Natural Stink.</li>
            <li>As a busy stay at home mom, my job doesn&#x27;t just stop in the house...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a lady who&#x27;s active, sweats a bunch, and doesn&#x27;t like super girly scents.</li>
            <li>For some reason, my body chemistry does not play nicely with clear deodorants and I smell worse with the deodorant than I do without it.  </li>
            <li>I think Secret brand was one of the first deodorants that I ever had as a teen or tween, and it is still one of my favorite brands to this day.</li>
            <li>I received my new secret outlast clear gel and have to say I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the new Secret outlast clear gel.</li>
            <li>and smelt clean and dry after a long day including a gym workout</li>
            <li>Smells good but the container seems half empty, not much quantity for he price.</li>
            <li>but then you would have to reapply especially now that it&#x27;s hot outside</li>
            <li>I normally go for the &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; deodorants knowing I won&#x27;t have a problem, but normally get an irritation because I am just too dry.</li>
            <li>Dries fast, leaves no stains in my clothing and protects me all day long.</li>
            <li>It goes on completely clear leaving no messy streaks on those little black dresses or in my case t-shirts :).  </li>
            <li>Disclosure I received this product free thanks to from secret</li>

            <li>I love the way it goes on, it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing, and I felt dry and fresh all day long, even after a tough workout.</li>
            <li>Unlike other clear gels I&#x27;ve tried, this is NOT sticky and dries fast.  </li>
            <li>It is clear and definitely create dryness.</li>
            <li>Always had problems controlling my sweat and finally I found a deodorant that suits me completely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely in love with secret&#x27;s outlast gel deodorant.</li>
            <li>Secret Outlast went on clear and dried quickly which is a huge plus for me.  </li>
            <li>just right a few minutes after application..</li>
            <li>It is a little chilly to use on a cold morning ( it will be great in the summer :) it is worth the 2 second chill.</li>
            <li>It really keeps me dry all day long and protects me from sweat odors.</li>
            <li>I just recommend that if you live in a sweltering hot state like Florida or any other southern state don&#x27;t purchase this product because you will continue having to buy this over and over due to the constant reapplying.</li>
            <li>But the Secret Outlast clear gel works much better than other deodorants.</li>
            <li>I found that it also lasted longer than other products i have compared it against when either working out or during high stress situations.</li>
            <li>I am pretty active and this keeps me dry.  </li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s comparable to most common antiperspirants in terms of making you sweat less.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing that really REALLY works, and you have NO sticky mess, NO white marks, and NO odor whatsoever.</li>

            <li> It has a pleasant scent that is not too overwhelming.</li>

            <li> I liked it.</li>
            <li> I have often used and liked this product, and that hasn&#x27;t changed.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve got my own side business making candy and baked goods.  </li>
            <li> The comments and views are my own.</li>
            <li> so hey this is my honest review.</li>
            <li> No stains, great, fresh scent!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, but WAY too strong!</li>
            <li> I smooth it on, and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> but was surprised at the great results!</li>
            <li> This deodorant keeps me fresh and feeling great.</li>
            <li> No white marks, smell is excellent, no sticky feeling after applying it, and the best part is it really does provide protection for 48 hours.</li>
            <li> I loved the sport fresh scent and have since bought the powder scent which is also a very nice light fragrance.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to apply, smooth, and smells great (in my opinion).</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product, the moment you apply it you feel fresh....</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> so I wouldnt know if it lasts the whole 48 lol.</li>
            <li> But I love this deodorant.</li>
            <li> I liked the smell and it didn&#x27;t irritate my under arms which is a huge plus for me</li>
            <li> love this deodorant -</li>
            <li> I received this free to try in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be able to buy the deodorant because of this.</li>
            <li> This is a longtime favorite.  </li>
            <li> I love this deodorant.</li>
            <li> love this stuff .  </li>
            <li> Love this deo.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample to try for free in exchange for my honest opinion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> scent &amp;#34;Completely Clean&amp;#34; was completely overwhelming.</li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t make me feel confident when sweating.</li>
            <li> and it is a lot more affordable</li>
            <li> Great antiperspirant, leaves you feeling fresh and streak free.</li>
            <li> This scent is nice and clean and the gel works well for me.</li>
            <li> I liked the scent and the fact that it dries quickly without leaving marks on my clothes.</li>
            <li> Great news for sleeveless summer shirt action!</li>
            <li> Goes on clear, no residue and works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of strong scents, so I love that this one is very light and fresh.</li>
            <li> It is pleasantly noticeable, and you can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s clean clothes, a body spray or a deodorant</li>
            <li> No problems running around outside with the kiddos this summer in the heat, I&#x27;m smelling fresh and feeling great!</li>
            <li> I was happy to be able to try this and still have clinical strength on back up just in case</li>
            <li> scent was strong in the container but</li>
            <li> The gel is easy to apply and it&#x27;s a cool refreshing feeling too.</li>
            <li> First, it smells really really nice.</li>
            <li> The best one hands down.</li>
            <li> i absolutely LOVE this deodorant - it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my underarms feeling sticky or filmy.</li>
            <li> I love wearing cute cap sleeve shirts and when you can tell you&#x27;ve had wetness going on, it certainly is embarrassing.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of gel deodorants in the spring and summer months.</li>
            <li> So this product was just ok, because I can&#x27;t trade the security of smelling fresh for no stains.  </li>

            <li> It is a great product if you are fighting the white!</li>
            <li> I got this product free through Bzzagent.com -</li>
            <li> I got a chance to try this product for free.  </li>
            <li> I found that the scent of the Sport Fresh is very clean and light.</li>
            <li> Fresh, clean scent with outstanding odor protection.  </li>
            <li> It was incredible, kept me fresh all day long.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> i got a free full sized sample from bzzagent and some coupons</li>
            <li> I had fun!</li>
            <li> One thing that really impressed me particularly with this deodorant is that it didn&#x27;t cause itchiness, smelled great, and dried clear AND quickly.</li>
            <li> They smell amazing and because of the gel formula, they do not leave white marks which is a huge deal to me!</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try this campaign to see if science had progressed since then</li>
            <li> I received a full sized sample in exchange of a review, as part of a BzzAgent</li>
            <li> all while smelling good and leaving no white marks.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m a mom, I&#x27;ve got a full time job</li>
            <li> If you need good protection and are worried about white marks (I wear black shirts for my job) then this product will work great for you.  </li>
            <li> Also dries quickly...</li>
            <li> I love how it goes on clear and has a great scent that keeps me fresh all day long .  </li>
            <li> I found that claim to be pretty close to accurate.</li>
            <li> so I love trying out their new items.  </li>
            <li> If most antiperspirants work for you, you&#x27;ll be dry, and if you end up with sweaty armpits most of the time, you still will.</li>
            <li> Most of the time regular strength deodorant does just fine for me.</li>
            <li> As far as the antiperspirant/deodorant it was just ok, I found that I sweat faster (about 4 hours after applying) with this product than with others, and of course the sweat brought the smell.  </li>
            <li> I cannot attest to how well this will work for anyone who experiences perspiration or body odors that are different from my own.</li>
            <li> I found secret outlast to be a good product, it smells really nice.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to another deodorant.</li>
            <li> I love the clear gel it is so nice not to have white streaks on my clothing and armpits.</li>
            <li> not so fresh feeling</li>
            <li> I also liked that there were no issues with white marks.  </li>
            <li> Secret makes excellent quality products.</li>
            <li> and I love the clear gel formula.  </li>
            <li> Fresh Smelling, but not over powering.</li>
            <li> I love the variety of products that they offer to cater to the individual preferences and unique needs of everyone who purchases odor protection products.</li>
            <li> Overall, I feel fresh, clean and confident while wearing the deodorant.</li>
            <li> I can use it right after shaving and it does not stain my clothes.</li>
            <li> Even at the end of a long day I still had a nice fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> She liked this one and believes it works well and lasts long too.</li>
            <li> Lasts a LONG time even in the warm Florida winters.  </li>
            <li> Everyone around me was impressed with my bulletproof and sweat-proof Secret OutlastÂ® Completely Clean Clear Gel!</li>
            <li> I think it is a tremendous value for the money, and I would absolutely recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li> The scent is fresh and clean, but not so overwhelming that it will give you a head ache like some other brands out there.  </li>
            <li> I like that it is very reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> also appreciate that the fragrance is very light and that there are no white streaks on my clothes.  </li>
            <li> and i am very thankful because i wouldn&#x27;t have tried the gel otherwise!</li>
            <li> And, it smells pretty androgynous, which is a pro for me.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> scent &amp;#34;Completely Clean&amp;#34; smelled just like laundry soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no white residue after getting dressed, after a day of sweating in a tank top (call it &amp;#34;ring around the armpit&amp;#34;) or on my husband&#x27;s work uniform after his &amp;#34;Welcome Home&amp;#34; hug even though I was the &amp;#34;arms around the neck&amp;#34; participant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this deodorant and if you are in my situation, totally try it out</li>
            <li> Especially with the colder weather I am wearing more layers and that&#x27;s when the sweating starts.</li>
            <li> It goes on clear and smoothly and doesn&#x27;t stain you clothes.</li>
            <li> When wearing it to play basketball outside, I would catch brief whiffs of it, and I liked to know that I smelled clean and not sweaty.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast clear gel fresh has an amazing fragrance that reminds me of a vacation, like a warm breeze at the ocean.  </li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife who had used other scents before and liked them.</li>
            <li> only issue with it is that it uses up very quickly</li>
            <li> It really IS strong enough for a man, and whether or not it&#x27;s made for a woman or not, I use it, and am NOT a woman.</li>
            <li> I liked that the gel dried pretty fast</li>
            <li> kept me feeling clean and fresh all day long.</li>
            <li> Keeps me fresh, clean, and dry even while I am working in the kitchen.</li>
            <li> it dries fast too.</li>
            <li> but this works really well.</li>
            <li> It dries surprisingly fast and does not leave ANY marks.</li>
            <li> Smells better than I expected and it lived up to the hype throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Secret is  a great brand</li>
            <li> I tried it then and have been a white solid kind of lady ever since.</li>
            <li> It dries quick, no messy feeling or white marks right after you put your shirt on!</li>
            <li> The product is super affordable too, which means I&#x27;m going to easily make the switch from the more expensive one I was wasting $$$ on!&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Worth it for the lasting protection and clean look in my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Secret&#x27;s new Active Fresh for about a week, and I am truly impressed with the long-lasting scent.</li>
            <li> Tried Secret Outlast Sport Fresh Clear Gel as a free sample and fell in love.</li>
            <li> It takes a few minutes to dry which is a pain, but it kept me fresh throughout the whole day, maybe not 48 hours but the full day at least!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a lovely smooth application and delivers on every promise-- which was thoroughly tested after a long marathon day.</li>
            <li> I think Secret Outlast is amazing!</li>
            <li> It goes on totally dry (wetness was my main initial concern) and easily making it super</li>
            <li> This is now my new deodorant!  </li>
            <li> I wear black a lot, so I need something that is not going to transfer, as it is much more noticeable on darker clothes.</li>
            <li> , overall, I will keep this product on hand for tank top days and dress up days, but I will keep my solid for my sweaty stink</li>
            <li> I have had a complicated relationship with gel deodorant since the first day it was presented as a brilliant idea way back forever ago.</li>
            <li> I highly recommed this to anyone.</li>
            <li> highly recomend it</li>
            <li> It dries fast and really gives you a dry and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> The fresh scent lasted all day and no white marks  </li>
            <li> I also never go 48 hours without re-applying deodorant, so I cannot attest to it&#x27;s ability to keep you smelling fresh for an entire 48 hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Secret Outlast in clear gel worked great for an average day, but you&#x27;ll need to use more than one or two clicks of the gel if you&#x27;re hoping it will last during an intense workout.</li>
            <li> After reviewing the deodorant for a few days, I was pleased that it does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> scent is good, not overwhelming, but enough to be noticable.</li>
            <li> I find that Secret Outlast Sport Fresh scent does a really good job of covering up BO and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing (unlike all the solid deodorants).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fresh, smells lovely and doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my black shirts!</li>
            <li> this dried quickly and smelled fresh.</li>
            <li> I do get a sticky feeling from it that I could live without.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Fantastic product that really does last all day long!</li>
            <li> It did dry quickly though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am super busy all day long from chasing my two boys, going to work, and running errands.  </li>
            <li> Works well all day long to keep odor at bay and the fragrance last strong.</li>
            <li> At the end of the first day, I could still smell the product, but about halfway into the second day, I began to notice some perspiration.</li>
            <li> There are no nasty white residues from it like other deodorants may have.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing this again in the future and I am excited to try all of the different scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It last in the hot south Texas heat even outdoors chasing kids.  </li>
            <li> Secret is great Deodorant, it&#x27;s been around for a long time, my mom used it, and I&#x27;ve used it on and off over the years.  </li>
            <li> I remained dry and fresh.</li>
            <li> Both the stickiness and coldness went away quickly and were not much of an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried many deodorants in the past and a lot of my tops and tees really got ruined because of sweat marks and white marks from deodorants</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about using a gel, but it really does dry fast and isn&#x27;t sticky at all.</li>
            <li> This product is a clear gel that you click up.</li>
            <li> It keeps me clean smelling and dry without leaving white marks.  </li>
            <li> Clear Gel-outlast</li>
            <li> /&gt;Generally, clear deodorants don&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> Goes on clear</li>
            <li> It goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing.  </li>
            <li> I like that it is in the clear gel form.  </li>
            <li> I was so surprised when trying this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had an issue with sweating, all of my adult life.</li>
            <li> morning after application, my armpits smelled like a mix of residual &amp;#34;Completely Clean&amp;#34; and Natural Stink.</li>
            <li> As a busy stay at home mom, my job doesn&#x27;t just stop in the house...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lady who&#x27;s active, sweats a bunch, and doesn&#x27;t like super girly scents.</li>
            <li> For some reason, my body chemistry does not play nicely with clear deodorants and I smell worse with the deodorant than I do without it.  </li>
            <li> I think Secret brand was one of the first deodorants that I ever had as a teen or tween, and it is still one of my favorite brands to this day.</li>
            <li> I received my new secret outlast clear gel and have to say I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the new Secret outlast clear gel.</li>
            <li> and smelt clean and dry after a long day including a gym workout</li>
            <li> Smells good but the container seems half empty, not much quantity for he price.</li>
            <li> but then you would have to reapply especially now that it&#x27;s hot outside</li>
            <li> I normally go for the &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; deodorants knowing I won&#x27;t have a problem, but normally get an irritation because I am just too dry.</li>
            <li> Dries fast, leaves no stains in my clothing and protects me all day long.</li>
            <li> It goes on completely clear leaving no messy streaks on those little black dresses or in my case t-shirts :).  </li>

            <li> I love the way it goes on, it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing, and I felt dry and fresh all day long, even after a tough workout.</li>
            <li> Unlike other clear gels I&#x27;ve tried, this is NOT sticky and dries fast.  </li>
            <li> It is clear and definitely create dryness.</li>
            <li> Always had problems controlling my sweat and finally I found a deodorant that suits me completely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with secret&#x27;s outlast gel deodorant.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast went on clear and dried quickly which is a huge plus for me.  </li>
            <li> just right a few minutes after application..</li>
            <li> It is a little chilly to use on a cold morning ( it will be great in the summer :) it is worth the 2 second chill.</li>
            <li> It really keeps me dry all day long and protects me from sweat odors.</li>
            <li> I just recommend that if you live in a sweltering hot state like Florida or any other southern state don&#x27;t purchase this product because you will continue having to buy this over and over due to the constant reapplying.</li>
            <li> But the Secret Outlast clear gel works much better than other deodorants.</li>
            <li> I found that it also lasted longer than other products i have compared it against when either working out or during high stress situations.</li>
            <li> I am pretty active and this keeps me dry.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s comparable to most common antiperspirants in terms of making you sweat less.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing that really REALLY works, and you have NO sticky mess, NO white marks, and NO odor whatsoever.</li>
            <li> After having my daughter I&#x27;ve become extremely self conscious of body odor.  </li>
            <li> I live in black and 40% of the time I get deodorant stains on my outfit and have to change.</li>
            <li> There were times when I could smell a little odor coming through, but this does a much better job at masking the odor than other products that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried that I would have that slimy feeling like with some other gels I&#x27;ve tried (which is why I stopped buying gels in the first place).</li>
            <li> It will last an incredibly long time and protects against wetness</li>
            <li> This actually works to keep my armpits dry and keep pit stains at bay.</li>
            <li> I recently tried the Secret Outlast Sport Fresh Scent, and I have to say that I like it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Secret Outlast Clear Gel.</li>
            <li> it lasts for a long time</li>
            <li> so I got the Outlast Sport and was pleasantly surprised how well it worked, went on and dried (not sticky feeling).</li>
            <li> Keep trying other brands, but keep coming back.</li>
            <li> Dry, but not overly dry where you will begin getting a rash.</li>
            <li> Overall, the Secret Outlast works very well for me.</li>
            <li> This dried fairly fast after application, under a minute and after working all day and heavy workouts</li>
            <li> A solid goes on smooth and feels silky, but a gel goes on wet and cold and dries sticky-ish.</li>
            <li> I get no white residue on my dark clothes and it works to keep odor away all day.</li>
            <li> The majority of my experience with this product has been during cooler weather where I am much less likely to work up a sweat.</li>
            <li> Typically one click dispenses enough product for 1 underarm.</li>
            <li> prefer clear gel antiperspirants because I feel that they are less likely to leave white residue behind on my clothes.</li>
            <li> because, let&#x27;s face it, clear solids still leave some white residue behind ).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel wet</li>
            <li> After trying this out for a few weeks, I have seen minimal wetness and NO WHITE MARKS.</li>
            <li> Going on clear, this product does not leave behind the pesky white marks that other deodorants do.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this new secret outlast, it really does out last every thing else I have tried.</li>
            <li> Thank you Secret OutlastÂ® Completely Clean Clear Gel and BzzAgent for being my secret weapon this past weekend when I ran a 5k with friends and family.  </li>
            <li> While the scent lasted a long time, it offered little to no wetness protection at all.  </li>
            <li> Those are usually all the things that I look for in a deodorant, but up until now I had only found in prescription strength formulas!</li>
            <li> Like the convenience of shipping along with other order items.</li>
            <li> And NO white marks like the solids I usually use.  </li>
            <li> Not a sticky feeling like with other deodorants.</li>
            <li> I have used secret before and for the longest time, I have searched for several products that will minimize the wetness in order to prevent white marks on my shirt.</li>
            <li> I have been a secret user since I was a teen but recently had to switch over to the clinical strength because of my job</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant claims to outlast any day providing 48-hour odor and wetness protection.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast clear gel did not disappoint.  </li>
            <li> Being a One2One Network member, I had the opportunity to test out the Secret Outlast Clear gel on behalf of clearlybetterchallenge.com.  </li>
            <li> Not with the Secret Outlast clear gel.</li>
            <li> They have never let me down.</li>
            <li> gel feels a bit sticky after application and is a  bit cold in when first applying.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is 2% less of the active ingredient in this product than my regular Secret solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been a long-time user of Secret products due to their innovation and constantly being at the forefront of the women&#x27;s deodorant scene.</li>
            <li> But...with the new Secret Outlast, I didn&#x27;t stink!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally like the gel because of the cold wet feeling but</li>
            <li> I am a very active person and secret out last</li>
            <li> I take a shower everyday</li>
            <li> This gel dried within a few minutes of applying it.</li>
            <li> Overall, I like the Secret Outlast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always stuck by the Secret brand, but I&#x27;ll probably go back to the solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let me preface this by saying that I am not a huge sweat-er.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the effectiveness of it&#x27;s wetness protection because halfway through walking the dog on a mid april afternoon in New York, I felt myself sweating through it...</li>
            <li> This used to be a bigger problem and it seems to be less sticky than I remember, but the wet and cold application is still there.</li>
            <li> I went through three different black shirts today and Secret Outlast didn&#x27;t leave any marks on them!  </li>
            <li> I have tried every brand of &amp;#34;super strength 48 hour odor control&amp;#34; deodorant product that I could get my hands on and none of them worked past a few hours.  </li>
            <li> It takes prolonged periods in extreme heat to get me dripping sweat, or extended periods of serious activity.</li>
            <li> and i never have to worry about any silly white stains.</li>
            <li> I usually use solids</li>
            <li> This had been a problem I came get past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very good about planning my outfits so after my shower and doing my hair, I usually slip out of my robe and head to my closet to try on shirts to wear for the day.  </li>
            <li> I usually get itchy underarms, I didn&#x27;t with Secret outlast</li>
            <li> I am a die hard Secret fan.  </li>
            <li> secret Outlast</li>
            <li> Secret OutlastÂ®</li>
            <li> BzzAgent and Secret for the opportunity to try this product.</li>
            <li> I am already a fan of secret products</li>
            <li> and I was, honestly, a little disappointed that it hadn&#x27;t really.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was wary to try a gel</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> , it was disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Secret Outlast put that to the test!!</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t like the fact that no matter when you put it on it burns horribly.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Fantastic product that really does last all day long! One thing that really impressed me particularly with this deodorant is that it didn&#x27;t cause itchiness, smelled great, and dried clear AND quickly. Those are usually all the things that I look for in a deodorant, but up until now I had only found in prescription strength formulas! The product is super affordable too, which means I&#x27;m going to easily make the switch from the more expensive one I was wasting $$$ on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about using a gel, but it really does dry fast and isn&#x27;t sticky at all. The fresh scent lasted all day and no white marks  :) i got a free full sized sample from bzzagent and some coupons and i am very thankful because i wouldn&#x27;t have tried the gel otherwise! I highly recommed this to anyone. Does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very good about planning my outfits so after my shower and doing my hair, I usually slip out of my robe and head to my closet to try on shirts to wear for the day.  I went through three different black shirts today and Secret Outlast didn&#x27;t leave any marks on them!  Plus it smells heavenly! I couldn&#x27;t believe that good smell was coming from me all day. As a member of one2one network, i received a free sample of secret&#x27;s new outlast clear gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com but i would buy it {even without a coupon which is saying a lot for this frugal mom} because it&#x27;s a work horse.</li>
            <li> Works well, great price and scent. I can use it right after shaving and it does not stain my clothes. As always Amazon has the best price around. I have it as part of my ship and save monthly delivery. You can always skip a month if you find them accumulating in your linen closet.</li>
            <li> I received my new secret outlast clear gel and have to say I love this product.  I don&#x27;t feel wet and I notice no odor at the end of day.  The scent is awesome. I think that this is a great value for the money.  I will be a fan for life.

            <li> I absolutely love the new Secret outlast clear gel. Goes on clear, no residue and works great. Going offroading and being outdoors, I need something that will hold up and this does it!! Even though I got this as a sample from being a member of One2One Network - I have used it before and will continue to use it. **I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from the clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>

            <li> I love that this does not stain my clothes at all!  As far as the antiperspirant/deodorant it was just ok, I found that I sweat faster (about 4 hours after applying) with this product than with others, and of course the sweat brought the smell.  So this product was just ok, because I can&#x27;t trade the security of smelling fresh for no stains.

            <li> First, it smells really really nice. Second, it works. I work in the Texas heat and need good protection and this gives it to me. I like that it is very reasonably priced too. Perfect for me. (Disclosure: I received the product free from clearlybetterchallenge.com  as a member of One2One Network)</li>
            <li> I have been a long-time user of Secret products due to their innovation and constantly being at the forefront of the women&#x27;s deodorant scene. I think Secret brand was one of the first deodorants that I ever had as a teen or tween, and it is still one of my favorite brands to this day. I love the variety of products that they offer to cater to the individual preferences and unique needs of everyone who purchases odor protection products. I recently tried the Secret Outlast Sport Fresh Scent, and I have to say that I like it. Let me preface this by saying that I am not a huge sweat-er. It takes prolonged periods in extreme heat to get me dripping sweat, or extended periods of serious activity. Most of the time regular strength deodorant does just fine for me. I cannot attest to how well this will work for anyone who experiences perspiration or body odors that are different from my own. The majority of my experience with this product has been during cooler weather where I am much less likely to work up a sweat. I also never go 48 hours without re-applying deodorant, so I cannot attest to it&#x27;s ability to keep you smelling fresh for an entire 48 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer clear gel antiperspirants because I feel that they are less likely to leave white residue behind on my clothes. This product is a clear gel that you click up. Typically one click dispenses enough product for 1 underarm. I smooth it on, and I&#x27;m good to go. I haven&#x27;t experienced transfer onto my clothes from using this which is one of my favorite features. I wear black a lot, so I need something that is not going to transfer, as it is much more noticeable on darker clothes. I found that the scent of the Sport Fresh is very clean and light. Overall, the Secret Outlast works very well for me. There were times when I could smell a little odor coming through, but this does a much better job at masking the odor than other products that I have used in the past. It actually works similarly to clinical strength varieties that I have tried before. I think it is a tremendous value for the money, and I would absolutely recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> The Secret Outlast in clear gel worked great for an average day, but you&#x27;ll need to use more than one or two clicks of the gel if you&#x27;re hoping it will last during an intense workout. I liked the scent and the fact that it dries quickly without leaving marks on my clothes. I noticed during one or two workouts that it wasn&#x27;t protecting as I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> I received a full sized sample in exchange of a review, as part of a BzzAgent campaign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant works perfectly for me. Dries fast, leaves no stains in my clothing and protects me all day long. Always had problems controlling my sweat and finally I found a deodorant that suits me completely.</li>
            <li> secret Outlast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, if you want great protection and a wonderful scent, this is the one! It lasts over 24 hours for me. I take a shower everyday so I wouldnt know if it lasts the whole 48 lol. But I love this deodorant.

            <li> I liked the smell and it didn&#x27;t irritate my under arms which is a huge plus for me</li>

It lasted me through the day and night and it worked great while working out too. It goes on totally dry (wetness was my main initial concern) and easily making it super convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with it is that it uses up very quickly (i find this is the case with any gel deodorant).</li>
            <li> I just love Secret! They have never let me down. I found secret outlast to be a good product, it smells really nice. I found that it also lasted longer than other products i have compared it against when either working out or during high stress situations. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this new secret outlast, it really does out last every thing else I have tried.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast Clear Gel Deodorant claims to outlast any day providing 48-hour odor and wetness protection. I found that claim to be pretty close to accurate. At the end of the first day, I could still smell the product, but about halfway into the second day, I began to notice some perspiration. I was a little worried that I would have that slimy feeling like with some other gels I&#x27;ve tried (which is why I stopped buying gels in the first place). Surprise! No sliminess! This gel dried within a few minutes of applying it. Now you can enjoy 100% mark-free clothes (because, let&#x27;s face it, clear solids still leave some white residue behind ). Great news for sleeveless summer shirt action! The one drawback, in my opinion, is the scent. It&#x27;s nice, but WAY too strong! I&#x27;d rather not have my perfume compete with my deodorant, you know? Overall, I would buy this product, but I would likely go for another scent or unscented. I received a free sample of this product to test. However, these opinions are strictly my own.</li>
            <li> Smells good but the container seems half empty, not much quantity for he price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of strong scents, so I love that this one is very light and fresh. It reminds me of the lemony scent of Purell hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li> I received this free to try in exchange for my honest opinion. After reviewing the deodorant for a few days, I was pleased that it does what it says it will. It will last an incredibly long time and protects against wetness all while smelling good and leaving no white marks. Because of this, I will give it 4 out of 5 stars. It does contain Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex Gly. This is why I can&#x27;t give it a 5 out of 5. This causes me and others I know to break out. I wouldn&#x27;t be able to buy the deodorant because of this.</li>
            <li> This is a longtime favorite.  Like the convenience of shipping along with other order items.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lady who&#x27;s active, sweats a bunch, and doesn&#x27;t like super girly scents. I find that Secret Outlast Sport Fresh scent does a really good job of covering up BO and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing (unlike all the solid deodorants). And, it smells pretty androgynous, which is a pro for me. However, it&#x27;s comparable to most common antiperspirants in terms of making you sweat less. If most antiperspirants work for you, you&#x27;ll be dry, and if you end up with sweaty armpits most of the time, you still will.</li>
            <li> I liked it. I don&#x27;t normally like the gel because of the cold wet feeling but this dried quickly and smelled fresh. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.  I was wary to try a gel but was surprised at the great results! This dried fairly fast after application, under a minute and after working all day and heavy workouts I remained dry and fresh. Would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> This actually works to keep my armpits dry and keep pit stains at bay. Of course, I still sweat but this helps a lot. It also smells really good, like jasmine. I liked that the gel dried pretty fast so I wasn&#x27;t fanning my armpits waiting to get dressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from the clearlybetterchallenge site.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised when trying this.  I&#x27;ve always had an issue with sweating, all of my adult life. I blame it on hormonal disorders.  After having my daughter I&#x27;ve become extremely self conscious of body odor.  Secret Outlast put that to the test!! It was incredible, kept me fresh all day long. It lived up to the hype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;disclaimer, I received the product free from clearlybetterchallenge.com  as a member of One2One Network</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant. I am a huge fan of gel deodorants in the spring and summer months. It doesn&#x27;t leave streak marks, and smells great. I love the feel as it goes on and keeps me fresh throughout the day.</li>
            <li> As a member of one2one network, I received a free sample of secret&#x27;s new outlast clear gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com. I&#x27;m absolutely in love with secret&#x27;s outlast gel deodorant. Even before I got this product sent to me, this is what I used on a daily basis. They smell amazing and because of the gel formula, they do not leave white marks which is a huge deal to me! This deodorant keeps me fresh and feeling great. I honestly don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to another deodorant.This is an amazing product and I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I have often used and liked this product, and that hasn&#x27;t changed. But while in a pinch, I ordered this from Amazon because I didn&#x27;t have time  to get a ride to the store, and when it was shipped to me, I was alarmed to find that it had no cap. The protective tape was still on it, but you guys might want to double-check that before shipping it to someone, just for sanitation&#x27;s sake. XD</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Secret&#x27;s new Active Fresh for about a week, and I am truly impressed with the long-lasting scent. It is pleasantly noticeable, and you can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s clean clothes, a body spray or a deodorant â€“ you just have this freshness about you that is noticeable (but in a good way). When wearing it to play basketball outside, I would catch brief whiffs of it, and I liked to know that I smelled clean and not sweaty. Overall, I feel fresh, clean and confident while wearing the deodorant. Going on clear, this product does not leave behind the pesky white marks that other deodorants do. I received this product for free from clearlybetterchallenge.com as a member of One2One Network. I would buy this again because of the scent alone.</li>
            <li> i absolutely LOVE this deodorant - it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my underarms feeling sticky or filmy. it lasts for a long time and i never have to worry about any silly white stains. perfect for the summer and for tank tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> Thank you Secret OutlastÂ® Completely Clean Clear Gel and BzzAgent for being my secret weapon this past weekend when I ran a 5k with friends and family.  It takes a few minutes to dry which is a pain, but it kept me fresh throughout the whole day, maybe not 48 hours but the full day at least!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has a lovely smooth application and delivers on every promise-- which was thoroughly tested after a long marathon day. Everyone around me was impressed with my bulletproof and sweat-proof Secret OutlastÂ® Completely Clean Clear Gel!</li>
            <li> The best Deodorant I know. It&#x27;s fresh, smells lovely and doesn&#x27;t leave white marks on my black shirts! Really great!!!</li>
            <li> I think Secret Outlast is amazing! I love the clear gel it is so nice not to have white streaks on my clothing and armpits. This product lasts all day there is no need to reapply it I am a very active person and secret out last kept me feeling clean and fresh all day long. Give it a try today. Disclosure I received this product free thanks to from secret</li>
            <li> love this stuff .  It keeps me clean smelling and dry without leaving white marks.  I love how it goes on clear and has a great scent that keeps me fresh all day long .  As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> Love this deo. I get no white residue on my dark clothes and it works to keep odor away all day. I like that it dries fast too. I usually use solids but this works really well. ( I  received this product free from clearlybetterchallenge.com  as a member of One2One Network)</li>
            <li> Secret is great Deodorant, it&#x27;s been around for a long time, my mom used it, and I&#x27;ve used it on and off over the years.  I received a sample of Secret Outlast Clear Gel and I have to say, it was disappointing.  While the scent lasted a long time, it offered little to no wetness protection at all.  I do a lot of running around, I&#x27;m a mom, I&#x27;ve got a full time job and I&#x27;ve got my own side business making candy and baked goods.  I was disappointed in the effectiveness of it&#x27;s wetness protection because halfway through walking the dog on a mid april afternoon in New York, I felt myself sweating through it... ugh</li>
            <li> Secret OutlastÂ® Clear Gel-outlast I&#x27;m not to sure about that! To me I find it last a couple of hours but then you would have to reapply especially now that it&#x27;s hot outside it smells great for a while and then you start to get that not so fresh feeling you know what i&#x27;m saying? It&#x27;s a good price for what you get I just recommend that if you live in a sweltering hot state like Florida or any other southern state don&#x27;t purchase this product because you will continue having to buy this over and over due to the constant reapplying. Sample received courtesy of BzzAgent #MomHack</li>
            <li> As a member of one2one network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s new Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generally, clear deodorants don&#x27;t work for me.  I have tried every brand of &amp;#34;super strength 48 hour odor control&amp;#34; deodorant product that I could get my hands on and none of them worked past a few hours.  For some reason, my body chemistry does not play nicely with clear deodorants and I smell worse with the deodorant than I do without it.  But...with the new Secret Outlast, I didn&#x27;t stink!  Woo-hoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate that the fragrance is very light and that there are no white streaks on my clothes.  This is a winner all around!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife who had used other scents before and liked them. She liked this one and believes it works well and lasts long too.</li>
            <li> I got to try this for free from Secret, so thought why not as I have never been a big fan of gels.  Unlike other clear gels I&#x27;ve tried, this is NOT sticky and dries fast.  Lasts a LONG time even in the warm Florida winters.  And NO white marks like the solids I usually use.  This is now my new deodorant!  Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Overall, I like the Secret Outlast. It does have great odor protection, well throughout the day. I do get a sticky feeling from it that I could live without.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is good, not overwhelming, but enough to be noticable. I&#x27;ve always stuck by the Secret brand, but I&#x27;ll probably go back to the solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks bzzagent for the chance to try it out!</li>
            <li> I was given a sample to try for free in exchange for my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;-The scent was strong in the container but just right a few minutes after application..&lt;br /&gt;-There was no white residue after getting dressed&lt;br /&gt;-Felt and smelt clean and dry after a long day including a gym workout&lt;br /&gt;- I could even lift my arms without fear of white specks in my armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel feels a bit sticky after application and is a  bit cold in when first applying.  Both the stickiness and coldness went away quickly and were not much of an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth it for the lasting protection and clean look in my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks BzzAgent and Secret for the opportunity to try this product. Its a keeper.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product, the moment you apply it you feel fresh....using it during winter may not be a good idea&lt;br /&gt;because it makes you shill rather than this it is good&lt;br /&gt;I highly recomend it</li>
            <li> Outlast outlasted me when we were on vacation! I usually get itchy underarms, I didn&#x27;t with Secret outlast</li>
            <li> The scent was excellent, I received a free sample and I can tell you, it was excellent.  No white marks, smell is excellent, no sticky feeling after applying it, and the best part is it really does provide protection for 48 hours.</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant! It smells great! Goes on clear so no white gunk on my armpits and it last up to 48 hours... what! #GotItFreeFromSecret</li>
            <li> Loved my secret outlast clear gel deodorant that I recieved free from secret! The best one hands down. Keeps me feeling fresh and smelling great all day even after a workout! Great for a man too.</li>
            <li> I have never tried a gel deodorant before. This product was a pleasant surprise! It smells great and protects me all day. There are no nasty white residues from it like other deodorants may have. Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> Secret Outlast clear gel fresh has an amazing fragrance that reminds me of a vacation, like a warm breeze at the ocean.  The gel is easy to apply and it&#x27;s a cool refreshing feeling too. It dries quick, no messy feeling or white marks right after you put your shirt on! Works well all day long to keep odor at bay and the fragrance last strong.I&#x27;d wear it just for the fragrance! but it works great too.&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com. The comments and views are my own.</li>
            <li> I am a die hard Secret fan.  Keep trying other brands, but keep coming back. This scent is nice and clean and the gel works well for me.</li>
            <li> I am already a fan of secret products so I love trying out their new items.  Secret Outlast clear gel did not disappoint.  I am super busy all day long from chasing my two boys, going to work, and running errands.  Even at the end of a long day I still had a nice fresh scent.  I also liked that there were no issues with white marks.  Secret Outlast went on clear and dried quickly which is a huge plus for me.  I will be purchasing this again in the future and I am excited to try all of the different scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> Fresh, clean scent with outstanding odor protection.  Secret makes excellent quality products.</li>
            <li> This is the best Deodorant / Antiperspirant I have ever used. It really IS strong enough for a man, and whether or not it&#x27;s made for a woman or not, I use it, and am NOT a woman. It&#x27;s the only thing that really REALLY works, and you have NO sticky mess, NO white marks, and NO odor whatsoever. It is THE BEST!</li>
            <li> I have had a complicated relationship with gel deodorant since the first day it was presented as a brilliant idea way back forever ago. I tried it then and have been a white solid kind of lady ever since. I was super excited to try this campaign to see if science had progressed since then and I was, honestly, a little disappointed that it hadn&#x27;t really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent &amp;#34;Completely Clean&amp;#34; smelled just like laundry soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no white residue after getting dressed, after a day of sweating in a tank top (call it &amp;#34;ring around the armpit&amp;#34;) or on my husband&#x27;s work uniform after his &amp;#34;Welcome Home&amp;#34; hug even though I was the &amp;#34;arms around the neck&amp;#34; participant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent &amp;#34;Completely Clean&amp;#34; was completely overwhelming. It leads me to believe that the 48 hours of odor protection comes from the body Febreze I smeared on my armpits as opposed to any mysterious bacteria/wetness protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel still feels a bit sticky after application. A solid goes on smooth and feels silky, but a gel goes on wet and cold and dries sticky-ish. This used to be a bigger problem and it seems to be less sticky than I remember, but the wet and cold application is still there. It did dry quickly though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The morning after application, my armpits smelled like a mix of residual &amp;#34;Completely Clean&amp;#34; and Natural Stink. Had to bathe and reapply before 48 hours were up. But I would have done that regardless...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is 2% less of the active ingredient in this product than my regular Secret solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, overall, I will keep this product on hand for tank top days and dress up days, but I will keep my solid for my sweaty stink days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks BzzAgent for the opportunity to try this product! #CompletelyClean #GotItFree&lt;br /&gt; I had fun!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and works great. I live in black and 40% of the time I get deodorant stains on my outfit and have to change. It is a little chilly to use on a cold morning ( it will be great in the summer :) it is worth the 2 second chill. It dries surprisingly fast and does not leave ANY marks. It is a great product if you are fighting the white!</li>
            <li> Smells better than I expected and it lived up to the hype throughout the day. Also dries quickly... Great product</li>
            <li> Secret is  a great brand and I love the clear gel formula.  It last in the hot south Texas heat even outdoors chasing kids.  It goes on completely clear leaving no messy streaks on those little black dresses or in my case t-shirts :).  The scent is fresh and clean, but not so overwhelming that it will give you a head ache like some other brands out there.  I got this product free through Bzzagent.com - but they don&#x27;t pay us so hey this is my honest review.</li>
            <li> Have been a raving fan for years!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something different so I got the Outlast Sport and was pleasantly surprised how well it worked, went on and dried (not sticky feeling). It worked all day. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> As a busy stay at home mom, my job doesn&#x27;t just stop in the house... You must run kids from sports to doctors appointments, to school or to even just running after the toddler in the back yard! Smelling fresh should be the least of your worries. I normally go for the &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; deodorants knowing I won&#x27;t have a problem, but normally get an irritation because I am just too dry. Tried Secret Outlast Sport Fresh Clear Gel as a free sample and fell in love. Fresh Smelling, but not over powering. Dry, but not overly dry where you will begin getting a rash. No problems running around outside with the kiddos this summer in the heat, I&#x27;m smelling fresh and feeling great!</li>
            <li> I love wearing cute cap sleeve shirts and when you can tell you&#x27;ve had wetness going on, it certainly is embarrassing. I have used secret before and for the longest time, I have searched for several products that will minimize the wetness in order to prevent white marks on my shirt. I never thought about trying a gel formulated antiperspirant. Being a One2One Network member, I had the opportunity to test out the Secret Outlast Clear gel on behalf of clearlybetterchallenge.com.  After trying this out for a few weeks, I have seen minimal wetness and NO WHITE MARKS. It&#x27;s a miracle. Who would have thought a gel deodorant would have helped my issue. I am pleased with this deodorant and if you are in my situation, totally try it out</li>
            <li> This deodorant lasts all day and smells really great.  It goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing.  I like that it is in the clear gel form.  I am pretty active and this keeps me dry.  As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com.</li>
            <li> As a member of One2One Network, I received a free sample of Secret&#x27;s NEW Outlast Clear Gel from clearlybetterchallenge.com to try. I have tried many deodorants in the past and a lot of my tops and tees really got ruined because of sweat marks and white marks from deodorants and they didn&#x27;t make me feel confident when sweating. Not with the Secret Outlast clear gel. Especially with the colder weather I am wearing more layers and that&#x27;s when the sweating starts. But the Secret Outlast clear gel works much better than other deodorants. It goes on clear and smoothly and doesn&#x27;t stain you clothes. It has a pleasant scent that is not too overwhelming. It dries fast and really gives you a dry and fresh feeling. Not a sticky feeling like with other deodorants. It really keeps me dry all day long and protects me from sweat odors. I highly recommend Secret Outlast Clear Gel.</li>
            <li> I got a chance to try this product for free.  I have been a secret user since I was a teen but recently had to switch over to the clinical strength because of my job I needed the extra protection.  I was happy to be able to try this and still have clinical strength on back up just in case I needed it.  I have never had to use back up with this product.  I am amazed at how well it works and it is a lot more affordable then the clinical strength.  I loved the sport fresh scent and have since bought the powder scent which is also a very nice light fragrance.  If you need good protection and are worried about white marks (I wear black shirts for my job) then this product will work great for you.  Keeps me fresh, clean, and dry even while I am working in the kitchen.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works absolutely great. It is clear and definitely create dryness. But I don&#x27;t like the fact that no matter when you put it on it burns horribly.  This had been a problem I came get past. I changed my razor,  put it on before I walked out the door, but still it burns. So however great it works,  I&#x27;m not an overall fan.</li>
            <li> Great antiperspirant, leaves you feeling fresh and streak free.</li>
            <li> Great deodorant. No stains, great, fresh scent! Can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
    </ol>
