            <li>Love this lamp!  </li>
            <li>This light is great.</li>
            <li>I do my own nails at home.</li>
            <li>I bought my own.</li>
            <li>but when I figured out that I was giving myself manicures and loving it</li>
            <li>Love the gelish product line.</li>
            <li>Purchased this machine for Mothers Day and was extremely satisfied with the quality.  </li>
            <li>My nail polish used to last for five days, as best.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Most important it works great curing polish fast.</li>
            <li>So far this machine is great.</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own gel nails at home for nearly a year now and was thrilled to purchase this as my Mother&#x27;s Day gift to myself.  :-)</li>
            <li>Easy to use, all five fingers fit comfortably , lightweight and stylish.  </li>
            <li>I knew it worked before I bought it because it&#x27;s the light</li>
            <li>I love how it turns on automatically when I place my hand inside and then turns off automatically (with a &amp;#34;beep&amp;#34;) when the curing time has elapsed.  </li>
            <li>Original shipment  did not include the cord, but the seller provided one.</li>
            <li>Worth the price!  </li>
            <li>I really love the lamp, i did my non-chip twice already and happy with yhe resoults, the nail polish stays long, and the whole process is liketwice srorter , instead of usind the UV lamp for 2-2h</li>
            <li>Love this lamp and came fast</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Worth the price in every way.</li>
            <li>It was well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The light is small and convenient and I got it for a good price.</li>
            <li>Everything I expected and more!  </li>
            <li>My manicure and pedicure is so much faster because if this lamp!</li>
            <li>Amazing , in style, worth the money as it works with all gel and shellec/ other led and  blue light 3 step or one step polish.</li>
            <li>This LED light cures gel polish super-fast and the interior is large enough to do your whole hand.  </li>
            <li>VERY.  </li>
            <li>Very roomy to accommodate any size hand.</li>
            <li>Really wanted to buy this lamp but just YESTERDAY it was 198</li>
            <li>this is the lamp they used at the salon I would always go to, my nails would last around 5-6 weeks with this light and the Gelish Polish</li>
            <li>Now, I can get at least a good 10-14 days out of the wear.</li>
            <li>This is the first one I found that actually works and comes with the lights.</li>
            <li>Was cheaper online than at any of the beauty supplies near me.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased a UV curing light since it was less expensive</li>
