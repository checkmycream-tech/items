            <li>and I know she is going to love them.</li>

            <li>I love these skulls.</li>

            <li>These are super cute and I use them all the time</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a great product</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li>The decals stay on with a great sealant, I put a small dab of nail glue on top of my nail, followed by the sealant and the decal</li>
            <li>I just love them so much.</li>
            <li>These looked more like aliens than they did skulls, very disatisfied</li>
            <li>I will order more and highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>These arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Came exactly how it looked in pictures!</li>
            <li>They sparkle and are really fun.  </li>
            <li>Probably will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>They had some sort of sticky sustenance on the back of most of them and they looked used.</li>
            <li>Bigger than I expected but still beautiful</li>
            <li>These are great quality, I was afraid they would be cheap looking, not the case at all.</li>
            <li>they cover almost the whole nail.</li>
            <li>They really don&#x27;t look like the pic.</li>
            <li>and they arrived fast.</li>
            <li>Looks great as an accent nail on a dark or grey chrome nail polish.</li>
            <li>They have a nice flat surface on the back to glue them on.</li>
            <li>Took a long time to come to my house, but for the price and free shipping</li>
            <li>I will definitely order some more in the near future.</li>
            <li>This is one of those rare purchases that I&#x27;ve made and just made me completely not want to order stuff like this from amazon</li>
            <li>They arrived faster than expected and are as pretty as ever!</li>
            <li>Which also means that it is raised pretty high off of the nail making it hard to clean and becoming questionable with sanitary, gluing on to the nail and practical use.</li>
            <li>Very cool and edgy!</li>
            <li>All of which are extremely important and must be taken seriously when purchasing items like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Does not come with the nails jut the skulls that was a waste of money</li>
            <li> I just got them yesterday and I will be using them on my nails today...</li>
            <li> I bought these 8 months ago And let me just say, my clients looooooove them ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è They are so pretty in person and they are perfect in size for your nails. I am deff buying again</li>
            <li> These arrived quickly. Great price. I just love them so much. I keep getting compliments about them. Probably will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> These looked more like aliens than they did skulls, very disatisfied</li>
            <li> These are stunning!  I just recently used these on my nails. I did one on each ring finger.  They have a nice flat surface on the back to glue them on. I wore them for 5 days and was able to take them off for re-use!  The crystals stayed shiny and didn&#x27;t fall out!  Wish I could submit a photo. To see them on my nails, check out Instagram. Username: Pinkcrayan !!</li>
            <li> These are adorable!!!  I love them!!  The look just like the pic and are the perfect size for nail Art.</li>
            <li> The sculls are well crafted.  They are very realistic, scary and delicate at the same time.  I will definitely order some more in the near future.</li>
            <li> I ordered them on May 11th and I got them today!!!! Super fast shipping!!! The skulls are really cute.  The crystals are iridescent and the skulls are shaped perfectly. I bought these cuties for a friend that loves skulls and I know she is going to love them. Thanks!</li>
            <li> they are bigger than expected. they cover almost the whole nail. They are beautiful though</li>
            <li> They really don&#x27;t look like the pic. They had some sort of sticky sustenance on the back of most of them and they looked used. This is one of those rare purchases that I&#x27;ve made and just made me completely not want to order stuff like this from amazon anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also really big for the nail even if it is my thumb. The size of it makes it bulky and would catch on fabric easier. Which also means that it is raised pretty high off of the nail making it hard to clean and becoming questionable with sanitary, gluing on to the nail and practical use. All of which are extremely important and must be taken seriously when purchasing items like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy these, what you see is NOT what you get!</li>
            <li> These are great quality, I was afraid they would be cheap looking, not the case at all. One drop of acrylic and they stayed on my nails for weeks</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these!</li>
            <li> It is beautiful but it took almost two months to arrive</li>

            <li> The decals stay on with a great sealant, I put a small dab of nail glue on top of my nail, followed by the sealant and the decal stays until you take it off!  I got a lot of compliments on my nails and I will indeed get some more!</li>
