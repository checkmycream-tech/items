    <ol>
            <li>Excellent value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Decent quality leather.</li>
            <li>Exelcent eyeglass case the best</li>
            <li>Excellent product.  </li>
            <li>If your glasses are slim, this product would be perfect for you.</li>
            <li>I am impressed with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>They work great.</li>
            <li>Great for the sunglasses that are not always needed.</li>
            <li>Great case for the money</li>
            <li>The others are probably good</li>
            <li>Looks good.</li>
            <li>This is a perfect fit for my sunglasses.</li>
            <li>Great fit and great price</li>
            <li>One thing I have found handy</li>
            <li>this item keeps glasses handy</li>
            <li>Good, but could be made better with heavier snaps, and a better grade of material.</li>
            <li>Making it very easy to take it off and get it on.</li>
            <li>I now attach it to the top of the belt loop strap, it stays and is handy and does not change the ease of opening to get glasses in or out.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t think of a way to make it better.</li>
            <li>Just what I need, it keeps my eye glasses and sunglasses secure and safe</li>
            <li>Just unsnap &amp; with fit most 1.5 inch belt or strap easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on.</li>
            <li>I always prefer to have things on my belt for easy access, and these fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>This case fixes securely to my belt and holds my glasses conveniently.  </li>
            <li>belt loop - not sure who wears these things on their belt these days.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good case - will protect my glasses nicely, without being too rigid of a case.</li>
            <li>fit my eyeglasses just right</li>
            <li>Great for large glasses, too big for readers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky I didn&#x27;t lose my $500.00 glasses.  </li>
            <li>but it does stop the case from trying to roll twist and dip on my belt which is much better than a unsnap able belt loop flat flap.</li>
            <li>Very pleased, I am thinking of ordering another to put back</li>
            <li>Gluing, that is making a belt way pass through also allows you to custom make the pass through size in accordance to the size of your belt has distinct advantages.</li>
            <li>Amazon made it right, but this item is junk.</li>
            <li>They shap on belt quickly but leary of snapping &amp; un snapping too much.</li>
            <li>However, this is exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>Unless the case has been designed for the exact width of your belt any case is going to be problematic and tend to dip roll and twist as it rides on your belt.</li>
            <li>This would increase the cost, but I would be willing to pay it.</li>
            <li>Fits my large sunglasses just right..</li>
            <li>The case is very adequate for standard glasses but is big but the large size makes it very easy to drop the glasses in.</li>
            <li>It serves my purpose very well</li>
            <li>Much better than expected.</li>
            <li>and I really like the look and feel of this product.</li>
            <li>It looks super cool and masculine at the same time!</li>
            <li>Thus far it has proven to be exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time so far they are holding up better than previous  case.  </li>
            <li>So, I unsnapped the belt loop flap judged the approximate size of the belt pass way I needed and then applied put a bead of super glue along the top of the case and then closed home the flap snapping it in place so that I have a true permanent belt loop hole on the case through which I can run my belt through.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Their design is easy to take on and off a belt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I purchased one in Black, and one in Brown, I&#x27;ll be leaving this review on each item.</li>
            <li>this eyeglass case is exactly what I wanted I was replacing a similar one and had quite a challenge finding this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s difficult to find this kind of case made the exact width of your belt.</li>
            <li>The hard bottom halves are going to make sure I don&#x27;t accidentally crush the pair in them.  </li>
            <li>Though they&#x27;re faux leather, they are soft and textured.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is that it&#x27;s a little cumbersome--seems as though the case is always in the way although it moves easily and can be positioned out of the way.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very accurate without any false alarm.</li>
            <li>- I generally always have a ballpoint pin with me, shirt pocket, trouser pocket, around shirt edge - where ever I could find at the time.  </li>
            <li>It would probably be just right for the average set of Sun Glasses - especially the big designer types.  </li>
            <li>They are not stitched very well and a little bulky.</li>

            <li> I needed an eyeglass case because I got tired of carrying my reading glasses hooked to the front of my shirt. This case fixes securely to my belt and holds my glasses conveniently.  The only problem is that it&#x27;s a little cumbersome--seems as though the case is always in the way although it moves easily and can be positioned out of the way.  However, this is exactly what I was looking for and I can&#x27;t think of a way to make it better.</li>
            <li> I bought this and it fell apart 1 month later.  I&#x27;m lucky I didn&#x27;t lose my $500.00 glasses.  Amazon made it right, but this item is junk.</li>
            <li> Excellent value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Decent quality leather. The case itself is not too thick, so if you have glasses (e.g. some sunglasses) that don&#x27;t fold down enough, they will not fit.&lt;br /&gt;The only feature I don&#x27;t like is the &amp;#34;wrap around&amp;#34; belt loop - not sure who wears these things on their belt these days.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good case - will protect my glasses nicely, without being too rigid of a case.</li>
            <li> fit my eyeglasses just right</li>
            <li> this eyeglass case is exactly what I wanted I was replacing a similar one and had quite a challenge finding this one.It serves my purpose very well</li>
            <li> The case is very adequate for standard glasses but is big but the large size makes it very easy to drop the glasses in. However, if you use it on your belt like I do it does not stay centered on my belt it tends to dip twist and roll. The belt loop snap on part of the case  lacks a way to keep the case from staying centered and properly oriented on my belt. So, I unsnapped the belt loop flap judged the approximate size of the belt pass way I needed and then applied put a bead of super glue along the top of the case and then closed home the flap snapping it in place so that I have a true permanent belt loop hole on the case through which I can run my belt through.&lt;br /&gt;  The glued flap does prevent the flap from ever being unsnapped and opened again but it does stop the case from trying to roll twist and dip on my belt which is much better than a unsnap able belt loop flat flap. Gluing, that is making a belt way pass through also allows you to custom make the pass through size in accordance to the size of your belt has distinct advantages. That being some belts are small and some are large so buying this case and then gluing the pass through to the size of the belt assures it will work well. It&#x27;s difficult to find this kind of case made the exact width of your belt. Unless the case has been designed for the exact width of your belt any case is going to be problematic and tend to dip roll and twist as it rides on your belt. So that as it does it not only makes the insertion of your glasses into a moving target hole it looks unattractive and out of place on your belt.</li>
            <li> They are not stitched very well and a little bulky.</li>
            <li> The leather strap that holds the case on the belt detached from the case after a few days of use.</li>
            <li> Worked well, but the extra decorative button scratched the frame of my glasses so I ended up going with a hard shell box case instead.</li>
            <li> It was just what i needed for work since my shirts do not have a pocket and I do not need my glasses when I&#x27;m not reading.</li>
            <li> just the thing i was looking for ty</li>
            <li> Exelcent eyeglass case the best</li>
            <li> Bad Product The Buckle broke the 2nd day and I had to throw it in the garbage. It probably was a lemon The others are probably good</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these eyeglasses cases for my reading glasses, since I am always misplacing them.  They work great.</li>
            <li> Thus far it has proven to be exactly what I wanted.  The missing 5th Star is for the size - much larger than I need for my glasses.  It would probably be just right for the average set of Sun Glasses - especially the big designer types.  Have not had any problem with it slipping around or opening.  I do usually just slip my belt through the strap when I am dressing rather than unsnapping and slipping around belt later.  One thing I have found handy - I generally always have a ballpoint pin with me, shirt pocket, trouser pocket, around shirt edge - where ever I could find at the time.  I now attach it to the top of the belt loop strap, it stays and is handy and does not change the ease of opening to get glasses in or out.  Very pleased, I am thinking of ordering another to put back so when I wear this one out I will have a spare.</li>
            <li> Much better than expected. Just unsnap &amp; with fit most 1.5 inch belt or strap easily. I have not had problem with snap opening up. I think if you do it a lot it will unsnap. I use them on briefcase &amp; back pack. I ordered 2. They shap on belt quickly but leary of snapping &amp; un snapping too much.</li>
            <li> The picture does not describe the second little strap. It unsnaps and wraps around your belt. Making it very easy to take it off and get it on. Great for the sunglasses that are not always needed.</li>
            <li> Just what I&#x27;m looking for.  Detector works like it shuold even in pitch dark.  It&#x27;s very accurate without any false alarm.</li>
            <li> Looks good. Easy to put on. Style was what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Poor quality than expected.</li>
            <li> Good, but could be made better with heavier snaps, and a better grade of material. This would increase the cost, but I would be willing to pay it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a case. not fancy. just a case to put my glasses in so they don&#x27;t get broken or crack.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect fit for my sunglasses. Great fit and great price</li>
            <li> Since I wear bifocals, and use a second pair as sunglasses, I need something on me to keep a pair from harm.  I always prefer to have things on my belt for easy access, and these fit the bill.  Though they&#x27;re faux leather, they are soft and textured.  The stitching looks well-done and unlikely to ravel.  The hard bottom halves are going to make sure I don&#x27;t accidentally crush the pair in them.  Their design is easy to take on and off a belt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I purchased one in Black, and one in Brown, I&#x27;ll be leaving this review on each item.</li>
            <li> Great case for the money</li>
            <li> Arrived on time so far they are holding up better than previous  case.  I recomendgetting this item keeps glasses handy but out of danger and well protected.</li>
            <li> Just what I need, it keeps my eye glasses and sunglasses secure and safe</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Great for large glasses, too big for readers.  Fits my large sunglasses just right..</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because the I wasnt a fan of the case my glasses came with. I ordered the brown one and I really like the look and feel of this product. It looks super cool and masculine at the same time! I wouldnt recommend this product if you have a thick or bulky frame to your glasses. If your glasses are slim, this product would be perfect for you. I am impressed with the quality of this product.</li>
