            <li>Great convenient bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered it for years and was happy to see it offered in the medium strength on Amazon.</li>

            <li>Faux Tan, a good thing.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizing and helps you keep a nice even glow.</li>

            <li>This is very handy and does what it says -- gives your skin A nice glow.</li>
            <li>Nice lotion with a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I use the fair to medium tone in the winter because I don&#x27;t want to appear too tan, just healthy.  </li>
            <li>This self-tanner is the best I&#x27;ve used and the color I get is absolutely spot on.  </li>
            <li>It never streaks and smells nice and moisturizes as well as tans.  </li>

            <li>It never streaks and smells nice and moisturizes as well as tans.  </li>
            <li>A nice tan look, not orange at all.</li>
            <li>When I used it by itself, it was kind of splotchy, but no one noticed except for me.</li>
            <li>Nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly with no blotches!</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>even if that was a healthy thing to do.  </li>
            <li>I like this lotion a bit more than the foam.  </li>
            <li>If I use this more than 2X/week then it makes me look orange.</li>
            <li>I then use a damp washcloth to go over my feet and knees, making sure the area of my ankle is blended in.  </li>
            <li>I make sure I wash my hands with lots of soap after applying the tanner.  </li>
            <li>Yes, we still go to the beach, but only the tourists have tans, lol!!  </li>
            <li>Yes, we still go to the beach, but only the tourists have tans, lol!!  </li>
            <li>I have to use it with another lotion, and that helps to make the color more even and gradual.</li>
            <li>Love the product for moisture and a conservative tan---and the pump version.  </li>
            <li>This does not make you orange, and I am pretty fair skinned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty fair</li>
            <li>I am very fair skin, red head &amp; can&#x27;t sit out in the sun.  </li>
            <li>this product has a very strong perfume smell but goes on nice and smooth and even it worked as described but gave me severe hot flashes</li>
            <li>Natural tan and smells great.</li>
            <li>so cool!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>East to use pump makes for an easy application.</li>
            <li>Works well and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
            <li>This is a really good product and I highly recommend it.suppose I could use it every day and get a darker color, but as it is, my legs match my arms and chest</li>
            <li>This is a really good product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I suppose I could use it every day and get a darker color, but as it is, my legs match my arms and chest just fine.  </li>
            <li>just fine.  </li>
            <li>My skin is light and this gives me a bronze glow on my legs so that I don&#x27;t have to wear stockings in the summer.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you cover all areas and wash your hands right after application.</li>
            <li>I like the foam one better because it&#x27;s easier to apply, but this is really good for touching up around the wrists where it tends to get a little streaky.</li>
            <li>A daily smoothing keeps me looking healthy and puts a smile on my face because I know I look and feel good.</li>
            <li>(you can also do this with a body creme or a really rich lotion).  </li>
            <li>a true light tan would look.  </li>
            <li>For fair skin the product didn&#x27;t actually show up even after 10 days of use, two times day.</li>
            <li>The moisturizing is probably good for you too, and has some basic sunscreen protection too.</li>
            <li>Love this product and the new smell is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Nice color (not orange) after just 2-3 days of daily application.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a nice moisturizer, so just replace your regular moisturizing with this and voila!</li>
            <li>I love all the Natural Glow Jergens products.  </li>
            <li>I then apply the tanner to my calf, making sure the lotion is evenly distributed and that it&#x27;s absorbed completely before moving on to my thigh.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pale and this lotion works great.</li>
            <li>, it goes on pretty evenly</li>
            <li>I also love the facial moistener.</li>
            <li>I first shave my legs and exfoliate my feet and knees with a body scrub.  </li>
            <li>Then I do my knees, again without adding any more lotion, using only what&#x27;s on my hands.  </li>
            <li>, I only wish I didn&#x27;t have to wait so many days for the tan to show up.  </li>
            <li>stars because I have to mix it with another regular moisturizer to get a better color.</li>
            <li>I got this brand because of some of the other reviews I read were good seems to smell better than a lot of the other products on the market nor no orange skin but seems to have a gentle darkening affect may use again</li>
            <li>I make sure my legs are completely dry and then apply either grapeseed or almond oil to my feet and knees.  </li>
            <li>Daily use is fast and easy.</li>
            <li>After doing both my calf and thigh, I then do my feet (but without adding any more self-tanner, I use only what&#x27;s left over on my hands) making sure to get between my toes and all around the outside but without doing the bottom of course.  </li>
            <li>This application method works really well for me</li>
            <li>and I get absolutely zero streaks or over-staining.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>ITEM AS DESCRIBED THANKS</li>
            <li>Works great, very subtle changes and doesn&#x27;t stain the hands.  </li>
            <li>Super greasy, not the same formula as what I bought at Walmart.  </li>
            <li>but the color does take several days to develop, which is kind of a drag.  </li>
            <li>Fades fairly quickly, but it&#x27;s nice as a daily moisturizer, so it won&#x27;t be hard to keep the color going.</li>
            <li>, second day i saw a little change, i was happy about it, my legs finally getting some color after winter, but day 3</li>
            <li>This procedure prevents the tanner from becoming too dark on my feet and knees.  </li>
            <li>maybe for people with darker skin it works better, but for my pale, ghost skin</li>
            <li>I do this application procedure every other day, which maintains my light bronze color.  </li>
            <li>The lotion itself smells nice, unlike other self tanners I&#x27;ve used, and it&#x27;s rich and thick</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and none of the natives are tan here.  </li>
            <li>I live in Florida and none of the natives are tan here.  </li>
            <li>at first i only used it on my elbows and didn&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
            <li>Make sure to get all the way down on the tops of your feet and around your ankles if you don&#x27;t want to be obvious!</li>
            <li>My body has found a friend in the natural glow lotion.</li>
            <li>Gives your skin a soft glow.  </li>
            <li>just a natural look</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Just a touch of color, natural and not orange.</li>
            <li>It does give a natural tan look that is gradual.  </li>
            <li>It gives me just enough color to look real.  </li>
            <li>Finally after how many years, a product that works, doesn&#x27;t smell nasty, isn&#x27;t bright orange and doesn&#x27;t look streaky!</li>
            <li>I love the subtle way this product &amp;#34;tans&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>when I was young there was no such thing as sunscreen</li>
            <li>It adds a bit of natural looking color to an otherwise very white girl.</li>
            <li>Problem for me was damaged skin, the aging sun spots that are red or kinda scaly and do not go away when exfoliated were extremely highlighted by the tanner cream so instead of blending in and less noticeable, the opposite happened and the spots are more noticeable now.</li>
            <li>Smells different, possible old?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the worst product I&#x27;ve used but by far the best.</li>
            <li>Also, it will come off on your pant leg if you cross a bare leg over it.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a long time.  </li>
            <li> and because it&#x27;s subtle you would really notice if you missed</li>
            <li> I then let my skin dry before getting dressed.  </li>
            <li> only downside I&#x27;ve noticed is that if you put it all the way down on your feet (which of course you&#x27;d do if you were wearing sandals), your shoes will rub it off.  </li>
            <li> I only wanted a slight color, but it has not even pulled that off.</li>
            <li> Not much of a smell.  </li>
            <li> You need to use it a few times to build up the color and then reapply regularly (every other day or two)  </li>
            <li> and this color won&#x27;t go away even after long shower,scrubbing and soaping 3 times a day, OMG!!!!</li>
            <li> Put it on just like you would any other lotion</li>
            <li> A little streaky in places, even though I was careful in trying to apply evenly.</li>
            <li> Not too dark,</li>
            <li> I do this so that the lotion does not over-absorb in these drier areas which would make the color too dark.  </li>
            <li> I use the foam for upper body since its not as thick and dries a little faster.</li>
            <li> This lotion is really subtle, depositing just a tiny bit of color each time you use it.  </li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s less chance of messing up.  </li>
            <li> It could be slightly less orange</li>
            <li> so a little is all I need to do my legs.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, heavy or laden with perfume.</li>
            <li> waste of money, time and SMELL, that SMELL</li>
            <li> However, I do like the way one use makes me look (for a few days until it wears off).</li>
            <li> I let the oil soak in for a few minutes</li>
            <li> I use it specifically for my legs all year round.  </li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t like being so pale that you can see the veins in my legs, either.  </li>
            <li> It is very thick which requires you to add alot each time.</li>
            <li> At first, it stinks and stinks bad!!!</li>
            <li> not when you apply it, but after a little while, like very bad!!!!!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to scrub/loofah like mad before you use it either</li>

            <li> Faux Tan, a good thing.</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks, I see no change in color. I only wanted a slight color, but it has not even pulled that off.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing and helps you keep a nice even glow.</li>
            <li> It has a light fragrance and an excellent moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 4 years. My body has found a friend in the natural glow lotion. A daily smoothing keeps me looking healthy and puts a smile on my face because I know I look and feel good. It&#x27;s not greasy, heavy or laden with perfume. It does start showing a glow within a couple of hours. I use the fair to medium tone in the winter because I don&#x27;t want to appear too tan, just healthy.  In the summer time it&#x27;s all out with the darker tan. I have never had a problem with an orangey look or hand discoloration. Of course wash your hands after applying!  I love this product!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.  Not much of a smell.  Gradual color.</li>
            <li> Finally a self tanner that I&#x27;m not allergic to! Goes on smoothly with no blotches!</li>
            <li> Works great, very subtle changes and doesn&#x27;t stain the hands.  Daily use is fast and easy.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Gives your skin a soft glow.  Just a hint of color so you don&#x27;t look so white.</li>
            <li> I got this brand because of some of the other reviews I read were good seems to smell better than a lot of the other products on the market nor no orange skin but seems to have a gentle darkening affect may use again</li>
            <li> Just had to try it!  Looks great!!  Not too dark, just a natural look</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.  I couldn&#x27;t tan if my life depended on it (red-headed) even if that was a healthy thing to do.  But I don&#x27;t like being so pale that you can see the veins in my legs, either.  This lotion is really subtle, depositing just a tiny bit of color each time you use it.  You don&#x27;t have to scrub/loofah like mad before you use it either, it goes on pretty evenly and because it&#x27;s subtle you would really notice if you missed a spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I&#x27;ve noticed is that if you put it all the way down on your feet (which of course you&#x27;d do if you were wearing sandals), your shoes will rub it off.  Also, it will come off on your pant leg if you cross a bare leg over it.</li>
            <li> At first, it stinks and stinks bad!!! not when you apply it, but after a little while, like very bad!!!!! that yo will have to take a shower again just to get rid of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;ORANGE ALERT!!!!! big times, from the beginning (day one ) i didn&#x27;t see any difference, well, I&#x27;m giving it a try, second day i saw a little change, i was happy about it, my legs finally getting some color after winter, but day 3 OOOOH GOD!!!! I BECAME ORANGE!!!! and this color won&#x27;t go away even after long shower,scrubbing and soaping 3 times a day, OMG!!!! maybe for people with darker skin it works better, but for my pale, ghost skin it was a disaster !!!!&lt;br /&gt;NEVER-NEVER AGAIN!!!! waste of money, time and SMELL, that SMELL i will never forget. EEEEEEeew</li>
            <li> Nice color (not orange) after just 2-3 days of daily application. A little streaky in places, even though I was careful in trying to apply evenly. Fades fairly quickly, but it&#x27;s nice as a daily moisturizer, so it won&#x27;t be hard to keep the color going.</li>
            <li> Natural tan and smells great. I have white legs Luke really white and this stuff works best</li>
            <li> Super greasy, not the same formula as what I bought at Walmart.  Smells different, possible old?  Didn&#x27;t seem to work as the store bought version did.</li>
            <li> East to use pump makes for an easy application.</li>
            <li> Wow. Finally after how many years, a product that works, doesn&#x27;t smell nasty, isn&#x27;t bright orange and doesn&#x27;t look streaky! You need to use it a few times to build up the color and then reapply regularly (every other day or two)  but it&#x27;s a nice moisturizer, so just replace your regular moisturizing with this and voila! Nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! Gradual tan that is not orange... Put it on just like you would any other lotion (it&#x27;s a bit thicker than my Vaseline Cocoa Butter lotion though). Make sure to get all the way down on the tops of your feet and around your ankles if you don&#x27;t want to be obvious!</li>
            <li> I did like it, works well overnight and not streaky, stinky or orange... Problem for me was damaged skin, the aging sun spots that are red or kinda scaly and do not go away when exfoliated were extremely highlighted by the tanner cream so instead of blending in and less noticeable, the opposite happened and the spots are more noticeable now. Moral of this story is wear sunscreen at all times so skin won&#x27;t get damage like mine-when I was young there was no such thing as sunscreen but sure wish we had it then!! If my skin weren&#x27;t so damaged, I would likely use this cream all summer.</li>
            <li> I love all the Natural Glow Jergens products.  I like this lotion a bit more than the foam.  For me I get faster color with the lotion.  I am very fair skin, red head &amp; can&#x27;t sit out in the sun.  This product gives me the touch of color I like!!  I also love the facial moistener.</li>
            <li> If I use this more than 2X/week then it makes me look orange. However, I do like the way one use makes me look (for a few days until it wears off).</li>
            <li> this product has a very strong perfume smell but goes on nice and smooth and even it worked as described but gave me severe hot flashes so I had to discontinue use I was disappointed because it worked so well I also used the face one</li>
            <li> Great for the fair skinned folks like me. It adds a bit of natural looking color to an otherwise very white girl.</li>
            <li> For fair skin the product didn&#x27;t actually show up even after 10 days of use, two times day. Was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> No smell, the &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; starts to develop just like it would if you were out in the sun all of the time.</li>
            <li> This is very handy and does what it says -- gives your skin A nice glow.</li>
            <li> so cool! at first i only used it on my elbows and didn&#x27;t notice a difference. when i started putting it on the lower part of my legs i noticed a difference but didn&#x27;t realize why i had a farmers tan. so i realized that its because of the jergen&#x27;s and i now use it all over, especially now that it is shorts weather. love it!!!</li>
            <li> I like the foam one better because it&#x27;s easier to apply, but this is really good for touching up around the wrists where it tends to get a little streaky. This does not make you orange, and I am pretty fair skinned.</li>
            <li> It does darken the skin, but it leaves alot to be desired. It leaves splotches and streaks. It is very thick which requires you to add alot each time. It&#x27;s not the worst product I&#x27;ve used but by far the best.</li>
            <li> Do not recommend. Gave it one star because it did not smell. But it left orange streaks on my legs. Will not purchase this again. Threw it away.</li>
            <li> Just a touch of color, natural and not orange. The moisturizing is probably good for you too, and has some basic sunscreen protection too.</li>
            <li> It does give a natural tan look that is gradual.  Nice lotion with a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff!!  It gives me just enough color to look real.  My skin is light and this gives me a bronze glow on my legs so that I don&#x27;t have to wear stockings in the summer.  It doesn&#x27;t streak at all but the color does take several days to develop, which is kind of a drag.  The lotion itself smells nice, unlike other self tanners I&#x27;ve used, and it&#x27;s rich and thick so a little is all I need to do my legs.  I first shave my legs and exfoliate my feet and knees with a body scrub.  I make sure my legs are completely dry and then apply either grapeseed or almond oil to my feet and knees.  I do this so that the lotion does not over-absorb in these drier areas which would make the color too dark.  I let the oil soak in for a few minutes (you can also do this with a body creme or a really rich lotion).  I then apply the tanner to my calf, making sure the lotion is evenly distributed and that it&#x27;s absorbed completely before moving on to my thigh.  After doing both my calf and thigh, I then do my feet (but without adding any more self-tanner, I use only what&#x27;s left over on my hands) making sure to get between my toes and all around the outside but without doing the bottom of course.  Then I do my knees, again without adding any more lotion, using only what&#x27;s on my hands.  I then use a damp washcloth to go over my feet and knees, making sure the area of my ankle is blended in.  This procedure prevents the tanner from becoming too dark on my feet and knees.  It works like a charm.  I then let my skin dry before getting dressed.  This application method works really well for me and I get absolutely zero streaks or over-staining.  I make sure I wash my hands with lots of soap after applying the tanner.  I really like this product, I only wish I didn&#x27;t have to wait so many days for the tan to show up.  I do this application procedure every other day, which maintains my light bronze color.  The color itself is not orange at all and looks like a true light tan would look.  I suppose I could use it every day and get a darker color, but as it is, my legs match my arms and chest just fine.  I live in Florida and none of the natives are tan here.  Yes, we still go to the beach, but only the tourists have tans, lol!!  This self-tanner is the best I&#x27;ve used and the color I get is absolutely spot on.  It never streaks and smells nice and moisturizes as well as tans.  This is a really good product and I highly recommend it.suppose I could use it every day and get a darker color, but as it is, my legs match my arms and chest just fine.

            <li> Love this product and the new smell is worth every penny. Just make sure you cover all areas and wash your hands right after application. Goes on smooth and one of the best affordable self tanners</li>
            <li> Good product for the price! I&#x27;m very pale and this lotion works great. I have to use it with another lotion, and that helps to make the color more even and gradual. A nice tan look, not orange at all. Doesn&#x27;t smell either.&lt;br /&gt;Four stars because I have to mix it with another regular moisturizer to get a better color. When I used it by itself, it was kind of splotchy, but no one noticed except for me.</li>
            <li> Works well and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
            <li> Great convenient bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a long time.  I like it because it&#x27;s gradual and there&#x27;s less chance of messing up.  I&#x27;m pretty fair so this works well.  It could be slightly less orange but it&#x27;s the best sunless tanner for the price - I use it specifically for my legs all year round.  I use the foam for upper body since its not as thick and dries a little faster.</li>
            <li> ITEM AS DESCRIBED THANKS</li>
            <li> Love the product for moisture and a conservative tan---and the pump version.  I love the subtle way this product &amp;#34;tans&amp;#34; the skin and it doesn&#x27;t have a bad odor.  I&#x27;ve ordered it for years and was happy to see it offered in the medium strength on Amazon.</li>
            <li> no  longer do I use powder on my eyelids to prevent smearing. My face glows and I feel awake.</li>
