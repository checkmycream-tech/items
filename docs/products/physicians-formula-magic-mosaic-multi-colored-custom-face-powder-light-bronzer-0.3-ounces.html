            <li>Pigmented and beautiful</li>
            <li>Nice!  </li>
            <li>This material goes on beautifully and since is is a palate of close colors, you can use one product to introduce shading as appropriate.</li>
            <li>Perfect golden and brown tanning points.</li>
            <li>Makes me look tan, I love it!</li>
            <li>and I just use my own.  </li>

            <li>and it stay on all day love it</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and know that it is an outstanding and dependable face powder.</li>
            <li>I love the lighter colors in the compact, but the difference in the shades causes for blotchy application.</li>
            <li>I love physicians formula products</li>
            <li>Nice setting powder with just the right amount of colour/bronzer.</li>
            <li>Color control comes from having all the colors available in a cake.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li>unlike most mono tone bronzers you can blend this to any color, or as much &amp;#</li>
            <li>I know it is marketed as a powder, but it works perfectly as a bronzer with several hue variations in the same palette.</li>
            <li>If you do, the cake may break apart and it will no longer be much fun to apply.</li>
            <li>love the natural tan it gives you</li>
            <li>One extra star for the idea of being able to customize the shade.</li>
            <li>You will need a makeup brush that does NOT come with this powder (nor does it come with most other powders).&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li>You can determined just how dark or light.  </li>
            <li>It makes me come alive in the mirror.  </li>

            <li> I realize that I myself am tan already, but you can tell how thickly pigmented the powder is by lightly swiping a finger on it, and hardly any powder shows up on my hand.</li>
            <li> Its okay, too bad it doesn&#x27;t come with a brush</li>

            <li> The brush that comes with the compact is a waste</li>
            <li> It gives my pale untanned face a glow.  </li>

            <li> I am not really impressed by this product.</li>
            <li> and I feel like it keeps getting darker (or maybe I&#x27;m buying the wrong color!).</li>

            <li> Love this brand for bronzer..</li>
            <li> I am not really impressed by this product. It doesn&#x27;t deliver the result I expected, so I would not really recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like that this bronzer doesn&#x27;t have any shimmer to it so you can wear it during the day.</li>
            <li> a great deal for the price!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It gives my pale untanned face a glow.  You can determined just how dark or light.  It makes me come alive in the mirror.  Love, love, love this product.  Will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> Its okay, too bad it doesn&#x27;t come with a brush</li>
            <li> This is great!  Perfect golden and brown tanning points.</li>

This was not worth the price tag. One extra star for the idea of being able to customize the shade.</li>
            <li> Nice setting powder with just the right amount of colour/bronzer.</li>
            <li> unlike most mono tone bronzers you can blend this to any color, or as much &amp;#34;tan look&amp;#34; on your face as you like.</li>
            <li> Pigmented and beautiful</li>
            <li> This material goes on beautifully and since is is a palate of close colors, you can use one product to introduce shading as appropriate. You will need a makeup brush that does NOT come with this powder (nor does it come with most other powders).&lt;br /&gt;Used to find it at my local drugstore chain, but with their closing, Amazon is my savior place to purchase now.&lt;br /&gt;The only admonition is that as with any cake makeup, you do NOT drop it on the floor. If you do, the cake may break apart and it will no longer be much fun to apply. Color control comes from having all the colors available in a cake.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> i do like this and it stay on all day love it</li>
            <li> It came all busted up. Not happy.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and know that it is an outstanding and dependable face powder. I find that Physicians Formula works for me, and I will continue to buy from them now and in the future.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product!  I know it is marketed as a powder, but it works perfectly as a bronzer with several hue variations in the same palette.</li>
            <li> I have been buying PF bronzer for years and I feel like it keeps getting darker (or maybe I&#x27;m buying the wrong color!). I love the lighter colors in the compact, but the difference in the shades causes for blotchy application. I do like that it stays on all day and does not make me look or feel oily. The brush that comes with the compact is a waste and I just use my own.  Next time I will be buying the next shade lighter!</li>
            <li> love the natural tan it gives you</li>
            <li> Nice!  I love physicians formula products</li>
            <li> Makes me look tan, I love it!</li>
            <li> Excellent coverage and ease in applying!  I will definitely purchase this again!!</li>
