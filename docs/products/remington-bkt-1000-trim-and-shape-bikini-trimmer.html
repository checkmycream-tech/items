            <li>I am so pleased with the results!  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and does a great job.</li>
            <li>It works great on his chest and it&#x27;s hastle free.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s good for literally trimming, but anyone could just use scissors for that.</li>
            <li>It is a nice trimmer, I wished it would trim alittle closer to the skin without the fear of getting nicked, I was once ..</li>
            <li>I could not find it in the store and was thrilled to see it was here.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s especially useful when you also have the remington precision trimmer for the smallest details.</li>
            <li>, it makes an effective compact travel clipper.  </li>
            <li>Good one, it helps me in keeping my frech beard clean and maintain good shape.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and light-weight as well.</li>
            <li>Cleaning it is very easy too.</li>
            <li>It even comes with it&#x27;s own travel bag and cleaning brush :)</li>
            <li>;) LOL</li>
            <li>That may be fine if you want a \\&quot;long\\&quot; trim, but if you&#x27;re trying to get something a tad shorter, watch out!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and comes with it&#x27;s own case and cleaning brush.  </li>
            <li>if your looking for a quick fix its a good buy</li>
            <li>That said let me assure you that this trimmer does a fine job trimming all kind of hair.</li>
            <li>The Reminton Bikini Trimmer is fabulous!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll better get another one just for me</li>
            <li>I really, really love this product and would reccomed it to anyone looking for something to help keep things under control.</li>
            <li>I guess you can&#x27;t expect top notch performance for 9.99.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are several lengths you can set it at, so it&#x27;s perfect for everyone.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had it for many years already.  </li>
            <li>It is safe to use.</li>
            <li>Not recommended if you are trying to eliminate the hair, but do recommend if you are trying to eliminate the bulk. :)</li>
            <li>But if you are into grooming and the modern look in lady-garden scaping, this is a great tool.</li>
            <li>My husband and i both use it, and it&#x27;s the best personal trimmer either of us has owned.</li>
            <li>Totally love this trimmer</li>
            <li>If you like a close shave do not buy this invest in something better.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who opts for a more groomed look.</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li>, I wanted my baby&#x27;s daddy to be able to trim me when I could no longer reach over my belly</li>
            <li>I even bought one for my mom several years ago because it&#x27;s so awesome.  </li>
            <li>Great product and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I am glad I found this product, it makes keeping that area neat and clean a very easy task.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use - very light weight and portable.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t let the $9.00 price fool you, this handy little gadget is wonderful!</li>
            <li>It is worth the price for sure!</li>
            <li>The trimmer seems to work great so far!</li>
            <li>Great price, easy to hold and to use, easy to clean, and does exactly what I had hoped it would.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll better save some money and get a cheap one.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I had to get another.  </li>
            <li>She says Its handy easy to use and worth the price.</li>
            <li>It give you lots of options in terms of length and is extremely easy to use.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong with no problems.  </li>
            <li>After years of trying to figure out the perfect way to manacure that down there area, I found this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and really easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is a fine product for the price.</li>
            <li>At first this seems like an awesome deal: you get a product that works well for a very low price.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is super!  </li>
            <li>She says its very handy, trims hair, no allergies or rash, and easy to carry, no charging only battery needed which works for some months.</li>
            <li>I got one of these and liked it so much I bought one for all my friends.  </li>
            <li>I like this trimmer because it is easy to use and clean</li>
            <li>This is a really cheap trimmer and it shows.....</li>
            <li>: I recently discover that this works great on my dog....</li>
            <li>To be quite frank, I do not do the hair free thing.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great product.</li>
            <li>Since it was so cheap</li>
            <li>My wife liked it so much that she got another two to gift her friends.</li>
            <li>this one isn&#x27;t available anymore.</li>
            <li>I really like that this one is adjustable, so I bought a second one and am very happy.</li>
            <li>The adjustable comb allows quick and easy trimming of hairs you want to leave.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>My original one broke after about 4 years</li>
            <li>a pretty case, I love mine.</li>
            <li>Ok, I will be the first to admit that this little gadget does not do a very good job of getting an area smooth, BUT that&#x27;s not why I bought it.</li>
            <li>It takes just seconds and the clean up is a breeze.  </li>
            <li>Solid build, good trimmer and</li>
            <li>Its worth Buying and really cheap at Amazon.</li>
            <li>The size is perfect to get into delicate areas without feeling like you are going to nick yourself.</li>
            <li>So far I have liked this product.</li>
            <li>All these reviews made it sound like exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The shortest available length is very close, and I think would satisfy anyone who&#x27;s just looking to be clean and neat.</li>
            <li>It is really easy to use and very efficient.</li>
            <li>First, know this, it is a trimmer not a shaver!  </li>
            <li>To be blunt, if you aren&#x27;t looking to go \\&quot;bald\\&quot; but want to be pretty close to it, this is for you!</li>
            <li>This product is so easy to use, fairly quiet and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>But feel like not that powerful.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the $15 i paid at target.</li>
            <li>I really like this Trimmer - trims nicely and leaves no razor burn on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get very close, but it&#x27;s very useful if it&#x27;s been a while</li>
            <li>This product is still going strong on the original battery (just about ready for a new one).</li>
            <li>Works better than I expected; Easy to control</li>
            <li>I am new to shaving the pubic area because I have fine hair there and didn&#x27;t feel the need too before.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, this is great to keep your hair shorter than usual.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly easy to cut yourself - pain and blood in that sensitive of an area is UNCOOL.</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying a trimmer.</li>
            <li>It gives a very close trim if wanted too!</li>
            <li>My puppy chewed my first one of these (my fault--</li>
            <li>It uses batteries, but I don&#x27;t recall ever needing to change the battery in the four or five years that I had the first one.</li>
            <li>although occasionally the top part that holds the razors pops off...</li>
            <li>This suited the needs of exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it does.  </li>
            <li>i think i&#x27;m going to my one more for a back up.</li>
            <li>I tried using the longest trim first which couldnt catch any of my hairs</li>
            <li>and it looks pretty w/</li>
            <li>Without it, you can get a pretty close trim.</li>
            <li>The remington shaver didn&#x27;t give a close enough shave... would work ok for use before a closer shave or waxing...</li>
            <li>much better than a standard razor or the \\&quot;pen\\&quot; style trimmers.</li>
            <li>The guard and length dial are durable and consistent.  </li>
            <li>I love this trimmer, it offers several different lengths and I always feel safe while using it.</li>
            <li>It is not the same as a razor or waxing, but it is a fabulous trimmer, i am very please!</li>
            <li>It makes trimming so simple and easy.  </li>
            <li>I find this beneficial when navigating certain areas.   </li>
            <li>This little device has gotten more than it worth in use.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Really I like this piece.</li>
            <li>I would not reccomend this for someone looking for a product that actually gets them smooth.</li>
            <li>I really expected more from this product.</li>
            <li>The trimmer doesn&#x27;t give you a close shave, which was the whole point of me buying it.</li>
            <li>Without the attachment, you get closer results, but still very visible hair lines.  </li>
            <li>but i did purchase it, and it works very well...</li>
            <li>It is a trimmer, not a shaver, but without the attachment, it really does trim very close.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much at all</li>
            <li>I would recommend against purchasing this product, unless you are okay with it no longer working after minimal use.</li>
            <li>Does not shave  as close as I hoped, but much easier than shaving cream.</li>
            <li>It doesnt really work for what I got it for though</li>
            <li>I paid full price back when it first came out and thought it was a deal then.  </li>
            <li>I left it in an easy place for him to find it in the bathroom), so when I decided to get a new one, I just went to Target and got a trimmer there.</li>
            <li>THIS LITTLE TRIMMER IS VERY EASY TO USE, JUST WISH YOU COULD GET CLOSER WITHOUT TAKING OFF COVER</li>
            <li>But unlike most other hair removal products it does it with NO irritation, NO rash and NO ingrown hairs because the hair is not cut to below the level of the skin surface.</li>
            <li>I had originally bought one of these at a local drug store to try.  </li>
            <li>YOu may need to drive through multiple no of times to get a clean cut.</li>
            <li>This is my second trimmer, the first stop working due to my own error.  </li>
            <li>The guard allows one to select how long to leave the hair, and comfortably protects the skin from nicks.  </li>
            <li>but I wanted a shorter still natural look for his birth and its it really only works for taking it all off or barely catching any hairs your vajayjay will end up looking like a chinese mans beard if you use the comb.</li>
            <li>It keeps the area clean but not bare.  </li>
            <li>but you better be careful with those sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer because it gives you a close enough trim without being too short.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>and this doesn&#x27;t give me any of that, which is why I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>You will need to be dry to use this trimmer, and clean up is a breeze.</li>
            <li>I have owned this model in the past (loved it) and recently bought a new one.  </li>
            <li>And the other reviews were accurate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 years now (though I just purchased a new one after losing it)</li>
            <li>but if it gets even slightly wet, for example when you clean it, it stops working.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking into buying that Finishing Touch pencil-sized product since it would fit easier into tight areas.  </li>
            <li>The one drawback is that it&#x27;s a little noisy - a sort of loud buzzing sound.</li>
            <li>It is still cutting great.</li>
            <li>PS - it&#x27;s also rather loud.</li>
            <li>There are several settings, which I find very helpful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going to remove the hair completely - that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s designed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Did not notice it was all that loud (another review).</li>
            <li>(and I&#x27;m talkng the WHOLE area, not just upper thighs)</li>
            <li>Bottom line, is worth for money spent.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to clean and I especially like that it uses regular AAA batteries rather than a recharging unit as those seem to go bad quickly.</li>
            <li>I still use it for now though to be silky soft bald, I dont think ill be able to trust my guys with it down there though because if your not very careful it would be very easy to cut yourself.</li>
            <li>It comes with a little brush to wipe clean the blades and a storage bag to keep it in.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly for touch ups between waxings, though the different length options make it feasible to use for almost any type of hair trimming.  </li>
            <li>Cute, small, several length selections    </li>
            <li>the second time.she had it for a year the first one and left it at her friends house.</li>
            <li>Just be careful if you take out the protected cover because is there for a very good reason.... to avoid you the pain of cutting your n..s or</li>
            <li>I would certainly not recommend this product, but might be necessary if you&#x27;ll be traveling and need a small portable trimmer that will get more results than just letting your hair grow wild.</li>
            <li>Worked well, the batteries lasted a long time, it works with wet or dry, has various settings, and it was easy to handle in the shower.</li>
            <li>Like the other review says, this product is so much easier to use than scissors.  </li>
            <li>To all future buyers... If you are thinking of purchasing this product keep in mind that since it is a trimmer it will not shave closely and there will be stubble apparent.</li>
            <li>and it really cuts down on shaving time.  </li>

            <li> I think it&#x27;s especially useful when you also have the remington precision trimmer for the smallest details.</li>
            <li> , it makes an effective compact travel clipper.  </li>
            <li> Good one, it helps me in keeping my frech beard clean and maintain good shape.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and light-weight as well.</li>
            <li> Cleaning it is very easy too.</li>
            <li> It even comes with it&#x27;s own travel bag and cleaning brush :)</li>
            <li> ;) LOL</li>
            <li> That may be fine if you want a \\&quot;long\\&quot; trim, but if you&#x27;re trying to get something a tad shorter, watch out!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and comes with it&#x27;s own case and cleaning brush.  </li>
            <li> if your looking for a quick fix its a good buy</li>
            <li> That said let me assure you that this trimmer does a fine job trimming all kind of hair.</li>
            <li> The Reminton Bikini Trimmer is fabulous!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll better get another one just for me</li>
            <li> I really, really love this product and would reccomed it to anyone looking for something to help keep things under control.</li>
            <li> I guess you can&#x27;t expect top notch performance for 9.99.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are several lengths you can set it at, so it&#x27;s perfect for everyone.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had it for many years already.  </li>
            <li> It is safe to use.</li>
            <li> Not recommended if you are trying to eliminate the hair, but do recommend if you are trying to eliminate the bulk. :)</li>
            <li> But if you are into grooming and the modern look in lady-garden scaping, this is a great tool.</li>
            <li> My husband and i both use it, and it&#x27;s the best personal trimmer either of us has owned.</li>
            <li> Totally love this trimmer</li>
            <li> If you like a close shave do not buy this invest in something better.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who opts for a more groomed look.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li> , I wanted my baby&#x27;s daddy to be able to trim me when I could no longer reach over my belly</li>
            <li> I even bought one for my mom several years ago because it&#x27;s so awesome.  </li>
            <li> Great product and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I am glad I found this product, it makes keeping that area neat and clean a very easy task.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use - very light weight and portable.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t let the $9.00 price fool you, this handy little gadget is wonderful!</li>
            <li> It is worth the price for sure!</li>
            <li> The trimmer seems to work great so far!</li>
            <li> Great price, easy to hold and to use, easy to clean, and does exactly what I had hoped it would.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll better save some money and get a cheap one.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much I had to get another.  </li>
            <li> She says Its handy easy to use and worth the price.</li>
            <li> It give you lots of options in terms of length and is extremely easy to use.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong with no problems.  </li>
            <li> After years of trying to figure out the perfect way to manacure that down there area, I found this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight and really easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a fine product for the price.</li>
            <li> At first this seems like an awesome deal: you get a product that works well for a very low price.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is super!  </li>
            <li> She says its very handy, trims hair, no allergies or rash, and easy to carry, no charging only battery needed which works for some months.</li>
            <li> I got one of these and liked it so much I bought one for all my friends.  </li>
            <li> I like this trimmer because it is easy to use and clean</li>
            <li> This is a really cheap trimmer and it shows.....</li>
            <li> : I recently discover that this works great on my dog....</li>
            <li> To be quite frank, I do not do the hair free thing.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great product.</li>
            <li> Since it was so cheap</li>
            <li> My wife liked it so much that she got another two to gift her friends.</li>
            <li> this one isn&#x27;t available anymore.</li>
            <li> I really like that this one is adjustable, so I bought a second one and am very happy.</li>
            <li> The adjustable comb allows quick and easy trimming of hairs you want to leave.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> My original one broke after about 4 years</li>
            <li> a pretty case, I love mine.</li>
            <li> Ok, I will be the first to admit that this little gadget does not do a very good job of getting an area smooth, BUT that&#x27;s not why I bought it.</li>
            <li> It takes just seconds and the clean up is a breeze.  </li>
            <li> Solid build, good trimmer and</li>
            <li> Its worth Buying and really cheap at Amazon.</li>
            <li> The size is perfect to get into delicate areas without feeling like you are going to nick yourself.</li>
            <li> So far I have liked this product.</li>
            <li> All these reviews made it sound like exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The shortest available length is very close, and I think would satisfy anyone who&#x27;s just looking to be clean and neat.</li>
            <li> It is really easy to use and very efficient.</li>
            <li> First, know this, it is a trimmer not a shaver!  </li>
            <li> To be blunt, if you aren&#x27;t looking to go \\&quot;bald\\&quot; but want to be pretty close to it, this is for you!</li>
            <li> This product is so easy to use, fairly quiet and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> But feel like not that powerful.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the $15 i paid at target.</li>
            <li> I really like this Trimmer - trims nicely and leaves no razor burn on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get very close, but it&#x27;s very useful if it&#x27;s been a while</li>
            <li> This product is still going strong on the original battery (just about ready for a new one).</li>
            <li> Works better than I expected; Easy to control</li>
            <li> I am new to shaving the pubic area because I have fine hair there and didn&#x27;t feel the need too before.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, this is great to keep your hair shorter than usual.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly easy to cut yourself - pain and blood in that sensitive of an area is UNCOOL.</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying a trimmer.</li>
            <li> It gives a very close trim if wanted too!</li>
            <li> My puppy chewed my first one of these (my fault--</li>
            <li> It uses batteries, but I don&#x27;t recall ever needing to change the battery in the four or five years that I had the first one.</li>
            <li> although occasionally the top part that holds the razors pops off...</li>
            <li> This suited the needs of exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it does.  </li>
            <li> i think i&#x27;m going to my one more for a back up.</li>
            <li> I tried using the longest trim first which couldnt catch any of my hairs</li>
            <li> and it looks pretty w/</li>
            <li> Without it, you can get a pretty close trim.</li>
            <li> The remington shaver didn&#x27;t give a close enough shave... would work ok for use before a closer shave or waxing...</li>
            <li> much better than a standard razor or the \\&quot;pen\\&quot; style trimmers.</li>
            <li> The guard and length dial are durable and consistent.  </li>
            <li> I love this trimmer, it offers several different lengths and I always feel safe while using it.</li>
            <li> It is not the same as a razor or waxing, but it is a fabulous trimmer, i am very please!</li>
            <li> It makes trimming so simple and easy.  </li>
            <li> I find this beneficial when navigating certain areas.   </li>
            <li> This little device has gotten more than it worth in use.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Really I like this piece.</li>
            <li> I would not reccomend this for someone looking for a product that actually gets them smooth.</li>
            <li> I really expected more from this product.</li>
            <li> The trimmer doesn&#x27;t give you a close shave, which was the whole point of me buying it.</li>
            <li> Without the attachment, you get closer results, but still very visible hair lines.  </li>
            <li> but i did purchase it, and it works very well...</li>
            <li> It is a trimmer, not a shaver, but without the attachment, it really does trim very close.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much at all</li>
            <li> I would recommend against purchasing this product, unless you are okay with it no longer working after minimal use.</li>
            <li> Does not shave  as close as I hoped, but much easier than shaving cream.</li>
            <li> It doesnt really work for what I got it for though</li>
            <li> I paid full price back when it first came out and thought it was a deal then.  </li>
            <li> I left it in an easy place for him to find it in the bathroom), so when I decided to get a new one, I just went to Target and got a trimmer there.</li>
            <li> THIS LITTLE TRIMMER IS VERY EASY TO USE, JUST WISH YOU COULD GET CLOSER WITHOUT TAKING OFF COVER</li>
            <li> But unlike most other hair removal products it does it with NO irritation, NO rash and NO ingrown hairs because the hair is not cut to below the level of the skin surface.</li>
            <li> I had originally bought one of these at a local drug store to try.  </li>
            <li> YOu may need to drive through multiple no of times to get a clean cut.</li>
            <li> This is my second trimmer, the first stop working due to my own error.  </li>
            <li> The guard allows one to select how long to leave the hair, and comfortably protects the skin from nicks.  </li>
            <li> but I wanted a shorter still natural look for his birth and its it really only works for taking it all off or barely catching any hairs your vajayjay will end up looking like a chinese mans beard if you use the comb.</li>
            <li> It keeps the area clean but not bare.  </li>
            <li> but you better be careful with those sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer because it gives you a close enough trim without being too short.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> and this doesn&#x27;t give me any of that, which is why I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> You will need to be dry to use this trimmer, and clean up is a breeze.</li>
            <li> I have owned this model in the past (loved it) and recently bought a new one.  </li>
            <li> And the other reviews were accurate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 years now (though I just purchased a new one after losing it)</li>
            <li> but if it gets even slightly wet, for example when you clean it, it stops working.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking into buying that Finishing Touch pencil-sized product since it would fit easier into tight areas.  </li>
            <li> The one drawback is that it&#x27;s a little noisy - a sort of loud buzzing sound.</li>
            <li> It is still cutting great.</li>
            <li> PS - it&#x27;s also rather loud.</li>
            <li> There are several settings, which I find very helpful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to remove the hair completely - that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s designed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Did not notice it was all that loud (another review).</li>
            <li> (and I&#x27;m talkng the WHOLE area, not just upper thighs)</li>
            <li> Bottom line, is worth for money spent.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to clean and I especially like that it uses regular AAA batteries rather than a recharging unit as those seem to go bad quickly.</li>
            <li> I still use it for now though to be silky soft bald, I dont think ill be able to trust my guys with it down there though because if your not very careful it would be very easy to cut yourself.</li>
            <li> It comes with a little brush to wipe clean the blades and a storage bag to keep it in.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly for touch ups between waxings, though the different length options make it feasible to use for almost any type of hair trimming.  </li>
            <li> Cute, small, several length selections    </li>
            <li> the second time.she had it for a year the first one and left it at her friends house.</li>
            <li> Just be careful if you take out the protected cover because is there for a very good reason.... to avoid you the pain of cutting your n..s or</li>
            <li> I would certainly not recommend this product, but might be necessary if you&#x27;ll be traveling and need a small portable trimmer that will get more results than just letting your hair grow wild.</li>
            <li> Worked well, the batteries lasted a long time, it works with wet or dry, has various settings, and it was easy to handle in the shower.</li>
            <li> Like the other review says, this product is so much easier to use than scissors.  </li>
            <li> To all future buyers... If you are thinking of purchasing this product keep in mind that since it is a trimmer it will not shave closely and there will be stubble apparent.</li>
            <li> and it really cuts down on shaving time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp, it cuts evenly and (so far) the batteries have lasted well.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it only lasted through two battery changes, and it doesn&#x27;t take long to use up the batteries.</li>
            <li> Batteries didn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like but would recommend the product anyway.</li>
            <li> Batteries last long</li>
            <li> Personally I think this would be a very strange gift from a friend or a lover</li>
            <li> Amazon tries to make it look like they&#x27;ve marked the price waaaayyy down, but I actually found this thing for a buck cheaper at Walmart after I bought it.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s too long (say before a wax or using an epilator).   </li>
            <li> The comb attachment keeps the hair kinda long.</li>
            <li> The shortest setting allows you to cut the hair about 1/4 of a inch and the longest probably about 1 inch long.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not interested in the \\&quot;totally bare\\&quot; look but want to keep your bikini area</li>
            <li> The safe-guard is very long on this shaver (a bit longer than a 1/4\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> I would not get this one unless you enjoy cutting into your private parts!</li>
            <li> I am not new to trimming my &amp;quot;personal&amp;quot; area</li>
            <li> Of course, this is a trimmer, so you won&#x27;t be completely bald down there; but if you don&#x27;t want a jungle down there either, then I would suggest this product.</li>
            <li> Only down side is that it is not rechargeable, it uses AAA batteries.</li>
            <li> I recently broke it when it took a fall from the top of my shower :(</li>
            <li> With the included height attachment, your bound to have a little fuzz still left.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super quiet, but no louder than any other electric razor-type thing.  </li>
            <li> I am quite disapointed with the product, because it runs on two AAA batteries, the motor is nearly powerful enought and will lock up sometimes when cutting hair in different angles.  </li>
            <li> And the batteries lasted longer than I expected..</li>
            <li> (Before this, I used scissors, no really.)</li>
            <li> Product is one of those items a lady didn&#x27;t know she needed until she tries it.</li>
            <li> , I was afraid of using it at first hoping not to cut myself, well not worries!!   </li>
            <li> As with any clipper, just a little maintenance and cleaning go a long way.</li>
            <li> Even the lowest setting leaves longer hair than what other users described as \\&quot;stubble\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit skeptical after reading what other buyers had wrote about the remington bkt-1000...</li>
            <li> I have used other Wahl products in the past and my problem with them is that they didn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> I also knicked myself, which is never a fun experience.</li>
            <li> In my opinion the length of trim this product provides is not worth the bother.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done easily and without fear of cutting!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves the idea of less hair in the area.</li>
            <li> It has a little bag for storage and a brush for cleaning.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to manuveur around REALLY sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s a \\&quot;personal\\&quot; trimmer, the head is narrow.</li>
            <li> I use it every few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I was even rough in a few spots by accident and not even one cut!!!  </li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer because I was tired of using scissors to trim that area and shaving is subject to ingrown hairs and cuts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for 3-4 years, with nary a complaint.</li>
            <li> It sucks that they&#x27;ve been discontinued and I hope mine never breaks.  </li>
            <li> I had it for at least 5 years and never had a problem with it.</li>
            <li> No more razor bumps!</li>
            <li> but now I am switching to another because I&#x27;m tired of replacing it because I cleaned it or dropped it in the sink.</li>
            <li> usually get awful razor burn (red bumps and ingrown hairs)</li>
            <li> But, I was very disappointed with the Trim and Shape because it doesn&#x27;t get nearly as close as I thought it would (even with no attachment).  </li>
            <li> but for what I know there is no perfect trimmer out there</li>
            <li> I was somewhat skeptical.  </li>
            <li> Im sad it is no longer on Amazon to purchase after my boyfriend ruined mine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sad</li>
            <li> Bad idea.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the customer reviews and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> ouch painful!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she absolutely loves it. Solid build, good trimmer and well designed.</li>
            <li> The Reminton Bikini Trimmer is fabulous! While it doesn&#x27;t trim as close as a razor (even with the comb removed) it does remove 99% of the hair, and neatly trims edges. But unlike most other hair removal products it does it with NO irritation, NO rash and NO ingrown hairs because the hair is not cut to below the level of the skin surface. The adjustable comb allows quick and easy trimming of hairs you want to leave. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have used this product a ton, and it works excellent. Although I never use it with the safety on, because it doesn&#x27;t go really short. I haven&#x27;t had to change the batteries either and I have used it for almost 8 months now. Great product and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Such as mentioned above, it leaves a bit of hair, even on the lowest setting.  It is difficult to manuveur around REALLY sensitive areas.  I&#x27;m looking into buying that Finishing Touch pencil-sized product since it would fit easier into tight areas.  Otherwise, this is great to keep your hair shorter than usual.  PS - it&#x27;s also rather loud.</li>
            <li> I got one of these and liked it so much I bought one for all my friends.  It give you lots of options in terms of length and is extremely easy to use.  It&#x27;s not super quiet, but no louder than any other electric razor-type thing.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I usually get awful razor burn (red bumps and ingrown hairs) and this doesn&#x27;t give me any of that, which is why I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer because I wanted to move away from using scissors in such a private area and I wanted to maintain a manicured appearance. I have to say that it serves its purpose and I&#x27;m no longer scared of snipping myself. I like this trimmer because it is easy to use and clean and it did not cost a lot. To all future buyers... If you are thinking of purchasing this product keep in mind that since it is a trimmer it will not shave closely and there will be stubble apparent.</li>
            <li> I brought this 2 days ago. Really I like this piece. Good one, it helps me in keeping my frech beard clean and maintain good shape. Bottom line, is worth for money spent.</li>
            <li> After looking at and reading about various products,I chose to go with this one.And the other reviews were accurate.It&#x27;s not a shaver,it&#x27;s a groomer.And,for the price,it does a great job.And the batteries lasted longer than I expected..</li>
            <li> This is a really cheap trimmer and it shows..... but for what I know there is no perfect trimmer out there so I&#x27;ll better save some money and get a cheap one. That said let me assure you that this trimmer does a fine job trimming all kind of hair. Just be careful if you take out the protected cover because is there for a very good reason.... to avoid you the pain of cutting your n..s or whatever part you are trimming. If you want a close cut you need to take that cover out but you better be careful with those sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PD: I recently discover that this works great on my dog....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come to think about it... I&#x27;ll better get another one just for me ;) LOL</li>
            <li> Ok, I will be the first to admit that this little gadget does not do a very good job of getting an area smooth, BUT that&#x27;s not why I bought it. To be quite frank, I do not do the hair free thing. This trimmer is excellent for keeping things neat, and I love it! (Before this, I used scissors, no really.) Since it&#x27;s a \\&quot;personal\\&quot; trimmer, the head is narrow. It&#x27;s similar in width to a regular razor. I find this beneficial when navigating certain areas.   The trimmer comes with a removable head that allows you to set how close you would like the trim to be. There are several settings, which I find very helpful. The trimming feature is also great because you can trim hair that&#x27;s too long (say before a wax or using an epilator).   You can also remove the head to actually shave off the hair. It doesn&#x27;t get very close, but it&#x27;s very useful if it&#x27;s been a while and you want to make it easier to shave with a razor or electric shaver.   I really, really love this product and would reccomed it to anyone looking for something to help keep things under control. I would not reccomend this for someone looking for a product that actually gets them smooth.</li>
            <li> Always wanted a trimmer that would not cut me several times in the process,  this remington 1000 its great, I was afraid of using it at first hoping not to cut myself, well not worries!!   I was even rough in a few spots by accident and not even one cut!!!  I love it; its great!!!</li>
            <li> I really expected more from this product. All these reviews made it sound like exactly what I was looking for. The trimmer doesn&#x27;t give you a close shave, which was the whole point of me buying it. Sure, it&#x27;s good for literally trimming, but anyone could just use scissors for that. Amazon tries to make it look like they&#x27;ve marked the price waaaayyy down, but I actually found this thing for a buck cheaper at Walmart after I bought it. So.. if you&#x27;re looking for something to just trim, get some scissors and save your money. If you&#x27;re looking for something to give you a close shave, get some Nair or visit a salon for a wax.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the customer reviews and was disappointed. Even the lowest setting leaves longer hair than what other users described as \\&quot;stubble\\&quot;. It is not a close trim.  I also knicked myself, which is never a fun experience. Would not recommend. I guess you can&#x27;t expect top notch performance for 9.99. Invest in something better!</li>
            <li> First, know this, it is a trimmer not a shaver!  With the included height attachment, your bound to have a little fuzz still left.  Without the attachment, you get closer results, but still very visible hair lines.  I am quite disapointed with the product, because it runs on two AAA batteries, the motor is nearly powerful enought and will lock up sometimes when cutting hair in different angles.  This lock up rips the hair out of your skin and sometimes even cuts you.  I would certainly not recommend this product, but might be necessary if you&#x27;ll be traveling and need a small portable trimmer that will get more results than just letting your hair grow wild.</li>
            <li> I had another one of these that I purchased at a store for the same price, but without the feature of setting the length of cut.      It gets the job done easily and without fear of cutting!</li>
            <li> I had originally bought one of these at a local drug store to try.  I FELL IN LOVE WITH IT!!!  I use it mainly for touch ups between waxings, though the different length options make it feasible to use for almost any type of hair trimming.  My original one broke after about 4 years and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere locally so I ended up looking on amazon and ta-da!!!  Don&#x27;t let the low price fool you- this really is a great product.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic trimmer!!  But please understand that&#x27;s what it is, a TRIMMER.  It&#x27;s not going to remove the hair completely - that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s designed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several lengths you can set it at, so it&#x27;s perfect for everyone.  Excellent value!</li>
            <li> Pros: Cute, small, several length selections    Cons: There is only a guard on one side of the blades. That may be fine if you want a \\&quot;long\\&quot; trim, but if you&#x27;re trying to get something a tad shorter, watch out! It&#x27;s fairly easy to cut yourself - pain and blood in that sensitive of an area is UNCOOL. I would advise getting a trimmer in which the blades are fully covered by a guard.</li>
            <li> I am not new to trimming my &amp;quot;personal&amp;quot; area but I have always used men&#x27;s hair clippers.  Finally, I thought a product made for women.  But, I was very disappointed with the Trim and Shape because it doesn&#x27;t get nearly as close as I thought it would (even with no attachment).  It still leaves stubble that looks like a 3-4 day shave growth.  So after you trim your bikini line you still have to shave it, which is what I wanted to avoid.  But all in all, if you still want a shag I guess it would be great.  And for the price, you&#x27;d just have to try it and see what you think.</li>
            <li> Just bought this product and I love it.  Easy to use and comes with it&#x27;s own case and cleaning brush.  Like the other review says, this product is so much easier to use than scissors.  Did not notice it was all that loud (another review).</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying a trimmer. I&#x27;m very happy with it. Gets the job that I want done a lot easier. It&#x27;s light weight and really easy to use. It gives a very close trim if wanted too! Plus no bumps or irritation. It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all! Comes with a zipper pouch deal too.</li>
            <li> My puppy chewed my first one of these (my fault-- I left it in an easy place for him to find it in the bathroom), so when I decided to get a new one, I just went to Target and got a trimmer there. Bad idea. That was when I realized that all trimmers are not created equal. I really like that this one is adjustable, so I bought a second one and am very happy. It uses batteries, but I don&#x27;t recall ever needing to change the battery in the four or five years that I had the first one.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit skeptical after reading what other buyers had wrote about the remington bkt-1000...but i did purchase it, and it works very well...although occasionally the top part that holds the razors pops off...it goes back on and would continue working...if your looking for a quick fix its a good buy</li>
            <li> It is a nice trimmer, I wished it would trim alittle closer to the skin without the fear of getting nicked, I was once ..ouch painful! All in all it does a good job and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used other Wahl products in the past and my problem with them is that they didn&#x27;t last.  This product works great and I&#x27;ve had it for many years already.  As a bonus, it doesn&#x27;t look like a men&#x27;s trimmer.</li>
            <li> As everyone else has said, this is a great trimmer. It is not the same as a razor or waxing, but it is a fabulous trimmer, i am very please! Only down side is that it is not rechargeable, it uses AAA batteries. I guess you could always buy rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> I brought this product through amazon and i used it couple of times. It serves the purpose. It is safe to use. But feel like not that powerful. YOu may need to drive through multiple no of times to get a clean cut.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer because it gives you a close enough trim without being too short. Not recommended if you are trying to eliminate the hair, but do recommend if you are trying to eliminate the bulk. :)</li>
            <li> Product is one of those items a lady didn&#x27;t know she needed until she tries it. Evenly trims pubic hair you don&#x27;t want to entirely remove without irritation. Quick and easy to use. Personally I think this would be a very strange gift from a friend or a lover and I wouldn&#x27;t use someone else&#x27;s either. But if you are into grooming and the modern look in lady-garden scaping, this is a great tool.</li>
            <li> This suited the needs of exactly what I was looking for. It is very easy to use and light-weight as well. Cleaning it is very easy too. Overall, a great product.</li>
            <li> This is a fine product for the price. I should have read the info closer to take notice that it is BATTERY ONLY.     Update: August 18, 2008. This product is still going strong on the original battery (just about ready for a new one). One note: This model does NOT require lubrication. Good product.</li>
            <li> What a great product!  It makes trimming so simple and easy.  It is a trimmer, not a shaver, but without the attachment, it really does trim very close.  No more razor bumps!</li>
            <li> This is my second trimmer, the first stop working due to my own error.  I loved it so much I had to get another.  I could not find it in the store and was thrilled to see it was here.  I would suggest anyone looking for this type trimmer to look over the rest and get the best :)</li>
            <li> The Remington Bikini Trimmer is painless and amazingly simple to use. Of course, this is a trimmer, so you won&#x27;t be completely bald down there; but if you don&#x27;t want a jungle down there either, then I would suggest this product. The shortest available length is very close, and I think would satisfy anyone who&#x27;s just looking to be clean and neat. You will need to be dry to use this trimmer, and clean up is a breeze.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 years now (though I just purchased a new one after losing it) and it&#x27;s a really impressive product.  It does exactly what it says it does.  I think it&#x27;s especially useful when you also have the remington precision trimmer for the smallest details.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It has three convenient settings and does a great job. It&#x27;s so easy to use - very light weight and portable. It even comes with it&#x27;s own travel bag and cleaning brush :)</li>
            <li> Just received this product and am impressed! It is really easy to use and very efficient. It is worth the price for sure!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for 3-4 years, with nary a complaint. My husband and i both use it, and it&#x27;s the best personal trimmer either of us has owned. Definitely worth the $15 i paid at target.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Totally love this trimmer and it really cuts down on shaving time.  I&#x27;m buying this for all of my female friends as future gifts.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer because I was tired of using scissors to trim that area and shaving is subject to ingrown hairs and cuts. This product is so easy to use, fairly quiet and easy to clean.  I am glad I found this product, it makes keeping that area neat and clean a very easy task.</li>
            <li> If you like a close shave do not buy this invest in something better.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t let the $9.00 price fool you, this handy little gadget is wonderful! Since it was so cheap I wasn&#x27;t expecting much at all but I was impressed. To be blunt, if you aren&#x27;t looking to go \\&quot;bald\\&quot; but want to be pretty close to it, this is for you!</li>
            <li> After years of trying to figure out the perfect way to manacure that down there area, I found this trimmer.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 3+ years now and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I use it without the attachment for a close, but not too close, shave.  It keeps the area clean but not bare.  I paid full price back when it first came out and thought it was a deal then.  I just noticed it on Amazon.com for $[...] and decided to buy a second for my boyfriend.  He is constantly trying to steal mine.  It works great on his chest and it&#x27;s hastle free.  It takes just seconds and the clean up is a breeze.  Don&#x27;t think about it, just buy it!</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t hurt my skin. i think i&#x27;m going to my one more for a back up.</li>
            <li> At first this seems like an awesome deal: you get a product that works well for a very low price. The only drawback is that it only lasted through two battery changes, and it doesn&#x27;t take long to use up the batteries. I would recommend against purchasing this product, unless you are okay with it no longer working after minimal use. I will not purchase anymore Remington shavers.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with how easy it is to use. I have never used a trimmer, but this was really simple. It has a little bag for storage and a brush for cleaning.</li>
            <li> Favorite trimmer!! Love it!</li>
            <li> Does not shave  as close as I hoped, but much easier than shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I am new to shaving the pubic area because I have fine hair there and didn&#x27;t feel the need too before.  I must admit being african-american I was somewhat skeptical.  So I went out and brought one and it works great.  I am so pleased with the results!  My boyfriend loves the idea of less hair in the area. I would recommend this product to anyone who opts for a more groomed look.</li>
            <li> It works only when you remove and reinstall the batteries.  Once you click it off, you need to reinstall the batteries again.   I had to ship it back but for the price of shipping, I should have gotten a different one.</li>
            <li> Used this on the longer hair on my bikini area and it worked great. Cuts well and keeps hair evenly trimmed. Batteries didn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like but would recommend the product anyway. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I really like this Trimmer - trims nicely and leaves no razor burn on my sensitive skin. Use it on my bikini area, and to trim eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer. Works better than I expected; Easy to control and there&#x27;s absolutley no irritation or razor burn.  Great price too!</li>
            <li> I tried using the longest trim first which couldnt catch any of my hairs but than I just took the comb off and got a shave so close that I didnt even have stubble. It doesnt really work for what I got it for though, I wanted my baby&#x27;s daddy to be able to trim me when I could no longer reach over my belly but I wanted a shorter still natural look for his birth and its it really only works for taking it all off or barely catching any hairs your vajayjay will end up looking like a chinese mans beard if you use the comb. I still use it for now though to be silky soft bald, I dont think ill be able to trust my guys with it down there though because if your not very careful it would be very easy to cut yourself. Batteries last long and it looks pretty w/a pretty case, I love mine.</li>
            <li> The trimmer seems to work great so far! I could not be happier. The comb attachment keeps the hair kinda long. Without it, you can get a pretty close trim. Rememeber it is NOT a shaver but a trimmer. Its not meant to make you hairless. Its just what I wanted. It comes with a little brush to wipe clean the blades and a storage bag to keep it in.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer for my wife the second time.she had it for a year the first one and left it at her friends house. so i bought another chargeable trimmer for $26. She did not like that and it also broke. So the thrid trimmer she demanded for Remington Trimmer.She says Its handy easy to use and worth the price. Got it from Amazon. My wife liked it so much that she got another two to gift her friends. She says its very handy, trims hair, no allergies or rash, and easy to carry, no charging only battery needed which works for some months.She has been using for some years.  Its worth Buying and really cheap at Amazon.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is super!  Great price, easy to hold and to use, easy to clean, and does exactly what I had hoped it would.  If you&#x27;re not interested in the \\&quot;totally bare\\&quot; look but want to keep your bikini area (and I&#x27;m talkng the WHOLE area, not just upper thighs) neatly groomed, then this is the just the ticket.  I had been using clunky full-sized hair clippers which were unwieldy and left nicks in snesitive places (yikes!), so this trimmer is a dream.  The guard allows one to select how long to leave the hair, and comfortably protects the skin from nicks.  Even without the guard (it&#x27;s removable), you won&#x27;t nick your skin. It uses 2 AA batteries - I can&#x27;t speak to the length of the battery life, since I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times.  The one drawback is that it&#x27;s a little noisy - a sort of loud buzzing sound.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item in 2008 and am finally writing a review in 2012.  Still have it.  Works great!  I use it every few weeks.  It is still cutting great. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer, it offers several different lengths and I always feel safe while using it. The size is perfect to get into delicate areas without feeling like you are going to nick yourself. It is very easy to clean and I especially like that it uses regular AAA batteries rather than a recharging unit as those seem to go bad quickly. My husband also uses it and he likes it as well. I have even bought these for a couple of friends who also needed trimmers.</li>
            <li> I have owned this model in the past (loved it) and recently bought a new one.  This one actually cuts skin, even with the protective guard on it.  I don&#x27;t know if I got a lemon or they changed the mechanics of it. I would not get this one unless you enjoy cutting into your private parts!</li>
            <li> The remington shaver didn&#x27;t give a close enough shave... would work ok for use before a closer shave or waxing...</li>
            <li> THIS LITTLE TRIMMER IS VERY EASY TO USE, JUST WISH YOU COULD GET CLOSER WITHOUT TAKING OFF COVER BUT IT WORKS GOOD.</li>
            <li> it is perfect trimmer but remember its not shaving razor :)</li>
            <li> So far I have liked this product. The shortest setting allows you to cut the hair about 1/4 of a inch and the longest probably about 1 inch long. It&#x27;s sharp, it cuts evenly and (so far) the batteries have lasted well.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this item. It is easy to use and does a great job. much better than a standard razor or the \\&quot;pen\\&quot; style trimmers.</li>
            <li> The safe-guard is very long on this shaver (a bit longer than a 1/4\\&quot;) so even at the lowest setting you can&#x27;t get a close shave. (Someone else mentioned this in their review but of course I had to try it for myself.  Uses AA batteries and comes w/ a mesh travel case. If you are looking for a closer trim, try a men&#x27;s beard and mustache trimmer. In my opinion the length of trim this product provides is not worth the bother. I am going to purchase something else.</li>
            <li> Item works great but if it gets even slightly wet, for example when you clean it, it stops working.  I&#x27;ve bought two but now I am switching to another because I&#x27;m tired of replacing it because I cleaned it or dropped it in the sink.</li>
            <li> This little device has gotten more than it worth in use.  It not only functions well for it&#x27;s intended purpose of body hair trimming, it makes an effective compact travel clipper.  The guard and length dial are durable and consistent.  I have had this for a number of years now and it still works as well as on day one.  As with any clipper, just a little maintenance and cleaning go a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for YEARS now and it&#x27;s still going strong with no problems.  I even bought one for my mom several years ago because it&#x27;s so awesome.  It sucks that they&#x27;ve been discontinued and I hope mine never breaks.  This is a truly solid trimmer.</li>
            <li> This was a great product. Im sad it is no longer on Amazon to purchase after my boyfriend ruined mine.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this trimmer. Worked well, the batteries lasted a long time, it works with wet or dry, has various settings, and it was easy to handle in the shower. I recently broke it when it took a fall from the top of my shower :( I&#x27;m very sad this one isn&#x27;t available anymore. I had it for at least 5 years and never had a problem with it.</li>
