            <li>, my hair is always soft and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>Wella products are great, has been around for ages but hard to find.</li>
            <li>When I went to a local salon to pick this product up, the product was authentic.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need straightener, hot rollers to look presentable.  </li>

            <li>I tried the color protect also but did not like as much.</li>
            <li>I love this treatment because it is light enough to use multiple times a week, makes my hair feel so soft, and is very light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down in any way!</li>
            <li>I have very long, extremely fine, wavy hair that is somewhat frizzy.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this was an authentic product. It&#x27;s smelled like apples. When I went to a local salon to pick this product up, the product was authentic.</li>

It does not seem to weigh down my hair, but I only use it every other week.  So nothing particularly wrong with it, but I probably won&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> I bought this moisturizing treatment for my 85-year-old mother who has always had thin, fine hair.  Since she has been using this product, her hair seems thicker and has more body.  It&#x27;s just what we were looking for.</li>

            <li> This moisturizing treatment is incredible. I have very long, extremely fine, wavy hair that is somewhat frizzy.

I love this treatment because it is light enough to use multiple times a week, makes my hair feel so soft, and is very light and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down in any way! Will continue to purchase this product. I also made my mom tried it and bough her one...and she loves it as well. This is a must try!</li>
            <li> I use Kerastace treatment for a couple years now, of which I really swore by it, however I am really impressed by Wella Professionals line. The only thing with Wella Professionals is that it is hard to find. I looked and called up several salons listed as a distrubutor on the Wella website -of which hardly any had any products even in-stock. Im glad to be able to find this online, my hair is always soft and easy to comb through. This product does not weigh the hair down either. I preciously liked the Wella SP Treatment for colored hair in the green/white container- couldnt find that either, but now I understand it was discontinued and this is the closest Wella replacement. Yippee!!!</li>
            <li> My hair went from black to blonde. It was so difficult to find the correct brand. Wen didn&#x27;t work, cabella did not work. Nothing seemed to have worked at all until I tried this one. I like it so much I will purchase the big gallon and purchase the salon gallon conditioner. Love love love it!!! Thank you wella, my hair feels virgin again!!!</li>
            <li> I was reminded about Wella Products by a Fashion Show they sponsored and tried to find it locally, I found it online and this was the best shampoo I ever used...I tried the Enrich line and went back to order the large size and try more products...I tried the color protect also but did not like as much.</li>
            <li> Great hair masque especially for dry and fine hair. I use it once a week. Love it.  I am not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  It moisturizes and silkens hair exceptionally well. I have very porous, dry hair due to menopause, but my hair is fine, and this product made it feel great. Well worth the money spent.[[ASIN:B004WMFVU6 Wella Enrich Moisturizing Treatment for Fine to Normal Hair, 5.07 oz]]</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel silky soft! And it smells incredible! Really helps your hair feel more healthy. Get this!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Gives hair a refresh and shine</li>
