            <li>Great to put in your pocket or purse.</li>
            <li>this is great.</li>
            <li>This is a great product to protect you at the beach or on the golf course.</li>
            <li>It also has a very nice silky feel when it is rubbed in.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product though which is why I gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li>Light, matte, excellent coverage.</li>
            <li>Good sun protection.</li>
            <li>This product would be good if it didn&#x27;t have the tint in it.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for about 2 years now and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I love this sunblock!</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best sun screen I have used on my face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s water-resistant too, which is nice.</li>
            <li>it goes on so silky smooth - feels more like great makeup than sunscreen or lotion.</li>
            <li>It does give a nice matte finish just like stated, that I really love.</li>
            <li>I was so delighted when I discovered how smooth and non-greasy this sunblock cream is.  </li>
            <li>It is perfect for sensitive skin and includes zinc.</li>
            <li>it might be okay, but it just makes my face look more tan than my neck.</li>
            <li>Makes the skin look nice and smooth like a primer.</li>
            <li>They are both incredibly safe to use when I check the ingredients on [...].  </li>
            <li>You can read more aboutit on EWG (Environmental Working Group).</li>
            <li>But the COTZ is even better than those.</li>
            <li>But the COTZ is even better than those.</li>
            <li>Well, I have to admit that it is really a perfect sun protection product, I use it everyday with a good mood.</li>
            <li>is I just love the texture.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make me look like a clown like most sunblocks.  </li>
            <li>It seems to make my skin look more even while wearing it.  </li>
            <li>I admit, it isn&#x27;t sexy, but who cares I am trying to log in miles).</li>
            <li>This one has been perfect --- I will totally repeat.</li>
            <li>great for very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The important thing is that they are both full of safe, effective ingredients.  </li>
            <li>heard about this from my uncle, and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I love is the consistency, extremely smooth and silky to put on, almost dissolves onto your face.</li>
            <li>It defiantly is has more smooth but now I look like a ghost.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply, creamy, dissolves without a trace.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and with freckles, I haven&#x27;t noticed any new freckles or sun burn.</li>
            <li>Makeup goes on smoothly over it.  </li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth</li>
            <li>Both my husband and I have super-sensitive skin and have tried just about every locally available sun screen.</li>
            <li>It has light reflective properties so my skin looks fabulous in pictures.  </li>
            <li>I have a fair complexion and sun sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>The protection is great against harmful rays (it&#x27;s full spectrum protection) and is much more sweat resistant than your average sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Very mattifying, doesn&#x27;t leave the skin greasy like many sunscreens do.</li>
            <li>I need some super sun protection for the summer when I&#x27;m out playing tennis.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also read reviews suggesting that the purchaser doesn&#x27;t need a high SPF level because this product can be layered on for better screening.</li>
            <li>Recommended by Dermatologist, had all types of skin cancer from basil cell to melanoma, this is solid sun protection, apply once a day, and feels more like a lotion and not a sunscreen, switched from blue lizard to this and happy with the results and the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth and makes your face feel very soft when you apply it.</li>
            <li>The protection comes from Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide instead of chemical sunscreens, so it&#x27;s healthier and more natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used some kind of sunscreen on my face year round since my early 20s, and at 45 I find my skin looks better than most.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for people who have sensitive skin, but also for anyone who needs a facial sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got hooked on Face COTZ when I received a sample size of it with another purchase (garden hat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But what I love is that when you put it over your entire face, it makes the skin so smooth, silky, pleasurable to the touch.</li>
            <li>Good old sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Plus, this sunscreen is doing a heck of a lot better than anything else I&#x27;ve used (even drugstore \\&quot;sensitive face\\</li>
            <li>One of the higher rated sun protection products out there.</li>
            <li>The Mychelle actually works so much better under makeup.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll need to use it more to determine how it works as a sunscreen, but for now I&#x27;m so happy not to have a greasy mess on my face anymore from other sunscreens.</li>
            <li>most bb creams come in lower spf (15-25), so I double up with this</li>
            <li>This product is the best for almost totally blocking the sun without causing an oil slick on my face.  </li>
            <li>It is the first product that isn&#x27;t greasy when I sweat.  </li>
            <li>The only sunscreens that are safe for UVA and UVB are titanium dioxide and zinc oxide.</li>
            <li>And it lasts much longer than the SPF 15 that most facial products carry.</li>
            <li>anything with a high SPF is more likely to irritate  your skin, but not with COTZ.    </li>
            <li>I love the tube because I can easily cut it open to swipe the inside to use every single ounce of the sunblock.  </li>
            <li>It starts out slightly white but is absorbed quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have very pale, easily burnt skin, and for some reason, nature thought it would be funny to make me extremely sensitive to most</li>
            <li>Customer service for Cotz says some people mix the tint and the white version together for a better match, but since I want something I can use on my neck too without worrying about getting tan stuff on my white clothing, the white one is better for me.</li>
            <li>I really like the Cotz water-resistant sunblock fo the face.  </li>
            <li>I use Retin-A and have always had very porcelain skin.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very oily, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>once you know how much to use, your skin will drink it up.</li>
            <li>My skin feels much softer, and the texture has improved as well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think i would have fussed as much if my mom put this on my face haha.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When I exercise or bike ride, this Face COTZ does not run into my eyes and burn like so many other sun screens have done.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;People with sensitive skin will definitely appreciate the COTZ line of products, but I feel that even those with normal skin will fall in love with them</li>
            <li>People with sensitive skin will definitely appreciate the COTZ line of products, but I feel that even those with normal skin will fall in love with them too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The sunscreen does not come out like most other sunscreens - which have the consistency of cosmetic moisturizer/face cream, more liquidy and slightly greasy/oily.</li>
            <li>The texture is very different, feels almost powderish but at the same time leaves the skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>Most people can probably get away with wearing less or maybe even no foundation when wearing this tinted sunscreen.</li>
            <li>So far, I have been using it under my make up and blends really well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve finally found a few good old standbys, and Face COTZ is one of them.</li>
            <li>I am Asian with super sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;(You&#x27;d be surprised how many \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; products are out there loaded with parabens and other known skin irritants.</li>
            <li>This will differ depending on your particular body chemistry, but I mainly needed a moisturizer for the sun protection, and every other facial sunscreens just made my face feel greasy, made me sweat just sitting at my desk, and made my skin break out - whereas moisturizers are a bit better on that score.</li>

            <li>The tinted version is fine if that&#x27;s what you want, but if you have a light/ivory shade of skin, you might want to consider the white version for lighter skin or possibly getting both versions and mixing them together.</li>
            <li>(main spf ingredients in the one I use are zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, and Ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate).&lt;br /&gt;So ladies who want sensitive protection and a bit of coverage might want to look into that.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>How any company thinks that  the label \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; is applicable to a product containing those ingredients, I don&#x27;t know, but apparently they basically market the same products with differing labels just to squeeze profit out of as many subsets of the market as possible.</li>
            <li>can squeeze the exact amount you want to use instead of a giant blob coming out.</li>
            <li>It works really well with my Bare Minerals make-up.  </li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned and have had numerous basal skin cancers removed from my face over the past few years.  </li>
            <li>Leaves matte finish, no oily shine.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to have pretty good protection, I use it on a daily basis, but I haven&#x27;t tested it on a hard-core sunny beach day yet.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, it does make my skin look a bit weird, emphasizing purple-red tones.</li>
            <li>There is a slight white residue, but not terribly noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Usually, anything with a high SPF is more likely to irritate  your skin, but not with COTZ.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was also worried I would use this up too fast, given the price, but I&#x27;ve been using the one tube for a month and still have plenty left, so it goes far.</li>
            <li>This completely rubs in and I can put my foundation makeup over it without any problem.  </li>
            <li>I actually bought one from Whole Foods called Mychelle Sun Shield.  </li>
            <li>It will  leave a white cast if you use too much, but</li>
            <li>I think I just have REALLY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have used Total Block SPF 65 for years now and really like it.</li>
            <li>product seems to make my fine lines less apparent.  </li>
            <li>This must be the original version of the sun block, as I&#x27;ve used this one for a few years.  </li>
            <li>My skin is a combination of dry and oily; easily gets dark spots.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products, including ones that are marketed for sensitive skin, and have the same problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Recently I bought a new bottle it had a different package but</li>
            <li>I ordered this assuming it was basic white sunscreen and received a tube labeled &#x27;Natural Skin Tone&#x27; which I found out has a tint to it.</li>
            <li>Instead, it is a thick but light, silky white substance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use this on a bare face and its doesn&#x27;t go on white.  </li>
            <li>I am a long distance runner and easily log at least 10 miles a week running outdoors (I am currently training for the marathon).</li>
            <li>although this can be occasionally mildly irritating to my super sensitive skin, it is literally the only sunscreen I would use on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finding strong enough sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t cause trouble is not easy.</li>
            <li>have problems with anything I put on my face making my skin turn bright red and painful.</li>

            <li> My skin feels much softer, and the texture has improved as well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think i would have fussed as much if my mom put this on my face haha.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I exercise or bike ride, this Face COTZ does not run into my eyes and burn like so many other sun screens have done.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;People with sensitive skin will definitely appreciate the COTZ line of products, but I feel that even those with normal skin will fall in love with them</li>

            <li> /&gt;The sunscreen does not come out like most other sunscreens - which have the consistency of cosmetic moisturizer/face cream, more liquidy and slightly greasy/oily.</li>
            <li> The texture is very different, feels almost powderish but at the same time leaves the skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> Most people can probably get away with wearing less or maybe even no foundation when wearing this tinted sunscreen.</li>
            <li> So far, I have been using it under my make up and blends really well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve finally found a few good old standbys, and Face COTZ is one of them.</li>
            <li> I am Asian with super sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;(You&#x27;d be surprised how many \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; products are out there loaded with parabens and other known skin irritants.</li>
            <li> This will differ depending on your particular body chemistry, but I mainly needed a moisturizer for the sun protection, and every other facial sunscreens just made my face feel greasy, made me sweat just sitting at my desk, and made my skin break out - whereas moisturizers are a bit better on that score.</li>

            <li> The tinted version is fine if that&#x27;s what you want, but if you have a light/ivory shade of skin, you might want to consider the white version for lighter skin or possibly getting both versions and mixing them together.</li>
            <li> (main spf ingredients in the one I use are zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, and Ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate).&lt;br /&gt;So ladies who want sensitive protection and a bit of coverage might want to look into that.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> How any company thinks that  the label \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; is applicable to a product containing those ingredients, I don&#x27;t know, but apparently they basically market the same products with differing labels just to squeeze profit out of as many subsets of the market as possible.</li>
            <li> can squeeze the exact amount you want to use instead of a giant blob coming out.</li>
            <li> It works really well with my Bare Minerals make-up.  </li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned and have had numerous basal skin cancers removed from my face over the past few years.  </li>
            <li> Leaves matte finish, no oily shine.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to have pretty good protection, I use it on a daily basis, but I haven&#x27;t tested it on a hard-core sunny beach day yet.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, it does make my skin look a bit weird, emphasizing purple-red tones.</li>
            <li> There is a slight white residue, but not terribly noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Usually, anything with a high SPF is more likely to irritate  your skin, but not with COTZ.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was also worried I would use this up too fast, given the price, but I&#x27;ve been using the one tube for a month and still have plenty left, so it goes far.</li>
            <li> This completely rubs in and I can put my foundation makeup over it without any problem.  </li>
            <li> I actually bought one from Whole Foods called Mychelle Sun Shield.  </li>
            <li> It will  leave a white cast if you use too much, but</li>
            <li> I think I just have REALLY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have used Total Block SPF 65 for years now and really like it.</li>
            <li> product seems to make my fine lines less apparent.  </li>
            <li> This must be the original version of the sun block, as I&#x27;ve used this one for a few years.  </li>
            <li> My skin is a combination of dry and oily; easily gets dark spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products, including ones that are marketed for sensitive skin, and have the same problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Recently I bought a new bottle it had a different package but</li>
            <li> I ordered this assuming it was basic white sunscreen and received a tube labeled &#x27;Natural Skin Tone&#x27; which I found out has a tint to it.</li>
            <li> Instead, it is a thick but light, silky white substance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use this on a bare face and its doesn&#x27;t go on white.  </li>
            <li> I am a long distance runner and easily log at least 10 miles a week running outdoors (I am currently training for the marathon).</li>
            <li> although this can be occasionally mildly irritating to my super sensitive skin, it is literally the only sunscreen I would use on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel dry.</li>
            <li> It seems to last all day on a typical day.  </li>
            <li> I like how it is slightly tinted to give you extra fabulousness if you are heading to the beach or pool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dry and sheer and feels just a little bit powdery afterwards, just like face powder.  </li>
            <li> (If you have very dry skin, you&#x27;ll definately need to use a moisturizer.)  </li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d only use it in the summer, but will probably use it year round now.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to wear on a daily basis under makeup but its just to heavy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I received the one with tint because it doesn&#x27;t mention that in this product listing, but I returned it and ordered the white version.</li>
            <li> When you rub a small amount into your skin, it disappears entirely - not just in color, but it makes no visible change in the skin surface.</li>

            <li> Although it wipes off on to anything that touches the skin it is very hard to get completely off the skin and has to be scrubbed off with a detergent or shampoo.</li>
            <li> It says it blends to a translucent shade, but my skin is light-to-medium ivory color and this is just a shade too dark for my skin color.</li>
            <li> Small tube goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen leaves a thick, somewhat greasy, chalky white layer on the skin that does not fade.</li>
            <li> It is certainly not useful as an everyday sunscreen.</li>

            <li> If I&#x27;m sweating a lot or swimming, I usually reapply one time.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the absolute best sun screen I have used on my face.  I am very fair skinned and have had numerous basal skin cancers removed from my face over the past few years.  I stay out of the sun, but even walking from car to store I can get burned.  This completely rubs in and I can put my foundation makeup over it without any problem.  It also has a very nice silky feel when it is rubbed in.  When I exercise or bike ride, this Face COTZ does not run into my eyes and burn like so many other sun screens have done.  This is great!</li>
            <li> My mother loves this product.  Purchased for her while she was visiting.  Great price.  One of the higher rated sun protection products out there.</li>
            <li> Recommended by Dermatologist, had all types of skin cancer from basil cell to melanoma, this is solid sun protection, apply once a day, and feels more like a lotion and not a sunscreen, switched from blue lizard to this and happy with the results and the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this assuming it was basic white sunscreen and received a tube labeled &#x27;Natural Skin Tone&#x27; which I found out has a tint to it. It says it blends to a translucent shade, but my skin is light-to-medium ivory color and this is just a shade too dark for my skin color. Maybe in the summer when I get some tan it might be okay, but it just makes my face look more tan than my neck. I found out the Cotz Face sunscreen comes in white which is labeled as &#x27;Cotz Face Lighter Skin Tone&#x27;. I&#x27;m not sure why I received the one with tint because it doesn&#x27;t mention that in this product listing, but I returned it and ordered the white version. Customer service for Cotz says some people mix the tint and the white version together for a better match, but since I want something I can use on my neck too without worrying about getting tan stuff on my white clothing, the white one is better for me. It&#x27;s a good product though which is why I gave it 4 stars. Very mattifying, doesn&#x27;t leave the skin greasy like many sunscreens do. It blends well. Makes the skin look nice and smooth like a primer. Most people can probably get away with wearing less or maybe even no foundation when wearing this tinted sunscreen. The protection comes from Zinc Oxide and Titanium Dioxide instead of chemical sunscreens, so it&#x27;s healthier and more natural. It&#x27;s water-resistant too, which is nice. The tinted version is fine if that&#x27;s what you want, but if you have a light/ivory shade of skin, you might want to consider the white version for lighter skin or possibly getting both versions and mixing them together.</li>
            <li> I have a fair complexion and sun sensitive skin.  Recently, my job required me to work outside for extended hours.  I purchased sun protection at a local drugstore (supposedly 110 SPF), which didn&#x27;t work and I saw sun damage.  After doing some internet research and consulting dermatologists, I decided to try Fallene Face Cotz - SPF 40.  What a relief to find out that this product actually works and no sunburn or sun damage on my face.  Face Cotz glides on smoothly, no greasy feel whatsoever.  There is a slight white residue, but not terribly noticeable.  I highly recommend this product and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I really like the Cotz water-resistant sunblock fo the face.  It does give a nice matte finish just like stated, that I really love. It is water-proof and sweat-proof.  I use Retin-A and have always had very porcelain skin.  But even though I wore sunscreen and a visor, I was getting blotchy brown patches on my lower cheeks this summer.  I started using this product and, with continued use of the Retin-A, the brown patches are sloughing away and not coming back.  This summer, I&#x27;ve been using it in place of base makeup, then using a little powder and blush to counter the whiteness.  That&#x27;s worked well.  I thought I&#x27;d only use it in the summer, but will probably use it year round now.  I&#x27;ve always used some kind of sunscreen on my face year round since my early 20s, and at 45 I find my skin looks better than most. I was also worried I would use this up too fast, given the price, but I&#x27;ve been using the one tube for a month and still have plenty left, so it goes far.</li>
            <li> This product goes on dry and is translucent.  It gives you great sunprotection without the shine or greasy look/feeling that other facial SPF products do.  I&#x27;m so happy I found it.</li>
            <li> I bought this in conjunction with their lip sunscreen.  I bought it to wear on a daily basis under makeup but its just to heavy.  I&#x27;ll use this on a bare face and its doesn&#x27;t go on white.  I actually bought one from Whole Foods called Mychelle Sun Shield.  They are both incredibly safe to use when I check the ingredients on [...].  The Mychelle actually works so much better under makeup.  The important thing is that they are both full of safe, effective ingredients.  Stay away from the chemical sunscreens and any Vit A ingredients. You can read more aboutit on EWG (Environmental Working Group).</li>
            <li> This is a great product for people who have sensitive skin, but also for anyone who needs a facial sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got hooked on Face COTZ when I received a sample size of it with another purchase (garden hat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sunscreen does not come out like most other sunscreens - which have the consistency of cosmetic moisturizer/face cream, more liquidy and slightly greasy/oily. Instead, it is a thick but light, silky white substance. When you rub a small amount into your skin, it disappears entirely - not just in color, but it makes no visible change in the skin surface. But what I love is that when you put it over your entire face, it makes the skin so smooth, silky, pleasurable to the touch. Again, it doesn&#x27;t change the skin visibly at all - once you rub it in, you look just like you did before you put it on. But the skin surface is smoother, and you can feel it with your fingers, though you can&#x27;t \\&quot;feel\\&quot; it on your skin (like you can when something is sitting on the skin, clogging your pores, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have problems with anything I put on my face making my skin turn bright red and painful. Good old sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products, including ones that are marketed for sensitive skin, and have the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;(You&#x27;d be surprised how many \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; products are out there loaded with parabens and other known skin irritants. How any company thinks that  the label \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; is applicable to a product containing those ingredients, I don&#x27;t know, but apparently they basically market the same products with differing labels just to squeeze profit out of as many subsets of the market as possible. Anyway...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve finally found a few good old standbys, and Face COTZ is one of them. I can put it on alone or I can put it on under my makeup (something else my skin is extremely picky about). It makes no difference whatsoever, except that my skin is protected from sunburn. And it lasts much longer than the SPF 15 that most facial products carry. Usually, anything with a high SPF is more likely to irritate  your skin, but not with COTZ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, since getting introduced to Face COTZ, I&#x27;ve given up on moisturizers. The COTZ is enough. This will differ depending on your particular body chemistry, but I mainly needed a moisturizer for the sun protection, and every other facial sunscreens just made my face feel greasy, made me sweat just sitting at my desk, and made my skin break out - whereas moisturizers are a bit better on that score. But the COTZ is even better than those. I don&#x27;t have oily/greasy issues at all now. It doesn&#x27;t block my pores and make me sweat. It just rubs in and protects my skin from the sun. Absolutely perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People with sensitive skin will definitely appreciate the COTZ line of products, but I feel that even those with normal skin will fall in love with them too.ly, anything with a high SPF is more likely to irritate  your skin, but not with COTZ.

            <li> I was so delighted when I discovered how smooth and non-greasy this sunblock cream is.  I went swimming and it stayed put on my face.  Worth the money!</li>
            <li> COTZ Waterproof Sun Screen for Face is excellent.It is perfect for sensitive skin and includes zinc. Easy to apply, creamy, dissolves without a trace. Small tube goes a long way. Great to put in your pocket or purse.</li>
            <li> Well, I have to admit that it is really a perfect sun protection product, I use it everyday with a good mood.</li>
            <li> I need some super sun protection for the summer when I&#x27;m out playing tennis.  I just tried this yesterday and one thing I can say is I just love the texture.  It&#x27;s so silky when it goes on, no greasy, oily feeling.  It&#x27;s dry and sheer and feels just a little bit powdery afterwards, just like face powder.  Makeup goes on smoothly over it.  I&#x27;ll need to use it more to determine how it works as a sunscreen, but for now I&#x27;m so happy not to have a greasy mess on my face anymore from other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I could not be happier with this sunscreen. I have very oily, acne-prone skin. This sunscreen does not make me break out or feel greasy. It is perfect for my skin.  (If you have very dry skin, you&#x27;ll definately need to use a moisturizer.)  It will  leave a white cast if you use too much, but once you know how much to use, your skin will drink it up. My skin feels much softer, and the texture has improved as well.  It seems to last all day on a typical day.  If I&#x27;m sweating a lot or swimming, I usually reapply one time.  If you have oily, acne-prone skin, this might just be the sun protection you&#x27;ve been looking for...</li>
            <li> I broke out in a rash after using regular sunscreen on my face so I bought this. It goes on so smooth it feels like a thick moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t pour out like some sunscreens do (where you end up asking if anyone else needs some just to get rid of the excess)--you can squeeze the exact amount you want to use instead of a giant blob coming out. The protection is great against harmful rays (it&#x27;s full spectrum protection) and is much more sweat resistant than your average sunscreen. Best of all it didn&#x27;t make my face break out in a rash!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen leaves a thick, somewhat greasy, chalky white layer on the skin that does not fade. Although it wipes off on to anything that touches the skin it is very hard to get completely off the skin and has to be scrubbed off with a detergent or shampoo. It is certainly not useful as an everyday sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back ordering my 2nd tube of this product. Both my husband and I have super-sensitive skin and have tried just about every locally available sun screen. This one, contains two physical blocking agents, titanium and zinc, works and doesn&#x27;t cause skin problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a number of reviews posted here that indicate that this fades sun spots and freckles. I&#x27;ve looked up every ingredient on the label and found none are bleaching agents. I&#x27;ve also read reviews suggesting that the purchaser doesn&#x27;t need a high SPF level because this product can be layered on for better screening. The label on the product makes no mention of this application technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If over-applied the skin will appear whiteish. Titanium and zinc both add white to the skin. There&#x27;s nothing on the label suggesting a super-heavy application to increase sun barrier results.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Light, matte, excellent coverage. Kept me from burning even in the Florida sun.</li>
            <li> I like how it is slightly tinted to give you extra fabulousness if you are heading to the beach or pool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear it daily and under my makeup with no issues.  I have already bought a second bottle.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent, but I didn&#x27;t receive this product, I got the ones that say a matte finish and that isn&#x27;t what I wanted, don&#x27;t like that one.  I didn&#x27;t want makeup, just sunscreen.</li>
            <li> it goes on so silky smooth - feels more like great makeup than sunscreen or lotion. I usually hate putting sunscreen on my face... this is great.</li>
            <li> great for very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very pale, easily burnt skin, and for some reason, nature thought it would be funny to make me extremely sensitive to most sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;I have a bad allergy to avobenzone, so I cannot use most cosmetic and facial products with spf.&lt;br /&gt;I heard about this from my uncle, and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I love is the consistency, extremely smooth and silky to put on, almost dissolves onto your face. Leaves matte finish, no oily shine.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to have pretty good protection, I use it on a daily basis, but I haven&#x27;t tested it on a hard-core sunny beach day yet.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, it does make my skin look a bit weird, emphasizing purple-red tones. It also tends to emphasizes any flakey-ness or facial dryness.&lt;br /&gt;If i leave it on for too long it does start to irritate my face a bit. So I usually wash it off once I get home from school or work.&lt;br /&gt;But I think I just have REALLY sensitive skin. Plus, this sunscreen is doing a heck of a lot better than anything else I&#x27;ve used (even drugstore \\&quot;sensitive face\\&quot; sunscreens turn me red and itchy)&lt;br /&gt;So although this can be occasionally mildly irritating to my super sensitive skin, it is literally the only sunscreen I would use on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been using BB cream with spf, and somehow that hasn&#x27;t bothered my skin at all (main spf ingredients in the one I use are zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, and Ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate).&lt;br /&gt;So ladies who want sensitive protection and a bit of coverage might want to look into that.&lt;br /&gt;But most bb creams come in lower spf (15-25), so I double up with this and I&#x27;m extra protected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this, especially if you have kids. I remember dreading putting sunscreen on my face when I was younger because it was so greasy and felt horrible. But it feels like you have nothing on when wearing this! Not greasy in the slightest. I don&#x27;t think i would have fussed as much if my mom put this on my face haha.&lt;br /&gt;I am alsoacne prone , and this did not cause me to break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biggest con is the price, but you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> This product is the best for almost totally blocking the sun without causing an oil slick on my face.  It is the first product that isn&#x27;t greasy when I sweat.  It starts out slightly white but is absorbed quickly.  I&#x27;m on my 5th or 6th delivery from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used Total Block SPF 65 for years now and really like it. I only purchased the Face Cotz because I was going to the beach and I wanted a water resistant sunscreen...well, I was disappointed in how this sunscreen goes on. It makes your face look white and never seems to absorb into your skin. I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> In spite of the item description and several reviews to the contrary, I was very disappointed in this sunscreen because it turned the skin on my face very white and no amount of rubbing would get rid of it. Also, I discovered after the fact that it is not highly rated for content of potentially harmful ingredients.</li>

My commute to work and home leaves me vulnerable to the sun as if the windshield is a magnifying glass burning into my skin (by the way, it&#x27;s 1 ½ hr commute EACH way).  I am in my 40&#x27;s...I wish I had found this product sooner!&lt;br /&gt;This product seems to make my fine lines less apparent.  I haven&#x27;t had a break out yet (I&#x27;ve been using the product for almost 6 months).  It doesn&#x27;t make me look like a clown like most sunblocks.  It works really well with my Bare Minerals make-up.  It&#x27;s odorless.  It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy (I wear a thin coat over  Oil Of Olay SPF 30 daily moisturizer).  It seems to make my skin look more even while wearing it.  It has light reflective properties so my skin looks fabulous in pictures.  It doesn&#x27;t get all over my clothing. I&#x27;ve gone running in the sun for 2 hours (of course, I wear the Sunday Afternoons Adventure Hat from REI...I admit, it isn&#x27;t sexy, but who cares I am trying to log in miles). It leaves a misty-glowy-matte finish; not oily. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel dry. The sunblock does not burn or sting.  It hasn&#x27;t ran into my eyes yet. I love the tube because I can easily cut it open to swipe the inside to use every single ounce of the sunblock.  I wear it every day. I wish it came in a bigger tube.</li>
            <li> I cannot use this product.  I don &#x27;t know if I ordered wrong  but it does not smooth on well and it is white and cakey</li>
            <li> Good sun protection. So far, I have been using it under my make up and blends really well. I am fair skinned and with freckles, I haven&#x27;t noticed any new freckles or sun burn. Need to try it at the beach or exercising under the sun. The texture is very different, feels almost powderish but at the same time leaves the skin very smooth. Must give it a try.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to protect you at the beach or on the golf course. I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> This product would be good if it didn&#x27;t have the tint in it.  It does not enhance my complexion.  I wasted money on this product.</li>
            <li> The only sunscreens that are safe for UVA and UVB are titanium dioxide and zinc oxide. This has both ingredients.</li>
            <li> This must be the original version of the sun block, as I&#x27;ve used this one for a few years.  It works well, but sometimes it seems to leave a white residue especially when I add on my day lotion.</li>
            <li> Very happy with  product</li>
            <li> I love this sunblock! It&#x27;s very smooth and makes your face feel very soft when you apply it. It&#x27;s waterproof which is awesome!</li>
            <li> My skin is a combination of dry and oily; easily gets dark spots. Finding strong enough sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t cause trouble is not easy. This one has been perfect --- I will totally repeat. A bit small but it&#x27;s lasting sufficiently long.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 2 years now and loved it.  Recently I bought a new bottle it had a different package but promised the same result.  It defiantly is has more smooth but now I look like a ghost.  I have this white film that doesn&#x27;t rub off so well.  I am going to try the Blue Lizard.</li>
            <li> Encore une fois il y a une différence entre ce qui est écrit sur le produit reçu (SPF 35) et il est écrit (SPF 40) sur le produit annoncé... ??? Sur ce point, ça fait 2 erreurs sur 2 produits...??? Attention aux consommateurs pointilleux...</li>
