            <li>and I have found that this is the best soap IMHO.  </li>

            <li>In a word: Awesome.  </li>

            <li>Great aroma.....</li>
            <li>Any variety from Col. Conk is a great, great shave soap.</li>
            <li>A really great soap.</li>
            <li>Very nice</li>
            <li>The Colonel is always the best but glycerine soaps are mostly melt &amp; pour.  </li>
            <li>My preferred shaving soap and a good value.</li>
            <li>I have never used any of the creams that are supposed to be superior to the soaps.  </li>
            <li>They are all good, but I think we both prefer the lime.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Provides good lather and glide which contributes to a good shave.</li>
            <li>Still prefer the Proraso smell be a fair margin</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can build a good foam in my brush, comparable to the non glycerine soaps I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The soap also has a good scent.</li>
            <li>This soap has an incredible lather and the scent is very mild.  </li>
            <li>Feels great on the skin, creates a nice lather, gives a nice shave.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, gives a nice smooth shave, with an excellent lather on my skin.</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with</li>
            <li>And the scent is very appealing to me.  </li>
            <li>Nice soapy understated smell.</li>
            <li>If you want a cost effective solution, get a Van Der Hagen soap bar.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells nice.  </li>
            <li>This soap is nice.</li>
            <li>This soap, combined with a good double-edge safety razor (I use the Parker 99R butterfly) and a good blade (I like Derby Extra) gives the best shave I have found.  </li>
            <li>However, this soap will make your shave better, even if you use an injector razor or even a good triple-blade disposable.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, the ingredients do not list anything that is way over the top chemical wise.  </li>
            <li>It leaves a very nice smooth balm like quality to my skin that is not tacky.  </li>
            <li>It made for a very special gift this Christmas!</li>
            <li>Lathers very easily.</li>
            <li>It stays on your face and creates the good smooth layer of lubrication that is required for a close shave.  </li>
            <li>It has a mild pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Great scent, and lathers very very well for me.  </li>
            <li>I like Conk&#x27;s shave soap better than most, because it has more lubrication than some others.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are better fancier products, with more smell or effect on the skin, but these work for me.</li>
            <li>My favorite shaving soap.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the smell now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this shaving soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure this has a scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s better stuff out there, but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>I wish it was more fragrant.</li>
            <li>Took awhile  to get used to this scent, I like it more, but it is not my fav.  </li>
            <li>Lathers OK.</li>
            <li>Better than the one I just finished using.  </li>
            <li>Faster and better than the Proraso.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of my favorite shave soaps.  </li>
            <li>Lasts longer than the more opaque soaps.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite shave soaps.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and the lather you get from it.  </li>
            <li>Miles better than anything you get from a can.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t found a better combination yet.</li>
            <li>In several words: The best shaving soap I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>It is a very mild scent, and it does it&#x27;s job outstandingly well.</li>
            <li>Arrived promptly and not only smells wonderful, the lather is rich and luxurious.</li>
            <li>I think my fianc&amp;eacute; will really like this shave soap, but I wish that the scent was a bit stronger; but for the price, the quality is good.</li>
            <li>It lathers up very nicely and the scent is masculine without being too strong.</li>
            <li>Perfect for me, i&#x27;m allergic to other stuff.</li>
            <li>It also rinses easily.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li>Too be honest I got what I paid for which wasn&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic shave soap.  </li>
            <li>No matter how I experimented with the soap, I always ended up with a lather that was subpar at cushioning my face and helping the blade glide along smoothly.</li>
            <li>I enjoy shaving now and have been wanting to try this soap and needed an order to add it to which happened this week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, I feel its a great product for beginners like me, and I will likely order again.</li>
            <li>This puck doesn&#x27;t fit into some of the shave bowls listed on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The result is a custom fit that doesn&#x27;t slide around or keep the lid</li>
            <li>Lather it up and enjoy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see any great advantage to the glycerine and much prefer the scent of the Bay Rum to this.</li>
            <li>This soap is far superior to canned shave cream.</li>
            <li>This is a great place to start if you are interested in old school</li>
            <li>I just know that this Amber glycerine lathers much easier, and after I then scrape the hair off my face, my face feels just as good as with the higher priced stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was the first one I tried when I returned to safety razor shaving and recall that it was an excellent first soap to use when starting out.  </li>
            <li>This was a re-order, my original supply having run out.  </li>
            <li>First load your brush with this stuff, and then top your brush off with the Bond Street.</li>
            <li>excellent shaving soap with a little cream is ideal to avoid irritating and smell great, and last for many shaves</li>
            <li>It lathers well and smells really good, not to mention the price is much more reasonable than many other shaving soaps.  </li>
            <li>quick and rich lather.smooth shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, this is the only good thing I have to say about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this is nice.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin nice and soft, kinda lotion like.  </li>
            <li>would recommend this product to anyone interested in old school shaving routines, you can&#x27;t really miss with the Colonel when you are looking for a great value shave soap.</li>
            <li>Mild and relaxing.</li>
            <li>and I love the product as much as the first order.</li>
            <li>The soap has a wonderful aroma and seems like it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li>No big ingredients list from the Col. thank you!&lt;br /&gt;3. Smells very masculine, the Amber scent is a great blend that does not linger.</li>
            <li>Fresh and fragrant smell without being too overpowering.</li>
            <li>When I first popped open the soap container, a strong and overwhelmingly funky smell hit my nose</li>
            <li>Lathers up pretty well however the lather seems to dissipate quickly</li>
            <li>and my husband gets a good rather despite other reviews.</li>
            <li>The price is really right.  </li>
            <li>This soap lathers with very little water and smells GREAT.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few different brands of soap, but Col. Conk&#x27;s always gives me the best shave.  </li>
            <li>As I said before, this Amber glycerine soap lathers very very well for me.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried this product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to buy more to try different scents.  </li>
            <li>This was my first experience with shave soap.  </li>
            <li>Wet the brush, not the soap, and it will lather great and last ages.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s similarly priced, can be picked up at your local supermarket, and has provided me superior lather.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As can be expected with any Col Conk soap, this provides a great lather and is a solid buy highly recommended !</li>
            <li>I had one of the most comfortable shaves of my life with this soap, and I&#x27;m actually looking forward to shaving next time just so I can use it again.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t care for either three of the scent...</li>
            <li>I received this soap as part of a straight razor shaving kit from Vintage Razors LLC.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything when you lather it up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lathers very well.  </li>
            <li>Lathers up fast.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice if there is any lingering smell on my face after I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li>Smells ok and gives some minimal glycerin lubrication, and now I use it as a hand soap.</li>
            <li>He has been wanting the whole set up for quite a while now.</li>
            <li>I had actually ordered the Col Conk almond soap, and when I opened the box and saw this Amber Glycerine soap, I almost had a kniption fit.  </li>
            <li>There are none, but I told him that at 13, he was now a man, so I bought him a nice Merkur safety razor, several blades, a cup and brush, and several varieties of Col. Conk&#x27;s soap.  </li>
            <li>need to change my blade to give it an honest evaluation but impressions so far...and for reference, the benchmark is Proraso in the green tub, tub, not tube.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a thick lather that lasts, which is most important.  </li>
            <li>Proraso leaves it tight and cool but not as lotion smooth...which I think I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;Doesnt seem to allow for as close a shave.&lt;br /&gt;Appears to need more frequent rinsing from blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>effective, one puck will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decent</li>
            <li>It lathers up luxuriantly producing a rich, thick, slick and protective foam that provides an exceptionally close nick- free shave.</li>
            <li>As far as if a soap lathering, lifting wiskers, while lubricating and creating a gliding surface for the razor, I don&#x27;t know about this sciency stuff or can&#x27;t tell a difference between this and the higher priced MWF and Jagger soaps.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s main selling point appears to be</li>
            <li>I have a bit of difficulty even getting a decent lather.  </li>
            <li>The amber scent is great for anyone who finds the other col conk scents a little overbearing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Lime and Bay Rum fragrances.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m not a slow shaver by any</li>
            <li>Lastly, this soap is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>In the recent past, I had been using higher priced Mitchels Wool Fat (MWF) and Edwin Jagger sandalwood shaving soaps, which are nice soaps in themselves.  </li>
            <li>Recommend wholeheartedly for the new d/e shaver.</li>
            <li>Col. Conk, I think you have a new lifetime customer.</li>
            <li>This is important because it means that the soap is actually keeping the hair lifted off the face so you can get a cleaner cut, granted you are lathering properly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is pretty mild and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>very \\&quot;old</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certainly interested in trying a different scent when my soap supply runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After several uses, the funkiness actually went away, leaving behind a nice, smooth, understated aroma of amber.</li>
            <li>I had to purchase a new bowl and soap to replace the old stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never had a clear shaving soap before.  </li>
            <li>Old school Barbershop smell, understated and not loud.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce]].</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and buy this along with Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood.</li>
            <li>Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Lathers easily and well.&lt;br /&gt;Gives a slick shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit of work, workin&#x27; up a lather, but it goes on smooth and as the old Southern adage goes, a little dab will do ya.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m relativity new to the double edge shaving scene.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very simple, straight forward product, so I will keep my review short and</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t go wrong with the low cost and a good soap to shave with.</li>
            <li>Yes, you heard right, one half.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a few other shave soaps, and this one is in the top 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I generally lather up my face twice to three times (i.e. shave 2-3 times).</li>
            <li>Brings back memories of my old neighborhood barber-shop.</li>
            <li>Barely notice it.  </li>
            <li>The rest are OK as shaving creams go, but are not great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will revisit after a fresh blade is used a few times.</li>
            <li>Classic scent and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>This soap seemed fairly hard, as it should, so I did the normal Prep routine: placed it in a mug, with a couple millimeters of hot water on it while wetting &amp; squeezing out the brush.</li>
            <li>A similar size bar of Taylor Of Old Bonds soap actually lasted me almost twice as long, meaning that it&#x27;s not that much of a money saver in the long run.</li>
            <li>As others have said it does seem to take a little effort to lather it up, soaking in hot water helps some.</li>
            <li>This makes a soft, thick, and long lasting lather; better than the soap I was using, plus the price was only slightly more expensive.</li>
            <li>Stays pretty wet on the face, doesn&#x27;t dry up.  </li>
            <li>When I was using my old mach 3 and some cheap mens gel, the smell could take down a small horse.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so it can be a bit harsh if I&#x27;m being really thorough, but it&#x27;s the same scent my Grandpa used when I was growing up, and it brings back memories.  </li>

            <li> Better than the one I just finished using.  </li>
            <li> Faster and better than the Proraso.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of my favorite shave soaps.  </li>
            <li> Lasts longer than the more opaque soaps.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite shave soaps.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell and the lather you get from it.  </li>
            <li> Miles better than anything you get from a can.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t found a better combination yet.</li>
            <li> In several words: The best shaving soap I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> It is a very mild scent, and it does it&#x27;s job outstandingly well.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and not only smells wonderful, the lather is rich and luxurious.</li>
            <li> I think my fianc&amp;eacute; will really like this shave soap, but I wish that the scent was a bit stronger; but for the price, the quality is good.</li>
            <li> It lathers up very nicely and the scent is masculine without being too strong.</li>
            <li> Perfect for me, i&#x27;m allergic to other stuff.</li>
            <li> It also rinses easily.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li> Too be honest I got what I paid for which wasn&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic shave soap.  </li>
            <li> No matter how I experimented with the soap, I always ended up with a lather that was subpar at cushioning my face and helping the blade glide along smoothly.</li>
            <li> I enjoy shaving now and have been wanting to try this soap and needed an order to add it to which happened this week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I feel its a great product for beginners like me, and I will likely order again.</li>
            <li> This puck doesn&#x27;t fit into some of the shave bowls listed on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The result is a custom fit that doesn&#x27;t slide around or keep the lid</li>
            <li> Lather it up and enjoy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see any great advantage to the glycerine and much prefer the scent of the Bay Rum to this.</li>
            <li> This soap is far superior to canned shave cream.</li>
            <li> This is a great place to start if you are interested in old school</li>
            <li> I just know that this Amber glycerine lathers much easier, and after I then scrape the hair off my face, my face feels just as good as with the higher priced stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was the first one I tried when I returned to safety razor shaving and recall that it was an excellent first soap to use when starting out.  </li>
            <li> This was a re-order, my original supply having run out.  </li>
            <li> First load your brush with this stuff, and then top your brush off with the Bond Street.</li>
            <li> excellent shaving soap with a little cream is ideal to avoid irritating and smell great, and last for many shaves</li>
            <li> It lathers well and smells really good, not to mention the price is much more reasonable than many other shaving soaps.  </li>
            <li> quick and rich lather.smooth shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, this is the only good thing I have to say about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this is nice.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin nice and soft, kinda lotion like.  </li>
            <li> would recommend this product to anyone interested in old school shaving routines, you can&#x27;t really miss with the Colonel when you are looking for a great value shave soap.</li>
            <li> Mild and relaxing.</li>
            <li> and I love the product as much as the first order.</li>
            <li> The soap has a wonderful aroma and seems like it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> No big ingredients list from the Col. thank you!&lt;br /&gt;3. Smells very masculine, the Amber scent is a great blend that does not linger.</li>
            <li> Fresh and fragrant smell without being too overpowering.</li>
            <li> When I first popped open the soap container, a strong and overwhelmingly funky smell hit my nose</li>
            <li> Lathers up pretty well however the lather seems to dissipate quickly</li>
            <li> and my husband gets a good rather despite other reviews.</li>
            <li> The price is really right.  </li>
            <li> This soap lathers with very little water and smells GREAT.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different brands of soap, but Col. Conk&#x27;s always gives me the best shave.  </li>
            <li> As I said before, this Amber glycerine soap lathers very very well for me.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried this product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to buy more to try different scents.  </li>
            <li> This was my first experience with shave soap.  </li>
            <li> Wet the brush, not the soap, and it will lather great and last ages.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s similarly priced, can be picked up at your local supermarket, and has provided me superior lather.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As can be expected with any Col Conk soap, this provides a great lather and is a solid buy highly recommended !</li>
            <li> I had one of the most comfortable shaves of my life with this soap, and I&#x27;m actually looking forward to shaving next time just so I can use it again.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t care for either three of the scent...</li>
            <li> I received this soap as part of a straight razor shaving kit from Vintage Razors LLC.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything when you lather it up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lathers very well.  </li>
            <li> Lathers up fast.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice if there is any lingering smell on my face after I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li> Smells ok and gives some minimal glycerin lubrication, and now I use it as a hand soap.</li>
            <li> He has been wanting the whole set up for quite a while now.</li>
            <li> I had actually ordered the Col Conk almond soap, and when I opened the box and saw this Amber Glycerine soap, I almost had a kniption fit.  </li>
            <li> There are none, but I told him that at 13, he was now a man, so I bought him a nice Merkur safety razor, several blades, a cup and brush, and several varieties of Col. Conk&#x27;s soap.  </li>
            <li> need to change my blade to give it an honest evaluation but impressions so far...and for reference, the benchmark is Proraso in the green tub, tub, not tube.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a thick lather that lasts, which is most important.  </li>
            <li> Proraso leaves it tight and cool but not as lotion smooth...which I think I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;Doesnt seem to allow for as close a shave.&lt;br /&gt;Appears to need more frequent rinsing from blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> effective, one puck will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decent</li>
            <li> It lathers up luxuriantly producing a rich, thick, slick and protective foam that provides an exceptionally close nick- free shave.</li>
            <li> As far as if a soap lathering, lifting wiskers, while lubricating and creating a gliding surface for the razor, I don&#x27;t know about this sciency stuff or can&#x27;t tell a difference between this and the higher priced MWF and Jagger soaps.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s main selling point appears to be</li>
            <li> I have a bit of difficulty even getting a decent lather.  </li>
            <li> The amber scent is great for anyone who finds the other col conk scents a little overbearing.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Lime and Bay Rum fragrances.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m not a slow shaver by any</li>
            <li> Lastly, this soap is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> In the recent past, I had been using higher priced Mitchels Wool Fat (MWF) and Edwin Jagger sandalwood shaving soaps, which are nice soaps in themselves.  </li>
            <li> Recommend wholeheartedly for the new d/e shaver.</li>
            <li> Col. Conk, I think you have a new lifetime customer.</li>
            <li> This is important because it means that the soap is actually keeping the hair lifted off the face so you can get a cleaner cut, granted you are lathering properly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is pretty mild and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> very \\&quot;old</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certainly interested in trying a different scent when my soap supply runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After several uses, the funkiness actually went away, leaving behind a nice, smooth, understated aroma of amber.</li>
            <li> I had to purchase a new bowl and soap to replace the old stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never had a clear shaving soap before.  </li>
            <li> Old school Barbershop smell, understated and not loud.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce]].</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and buy this along with Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Lathers easily and well.&lt;br /&gt;Gives a slick shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit of work, workin&#x27; up a lather, but it goes on smooth and as the old Southern adage goes, a little dab will do ya.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m relativity new to the double edge shaving scene.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a very simple, straight forward product, so I will keep my review short and</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the low cost and a good soap to shave with.</li>
            <li> Yes, you heard right, one half.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few other shave soaps, and this one is in the top 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I generally lather up my face twice to three times (i.e. shave 2-3 times).</li>
            <li> Brings back memories of my old neighborhood barber-shop.</li>
            <li> Barely notice it.  </li>
            <li> The rest are OK as shaving creams go, but are not great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will revisit after a fresh blade is used a few times.</li>
            <li> Classic scent and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> This soap seemed fairly hard, as it should, so I did the normal Prep routine: placed it in a mug, with a couple millimeters of hot water on it while wetting &amp; squeezing out the brush.</li>
            <li> A similar size bar of Taylor Of Old Bonds soap actually lasted me almost twice as long, meaning that it&#x27;s not that much of a money saver in the long run.</li>
            <li> As others have said it does seem to take a little effort to lather it up, soaking in hot water helps some.</li>
            <li> This makes a soft, thick, and long lasting lather; better than the soap I was using, plus the price was only slightly more expensive.</li>
            <li> Stays pretty wet on the face, doesn&#x27;t dry up.  </li>
            <li> When I was using my old mach 3 and some cheap mens gel, the smell could take down a small horse.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so it can be a bit harsh if I&#x27;m being really thorough, but it&#x27;s the same scent my Grandpa used when I was growing up, and it brings back memories.  </li>
            <li> Just take it slow and gentle, and if you&#x27;ve got issues with sensitive skin on the neck, just shave in one direction on a given day and alternate the next</li>
            <li> Furthermore, the lather is very short-lived, meaning I have to waste time reapplying lather on my face before I had done one half of a complete pass.</li>
            <li> But I felt it would be such a waste to throw away new soap, so I decided to hold my nose and give it a shot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how much foam this soap produces from a relatively small amount of swishing around with my brush.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last as long as I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The fact of the matter is, the soap fails to perform in the one thing it&#x27;s supposed to do - provide a creamy and smooth lather to make shaving a simple endeavor.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap for my straight razor the biggest dissapontment is that if you don&#x27;t but it on thick enough it will evaporate off your face.</li>
            <li> A few of the old school guys on Badger &amp; Blade keep this in rotation, so it goes from beginner to expert.</li>
            <li> Seems to be long lasting (on par with other shave soaps of this type).</li>
            <li> I think lather also depends on your water situation (hard vs soft).</li>
            <li> I wet the bottom of the puck and stick it inside the plastic camping mug I use.</li>
            <li> My son just turned 13, and for the last few years, I often found him in my bathroom brushing on my soap, just as I had done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just got a wet shave set up...</li>
            <li> This glycerine soap is where it is at when it comes to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to wet having about three months ago.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Smells of soap with a hint of wet dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Col. brand of shave soaps for a long while now, and of all the different scents, I like this one the least.</li>
            <li> Other than scent, I have not found any difference in this and</li>
            <li> other Col. Conk shave soaps.</li>
            <li> I kept this Amber glycerine shaving soap to use after I finished up my other soaps.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for over a year and a half now</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s really a shame that the soap failed to deliver.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it rally isn&#x27;t a lot of soap for the price.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that it smells just like Pine Sol.</li>
            <li> The soap lathers well, although it is slightly taller than my soap holder, I&#x27;m still trying out soaps.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pretty plain, neutral smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the scent of this soap is understated, moreso than the bay rum soap I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switch around and usually just get whatever variety of Col. Conk&#x27;s soap that is selling for the cheapest amount on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I have rated MWF 4 stars in the past.  </li>
            <li> scent is subtle, and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> The combination of preshave oil and this soap will give you the closest shave without irritation - at least on my face.  </li>
            <li> Thick lather.</li>
            <li> The scent is quite subtle.  </li>
            <li> For me, that is not a pleasant odor to shave with.</li>
            <li> Makes for a very slick shave!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be very wary of buying anything Colonel Conk from this point forward.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff makes your face slicker then oil you will notice the difference, and it has a great scent.</li>
            <li> Since I started DE Shaving I have been working my way through various shave soaps and creams and testing them out along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very simple, straight forward product, so I will keep my review short and simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Lathers well&lt;br /&gt;2. Soothes the skin, thank you Glycerine. No big ingredients list from the Col. thank you!&lt;br /&gt;3. Smells very masculine, the Amber scent is a great blend that does not linger. Old school Barbershop smell, understated and not loud.&lt;br /&gt;4. This is a great place to start if you are interested in old school shaving.&lt;br /&gt;5. Inexpensive, and a great value, perfect step up from Williams Mug Soap. The next level.&lt;br /&gt;6. A few of the old school guys on Badger &amp; Blade keep this in rotation, so it goes from beginner to expert. It is in my rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone interested in old school shaving routines, you can&#x27;t really miss with the Colonel when you are looking for a great value shave soap.</li>
            <li> the scent of this soap is understated, moreso than the bay rum soap I have tried in the past. I like Conk&#x27;s shave soap better than most, because it has more lubrication than some others. I also like the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are better fancier products, with more smell or effect on the skin, but these work for me. I don&#x27;t care to spend over $10 on a block of shave soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be trying the &#x27;lime&#x27; flavor next.</li>
            <li> Too be honest I got what I paid for which wasn&#x27;t much. I really don&#x27;t care for either three of the scent...very \\&quot;old man\\&quot; smelling.</li>
            <li> My preferred shaving soap and a good value.</li>
            <li> My favorite shaving soap. Been using it for years. I wet the bottom of the puck and stick it inside the plastic camping mug I use. It doesn&#x27;t slide around.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic shave soap.  I have been using the same bar for months and it seems like it will last for another couple of months.  It produces a lot of lather.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the Col. Conk Amber shaving soap, and I must say, it&#x27;s grown on me.  I have sensitive skin, so it can be a bit harsh if I&#x27;m being really thorough, but it&#x27;s the same scent my Grandpa used when I was growing up, and it brings back memories.  It&#x27;s a bit of work, workin&#x27; up a lather, but it goes on smooth and as the old Southern adage goes, a little dab will do ya.  Just take it slow and gentle, and if you&#x27;ve got issues with sensitive skin on the neck, just shave in one direction on a given day and alternate the next and you&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li> Nice soapy understated smell. Feels great on the skin, creates a nice lather, gives a nice shave.Recommend wholeheartedly for the new d/e shaver.</li>
            <li> I received this soap as part of a straight razor shaving kit from Vintage Razors LLC. When I first popped open the soap container, a strong and overwhelmingly funky smell hit my nose and I immediately wondered if I should just toss the soap. But I felt it would be such a waste to throw away new soap, so I decided to hold my nose and give it a shot. After several uses, the funkiness actually went away, leaving behind a nice, smooth, understated aroma of amber. I absolutely love the smell now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this is the only good thing I have to say about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact of the matter is, the soap fails to perform in the one thing it&#x27;s supposed to do - provide a creamy and smooth lather to make shaving a simple endeavor. No matter how I experimented with the soap, I always ended up with a lather that was subpar at cushioning my face and helping the blade glide along smoothly. Furthermore, the lather is very short-lived, meaning I have to waste time reapplying lather on my face before I had done one half of a complete pass. Yes, you heard right, one half. And I&#x27;m not a slow shaver by any means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s main selling point appears to be it&#x27;s extremely low cost for what is supposed to be a mid-level quality soap, but don&#x27;t be fooled. The soap is glycerine-based, meaning that it disappears quicker than traditional triple-milled soaps. A similar size bar of Taylor Of Old Bonds soap actually lasted me almost twice as long, meaning that it&#x27;s not that much of a money saver in the long run. If you want a cost effective solution, get a Van Der Hagen soap bar. It&#x27;s similarly priced, can be picked up at your local supermarket, and has provided me superior lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really a shame that the soap failed to deliver. I&#x27;ll be very wary of buying anything Colonel Conk from this point forward.</li>
            <li> I have never used any of the creams that are supposed to be superior to the soaps.  I have always been intrigued by the soaps. My father used to have a shaving mug and a brush that I used to pretend I was shaving with.  I have tried a few different brands of soap, but Col. Conk&#x27;s always gives me the best shave.  My son just turned 13, and for the last few years, I often found him in my bathroom brushing on my soap, just as I had done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He likes to think he is grown up, and I see him looking in the mirror for hairs on his face.  There are none, but I told him that at 13, he was now a man, so I bought him a nice Merkur safety razor, several blades, a cup and brush, and several varieties of Col. Conk&#x27;s soap.  They are all good, but I think we both prefer the lime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switch around and usually just get whatever variety of Col. Conk&#x27;s soap that is selling for the cheapest amount on Amazon.  When I got this one, this was the cheapest.</li>
            <li> Love this shaving soap. Was my second order and I love the product as much as the first order.</li>
            <li> Smells AWESOME!! Totally has the smell of a barber shop. I haven&#x27;t used it yet as I haven&#x27;t chopped off my beard yet. Soon...</li>
            <li> I tried this after using the regular Bay Rum Soap from Col. Conk. I don&#x27;t really see any great advantage to the glycerine and much prefer the scent of the Bay Rum to this. I&#x27;m not even sure this has a scent. Just seems to smell like soap to me. As others have said it does seem to take a little effort to lather it up, soaking in hot water helps some. That being said I&#x27;d rather use this then anything out of a can if I have the extra time.</li>
            <li> The Colonel is always the best but glycerine soaps are mostly melt &amp; pour.  Great aroma..... so, so shave</li>
            <li> Just got a wet shave set up...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty plain, neutral smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost effective, one puck will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decent lather, but it won&#x27;t be the consistency of shaving cream in a can or shave gel if you&#x27;re used to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s better stuff out there, but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> This glycerine soap is where it is at when it comes to wet shaving. It lathers up very nicely and the scent is masculine without being too strong.</li>
            <li> This is a repeat buy for me.  It leaves a very nice smooth balm like quality to my skin that is not tacky.  It was the first one I tried when I returned to safety razor shaving and recall that it was an excellent first soap to use when starting out.  I keep a couple different kinds of shave products and I&#x27;ve decided that this will be a &#x27;staple&#x27; item going forward.</li>
            <li> I think my fianc&amp;eacute; will really like this shave soap, but I wish that the scent was a bit stronger; but for the price, the quality is good.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and my husband gets a good rather despite other reviews. I think lather also depends on your water situation (hard vs soft). Pairs well with the silvertip badger brush and bowl I got him for his birthday.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Lime and Bay Rum fragrances.  The rest are OK as shaving creams go, but are not great.</li>
            <li> This soap seemed fairly hard, as it should, so I did the normal Prep routine: placed it in a mug, with a couple millimeters of hot water on it while wetting &amp; squeezing out the brush. After it was in there about 20 seconds, I tried to begin, but almost the entire puck had disolved into a jello like goo!&lt;br /&gt;I just returned what I could get back in the pack.</li>
            <li> Fresh and fragrant smell without being too overpowering. Provides good lather and glide which contributes to a good shave. Brings back memories of my old neighborhood barber-shop. This is the first time I have tried this product. Seems to be long lasting (on par with other shave soaps of this type). Looking forward to trying the Col. Conk Bay Rum. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap for my straight razor the biggest dissapontment is that if you don&#x27;t but it on thick enough it will evaporate off your face.</li>
            <li> I wish it was more fragrant. It doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything when you lather it up. Nonetheless, gives a nice smooth shave, with an excellent lather on my skin. I just keep it in a mug for use with my brush. Wet the brush, not the soap, and it will lather great and last ages.</li>
            <li> Lathers well and lasted almost a year</li>
            <li> Took awhile  to get used to this scent, I like it more, but it is not my fav.  Lathers OK.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how much foam this soap produces from a relatively small amount of swishing around with my brush. It&#x27;s almost like it&#x27;s sitting around waiting for me to shave just so it can show me how awesome it is! Col. Conk, I think you have a new lifetime customer. I can&#x27;t wait to try the almond and lime versions I also ordered.</li>
            <li> Better than the one I just finished using.  Face feels...refreshed.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to wet having about three months ago.  What a difference.  I enjoy shaving now and have been wanting to try this soap and needed an order to add it to which happened this week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to change my blade to give it an honest evaluation but impressions so far...and for reference, the benchmark is Proraso in the green tub, tub, not tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lathers very well.  Faster and better than the Proraso.&lt;br /&gt;Smells nice.  Still prefer the Proraso smell be a fair margin but this is nice.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin nice and soft, kinda lotion like.  Proraso leaves it tight and cool but not as lotion smooth...which I think I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;Doesnt seem to allow for as close a shave.&lt;br /&gt;Appears to need more frequent rinsing from blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will revisit after a fresh blade is used a few times.</li>
            <li> The amber scent is great for anyone who finds the other col conk scents a little overbearing. Mild and relaxing.</li>
            <li> Colonel Conk&#x27;s amber shaving soap is an excellent product. It lathers up luxuriantly producing a rich, thick, slick and protective foam that provides an exceptionally close nick- free shave. It also rinses easily. I personally like the smell, which to me is like Neutrogena&#x27;s amber soap.</li>
            <li> This soap lathers with very little water and smells GREAT. Would definitly recommend it, I just wish this line would have an after shave!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Lathers easily and well.&lt;br /&gt;Gives a slick shave.&lt;br /&gt;Holds body well.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful colour.&lt;br /&gt;Scent lasts 3-5minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Smells of soap with a hint of wet dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the scent and would recommend this to people who like animals and a great shave!</li>
            <li> Perfect for me, i&#x27;m allergic to other stuff. Lathers up fast. I generally lather up my face twice to three times (i.e. shave 2-3 times).</li>
            <li> My husband uses this and loves it!  It lathers well and smells really good, not to mention the price is much more reasonable than many other shaving soaps.  He uses this in conjunction with [[ASIN:B0007MW2ZW Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce]].</li>
            <li> excellent shaving soap with a little cream is ideal to avoid irritating and smell great, and last for many shaves</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m relativity new to the double edge shaving scene. I&#x27;ve used a few other shave soaps, and this one is in the top 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is subtle, and not overwhelming. When I was using my old mach 3 and some cheap mens gel, the smell could take down a small horse. I don&#x27;t really notice if there is any lingering smell on my face after I&#x27;m done shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can build a good foam in my brush, comparable to the non glycerine soaps I&#x27;ve used. And the foam lasts during the entire shaving session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I feel its a great product for beginners like me, and I will likely order again.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite shave soaps.  It has a mild pleasant smell. Lathers very easily. Lasts longer than the more opaque soaps.</li>
            <li> Smells ok and gives some minimal glycerin lubrication, and now I use it as a hand soap. Definitely not a shaving soap I would ever recommend.</li>
            <li> Classic scent and long lasting.  Thick lather.</li>
            <li> Lathers up pretty well however the lather seems to dissipate quickly so I&#x27;d have to reapply a couple times during a shave.</li>
            <li> Very nice and it got here on time</li>
            <li> This makes a soft, thick, and long lasting lather; better than the soap I was using, plus the price was only slightly more expensive.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this gift! He has been wanting the whole set up for quite a while now. I got him everything. Straightedge and all!</li>
            <li> This puck doesn&#x27;t fit into some of the shave bowls listed on Amazon. To work around this, I cut the soap into chunks, heated it in the microwave to a liquid, and then poured it into the bowl. The result is a custom fit that doesn&#x27;t slide around or keep the lid open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is pretty mild and doesn&#x27;t last long. I&#x27;m certainly interested in trying a different scent when my soap supply runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> This soap is nice. It lathers nicely and has a pleasant smell. Only complaint is that it rally isn&#x27;t a lot of soap for the price.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaving soap I have used. This was a re-order, my original supply having run out.  I have done a lot of experimenting trying to find the best shave.  This soap, combined with a good double-edge safety razor (I use the Parker 99R butterfly) and a good blade (I like Derby Extra) gives the best shave I have found.  However, this soap will make your shave better, even if you use an injector razor or even a good triple-blade disposable. This soap is far superior to canned shave cream. It stays on your face and creates the good smooth layer of lubrication that is required for a close shave.  The soap also has a good scent. Other than scent, I have not found any difference in this and other Col. Conk shave soaps.</li>
            <li> The soap lathers well, although it is slightly taller than my soap holder, I&#x27;m still trying out soaps. Smell is negligible.</li>
            <li> quick and rich lather.smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Makes for a very slick shave!</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with a saftey razor for some time now.  I accidentally dropped my bowl and soap and they were destroyed.  I had to purchase a new bowl and soap to replace the old stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that this soap has given the best lather I have ever had.  The combination of preshave oil and this soap will give you the closest shave without irritation - at least on my face.  It has a thick lather that lasts, which is most important.  I did not find the need to relather during the initial pass with the razor.  This is important because it means that the soap is actually keeping the hair lifted off the face so you can get a cleaner cut, granted you are lathering properly.  Furthermore, the ingredients do not list anything that is way over the top chemical wise.  The soap has a wonderful aroma and seems like it will last a long time.  Lastly, this soap is well worth the money.  I have tried various types of soap on the market and I have found that this is the best soap IMHO.  I can&#x27;t wait to buy more to try different scents.  Try this soap, it will not dissappoint!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Col. brand of shave soaps for a long while now, and of all the different scents, I like this one the least. It is a very mild scent, and it does it&#x27;s job outstandingly well. You can&#x27;t go wrong with the low cost and a good soap to shave with. The only complaint I have is that it smells just like Pine Sol. For me, that is not a pleasant odor to shave with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for over a year and a half now and I&#x27;m very pleased with Col. Conk shave soaps. The Amber scent reminds me of my grandfather. Best man I know.</li>
            <li> Great scent, and lathers very very well for me.  I had actually ordered the Col Conk almond soap, and when I opened the box and saw this Amber Glycerine soap, I almost had a kniption fit.  I never had a clear shaving soap before.  But I decided to keep it anyway to use after my current soaps were gone.  The price is really right.  In the recent past, I had been using higher priced Mitchels Wool Fat (MWF) and Edwin Jagger sandalwood shaving soaps, which are nice soaps in themselves.  I have rated MWF 4 stars in the past.  I also earlier tried the Proraso sandalwood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I kept this Amber glycerine shaving soap to use after I finished up my other soaps.  As I said before, this Amber glycerine soap lathers very very well for me.  And the scent is very appealing to me.  I look forward to lathering up every day just for the scent!  As far as if a soap lathering, lifting wiskers, while lubricating and creating a gliding surface for the razor, I don&#x27;t know about this sciency stuff or can&#x27;t tell a difference between this and the higher priced MWF and Jagger soaps.  I just know that this Amber glycerine lathers much easier, and after I then scrape the hair off my face, my face feels just as good as with the higher priced stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MWF will still have a place in a mug in my shaving cabinet, but this Amber glycerine soap may have two mugs!!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite shave soaps.  Love the smell and the lather you get from it.  Miles better than anything you get from a can.</li>
            <li> The scent is quite subtle.  Barely notice it.  Stays pretty wet on the face, doesn&#x27;t dry up.  Lather was so-so.  This was my first experience with shave soap.  It didn&#x27;t last as long as I thought it would.  I got maybe 8 shaves out of this bar.  I think I will try another brand before I buy this one again.</li>
            <li> As can be expected with any Col Conk soap, this provides a great lather and is a solid buy highly recommended !</li>
            <li> Any variety from Col. Conk is a great, great shave soap.</li>
            <li> A really great soap. If you haven&#x27;t tried it yet then give it a whirl! Your face will thank you.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and buy this along with Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood. First load your brush with this stuff, and then top your brush off with the Bond Street. Lather it up and enjoy. Haven&#x27;t found a better combination yet.</li>
            <li> In a word: Awesome.  In several words: The best shaving soap I&#x27;ve ever used.  As I write this, I have only used this soap once, but I was so taken with it that I can&#x27;t imagine ever using anything else again.  I was instantly converted.  This soap has an incredible lather and the scent is very mild.  I had one of the most comfortable shaves of my life with this soap, and I&#x27;m actually looking forward to shaving next time just so I can use it again.  Thank you, Col. Conk.</li>
            <li> I have a bit of difficulty even getting a decent lather.  I think I&#x27;ll stick to creams.  Still very good price for the amount you get.  This will likely last me 6 months.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and not only smells wonderful, the lather is rich and luxurious. It made for a very special gift this Christmas!</li>
