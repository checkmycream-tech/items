            <li>The Subscribe and Save option is great because we never run out!</li>
            <li>Great bargain!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tasted it myself and the flavor of this one and the orange are very good.</li>
            <li>He brushes his teeth now and doesn&#x27;t use an incredible amount on his toothbrush either.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, good stuff!  </li>
            <li>Smells great</li>
            <li>After a week of brushing with this tooth paste my son promised he would never swallow tooth paste again, lol.</li>
            <li>this stuff is great, good value for the price, and the best part, its safe!</li>
            <li>Great buy, good size and my daughter loves the taste.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good for them.</li>
            <li>it is good for teeth but the taste is not that good.</li>
            <li>I take the packaging word for what the ingredients are,and based on that it is the best kids toothpaste out there- free of harmful chemicals and sugar.</li>
            <li>, it tastes good</li>
            <li>It smells good, but if they didn&#x27;t like the way it tastes, there&#x27;s no point in buying it...</li>
            <li>Good product,my question is could kids swallow toothpaste occasionally?&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>My kids love it, it tastes great</li>
            <li>The taste is bright and nice</li>
            <li>Who cares if it tastes like soap if your kids love it!  </li>
            <li>Good toothpaste, the kids love it.  </li>
            <li>I can subscribe to the orange flavor, but this is the one my kids liked</li>
            <li>Nice flavor and not too strong for a toddler.</li>
            <li>Kids love it</li>
            <li>Although we&#x27;re not yet sure which ingredient was causing the problem, calendula is in the ragweed family, and has been known to cause allergies.</li>
            <li>I like the taste of this much better than the orange flavor.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Glad we found another kid safe toothpaste that wasn&#x27;t crest.</li>
            <li>My kids love this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>But my kids love it.</li>
            <li>I however love the texture.</li>
            <li>We had been using earthpaste (my sons favorite)</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>There is a bonus as well - my kids love the taste.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t contain saccharin.</li>
            <li>Since then, I found a much better toothpaste with no toxins.</li>
            <li>I also entered these ingredients through the EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep Cosmetics Database and it got a zero toxin rating which is the best you can get.</li>
            <li>My children love this toothpaste and I love it too</li>
            <li>And I love it, too :)</li>
            <li>I have tasted this toothpaste that my daughter uses and Love the smell.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Has a great flavor that our kids love, cleans very well, and safe to swallow.</li>
            <li>We love the fact that we do not have to worry about the poison known as fluoride.</li>
            <li>If you have a kid who doesn&#x27;t enjoy brushing their teeth, this is definitely a good way to get them to enjoy brushing their teeth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care if I like the taste or not, if it makes her happy about brushing, good enough for me.  </li>
            <li>I have used it before as well and think it tastes pretty good.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter loves the taste; I love that it is fluoride free.</li>
            <li>Both of my daughters were so excited about this toothpaste because it is in a cute package.</li>
            <li>is so strong that it made me gag.  </li>
            <li>This one seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>We picked it up at Toys-R-Us after trying many kinds of toothpaste, and the flavor is mild and he is not bothered by anything in it.  </li>
            <li>Also, the smell reminds me of cheap strawberry lip balm.</li>
            <li>Flouride FREE</li>
            <li>I will try another fluoride free toothpaste before I by this again.</li>
            <li>It is Squigle Tooth Builder and is SLS free and fluoride free with no added flavors.</li>
            <li>my child really enjoy the taste...</li>
            <li>And it was a fantastic price.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a fluoride free toothpaste for my kids for some time.</li>
            <li>My daughter started throwing a fit each night having to use the Tom&#x27;s strawberry flavor that I purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Has a good taste, makes brushing teeth fun for the whole family.  </li>
            <li>Taste good only I need more foam...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would love to see Amazon consistently include ingredients lists.</li>
            <li>so I was really excited to try this one out.</li>
            <li>she LOVES it and gets excited to brush her teeth.  </li>
            <li>The paste smells wonderful but the taste of is not very good.</li>
            <li>I love Jason products and support them as much as I can-they are animal and environmentally friendly.  </li>
            <li>While we have enjoyed Jason products and like the company&#x27;s philophies watch out for an allergic reaction, especially in sensitive kids.</li>
            <li>A good purchase overall.</li>
            <li>and I think it is way too sweet.</li>
            <li>However, because it does not taste as good as the mainstream blue colored brands, my toddler has stopped eating the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>taste Yummy, sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste but my youngest seems to like it too much and ends up eating it.</li>
            <li>was looking for the most natural, safe, effective, and fluoride free option because my son was swallowing the toothpaste and making a mess along the way.</li>
            <li>Pretty good ingredients, however, not big on the caraageen that&#x27;s added.  </li>
            <li>I switched him to my Jason&#x27;s Sea Fresh toothpaste to which he has had no reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sea Fresh toothpaste:&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:</li>
            <li>We only buy chemical free toothpaste for our kids and they love the orange flavor.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is natural and safe to swallow.</li>
            <li>im assuming kids need powerful toothpaste too) or</li>
            <li>and I love that this one is clear colored</li>
            <li>However, it is natural and has no fluoride, so I&#x27;m okay with giving it to them for brushing.</li>
            <li>like the consistency and fresh smell too.</li>
            <li>Not yet open to use, thinking the toothpaste to be suitable for my daughter.</li>
            <li>My previous dentist told me that the ingredient xylitol is good for fighting cavities.</li>
            <li>but my 6 year old confirmed that it &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t taste right...</li>
            <li>Though the delivery of this product was very fast, the quality didn&#x27;t meet my 8 year-old&#x27;s expectations.</li>
            <li>I dismissed my son&#x27;s complaints at first, and then tried it myself.</li>
            <li>But be aware that this paste does not have fluoride in it.</li>
            <li>My oldest tried it first while my youngest was napping.</li>
            <li>, however, it does say \\&quot;kids\\&quot; toothpaste and so the first one to try it was my lil&#x27; one and</li>
            <li>My son absolutely loves this toothpaste!</li>
            <li>There are not many options at the store for kids fluoride free toothpaste unless you buy the kind for infants and he doesn&#x27;t like those flavors.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be purchasing more of this.</li>
            <li>We tried several and this has been her favorite -</li>
            <li>although it&#x27;s a different flavor from the one i bought before, my children still love the way the toothpaste tastes.</li>
            <li>it makes my younger child want to brush his teeth more.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised that she spit it right out as well!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Agreeing with another post, it doesn&#x27;t matter whether I like it or not as long as he/she does/ :-)</li>
            <li>He really seemed to like it</li>
            <li>My daughter really loves the taste and that is a Godsend because otherwise, it s a fight to brush her teeth.</li>
            <li>You can even taste the aloe vera which is also very yucky.</li>
            <li>but i dont think it cleaned my teeth very well</li>
            <li>My son doesn&#x27;t swallow the toothpaste and the tube lasts much longer now.</li>
            <li>We found a tube of this at Whole Foods and both kids (age 5 and age 7) have tried it and gave two thumbs up.</li>
            <li>It is a plain white toothpaste that tastes great and foams well.</li>
            <li>They absolutely love this toothpaste, probably a little too much.</li>
            <li>Kids love the flavor...caught my 2 year old eating it the other day.  </li>
            <li>I think that if someone is looking for a non-fluoride toothpaste for a child this one should generally go over pretty well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s less abrasive than typical toothpastes and more natural to be more sensitive for kids.</li>
            <li>Maybe even kids after awhile need something new and fresh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We really liked this product and the fact that it was without artificial colors and gluten, sulfate, saccharin and fluoride free.</li>
            <li>natural xylitol(prevents plaque, from birch trees),  purified water (texture, from spring water),  calcite(polishes and cleans, plugs open tubules, heals decay, from limestone), glycerin(moistener, from vegetable oil), poloxamer(super mild detergent, from natural gas),  cellulose gum (thickener, foamer, from trees),  </li>
            <li>The flavor of the big one, children like it very much.</li>
            <li>He also like to go around and make everyone smell his breath after brushing because the strawberry flavor and scent is so strong and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I am not sure how many parents taste their kids toothpaste, but they should.  </li>
            <li>This may sound ridiculous, but we have had better luck with this average tasting toothpaste than with those that tasted like candy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started using it as well and the canker sores I&#x27;ve been getting in my mouth have completely disappeared.</li>
            <li>My 4 year old still swallows toothpaste.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old likes this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Works well so far, kids like the taste and smell.</li>
            <li>As an adult, I don&#x27;t prefer it myself.</li>
            <li>My 2 year old Never has problems brushing with this toothpaste..</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 5 year old daughter</li>
            <li>So I am going to stick with this one for my 5 year old Son and Myself.   </li>
            <li>B00206DXQ0 Squigle Tooth Builder Sensitive Toothpaste (4.4 oz]]</li>
            <li>my 3 year old toddler and the Jason Strawberry toothpaste has proven to work the best.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It let the child conscious to brush your teeth every day.</li>
            <li>I have twin 2 year old girls.</li>
            <li>I use all natural toothpaste myself (Earthpaste) and wanted to do so for my kids.</li>
            <li>It leaves my mouth feeling clean and leaves little to no taste in my mouth after I rinse, which I like because then I can go eat my breakfast without tasting toothpaste.</li>
            <li>It tastes a little sweet because of the xylitol.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of a natural toothpaste without fluoride for my almost four year old, but unfortunately he doesn&#x27;t like either the strawberry or the orange favors.</li>
            <li>This is certainly not the best tasting toothpaste but it isn&#x27;t that bad either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find toothpaste that&#x27;s floride free.</li>
            <li>My five year old will ONLY use this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Jason Kids Only toothpaste:&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Glycerin, aqua (purified water), silica, xylitol, xanthan gum, panthenol, aloe barbadensis (aloe vera) leaf juice, calendula officinalis flower extract, calcium carbonate, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, natural flavor *</li>
            <li>This is the only natural toothpaste they like</li>
            <li>I have to switch back to her old toothpaste.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have noted, it does taste pretty gross to me, soapy and a weird kind of fruity flavor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what the other review was about, however, I also use EWG&#x27;s website and it was listed with \\&quot;0\\&quot; toxin the last time I checked and one of the top toothpastes listed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>However, this toothpaste got a less than positive response from my three year olds.</li>
            <li>We have sampled many, many natural toothpastes and this one tastes HORRIBLE.</li>

            <li> My oldest tried it first while my youngest was napping.</li>
            <li> , however, it does say \\&quot;kids\\&quot; toothpaste and so the first one to try it was my lil&#x27; one and</li>
            <li> My son absolutely loves this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> There are not many options at the store for kids fluoride free toothpaste unless you buy the kind for infants and he doesn&#x27;t like those flavors.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be purchasing more of this.</li>
            <li> We tried several and this has been her favorite -</li>
            <li> although it&#x27;s a different flavor from the one i bought before, my children still love the way the toothpaste tastes.</li>
            <li> it makes my younger child want to brush his teeth more.</li>
            <li> and I was surprised that she spit it right out as well!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Agreeing with another post, it doesn&#x27;t matter whether I like it or not as long as he/she does/ :-)</li>
            <li> He really seemed to like it</li>
            <li> My daughter really loves the taste and that is a Godsend because otherwise, it s a fight to brush her teeth.</li>
            <li> You can even taste the aloe vera which is also very yucky.</li>
            <li> but i dont think it cleaned my teeth very well</li>
            <li> My son doesn&#x27;t swallow the toothpaste and the tube lasts much longer now.</li>
            <li> We found a tube of this at Whole Foods and both kids (age 5 and age 7) have tried it and gave two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> It is a plain white toothpaste that tastes great and foams well.</li>
            <li> They absolutely love this toothpaste, probably a little too much.</li>
            <li> Kids love the flavor...caught my 2 year old eating it the other day.  </li>
            <li> I think that if someone is looking for a non-fluoride toothpaste for a child this one should generally go over pretty well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less abrasive than typical toothpastes and more natural to be more sensitive for kids.</li>
            <li> Maybe even kids after awhile need something new and fresh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We really liked this product and the fact that it was without artificial colors and gluten, sulfate, saccharin and fluoride free.</li>
            <li> natural xylitol(prevents plaque, from birch trees),  purified water (texture, from spring water),  calcite(polishes and cleans, plugs open tubules, heals decay, from limestone), glycerin(moistener, from vegetable oil), poloxamer(super mild detergent, from natural gas),  cellulose gum (thickener, foamer, from trees),  </li>
            <li> The flavor of the big one, children like it very much.</li>
            <li> He also like to go around and make everyone smell his breath after brushing because the strawberry flavor and scent is so strong and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how many parents taste their kids toothpaste, but they should.  </li>
            <li> This may sound ridiculous, but we have had better luck with this average tasting toothpaste than with those that tasted like candy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using it as well and the canker sores I&#x27;ve been getting in my mouth have completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old still swallows toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old likes this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Works well so far, kids like the taste and smell.</li>
            <li> As an adult, I don&#x27;t prefer it myself.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old Never has problems brushing with this toothpaste..</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 5 year old daughter</li>
            <li> So I am going to stick with this one for my 5 year old Son and Myself.   </li>
            <li> B00206DXQ0 Squigle Tooth Builder Sensitive Toothpaste (4.4 oz]]</li>
            <li> my 3 year old toddler and the Jason Strawberry toothpaste has proven to work the best.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It let the child conscious to brush your teeth every day.</li>
            <li> I have twin 2 year old girls.</li>
            <li> I use all natural toothpaste myself (Earthpaste) and wanted to do so for my kids.</li>
            <li> It leaves my mouth feeling clean and leaves little to no taste in my mouth after I rinse, which I like because then I can go eat my breakfast without tasting toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It tastes a little sweet because of the xylitol.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of a natural toothpaste without fluoride for my almost four year old, but unfortunately he doesn&#x27;t like either the strawberry or the orange favors.</li>
            <li> This is certainly not the best tasting toothpaste but it isn&#x27;t that bad either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find toothpaste that&#x27;s floride free.</li>
            <li> My five year old will ONLY use this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Jason Kids Only toothpaste:&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Glycerin, aqua (purified water), silica, xylitol, xanthan gum, panthenol, aloe barbadensis (aloe vera) leaf juice, calendula officinalis flower extract, calcium carbonate, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, natural flavor *</li>
            <li> This is the only natural toothpaste they like</li>
            <li> I have to switch back to her old toothpaste.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, it does taste pretty gross to me, soapy and a weird kind of fruity flavor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the other review was about, however, I also use EWG&#x27;s website and it was listed with \\&quot;0\\&quot; toxin the last time I checked and one of the top toothpastes listed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> However, this toothpaste got a less than positive response from my three year olds.</li>
            <li> We have sampled many, many natural toothpastes and this one tastes HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> disappointment is that this product is only available as an add-on and not a subscription.</li>
            <li> She spit it right out and was very upset at how bad it tasted.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a flouride free toothpaste w/ nothing artificial.</li>

            <li> My daughter never wants to brush her teeth and this toothpaste hasn&#x27;t been an issue.  </li>
            <li> (Fluoride is actually industrial toxic waste from the nuclear and fertilizer industries.)</li>
            <li> This stuff smells really good, but our daughter hated the taste.</li>
            <li> She likes the other toddler toothepastes, but not this one.</li>
            <li> But, I wanted a fluoride-free toothpaste for our daughter who&#x27;s not willing to spit out toothpaste while brushing yet.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s actually slightly lower in priced compared to crest.</li>
            <li> My 4-year-old says it is a little &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; for her and would rather have something milder.  </li>
            <li> which was a must when I was looking for a toothpaste for my little one.</li>
            <li> My little one is almost 6</li>
            <li> This toothpaste   has a harsh \\&quot;fruity\\&quot; taste</li>
            <li> I chose this because SLS gives me sores in my mouth and I haven&#x27;t had any sores since I started using this a few months ago.</li>
            <li> cause I don&#x27;t have to worry about all the harsh chemicals that they may swallow.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;. I did give it three stars though because my kids WILL still use it so it can&#x27;t be too terrible:).</li>
            <li> Frustrated, I knew I had to find something new but with no fluoride.</li>
            <li> The blue colored toothpaste products also left a terrible mess everywhere</li>
            <li> The tast is so bad that my child won&#x27;t use it - total waste!!  </li>
            <li> and i got tired of using mint toothpaste</li>
            <li> The verdict, not good!</li>
            <li> This one is the only one he hated.</li>
            <li> and I was sad to have to chuck it.</li>
            <li> Sorry,</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this will not be the one for us.  </li>
            <li> He hated the other orajel stuff</li>
            <li> They complain about the nasty taste and strange smell.</li>
            <li> Has a really weird artificial taste and smell.</li>
            <li> but it was SO bad</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the flavor is terrible.</li>
            <li> My kids hate this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My kids HATE this tooth paste, they think it taste like soap.</li>
            <li> Then, that sensation was followed by  a terrible soapy flavor that wouldn&#x27;t leave my mouth.  </li>
            <li> omg this tooth paste tastes horrible and does not foam</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This stuff smells really good, but our daughter hated the taste. She refuses to use is because it is yucky. She likes the other toddler toothepastes, but not this one. Perhaps we&#x27;ll give it another try one day.</li>
            <li> My kids love it, it tastes great and I notice less tartar on their teeth in the mornings.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a flouride free toothpaste w/ nothing artificial. Unfortunately, the flavor is terrible. I dismissed my son&#x27;s complaints at first, and then tried it myself. Yuck. We chucked it.</li>
            <li> My five year old will ONLY use this toothpaste.  We picked it up at Toys-R-Us after trying many kinds of toothpaste, and the flavor is mild and he is not bothered by anything in it.  Now we can&#x27;t find it in the stores and I have to order online.   I&#x27;ve started using it as well and the canker sores I&#x27;ve been getting in my mouth have completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old still swallows toothpaste. However he does not want to use baby toothpaste. It&#x27;s hard to find toothpaste that&#x27;s floride free. Kids love it and it&#x27;s good for them.</li>
            <li> We really liked this product and the fact that it was without artificial colors and gluten, sulfate, saccharin and fluoride free. However, we realized that my son was allergic to it and it was causing daily wheezing. Although we&#x27;re not yet sure which ingredient was causing the problem, calendula is in the ragweed family, and has been known to cause allergies. While we have enjoyed Jason products and like the company&#x27;s philophies watch out for an allergic reaction, especially in sensitive kids. I switched him to my Jason&#x27;s Sea Fresh toothpaste to which he has had no reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would love to see Amazon consistently include ingredients lists. In lieu of that, here is an ingredient list from Vitacost:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason Kids Only toothpaste:&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Glycerin, aqua (purified water), silica, xylitol, xanthan gum, panthenol, aloe barbadensis (aloe vera) leaf juice, calendula officinalis flower extract, calcium carbonate, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, natural flavor * certified organic vegetable source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason Sea Fresh toothpaste:&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Calcium carbonate, aqua (purified water), vegetable glycerin, sodium cocoyl glutamate, mentha viridis (spearmint) leaf oil, carrageenan, aphanizomenon flos aquae (blue green algae), aloe barbadensis (aloe vera) leaf gel, bambusa arundinacea (bamboo) stem powder, carum petroselinum (parsley) extract, perilla ocymoides (perilla) seed extract, sodium bicarbonate, silica, stevioside, citrus grandis (grapefruit) seed extract.</li>
            <li> My daughter HATES minty tasting toothpaste, she says they burn her mouth so I was really excited to try this one out. She and her brother loves this toothpaste! The Subscribe and Save option is great because we never run out!</li>
            <li> My 3 year old likes this toothpaste. I selected this one since she will not use the mint flavored pastes yet. This one seems to work fine. But be aware that this paste does not have fluoride in it. Also, the smell reminds me of cheap strawberry lip balm. I think that if someone is looking for a non-fluoride toothpaste for a child this one should generally go over pretty well. We will probably finish using the tube.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how many parents taste their kids toothpaste, but they should.  This toothpaste   has a harsh \\&quot;fruity\\&quot; taste is so strong that it made me gag.  Then, that sensation was followed by  a terrible soapy flavor that wouldn&#x27;t leave my mouth.  Given the harshness of it, I am curious about the actual  safety of this product when in contact with young children.</li>
            <li> Good toothpaste, the kids love it.  Has a good taste, makes brushing teeth fun for the whole family.  Packaged well</li>
            <li> We only buy chemical free toothpaste for our kids and they love the orange flavor.  We decided to give the Stawberry flavor a go, and they seem to like the taste too.</li>
            <li> Not yet open to use, thinking the toothpaste to be suitable for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Has a really weird artificial taste and smell. I stopped giving it to my toddler. He really seemed to like it and I was sad to have to chuck it.</li>
            <li> I like the taste of this much better than the orange flavor. It leaves my mouth feeling clean and leaves little to no taste in my mouth after I rinse, which I like because then I can go eat my breakfast without tasting toothpaste. The taste is bright and nice, it reminds me of strawberry gum or candy or something like that. I chose this because SLS gives me sores in my mouth and I haven&#x27;t had any sores since I started using this a few months ago.</li>
            <li> it is good for teeth but the taste is not that good. my child prefers colgate and only bc of taste.</li>
            <li> Both of my daughters were so excited about this toothpaste because it is in a cute package. They couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. My oldest tried it first while my youngest was napping. She spit it right out and was very upset at how bad it tasted. After my youngest woke up she wanted to try too. She loves almost anything and I was surprised that she spit it right out as well! Won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> My 4-year-old says it is a little &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; for her and would rather have something milder.  Otherwise, good stuff!  :)</li>
            <li> Glad we found another kid safe toothpaste that wasn&#x27;t crest. It&#x27;s actually slightly lower in priced compared to crest. Works well so far, kids like the taste and smell. Plan to repurchase when we run out.</li>
            <li> Nice flavor and not too strong for a toddler. Flouride FREE which was a must when I was looking for a toothpaste for my little one.</li>
            <li> My little one is almost 6 and we have been using this toothpaste for years. I&#x27;m not sure what the other review was about, however, I also use EWG&#x27;s website and it was listed with \\&quot;0\\&quot; toxin the last time I checked and one of the top toothpastes listed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed from time to time that they change ratings on that website so it may have changed, however, it does say \\&quot;kids\\&quot; toothpaste and so the first one to try it was my lil&#x27; one and he/she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Agreeing with another post, it doesn&#x27;t matter whether I like it or not as long as he/she does/ :-)</li>
            <li> My kids love this toothpaste. It&#x27;s less abrasive than typical toothpastes and more natural to be more sensitive for kids. As an adult, I don&#x27;t prefer it myself. But my kids love it. They like the taste.</li>
            <li> My son absolutely loves this toothpaste! There are not many options at the store for kids fluoride free toothpaste unless you buy the kind for infants and he doesn&#x27;t like those flavors. He also like to go around and make everyone smell his breath after brushing because the strawberry flavor and scent is so strong and long lasting. Will definitely be purchasing more of this.</li>
            <li> My kids hate this toothpaste. They complain about the nasty taste and strange smell. I thought I would give this a try just to see how it compares with kids Crest, plus it was cheaper. The verdict, not good! Sorry, but we&#x27;re going back to what we&#x27;re used to.</li>
            <li> Pretty good ingredients, however, not big on the caraageen that&#x27;s added.  Hopefully they will find a substitute for it soon.</li>
            <li> He is so not a fan of the flavor. I however love the texture. We had been using earthpaste (my sons favorite) but I wanted something that would lather</li>
            <li> I love Jason products and support them as much as I can-they are animal and environmentally friendly.  However, this toothpaste got a less than positive response from my three year olds. They said the taste starts off okay and then &amp;#34;gets yucky&amp;#34;. I have not tried it myself but my 6 year old confirmed that it &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t taste right...&amp;#34;. I did give it three stars though because my kids WILL still use it so it can&#x27;t be too terrible:). I will try another fluoride free toothpaste before I by this again.</li>
            <li> Who cares if it tastes like soap if your kids love it!  I haven&#x27;t tasted it, nor will I, because it&#x27;s not my toothpaste.  This is the only natural toothpaste they like so I will keep on buying it.</li>
            <li> I take the packaging word for what the ingredients are,and based on that it is the best kids toothpaste out there- free of harmful chemicals and sugar. There is a bonus as well - my kids love the taste. They say it is like strawberry yogurt, which they like a lot. A good purchase overall.</li>
            <li> Great buy, good size and my daughter loves the taste. I like that it is natural and safe to swallow.</li>
            <li> My daughter really loves the taste and that is a Godsend because otherwise, it s a fight to brush her teeth.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old Never has problems brushing with this toothpaste..he loves it. He actually asks to brush all the time. He hated the other orajel stuff &amp; I never trusted the ingredients in that.</li>
            <li> The tast is so bad that my child won&#x27;t use it - total waste!!  I don&#x27;t recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 5 year old daughter but she told me she didn&#x27;t like the taste of this toothpaste. So I tried it by myself and I think it is way too sweet. I have to switch back to her old toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My previous dentist told me that the ingredient xylitol is good for fighting cavities. I love that it doesn&#x27;t contain saccharin.</li>
            <li> I tasted this toothpaste before I gave it to my son and YUCK, it tastes like soap. Then I happened to notice that it has the same ingredients that are in my shampoo which are Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate, Panthenol and Aloe Vera. No wonder it tastes like and smells like soap. You can even taste the aloe vera which is also very yucky. Since then, I found a much better toothpaste with no toxins. It is Squigle Tooth Builder and is SLS free and fluoride free with no added flavors. It tastes a little sweet because of the xylitol. It is a plain white toothpaste that tastes great and foams well. My son loves it. Here are the ingredients I got off of their website:    natural xylitol(prevents plaque, from birch trees),  purified water (texture, from spring water),  calcite(polishes and cleans, plugs open tubules, heals decay, from limestone), glycerin(moistener, from vegetable oil), poloxamer(super mild detergent, from natural gas),  cellulose gum (thickener, foamer, from trees),  Methocel®(thickener, foamer from trees),  calcium propionate (antimicrobial, heals decay, from trees),  lactoferrin (antimicrobial, from cow&#x27;s milk)    I also entered these ingredients through the EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep Cosmetics Database and it got a zero toxin rating which is the best you can get. So I am going to stick with this one for my 5 year old Son and Myself.   [[ASIN:B00206DXQ0 Squigle Tooth Builder Sensitive Toothpaste (4.4 oz]]</li>
            <li> Taste good only I need more foam...my child really enjoy the taste...</li>
            <li> We have sampled many, many natural toothpastes and this one tastes HORRIBLE. After I bought a pack in bulk, I figured I&#x27;d try it since my girls refused it....but it was SO bad, I ended up throwing it all away. Do NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> My children love this toothpaste and I love it too cause I don&#x27;t have to worry about all the harsh chemicals that they may swallow.  I have used it before as well and think it tastes pretty good.</li>
            <li> Smells great but my children do not like the taste.</li>
            <li> Though the delivery of this product was very fast, the quality didn&#x27;t meet my 8 year-old&#x27;s expectations. The paste smells wonderful but the taste of is not very good.</li>
            <li> My kids REFUSE to use this toothpaste.  So I tried it and yes, it. is. gross.</li>
            <li> im 27 and i got tired of using mint toothpaste, i wanted fruit, so i found this, it tastes good but i dont think it cleaned my teeth very well, i dont know if its just cuz it was kids toothpaste (to me that shouldnt matter cuz im assuming kids need powerful toothpaste too) or what but i like the toothpaste i use now, its an aloe vera based orgainc toothpaste</li>
            <li> omg this tooth paste tastes horrible and does not foam</li>
            <li> My son LOVES this toothpaste!  And I love it, too :) Because it has no SLS or fluoride!</li>
            <li> Kids love the flavor...caught my 2 year old eating it the other day.  No gross chemicals...passes the test for our house.</li>
            <li> This may sound ridiculous, but we have had better luck with this average tasting toothpaste than with those that tasted like candy. My son doesn&#x27;t swallow the toothpaste and the tube lasts much longer now. I have bought 10 different brands of toothpaste for my 3 year old toddler and the Jason Strawberry toothpaste has proven to work the best.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for the most natural, safe, effective, and fluoride free option because my son was swallowing the toothpaste and making a mess along the way. This is certainly not the best tasting toothpaste but it isn&#x27;t that bad either. However, because it does not taste as good as the mainstream blue colored brands, my toddler has stopped eating the toothpaste. He brushes his teeth now and doesn&#x27;t use an incredible amount on his toothbrush either. The blue colored toothpaste products also left a terrible mess everywhere and I love that this one is clear colored so it isn&#x27;t as messy.&lt;br /&gt;We prefer this strawberry flavor and keep it on subscribe and save every month. We use (1) 4.2 ounce tube every 30 days brushing 3 times a day and my son just had a check up at the dentist with no cavities and no signs of gum issues.</li>
            <li> I have tasted this toothpaste that my daughter uses and Love the smell. taste Yummy, sweet smelling. My daughter never wants to brush her teeth and this toothpaste hasn&#x27;t been an issue.  :)</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste but my youngest seems to like it too much and ends up eating it. Oh well, guess it won&#x27;t hurt her...</li>
            <li> The flavor of the big one, children like it very much. It let the child conscious to brush your teeth every day.</li>
            <li> Has a great flavor that our kids love, cleans very well, and safe to swallow. We love the fact that we do not have to worry about the poison known as fluoride. (Fluoride is actually industrial toxic waste from the nuclear and fertilizer industries.) There have been no studies that show the risks of fluoride outweigh the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways enough of that.. this stuff is great, good value for the price, and the best part, its safe!</li>
            <li> If you have a kid who doesn&#x27;t enjoy brushing their teeth, this is definitely a good way to get them to enjoy brushing their teeth. I never tasted it myself but my kids have to remind me every morning and every night that they need to brush their teeth. Just to use this toothpaste. And it was a fantastic price. How can anyone pass that up??</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves the taste; I love that it is fluoride free. Great bargain! I will purchase several tubes the next time .</li>
            <li> My kids HATE this tooth paste, they think it taste like soap. We bought it because we had a problem with my son swallowing tooth paste containing fluoride. After a week of brushing with this tooth paste my son promised he would never swallow tooth paste again, lol.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, it does taste pretty gross to me, soapy and a weird kind of fruity flavor.  But, I wanted a fluoride-free toothpaste for our daughter who&#x27;s not willing to spit out toothpaste while brushing yet.  We tried several and this has been her favorite - she LOVES it and gets excited to brush her teeth.  I don&#x27;t care if I like the taste or not, if it makes her happy about brushing, good enough for me.  She gets plenty of fluoride in all the city water she drinks anyhow.</li>
            <li> although it&#x27;s a different flavor from the one i bought before, my children still love the way the toothpaste tastes. it makes my younger child want to brush his teeth more.</li>
            <li> My son likes to brush his teeth. We tried several toothpastes over three years. This one is the only one he hated. Not to our taste.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a fluoride free toothpaste for my kids for some time. Unfortunately this will not be the one for us.  My kids say it tastes &amp;#34;kinda gross&amp;#34; and it still has SLS in it.  It smells good, but if they didn&#x27;t like the way it tastes, there&#x27;s no point in buying it...</li>
            <li> I have twin 2 year old girls. I use all natural toothpaste myself (Earthpaste) and wanted to do so for my kids. They absolutely love this toothpaste, probably a little too much. However, it is natural and has no fluoride, so I&#x27;m okay with giving it to them for brushing. I&#x27;ve tasted it myself and the flavor of this one and the orange are very good.</li>
            <li> My daughter started throwing a fit each night having to use the Tom&#x27;s strawberry flavor that I purchased on Amazon. Frustrated, I knew I had to find something new but with no fluoride. We found a tube of this at Whole Foods and both kids (age 5 and age 7) have tried it and gave two thumbs up. Teeth brushing is no longer a battle. I&#x27;m not sure why she suddenly stopped liking Tom&#x27;s. They had been using that for awhile. Maybe even kids after awhile need something new and fresh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My disappointment is that this product is only available as an add-on and not a subscription. I would like to subscribe to it. I can subscribe to the orange flavor, but this is the one my kids liked so I would like to stick with what is working.</li>
            <li> Good product,my question is could kids swallow toothpaste occasionally?&lt;br /&gt;Nice smell,kids like that.***********&lt;br /&gt;I like the consistency and fresh smell too.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of a natural toothpaste without fluoride for my almost four year old, but unfortunately he doesn&#x27;t like either the strawberry or the orange favors. I gave my tube to a friend whose kids don&#x27;t mind the taste.</li>
