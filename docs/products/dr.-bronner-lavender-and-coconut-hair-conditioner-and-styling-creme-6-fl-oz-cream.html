    <ol>
            <li>so it is an excellent buy!!</li>
            <li>I am not overly impressed.  </li>
            <li>and I found this one to be perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Great smell of lavender that lingers!</li>
            <li>It does not perform like a rinse-out conditioner or a leave-in conditioner, but I found it to be an excellent styling product.  </li>
            <li>This smells wonderful!  </li>
            <li>For me this product is the easiest after shampoo conditioner that works on my  curly hair the best.</li>
            <li>Her baby hair is very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>It works great!</li>
            <li>Awesome.</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful!  </li>
            <li>Excellent leave in conditioner if you also want a styling product.</li>
            <li>Best feeling in the world.</li>
            <li>Awesome stuff smells great</li>
            <li>Bronner&#x27;s is an INCREDIBLE company.</li>
            <li>(although I gave it a good 3.5 month shot!).</li>
            <li>and so it might worked great for someone else but not for me.</li>
            <li>Great for frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>It also works great as a baby styling creme bc</li>
            <li>This is a  great product but you have to have hair that can tolerate oil to use this.  </li>
            <li>but my husband has thicker hair and it has been great for him and adds texture and shape.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>This smells great</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a great styling creme.</li>
            <li>A great experience.</li>
            <li>I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile Soap for body wash and shampoo, and this is a great compliment to that.  </li>
            <li>Great Quality, great product.</li>
            <li>and i think it works great.</li>
            <li>just the tiniest amount does my hair great justice. ..</li>
            <li>However, when I use this stuff on her hair... it looks amazing!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff though, great product!</li>
            <li>My best friend who is a vegan recommended I go for more organic/natural products.</li>
            <li>It smells great, it takes good care of my hair, it&#x27;s a really good cream rinse -</li>
            <li>It also has a pleasant, but not over powering smell.</li>
            <li>Smells good too.</li>
            <li>Who ever said this smells good</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seller good, product so so.</li>
            <li>It works fairly well.</li>
            <li>It also smells really good.</li>
            <li>Good thing is that it works as a moisturizer and a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>Good ingredients&lt;br</li>
            <li>So good on my hair and scalp -- which need a lot of moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The item was delivered quickly and is perfect in every way.</li>
            <li>Love Dr. Bronner products but this one isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>I also have the doctor Bronners castile soap in lavender, peppermint and almond and all of course very lovely.</li>
            <li>- I love Bronner&#x27;s soap so this sounded great.</li>
            <li>this product works well, is cost effective and of good quality.</li>
            <li>This looks good in my son&#x27;s hair gives it a light shine and smell great</li>
            <li>Love everything about this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>P)&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on my hair!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this leave it creme!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I have just fallen in love with this company!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>I love how silky my hair feels when I use this!  </li>
            <li>My favorite!</li>
            <li>but otherwise was extremely satisfied!</li>
            <li>Love it !</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel it did an amazing detangling job</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so amazing</li>
            <li>Smells amazing</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>and most but not all ingrediants are fair trade certified.</li>
            <li>Also, not a fan of having to dilute the rinse on my own before use.</li>
            <li>Great great product with real results.</li>
            <li>, it didn&#x27;t detangle my hair as well as I would&#x27;ve liked to.</li>
            <li>I bought this to use as a conditioner after I started making my own shampoos</li>
            <li>The smell is nice.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, even 10 hours post use</li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>hubby liked the way my hair smelled and looked.  </li>
            <li>My hair is much healthier, longer and smells awesome &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>Smells so nice.</li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>I bought Dr. Bronner shampoo and conditioner and my hair has never looked more healthy!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best leave-in hair conditioner I ever ran into!!</li>
            <li>The scent is a delicious but far from overpowering lavender.</li>
            <li>and this is the best product I&#x27;ve found that tames it a bit but keeps it looking natural with some shine.</li>
            <li>This is the BEST product I&#x27;ve tried to smooth out my very curly hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great product; light moisturization and light hold for curls.</li>
            <li>This Magic Hair Creme doesn&#x27;t do a thing for me as a leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this product.</li>
            <li>thought I would love it because it is Dr.</li>
            <li>I love using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps, but NOT this hair &amp;#34;conditioner&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>and it really works great, don&#x27;t even need the conditioning rinse.</li>
            <li>ok maybe im a organic FREAK</li>
            <li>Scent is more on the lavender side than coconut.</li>
            <li>Bottle top was unscrewed inside the box when I opened.</li>
            <li>But...its ok after shampooing, conditioning with something else, and then use as a leave in?</li>
            <li>that just ok.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be more thicker and creamier.</li>
            <li>I do also recommend you mostly use this on your ends or on damaged hair.</li>
            <li>the soap smells wonderful, it doesn&#x27;t last on your hair</li>
            <li>I love the pump on the product.</li>
            <li>I love this leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>but on days when I&#x27;m rushed and don&#x27;t condition my hair in the shower, I&#x27;ll use more as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li>However, when using this product my hair felt more hydrated.</li>
            <li>It pains me to give this product 3 stars because I LOVE LOVE LOVE Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had good success with products containing coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I love lavender, and I love coconut.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely more of a medicinal/botanical fragrance.</li>
            <li>I Love that it is organic too.</li>
            <li>I can apply it several days in a row (without hair washing) and her hair looks GREAT!  </li>
            <li>Dr. Bronner products are like magic - this one is no exception.  </li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair feels each time i use it.</li>
            <li>Starting to wonder if there are ANY good organic hair products out there!!!???</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Bonner&#x27;s soaps for years and love them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never felt better or looked better.</li>
            <li>Better than greasy pastes and pomades.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an ok conditioner</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I use his lotions, hand soaps, body soaps and chapsticks and love them all.  </li>
            <li>My hair just looks better throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I don’t use it as a conditioner, but more of a style agent.</li>
            <li>I love Bronners.</li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>the review is … eh, I guess it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>And I love the idea of this.</li>
            <li>Growing the items I buy from them more and more.</li>
            <li>Smells great, but doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair</li>
            <li>We really like it and the scent is great.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>If I use more then a nickle size my hair looks greasy.</li>
            <li>It must not be for all hair types, since others seem to love it.</li>
            <li>I would love it if Bronners made lotions instead of the hair creme -</li>
            <li>However, my hair is very fine and gets greasy very quickly.</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful, and it makes my hair super soft!</li>
            <li>It is important to use all the products according to the package instructions or your hair may not be exactly what you want it to be, but when it&#x27;s used properly-- great results.</li>
            <li>Smells great, does decent moisturizing, but doesn&#x27;t help a whit with preventing tangles and knots.</li>
            <li>but when I rinsed it out, the results were very impressive-- smooth, soft, easy to comb thru hair.</li>
            <li>The cost is very reasonable, and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products are insanely good for you and for the environment.  </li>
            <li>Overall really happy with it and love Bronners!</li>
            <li>Dr. Bronner can&#x27;t do things better, all their products are so great and so natural</li>
            <li>the strong smell of the soap when showering :) ahhh...tea tree...peppermint...</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and is made of wonderful ingredients; however, I cannot seem to rinse it out of my hair enough to not make my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li>It does have a nice texture - the overall smell is pleasant - more on the hemp side than lavender - however</li>
            <li>Dr. Bronner&#x27;s line of castile soaps are now legendary for those of us who demand safe, natural, and socially responsible products.</li>
            <li>The product felt more like it was absorbed into my hair than sitting on top of the hair</li>
            <li>They are filled with truly organic and fair trade ingredients, and they really are a family that cares for the world around them.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft (even after I wash it out) and it&#x27;s great for getting rid of frizz and light hold.</li>
            <li>I love this product, its very light weight, smells nice and leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Although I love the smell and consistency of this product, it is a tad too heavy/greasy for my super fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves fine hair too oily feeling.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it makes it look greasy</li>
            <li>My hair is really fine, so I should have figured this would happen.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love it, but I will say I get super second-day hair with this product.</li>
            <li>It dried to a wonderful smooth texture with almost no tangles, even in the barrette-compression zone after wearing one all day.    </li>
            <li>Nice smell and love that it&#x27;s a natural product,</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a HUGE difference, but it was noticeable to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a HUGE difference, but it was noticeable to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Product also has a lemon fragrance to it that I don&#x27;t enjoy with the lavender.  </li>
            <li>Light feel to hair after application, but cannot use because I cannot tolerate the lemon &amp; lavender combo.</li>
            <li>The scent is light not over powering.</li>
            <li>While marketed as a leave-in conditioner and styling cream, I think it&#x27;s important to know your own hair very well so that you&#x27;ll know how to use this product.</li>
            <li>At first, this was pretty good.</li>
            <li>The smell is good if you love lavender, I&#x27;m not a big fan of it</li>
            <li>About a nickel size is perfect or it can easily leave your hair feeling icky.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re already familiar with coconut oil in your hair, you&#x27;re close to knowing how your hair will respond to this product.</li>
            <li>I love supporting this company with my business.</li>
            <li>but i absolutely am so excited to try this..</li>
            <li>I used it every day and my hair felt significantly softer within the week.</li>
            <li>Originally used the soap on body too, but after not seeing a noticeable difference over my Dove bar, decided to save it for just the hair.&lt;br /&gt;-Though</li>
            <li>So when I came across this product I was extremely excited to try it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was excited to try it out along with the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castille Soap and Shikakai Hair Rinse, in preparation for a camping trip at a place that requires organic products.</li>
            <li>Originally, I purchased this to go with part of an organic hair care routine using Dr. Bronner’s Citrus Rinse and J.R. Liggett’s bar soap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, my original concerns with purchasing this product were as follows – with my resolutions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>and I know it&#x27;s clean,</li>
            <li>Easy to apply to freshly blown hair to manage the frizz.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with this product, my coworker recommended Dr. Bronners to me and it this creme makes my hair look and feel like I just got a fresh cut and deep conditioning.  </li>
            <li>after shampooing with J.R. Liggett&#x27;s Jojoba &amp; Pepperming bar shampoo, taking care of my hair has never been so easy, economical and organic.</li>
            <li>had I blown my hair dry, but air drying did not look so great.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and it makes my hair silky soft!</li>
            <li>Smells great, but wasn&#x27;t what expected at all.</li>
            <li>So after returning home I sent out to find retailers who sold this Brand and eventually found Amazon sold a good bit of different Dr. Bronner products.</li>
            <li>and I really wanted to love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one because they actually use good ingredients.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t it enough to have your values represented in the ingredients and fair trade affiliation?</li>
            <li>rose 100% natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll say the conditioner was better than the shampoo, but it wasn&#x27;t really doing it for me</li>
            <li>I purchased it directly from the Dr. Bronner website, but loved it so much I had to post on here!</li>
            <li>The same quality ingredients and social consciousness are put into this product, and the results are quite wonderful.    </li>
            <li>So soft, so shiny (not greasy though), so healthy and strong...</li>
            <li>If your hair doesn&#x27;t respond well to light oils, then this may not be the right product for you.    </li>
            <li>Lovely scent and hair is soft, smooth, and manageable.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d suggest anyone looking for a natural conditioner to try Nurture My Body conditioner which I enjoy more than this.</li>
            <li>Now I wash my hair with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s lavender liquid castile soap (love) and, after a brief adjustment period, my hair&#x27;s doing better than ever.</li>
            <li>This product works good, it gives my hair a softness without the heavy oily look of most cremes.</li>
            <li>This product smells great and really makes hair shiny (even course-textured hair), but for curly hair it tends to last about a day or so before the frizz kicks in or the curls flatten out.</li>
            <li>First off I am a HUGE fan of all Dr. Bronner products.</li>
            <li>I tried many many other organic hair care product, but none of them satisfied me completely except that they aren&#x27;t filled with toxic crap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft and has a healthy shine without the oily look.</li>
            <li>It takes a TEENSY bit on my somewhat fine hair, or it leaves it very greasy, like you&#x27;d expect coconut oil to.</li>
            <li>By then the curls have lost that crunchy look and form great ringlets once revived with a little spritz of water.</li>
            <li>I decided it might not be fair to expect this product to work great on my hair since it isn&#x27;t marketed as anything other than a general leave-in, light styling product and not one specific for wavy/curly hair.</li>
            <li>but all that really means is have a light touch</li>
            <li>Smells absolutely divine and leaves my hair looking and feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li>My hair has a lot of natural curl, and I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments since I started using it.</li>
            <li>This Magic Organic Hair Creme represents a departure from the soapy simplicity of the old Dr. Bronner&#x27;s lineup.</li>
            <li>Put it in my freshly washed hair and it made it look and feel like I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in a week.</li>
            <li>I have kind of coarse, curly, frizzy hair</li>
            <li>I am transitioning to natural hair and this product is great for any hair type especially for transitioners.</li>
            <li>Got this because I was looking for a more natural, eco-friendly conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural and organic</li>
            <li>I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s natural products.  </li>
            <li>that I kind of tire of the same scent day after day.</li>
            <li>I chose this hair conditioner because I&#x27;m looking for a more natural type of product for my hair.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m looking for more natural types of products to use on my body.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t find the desired effect was worth the use of the product.</li>
            <li>Of course I love that it is all natural and organic.  </li>
            <li>so it would not be economical to use often.</li>
            <li>however, even though it works decently, it leaves a greasy- like coating on my fine hair that makes me look as if my hair is greasy.</li>
            <li>Legit fair trade, seriously organic, no one gets paid more than 5 times another</li>
            <li>Its a good product - probably works well for other types of hair.</li>
            <li>Maybe I can come up with the right amounts to use on use.</li>
            <li>I had to play around to find the right amount.</li>
            <li>It seems to soak it right up without making it look greasy.  </li>
            <li>I use three pumps on damp hair right out of the shower, concentrating on the ends.  </li>
            <li>I like to use this product right when I am out the shower.</li>
            <li>I do like dr. Bronners products in general and like that it is safe to use, so I gave this 2 stars.</li>
            <li>This give a nice weight to my daughter&#x27;s long locks and helps with tangles.</li>
            <li>I have lots of very curly, and somewhat fine hair that tends to be frizzy and IS always very frizzy if no products are used.</li>
            <li>Smells awesome, and actually has a little styling use too.</li>
            <li>So far, my absolute favorite leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>Crazy good products from a genuinely good company.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to black women who are looking for a good hair</li>
            <li>Your hair will not have that chemical-conditioner softness when wet, but after my hair dries it feels soft and looks great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is just worth mentioning that I did try to go without the hair creme and just use the bar soap and the citrus rinse, but my hair wasn&#x27;t as smooth and soft as before.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is just worth mentioning that I did try to go without the hair creme and just use the bar soap and the citrus rinse, but my hair wasn&#x27;t as smooth and soft as before.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>shipped very fast, however I do not think this product is made for my hair</li>
            <li>My 1.5 year old daughter has fine, but LOTS, of type 3 curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I have used it on wet hair, as well, with no problems, when I was originally aiming to use it more as a conditioning boost.</li>
            <li>I bought this soup because i really like the peppermint soup and wanted to see if their other products are as good.</li>
            <li>The first time I used Dr. Bronner was the peppermint soap, I have never used another soap since.</li>
            <li>Very environmentally correct!</li>
            <li>MUCH FOR NOT PUTTING PALM OIl IN IT!</li>
            <li>When I first attempted to use this, the results were pretty</li>
            <li>I suspect my hair actually smells a bit more like some oil (for all my desi folks out there, kinda like Ayurvedic medicine).</li>
            <li>First world problems, I know,</li>
            <li>First pump</li>
            <li>I tried it first as a rinse and a leave in conditioner</li>
            <li>use this daily love the product</li>
            <li>overall I love it.</li>
            <li>I first applied a lot of the product because i have thicker coarser curls (type 4a/b, and some 4c)</li>
            <li>I noticed at first when I apply this conditioner</li>
            <li>Got this to feel comfortable about continuing to use a styling creme that&#x27;s natural.  </li>
            <li>Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products are a bit expensive and I like the liquid soaps the best.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t use as styling cream too heavy, good for a beach day or vaca@South Beach.</li>
            <li>I just have to be sure not to use too much in my daughter&#x27;s hair (or mine) as it will get weighed down and greasy--but that&#x27;s easy to figure out</li>
            <li>Right now, might be using too much shampoo, because hair becomes parched if I don&#x27;t use the leave-in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;-Price.</li>
            <li>and easy to tame when drying :)</li>
            <li>Economically, it&#x27;s great because I only use about 1/2 of the amount I used of the other brands.</li>
            <li>(amazing considering that most CEOs nowadays make hundreds times what their factory floor workers do), employees get 100% free healthcare, and they give like a third of their profits back to charity (beyond their free trade projects, which, among other things, support peaceful Palestinian/Israeli coexistence and medical equipment for hospitals in Sri Lanka).</li>
            <li>and I have super thick hair that comes down to my shoulders, and that is the perfect amount for me.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I liked this conditioner at first because it left a very heavy residue.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, in the dry indoor heat of winter, I don&#x27;t frizz out.</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft, sleek and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It smelled very good, but it was very heavy on my medium-thick blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair nice and silky, really tames down the flyaways.</li>
            <li>I know the coconut in it is for real because when i put it on and then blow dry my hair, it smells like toasted coconut :)</li>
            <li>It would probably be fine after a regular shampoo, but I still have a whole bottle of lavender soap to finish up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough not to feel \\&quot;gunky\\&quot; but really does the job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used just a tiny drop, but it really did make a huge difference in the smoothness and softness of my hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really suggest it to someone who uses no conditioner at all in the shower, though, which I guess might be the purpose, because it really does condition your hair.</li>
            <li>otherwise my hair comes out too greasy (too much product) or too frizzy (</li>
            <li>Even our Whole Foods, Sprouts, etc.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For those of you who are looking for an organic and gentle conditioner, I would recommend this, but be prepared to spend a lot of money.</li>
            <li>Environmentally, socially, financially responsible through and through.</li>
            <li>Do you know how much time that saves me in the morning?</li>
            <li>Do not use too much because you will regret it</li>
            <li>To much.</li>
            <li>something I really look for.</li>
            <li>Too much</li>
            <li>she does not like much to be done with her hair.  </li>
            <li>(we use another gentle baby shampoo)</li>
            <li>it de-frizzes and creates a gentle hold to keep her curls separate and in place.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t apply very evenly&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really convinced to stop using chemicals in my house</li>
            <li>I really like how this makes my heir feel.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much of it or you&#x27;ll look greasy.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have to use much</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t see any difference in the volume of my hair though&lt;</li>
            <li>I really softens my hair and allows me to comb through my hair without breakage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am still trying to discover how much to use.</li>
            <li>However, I’ve found that I really just prefer to use it after styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff, as others have said, can leave your hair sticky and greasy if you use too much.</li>
            <li>I do actually really like this hair creme -</li>
            <li>After my hair air dried, I could still run my fingers through it from root to tip with ease, which is rarely the case with most products.  </li>
            <li>works good on my  kinky thick hair</li>
            <li>And although I have a lot of hair, my biggest problem is flat hair because it is so fine.</li>
            <li>It enables her hair to remain tangle free and it keeps my frizz down and allows nice waves/curls to form when I don&#x27;t blow dry and protects my hair when I straighten it.</li>
            <li>It is just right for her wild hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other hair products and liked them as they made my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I have shoulder length slightly wavy, very fine hair-- and a lot of it.</li>
            <li>Other than that the product is okay.</li>
            <li>May work better for other hair types.</li>
            <li>I like this and many other of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>but it sounded better than the other options.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product b/c I absolutely love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s other products.  </li>
            <li>Too much makes your hair really waxy and is hard to wash out but overall a great product</li>
            <li>My hair is coarse and curly -- this conditioner helps smooth and tame my flyaways (it may not work as well on very fine hair or oily hair.)</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re interested in more socially responsible products, check out the Good Guide app (here&#x27;s the Apple link: [...] )</li>
            <li>It does not leave my hair feeling oily, takes very little to do its job, and smells nice.</li>
            <li>I started using a super tiny amount because of allllll the reviews warning me to, but later found that I didn’t need to be as worried amount the amount as I originally thought.</li>
            <li>This one leaves your hair really soft, less frizzy, it&#x27;s super affordable and i love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, smooth, feels thicker and it typically looks and feels even better the next day.. and the day after that.</li>
            <li>I only want body/hair products not tested on animals, and have tried so many over the years that are just a big no.</li>
            <li>stores don&#x27;t seem to carry this particular Dr. B product.</li>
            <li>A small dab keeps my hair neatly in place and looking great all day long.</li>
            <li>She only gets it washed once a week, twice if we are lucky.  </li>
            <li>I mainly use this product after I flat-iron my hair.</li>
            <li>The best part as with all Dr. Bronners products this stuff is concentrated( a small dot is enough if applied to wet hair).</li>
            <li>so must order online though the price is a bit high.</li>
            <li>So much more natural feeling than other hair products.</li>
            <li>It smells so good and a little defiantly goes a long way.</li>
            <li>and sometimes my hair can dry-out throughout the day and be hard to manage to keep the curls looking nice.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it weighed it down to much.</li>
            <li>When I put it on, I was surprised because it did not &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; very creamy as I worked it thru my hair--</li>
            <li>I had to rinse it out and use my normal conditioner.</li>
            <li>, be aware that the switch did make my hair feel different in a very indescribable way.</li>
            <li>, be aware that the switch did make my hair feel different in a very indescribable way.</li>
            <li>you gives you more control as far as where you need to moisturize and how heavily.</li>
            <li>I even cleaned dark blue marker off a light pink upholstered bed (my little one decided that might be a great idea.)</li>
            <li>I have used it to mix up natural foaming handsoap, laundry detergent, body wash, you name it!</li>
            <li>and I have looked at a lot of natural products!  </li>
            <li>The next night, I washed my hair with the liquid soap again and followed it with a vinegar rinse to remove any soap residue, which definitely reduced much of the \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; feeling right there.    </li>
            <li>If you must use something to tame hair (which I found is not necessary with the combination above), Virgin Unrefined Coconut Oil (yes, straight from the grocery shelves) is sooo much cheaper, has sooo many more uses, is just plain all-natural and it smells sooo mm, mm</li>
            <li>In actuality, I ended up using this more so after I reverted back to a conventional hair-care routine after the method with the Citrus Rinse did not work well for me</li>
            <li>AND my hair is still dry which I didn&#x27;t even think was possible to have both greasy and dry hair - and you absolutely cannot use it more than one day in a row.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m just not used to it.smooth, feels thicker and it typically looks and feels even better the next day..</li>
            <li>It does not have that toxic / chemical smell so many hair products leave you stuck with, nor does it feel icky to the touch.  </li>
            <li>thing is gonna last me a long long time for sure</li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t feel soft and silky as it should have been.</li>
            <li>well crunchy is really the only word I can think of.</li>
            <li>Bottle says to put in after shampooing to make hair soft.</li>
            <li>and this didn&#x27;t feel like it moisturized or really nourished deeply.</li>
            <li>So far, my hair has improved but that&#x27;s about it.  </li>
            <li>Used in conjunction with J.R. Liggetts old fashioned bar shampoo (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GJL22K/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1).</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re interested, it&#x27;s long but informative i think.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and moisturized without making it oil.</li>
            <li>that is completely natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far number one for hair growth in my experience.</li>
            <li>it was very drying and left my hair crunchy feeling.</li>
            <li>However, once I adjusted the portions properly as some reviews suggested, it complimented my hair very well.</li>
            <li>I bpught this product wanting something almost completely non toxic for my daughter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional Hair Stylist, there are a lot of leave-in conditioners I&#x27;ve tried but nothing like this one.</li>
            <li>I always mix it with natural hair oils.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t contain harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I have used this 4x&#x27;s so far.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is natural.</li>
            <li>actually found this not to matter so much.</li>
            <li>The fact that it is completely organic is a plus</li>
            <li>After trying the natural way of shampoo (1.5cups virgin coconut milk +</li>
            <li>and I like their philosophy of not harming the environment and about providing natural products without chemicals.</li>
            <li>but a little goes a long way and your hair is more than conditioned with this product.</li>
            <li>, my hair is natural and leans more towards tightly curled than loosely curled.</li>
            <li>The instructions say to apply to clean hair after towel drying but this can lend to that heavy moisturized look.</li>
            <li>: love the company and the results, not such a big fan of the price or the slight oily smell--but that&#x27;s what you get for all-natural.</li>
            <li>all came at different times (only days apart), but I got to try the Lavender and Coconut hair creme first with my homemade products.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this product would make my hair more manageable and would cut down on my daily flat ironing, all it did was make my hair greasy!</li>
            <li>I have to be very careful to use just the right amount</li>
            <li>I have long and sometimes very frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>It barely felt like it got my hair soft-</li>
            <li>I finally got around to getting new conditioner.</li>
            <li>read other reviews on here cautioning not to use very much.</li>
            <li>(it can strip too much oil off your hair leaving it dry and kicking your scalp into oil-production overdrive).</li>
            <li>Love the smell, but it&#x27;s obviously not for any hair type but thick and course.</li>
            <li>My hair type is bleached, double processed, long, fine, dry and very fragile.  </li>
            <li>The next time, I barely used any product (less than a dime size amount) and it was still mildly greasy.  </li>
            <li>The delicate scent and the light weight of the oils helps create a finished look.</li>
            <li>Careful not to use too much.</li>
            <li>I switched to American Crew Pomade - which is more expensive at around fifteen dollars - but the jar of pomade lasts me much</li>
            <li>and it barely made a difference</li>
            <li>Even with careful application, it makes my hair take much longer to air-dry</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend this product for the health conscious consumer.</li>
            <li>I really hoped I would like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s conditioner just as much, but alas, there was so much oil in it that even after a legnthy rinsing my hair felt greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on products to help increase volume, but I really hadn&#x27;t found anything that worked all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this occasionally (trying to use up an old product) and my husband uses it every time he washes his hair with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint bar soap.</li>
            <li>I used it for a while then went back to my old shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I used a full pump (I have shoulder length, fine but thick, bleached blonde hair) and had to shake some off because I was afraid it was too much.</li>
            <li>I blow dry it straight or let it dry natural and curly</li>
            <li>Hair much improved without all the chemicals in other products.</li>
            <li>But just the right amount gives you that day-after-washing look to tame frizzies.</li>
            <li>Not overly impressed not super disappointed.</li>
            <li>I hope they continue to sell enough of this to keep the product line in that they must not sell much because a bottle can last such a long time!  </li>
            <li>I first used about a nickle sized amount on my wet/damp hair after a shower and when I blow dried my hair, it was so greasy that I had to re-wash it.  </li>
            <li>and it really helps cut down on irritations</li>
            <li>Love the smell and lightness of the product; however, it has left my hair slightly stiff when applied heavily or used daily.</li>
            <li>A bit &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; for those without super thick hair&lt;br /&gt;2.)</li>
            <li>Works well on my super thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re hoping it will detangle and soften your hair after the Bronners soap made it a waxy mess and the shikakai rinse didn&#x27;t help much you can give up, thats the reason I ordered it</li>
            <li>and I am very disappointed since the soap and rinse have been so wonderful.</li>
            <li>I was trying to find a conditioner for my hair b/c after I switched to natural hair products, they left my hair dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li>The texture is light, a little \\&quot;thin,\\&quot; and a little slippery without being viscous.</li>
            <li>She does have fine thin hair so even with the slightest amount it leaves her hair looking greasy and stringy.</li>
            <li>I have very fine and dry hair, and will save this conditioner just for putting on the dry ends for deep conditioning when I know I&#x27;m not going to be styling my hair down for a few days and have enough shampoos to wash it out.</li>
            <li>that doesn&#x27;t bother me; but if I were to wear my hair down, I don&#x27;t particularly care for the greasy appearance, though.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter how much or how little I used, always makes my hair greasy and gross.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> so it is an excellent buy!!</li>
            <li> I am not overly impressed.  </li>
            <li> and I found this one to be perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Great smell of lavender that lingers!</li>
            <li> It does not perform like a rinse-out conditioner or a leave-in conditioner, but I found it to be an excellent styling product.  </li>
            <li> This smells wonderful!  </li>
            <li> For me this product is the easiest after shampoo conditioner that works on my  curly hair the best.</li>
            <li> Her baby hair is very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> It works great!</li>
            <li> Awesome.</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful!  </li>
            <li> Excellent leave in conditioner if you also want a styling product.</li>
            <li> Best feeling in the world.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff smells great</li>
            <li> Bronner&#x27;s is an INCREDIBLE company.</li>
            <li> (although I gave it a good 3.5 month shot!).</li>
            <li> and so it might worked great for someone else but not for me.</li>
            <li> Great for frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It also works great as a baby styling creme bc</li>
            <li> This is a  great product but you have to have hair that can tolerate oil to use this.  </li>
            <li> but my husband has thicker hair and it has been great for him and adds texture and shape.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> This smells great</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a great styling creme.</li>
            <li> A great experience.</li>
            <li> I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile Soap for body wash and shampoo, and this is a great compliment to that.  </li>
            <li> Great Quality, great product.</li>
            <li> and i think it works great.</li>
            <li> just the tiniest amount does my hair great justice. ..</li>
            <li> However, when I use this stuff on her hair... it looks amazing!  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff though, great product!</li>
            <li> My best friend who is a vegan recommended I go for more organic/natural products.</li>
            <li> It smells great, it takes good care of my hair, it&#x27;s a really good cream rinse -</li>
            <li> It also has a pleasant, but not over powering smell.</li>
            <li> Smells good too.</li>
            <li> Who ever said this smells good</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seller good, product so so.</li>
            <li> It works fairly well.</li>
            <li> It also smells really good.</li>
            <li> Good thing is that it works as a moisturizer and a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Good ingredients&lt;br</li>
            <li> So good on my hair and scalp -- which need a lot of moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The item was delivered quickly and is perfect in every way.</li>
            <li> Love Dr. Bronner products but this one isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> I also have the doctor Bronners castile soap in lavender, peppermint and almond and all of course very lovely.</li>
            <li> - I love Bronner&#x27;s soap so this sounded great.</li>
            <li> this product works well, is cost effective and of good quality.</li>
            <li> This looks good in my son&#x27;s hair gives it a light shine and smell great</li>
            <li> Love everything about this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> P)&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on my hair!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this leave it creme!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I have just fallen in love with this company!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> I love how silky my hair feels when I use this!  </li>
            <li> My favorite!</li>
            <li> but otherwise was extremely satisfied!</li>
            <li> Love it !</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel it did an amazing detangling job</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so amazing</li>
            <li> Smells amazing</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> and most but not all ingrediants are fair trade certified.</li>
            <li> Also, not a fan of having to dilute the rinse on my own before use.</li>
            <li> Great great product with real results.</li>
            <li> , it didn&#x27;t detangle my hair as well as I would&#x27;ve liked to.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a conditioner after I started making my own shampoos</li>
            <li> The smell is nice.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, even 10 hours post use</li>
            <li> Smells nice.</li>
            <li> hubby liked the way my hair smelled and looked.  </li>
            <li> My hair is much healthier, longer and smells awesome &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Smells so nice.</li>
            <li> Smells nice.</li>
            <li> I bought Dr. Bronner shampoo and conditioner and my hair has never looked more healthy!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best leave-in hair conditioner I ever ran into!!</li>
            <li> The scent is a delicious but far from overpowering lavender.</li>
            <li> and this is the best product I&#x27;ve found that tames it a bit but keeps it looking natural with some shine.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST product I&#x27;ve tried to smooth out my very curly hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great product; light moisturization and light hold for curls.</li>
            <li> This Magic Hair Creme doesn&#x27;t do a thing for me as a leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> thought I would love it because it is Dr.</li>
            <li> I love using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps, but NOT this hair &amp;#34;conditioner&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and it really works great, don&#x27;t even need the conditioning rinse.</li>
            <li> ok maybe im a organic FREAK</li>
            <li> Scent is more on the lavender side than coconut.</li>
            <li> Bottle top was unscrewed inside the box when I opened.</li>
            <li> But...its ok after shampooing, conditioning with something else, and then use as a leave in?</li>
            <li> that just ok.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more thicker and creamier.</li>
            <li> I do also recommend you mostly use this on your ends or on damaged hair.</li>
            <li> the soap smells wonderful, it doesn&#x27;t last on your hair</li>
            <li> I love the pump on the product.</li>
            <li> I love this leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> but on days when I&#x27;m rushed and don&#x27;t condition my hair in the shower, I&#x27;ll use more as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li> However, when using this product my hair felt more hydrated.</li>
            <li> It pains me to give this product 3 stars because I LOVE LOVE LOVE Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good success with products containing coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I love lavender, and I love coconut.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely more of a medicinal/botanical fragrance.</li>
            <li> I Love that it is organic too.</li>
            <li> I can apply it several days in a row (without hair washing) and her hair looks GREAT!  </li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner products are like magic - this one is no exception.  </li>
            <li> love</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair feels each time i use it.</li>
            <li> Starting to wonder if there are ANY good organic hair products out there!!!???</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Bonner&#x27;s soaps for years and love them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt better or looked better.</li>
            <li> Better than greasy pastes and pomades.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an ok conditioner</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I use his lotions, hand soaps, body soaps and chapsticks and love them all.  </li>
            <li> My hair just looks better throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I don’t use it as a conditioner, but more of a style agent.</li>
            <li> I love Bronners.</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> the review is … eh, I guess it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> And I love the idea of this.</li>
            <li> Growing the items I buy from them more and more.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair</li>
            <li> We really like it and the scent is great.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> If I use more then a nickle size my hair looks greasy.</li>
            <li> It must not be for all hair types, since others seem to love it.</li>
            <li> I would love it if Bronners made lotions instead of the hair creme -</li>
            <li> However, my hair is very fine and gets greasy very quickly.</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful, and it makes my hair super soft!</li>
            <li> It is important to use all the products according to the package instructions or your hair may not be exactly what you want it to be, but when it&#x27;s used properly-- great results.</li>
            <li> Smells great, does decent moisturizing, but doesn&#x27;t help a whit with preventing tangles and knots.</li>
            <li> but when I rinsed it out, the results were very impressive-- smooth, soft, easy to comb thru hair.</li>
            <li> The cost is very reasonable, and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products are insanely good for you and for the environment.  </li>
            <li> Overall really happy with it and love Bronners!</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner can&#x27;t do things better, all their products are so great and so natural</li>
            <li> the strong smell of the soap when showering :) ahhh...tea tree...peppermint...</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and is made of wonderful ingredients; however, I cannot seem to rinse it out of my hair enough to not make my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> It does have a nice texture - the overall smell is pleasant - more on the hemp side than lavender - however</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s line of castile soaps are now legendary for those of us who demand safe, natural, and socially responsible products.</li>
            <li> The product felt more like it was absorbed into my hair than sitting on top of the hair</li>
            <li> They are filled with truly organic and fair trade ingredients, and they really are a family that cares for the world around them.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft (even after I wash it out) and it&#x27;s great for getting rid of frizz and light hold.</li>
            <li> I love this product, its very light weight, smells nice and leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Although I love the smell and consistency of this product, it is a tad too heavy/greasy for my super fine curly hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves fine hair too oily feeling.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it makes it look greasy</li>
            <li> My hair is really fine, so I should have figured this would happen.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it, but I will say I get super second-day hair with this product.</li>
            <li> It dried to a wonderful smooth texture with almost no tangles, even in the barrette-compression zone after wearing one all day.    </li>
            <li> Nice smell and love that it&#x27;s a natural product,</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a HUGE difference, but it was noticeable to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a HUGE difference, but it was noticeable to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Product also has a lemon fragrance to it that I don&#x27;t enjoy with the lavender.  </li>
            <li> Light feel to hair after application, but cannot use because I cannot tolerate the lemon &amp; lavender combo.</li>
            <li> The scent is light not over powering.</li>
            <li> While marketed as a leave-in conditioner and styling cream, I think it&#x27;s important to know your own hair very well so that you&#x27;ll know how to use this product.</li>
            <li> At first, this was pretty good.</li>
            <li> The smell is good if you love lavender, I&#x27;m not a big fan of it</li>
            <li> About a nickel size is perfect or it can easily leave your hair feeling icky.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re already familiar with coconut oil in your hair, you&#x27;re close to knowing how your hair will respond to this product.</li>
            <li> I love supporting this company with my business.</li>
            <li> but i absolutely am so excited to try this..</li>
            <li> I used it every day and my hair felt significantly softer within the week.</li>
            <li> Originally used the soap on body too, but after not seeing a noticeable difference over my Dove bar, decided to save it for just the hair.&lt;br /&gt;-Though</li>
            <li> So when I came across this product I was extremely excited to try it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was excited to try it out along with the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castille Soap and Shikakai Hair Rinse, in preparation for a camping trip at a place that requires organic products.</li>
            <li> Originally, I purchased this to go with part of an organic hair care routine using Dr. Bronner’s Citrus Rinse and J.R. Liggett’s bar soap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, my original concerns with purchasing this product were as follows – with my resolutions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> and I know it&#x27;s clean,</li>
            <li> Easy to apply to freshly blown hair to manage the frizz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this product, my coworker recommended Dr. Bronners to me and it this creme makes my hair look and feel like I just got a fresh cut and deep conditioning.  </li>
            <li> after shampooing with J.R. Liggett&#x27;s Jojoba &amp; Pepperming bar shampoo, taking care of my hair has never been so easy, economical and organic.</li>
            <li> had I blown my hair dry, but air drying did not look so great.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and it makes my hair silky soft!</li>
            <li> Smells great, but wasn&#x27;t what expected at all.</li>
            <li> So after returning home I sent out to find retailers who sold this Brand and eventually found Amazon sold a good bit of different Dr. Bronner products.</li>
            <li> and I really wanted to love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one because they actually use good ingredients.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t it enough to have your values represented in the ingredients and fair trade affiliation?</li>
            <li> rose 100% natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll say the conditioner was better than the shampoo, but it wasn&#x27;t really doing it for me</li>
            <li> I purchased it directly from the Dr. Bronner website, but loved it so much I had to post on here!</li>
            <li> The same quality ingredients and social consciousness are put into this product, and the results are quite wonderful.    </li>
            <li> So soft, so shiny (not greasy though), so healthy and strong...</li>
            <li> If your hair doesn&#x27;t respond well to light oils, then this may not be the right product for you.    </li>
            <li> Lovely scent and hair is soft, smooth, and manageable.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d suggest anyone looking for a natural conditioner to try Nurture My Body conditioner which I enjoy more than this.</li>
            <li> Now I wash my hair with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s lavender liquid castile soap (love) and, after a brief adjustment period, my hair&#x27;s doing better than ever.</li>
            <li> This product works good, it gives my hair a softness without the heavy oily look of most cremes.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and really makes hair shiny (even course-textured hair), but for curly hair it tends to last about a day or so before the frizz kicks in or the curls flatten out.</li>
            <li> First off I am a HUGE fan of all Dr. Bronner products.</li>
            <li> I tried many many other organic hair care product, but none of them satisfied me completely except that they aren&#x27;t filled with toxic crap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is super soft and has a healthy shine without the oily look.</li>
            <li> It takes a TEENSY bit on my somewhat fine hair, or it leaves it very greasy, like you&#x27;d expect coconut oil to.</li>
            <li> By then the curls have lost that crunchy look and form great ringlets once revived with a little spritz of water.</li>
            <li> I decided it might not be fair to expect this product to work great on my hair since it isn&#x27;t marketed as anything other than a general leave-in, light styling product and not one specific for wavy/curly hair.</li>
            <li> but all that really means is have a light touch</li>
            <li> Smells absolutely divine and leaves my hair looking and feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> My hair has a lot of natural curl, and I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments since I started using it.</li>
            <li> This Magic Organic Hair Creme represents a departure from the soapy simplicity of the old Dr. Bronner&#x27;s lineup.</li>
            <li> Put it in my freshly washed hair and it made it look and feel like I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in a week.</li>
            <li> I have kind of coarse, curly, frizzy hair</li>
            <li> I am transitioning to natural hair and this product is great for any hair type especially for transitioners.</li>
            <li> Got this because I was looking for a more natural, eco-friendly conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s all natural and organic</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s natural products.  </li>
            <li> that I kind of tire of the same scent day after day.</li>
            <li> I chose this hair conditioner because I&#x27;m looking for a more natural type of product for my hair.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m looking for more natural types of products to use on my body.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t find the desired effect was worth the use of the product.</li>
            <li> Of course I love that it is all natural and organic.  </li>
            <li> so it would not be economical to use often.</li>
            <li> however, even though it works decently, it leaves a greasy- like coating on my fine hair that makes me look as if my hair is greasy.</li>
            <li> Legit fair trade, seriously organic, no one gets paid more than 5 times another</li>
            <li> Its a good product - probably works well for other types of hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe I can come up with the right amounts to use on use.</li>
            <li> I had to play around to find the right amount.</li>
            <li> It seems to soak it right up without making it look greasy.  </li>
            <li> I use three pumps on damp hair right out of the shower, concentrating on the ends.  </li>
            <li> I like to use this product right when I am out the shower.</li>
            <li> I do like dr. Bronners products in general and like that it is safe to use, so I gave this 2 stars.</li>
            <li> This give a nice weight to my daughter&#x27;s long locks and helps with tangles.</li>
            <li> I have lots of very curly, and somewhat fine hair that tends to be frizzy and IS always very frizzy if no products are used.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome, and actually has a little styling use too.</li>
            <li> So far, my absolute favorite leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Crazy good products from a genuinely good company.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to black women who are looking for a good hair</li>
            <li> Your hair will not have that chemical-conditioner softness when wet, but after my hair dries it feels soft and looks great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is just worth mentioning that I did try to go without the hair creme and just use the bar soap and the citrus rinse, but my hair wasn&#x27;t as smooth and soft as before.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is just worth mentioning that I did try to go without the hair creme and just use the bar soap and the citrus rinse, but my hair wasn&#x27;t as smooth and soft as before.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> shipped very fast, however I do not think this product is made for my hair</li>
            <li> My 1.5 year old daughter has fine, but LOTS, of type 3 curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have used it on wet hair, as well, with no problems, when I was originally aiming to use it more as a conditioning boost.</li>
            <li> I bought this soup because i really like the peppermint soup and wanted to see if their other products are as good.</li>
            <li> The first time I used Dr. Bronner was the peppermint soap, I have never used another soap since.</li>
            <li> Very environmentally correct!</li>
            <li> MUCH FOR NOT PUTTING PALM OIl IN IT!</li>
            <li> When I first attempted to use this, the results were pretty</li>
            <li> I suspect my hair actually smells a bit more like some oil (for all my desi folks out there, kinda like Ayurvedic medicine).</li>
            <li> First world problems, I know,</li>
            <li> First pump</li>
            <li> I tried it first as a rinse and a leave in conditioner</li>
            <li> use this daily love the product</li>
            <li> overall I love it.</li>
            <li> I first applied a lot of the product because i have thicker coarser curls (type 4a/b, and some 4c)</li>
            <li> I noticed at first when I apply this conditioner</li>
            <li> Got this to feel comfortable about continuing to use a styling creme that&#x27;s natural.  </li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products are a bit expensive and I like the liquid soaps the best.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t use as styling cream too heavy, good for a beach day or vaca@South Beach.</li>
            <li> I just have to be sure not to use too much in my daughter&#x27;s hair (or mine) as it will get weighed down and greasy--but that&#x27;s easy to figure out</li>
            <li> Right now, might be using too much shampoo, because hair becomes parched if I don&#x27;t use the leave-in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;-Price.</li>
            <li> and easy to tame when drying :)</li>
            <li> Economically, it&#x27;s great because I only use about 1/2 of the amount I used of the other brands.</li>
            <li> (amazing considering that most CEOs nowadays make hundreds times what their factory floor workers do), employees get 100% free healthcare, and they give like a third of their profits back to charity (beyond their free trade projects, which, among other things, support peaceful Palestinian/Israeli coexistence and medical equipment for hospitals in Sri Lanka).</li>
            <li> and I have super thick hair that comes down to my shoulders, and that is the perfect amount for me.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I liked this conditioner at first because it left a very heavy residue.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more, in the dry indoor heat of winter, I don&#x27;t frizz out.</li>
            <li> My hair is super soft, sleek and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It smelled very good, but it was very heavy on my medium-thick blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair nice and silky, really tames down the flyaways.</li>
            <li> I know the coconut in it is for real because when i put it on and then blow dry my hair, it smells like toasted coconut :)</li>
            <li> It would probably be fine after a regular shampoo, but I still have a whole bottle of lavender soap to finish up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light enough not to feel \\&quot;gunky\\&quot; but really does the job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used just a tiny drop, but it really did make a huge difference in the smoothness and softness of my hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d really suggest it to someone who uses no conditioner at all in the shower, though, which I guess might be the purpose, because it really does condition your hair.</li>
            <li> otherwise my hair comes out too greasy (too much product) or too frizzy (</li>
            <li> Even our Whole Foods, Sprouts, etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For those of you who are looking for an organic and gentle conditioner, I would recommend this, but be prepared to spend a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Environmentally, socially, financially responsible through and through.</li>
            <li> Do you know how much time that saves me in the morning?</li>
            <li> Do not use too much because you will regret it</li>
            <li> To much.</li>
            <li> something I really look for.</li>
            <li> Too much</li>
            <li> she does not like much to be done with her hair.  </li>
            <li> (we use another gentle baby shampoo)</li>
            <li> it de-frizzes and creates a gentle hold to keep her curls separate and in place.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t apply very evenly&lt;br</li>
            <li> This really convinced to stop using chemicals in my house</li>
            <li> I really like how this makes my heir feel.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much of it or you&#x27;ll look greasy.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have to use much</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see any difference in the volume of my hair though&lt;</li>
            <li> I really softens my hair and allows me to comb through my hair without breakage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am still trying to discover how much to use.</li>
            <li> However, I’ve found that I really just prefer to use it after styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff, as others have said, can leave your hair sticky and greasy if you use too much.</li>
            <li> I do actually really like this hair creme -</li>
            <li> After my hair air dried, I could still run my fingers through it from root to tip with ease, which is rarely the case with most products.  </li>
            <li> works good on my  kinky thick hair</li>
            <li> And although I have a lot of hair, my biggest problem is flat hair because it is so fine.</li>
            <li> It enables her hair to remain tangle free and it keeps my frizz down and allows nice waves/curls to form when I don&#x27;t blow dry and protects my hair when I straighten it.</li>
            <li> It is just right for her wild hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other hair products and liked them as they made my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I have shoulder length slightly wavy, very fine hair-- and a lot of it.</li>
            <li> Other than that the product is okay.</li>
            <li> May work better for other hair types.</li>
            <li> I like this and many other of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> but it sounded better than the other options.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product b/c I absolutely love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s other products.  </li>
            <li> Too much makes your hair really waxy and is hard to wash out but overall a great product</li>
            <li> My hair is coarse and curly -- this conditioner helps smooth and tame my flyaways (it may not work as well on very fine hair or oily hair.)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re interested in more socially responsible products, check out the Good Guide app (here&#x27;s the Apple link: [...] )</li>
            <li> It does not leave my hair feeling oily, takes very little to do its job, and smells nice.</li>
            <li> I started using a super tiny amount because of allllll the reviews warning me to, but later found that I didn’t need to be as worried amount the amount as I originally thought.</li>
            <li> This one leaves your hair really soft, less frizzy, it&#x27;s super affordable and i love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, smooth, feels thicker and it typically looks and feels even better the next day.. and the day after that.</li>
            <li> I only want body/hair products not tested on animals, and have tried so many over the years that are just a big no.</li>
            <li> stores don&#x27;t seem to carry this particular Dr. B product.</li>
            <li> A small dab keeps my hair neatly in place and looking great all day long.</li>
            <li> She only gets it washed once a week, twice if we are lucky.  </li>
            <li> I mainly use this product after I flat-iron my hair.</li>
            <li> The best part as with all Dr. Bronners products this stuff is concentrated( a small dot is enough if applied to wet hair).</li>
            <li> so must order online though the price is a bit high.</li>
            <li> So much more natural feeling than other hair products.</li>
            <li> It smells so good and a little defiantly goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and sometimes my hair can dry-out throughout the day and be hard to manage to keep the curls looking nice.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it weighed it down to much.</li>
            <li> When I put it on, I was surprised because it did not &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; very creamy as I worked it thru my hair--</li>
            <li> I had to rinse it out and use my normal conditioner.</li>
            <li> , be aware that the switch did make my hair feel different in a very indescribable way.</li>
            <li> , be aware that the switch did make my hair feel different in a very indescribable way.</li>
            <li> you gives you more control as far as where you need to moisturize and how heavily.</li>
            <li> I even cleaned dark blue marker off a light pink upholstered bed (my little one decided that might be a great idea.)</li>
            <li> I have used it to mix up natural foaming handsoap, laundry detergent, body wash, you name it!</li>
            <li> and I have looked at a lot of natural products!  </li>
            <li> The next night, I washed my hair with the liquid soap again and followed it with a vinegar rinse to remove any soap residue, which definitely reduced much of the \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; feeling right there.    </li>
            <li> If you must use something to tame hair (which I found is not necessary with the combination above), Virgin Unrefined Coconut Oil (yes, straight from the grocery shelves) is sooo much cheaper, has sooo many more uses, is just plain all-natural and it smells sooo mm, mm</li>
            <li> In actuality, I ended up using this more so after I reverted back to a conventional hair-care routine after the method with the Citrus Rinse did not work well for me</li>
            <li> AND my hair is still dry which I didn&#x27;t even think was possible to have both greasy and dry hair - and you absolutely cannot use it more than one day in a row.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m just not used to it.smooth, feels thicker and it typically looks and feels even better the next day..</li>
            <li> It does not have that toxic / chemical smell so many hair products leave you stuck with, nor does it feel icky to the touch.  </li>
            <li> thing is gonna last me a long long time for sure</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t feel soft and silky as it should have been.</li>
            <li> well crunchy is really the only word I can think of.</li>
            <li> Bottle says to put in after shampooing to make hair soft.</li>
            <li> and this didn&#x27;t feel like it moisturized or really nourished deeply.</li>
            <li> So far, my hair has improved but that&#x27;s about it.  </li>
            <li> Used in conjunction with J.R. Liggetts old fashioned bar shampoo (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GJL22K/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1).</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re interested, it&#x27;s long but informative i think.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and moisturized without making it oil.</li>
            <li> that is completely natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by far number one for hair growth in my experience.</li>
            <li> it was very drying and left my hair crunchy feeling.</li>
            <li> However, once I adjusted the portions properly as some reviews suggested, it complimented my hair very well.</li>
            <li> I bpught this product wanting something almost completely non toxic for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional Hair Stylist, there are a lot of leave-in conditioners I&#x27;ve tried but nothing like this one.</li>
            <li> I always mix it with natural hair oils.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t contain harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I have used this 4x&#x27;s so far.  </li>
            <li> I like that it is natural.</li>
            <li> actually found this not to matter so much.</li>
            <li> The fact that it is completely organic is a plus</li>
            <li> After trying the natural way of shampoo (1.5cups virgin coconut milk +</li>
            <li> and I like their philosophy of not harming the environment and about providing natural products without chemicals.</li>
            <li> but a little goes a long way and your hair is more than conditioned with this product.</li>
            <li> , my hair is natural and leans more towards tightly curled than loosely curled.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to apply to clean hair after towel drying but this can lend to that heavy moisturized look.</li>
            <li> : love the company and the results, not such a big fan of the price or the slight oily smell--but that&#x27;s what you get for all-natural.</li>
            <li> all came at different times (only days apart), but I got to try the Lavender and Coconut hair creme first with my homemade products.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this product would make my hair more manageable and would cut down on my daily flat ironing, all it did was make my hair greasy!</li>
            <li> I have to be very careful to use just the right amount</li>
            <li> I have long and sometimes very frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It barely felt like it got my hair soft-</li>
            <li> I finally got around to getting new conditioner.</li>
            <li> read other reviews on here cautioning not to use very much.</li>
            <li> (it can strip too much oil off your hair leaving it dry and kicking your scalp into oil-production overdrive).</li>
            <li> Love the smell, but it&#x27;s obviously not for any hair type but thick and course.</li>
            <li> My hair type is bleached, double processed, long, fine, dry and very fragile.  </li>
            <li> The next time, I barely used any product (less than a dime size amount) and it was still mildly greasy.  </li>
            <li> The delicate scent and the light weight of the oils helps create a finished look.</li>
            <li> Careful not to use too much.</li>
            <li> I switched to American Crew Pomade - which is more expensive at around fifteen dollars - but the jar of pomade lasts me much</li>
            <li> and it barely made a difference</li>
            <li> Even with careful application, it makes my hair take much longer to air-dry</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this product for the health conscious consumer.</li>
            <li> I really hoped I would like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s conditioner just as much, but alas, there was so much oil in it that even after a legnthy rinsing my hair felt greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on products to help increase volume, but I really hadn&#x27;t found anything that worked all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this occasionally (trying to use up an old product) and my husband uses it every time he washes his hair with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint bar soap.</li>
            <li> I used it for a while then went back to my old shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I used a full pump (I have shoulder length, fine but thick, bleached blonde hair) and had to shake some off because I was afraid it was too much.</li>
            <li> I blow dry it straight or let it dry natural and curly</li>
            <li> Hair much improved without all the chemicals in other products.</li>
            <li> But just the right amount gives you that day-after-washing look to tame frizzies.</li>
            <li> Not overly impressed not super disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hope they continue to sell enough of this to keep the product line in that they must not sell much because a bottle can last such a long time!  </li>
            <li> I first used about a nickle sized amount on my wet/damp hair after a shower and when I blow dried my hair, it was so greasy that I had to re-wash it.  </li>
            <li> and it really helps cut down on irritations</li>
            <li> Love the smell and lightness of the product; however, it has left my hair slightly stiff when applied heavily or used daily.</li>
            <li> A bit &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; for those without super thick hair&lt;br /&gt;2.)</li>
            <li> Works well on my super thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re hoping it will detangle and soften your hair after the Bronners soap made it a waxy mess and the shikakai rinse didn&#x27;t help much you can give up, thats the reason I ordered it</li>
            <li> and I am very disappointed since the soap and rinse have been so wonderful.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a conditioner for my hair b/c after I switched to natural hair products, they left my hair dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> The texture is light, a little \\&quot;thin,\\&quot; and a little slippery without being viscous.</li>
            <li> She does have fine thin hair so even with the slightest amount it leaves her hair looking greasy and stringy.</li>
            <li> I have very fine and dry hair, and will save this conditioner just for putting on the dry ends for deep conditioning when I know I&#x27;m not going to be styling my hair down for a few days and have enough shampoos to wash it out.</li>
            <li> that doesn&#x27;t bother me; but if I were to wear my hair down, I don&#x27;t particularly care for the greasy appearance, though.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how much or how little I used, always makes my hair greasy and gross.</li>
            <li> I have problems with my scalp breaking out with other conditioners - this doesnt do that and keep my scalp moist and clear</li>
            <li> Only use a small (pea sized) amount for your hair or it could make it very &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to find a natural conditioner that would help keep my unruly hair slightly less tangled and easier to manage, like some regular conditioners do.  </li>
            <li> I tried many different ways of applying this, even put some on in shower and rinsed out, but it always left my hair looking greasy and dirty</li>
            <li> And it will last for a long time...</li>
            <li> I expect the container to last a long while because it is a leave in conditioner</li>
            <li> Also works well to keep my hair moisturized after straightening with flat iron.</li>
            <li> and I have long red hair.</li>
            <li> , it makes my hair have a completely flat shape to it</li>
            <li> it smells ok and is a little thin.</li>
            <li> I tried leaving my hair to air dry, it was gross.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless shampoos and conditioners and none of them have helped my horribly dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Just a tiny amount (eraser tip size for my long hair) does the job of getting rid of dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Smells kind of like lavender cleaner, so not what I&#x27;d hoped for but not too bad.</li>
            <li> I say \\&quot;suspect\\&quot; because I don&#x27;t smell it on a day to day basis, and no one has told me my hair stinks, but if I am hot and/or sweaty, sometimes I smell it.&lt;br /&gt;-for the citrus conditioning rinse, be careful, because it really stings if you get it in your eyes or on open cuts.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been Dr. Bronner product fans for a long time, so when I learned about this hair cream I paid attention.</li>
            <li> I expected only lavender since product stated lavender.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d appreciate it if it came pre-diluted, and preferably at the same consistency as the soap (instead of having the viscosity of water, which is harder to work through your hair).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have curly long hair</li>
            <li> One pump goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Hope this helps provide some insight!hick and long.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an eco-friendly solution to detangle my extremely long hair.</li>
            <li> Makes my long hair shiney, does not leave it oily.</li>
            <li> I have long hair.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t really say it detangled my thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair wasn&#x27;t stringy but it had a very strange texture-- not very soft.</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic and it doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling greasy or slick (as long as you don&#x27;t go overboard!).</li>
            <li> /&gt;After washing my hair with homemade shampoo, I rinse my hair with apple cider vinegar with some essential oils in a glass bowl, when that&#x27;s done, I put less than a pea size and mix it in with the mixture mentioned above.</li>
            <li> I tried using a smaller amount (less than one pump) but it was still gross.</li>
            <li> Almost or fully dry hair</li>
            <li> I put the dollop in my hand and rub it in after I pat dry my hair.</li>
            <li> To prove it, I tried the creme with my regular shampoo &amp; conditioner combo and turned into a greaseball the second it dried.</li>
            <li> (I’m not really high maintenance with my hair), and then apply this cream to my DRY hair.</li>
            <li> makes my hair soft and manageable no more gel for our family</li>
            <li> Usually order directly</li>
            <li> We do not have a water softener, but have our water tested yearly and it is only mildly hard, and no other hair product has ever done this to my hair!&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m down to my last bottle now</li>
            <li> A little definitely goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It was ok not impressed with this product &amp; usually like all dr bronners products.</li>
            <li> Apparently, according to reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Also not true!</li>
            <li> I could only use a little bit every couple days on the tips of my hair.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was spilled inside with only a little remaining in the bottle...</li>
            <li> My doctor even put me on a medical shampoo and it worked for a little bit</li>
            <li> I think it would work on a wide range of hair types without issue.</li>
            <li> I tried using a few times in different amounts</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try this, but it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products we use consistently on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really not a problem.</li>
            <li> just so i wont waste my money entirely.. will not buy again!!!!</li>
            <li> I stopped using it after 3 tries...</li>
            <li> (dilute with only a few drops, not a capful, per cup of water)</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you have thin or straight hair.</li>
            <li> It works decent in conjunction with the Citrus Orange Conditioning Rinse (which leaves the hair tough to comb through)...</li>
            <li> It feels like I have tried every leave in on the market, from cheap to expensive, and nothing has worked like this!</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner actually spent time in mental institutions!  </li>
            <li> However, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling stiff and weighed down.</li>
            <li> Instead, I use it on the ends of my already-moisturized hair and as a final dressing for my hair (a small amount rubbed between my hands and smoothed over my hair).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky at all, like the other Leave-in&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I usually use a tiny bit of this after conditioning my hair in the shower...</li>
            <li> But with rotating with other conditioners I have</li>
            <li> Because other products on the market have harmful chemicals</li>
            <li> I started using less and less, and finally found that I need less than 1/2 teaspoon</li>
            <li> so I threw out all my products and replaced all of them with Dr. Bronner products and other organic products.</li>
            <li> The bar shampoo says it can be used without any other products--</li>
            <li> A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY!</li>
            <li> It seems to be a little heavy (using different amounts), however I&#x27;m getting a perm tomorrow</li>
            <li> This is very heavy and feels greasy and gross.  </li>
            <li> WILL DRY YOUR HAIR!!!  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone that wants a healthier alternative to the chemical filled crap the stores sell!</li>
            <li> , I have dark wavy and semi-curly hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the smell.</li>
            <li> It takes 3-4 pumps to work thru a long head of hair, and this is a SMALL bottle--</li>
            <li> I even wore my hair in a ponytail for work, wore it up all day, and then took it down when I went to sleep.</li>
            <li> I even wore my hair in a ponytail for work, wore it up all day, and then took it down when I went to sleep.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair extremely greasy, no matter how little I use.</li>
            <li> I tend to need a slightly heavier conditioner to help weigh down and separate my curls; leaving in one of the Suave ([[ASIN:B0002FCD5I</li>
            <li> too harsh just as all other Bronner&#x27;s products</li>
            <li> This can be a little heavy if you aren&#x27;t careful</li>
            <li> A previous reviewer was correct in saying that just the smallest amount does the trick with this product.</li>
            <li> I should have heed the advice the comments by the previous buyers.  </li>
            <li> each time using less and less.  </li>
            <li> and figured I would try some with a lot less flammability  </li>
            <li> and I have long thick hair.</li>
            <li> the record, my hair type is thick and long.</li>
            <li> I think it could work with a little less greasy-ness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wasted a lot of money on anti frizz products and none worked half as well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t promise the end of summer frizzies if you sweat, but if you&#x27;re in and out of air conditioning, this product as astyling/finishing cream will help you stay just a little sleeker.    </li>
            <li> I tried putting the tiniest amount in my hair and it doesn&#x27;t make a bit of difference how little I use -</li>
            <li> just a little to get some softness.     </li>
            <li> It does help with tangles a little but don&#x27;t expect it to work miracles.</li>
            <li> and so little is needed.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair a bit to oily no matter how little I use.</li>
            <li> no matter how little I used or when I used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hate to know how much money they are they flushing down the toilet because of their nut job rants on the label.</li>
            <li> friend was telling me about all the bad things in regular shampoo, so I decided to switch to all natural products.</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> Probably one of the few guys (with medium length hair) who uses Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> I tried it a few times altering amount.</li>
            <li> Leaves a heavy residue if used for leave in, doesn&#x27;t seem to condition all that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few products I could find on Amazon that was non-greasy and had coconut oil.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old has very thin cotton candy hair.  </li>
            <li> This provides some control without being stiff like gel.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work at all to tame the frizzies.</li>
            <li> --I&#x27;d have to follow up with another product to tame my hair and in that case, I could just skip this one.</li>
            <li> I just swoosh it all around and have found that it helps tame my hair from being frizzy.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to find something that cuts the frizz down.</li>
            <li> After placing a small (1/8 to 1/4 of a teaspoon!)amount in my hands and rubbing it into my hands, I bend over and massage it into my hair from underneath</li>
            <li> While my hair was damp, I combed in a *lot* of this stuff as if using my usual detangler.</li>
            <li> When my hair was still somewhat drippy, I put a *teeny* amount (one small squirt) into one palm, rubbed my hands together (as if foaming up the soap) to spread it around, and then ran them through my hair as if smoothing/detangling a ponytail.</li>
            <li> but then the dandruff came back even worse!</li>
            <li> After I have shampooed I put a small amount in my hair and leave it in.  </li>
            <li> No more problems with oily hair</li>
            <li> No more problems with oily hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I can ascertain the smell of lavender is felt on my hair, but this conditioner makes them feel silky and squeeky clean.&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li> I usually use a squirt of it – but I’m not overly-cautious and have not had any problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really slick texture.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because I really like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products</li>
            <li> Instead it got really hard and didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t bad at all, but it is a little different.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t bad at all, but it is a little different.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m officially sold on this stuff, at least as a combination with the lavender soap and a vinegar rinse.</li>
            <li> I have thick, shoulder length curly hair</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend (she has thick hair).</li>
            <li> The lavender smell is a little weird.</li>
            <li> I was a little wary about purchasing this.</li>
            <li> too b/c Dr Bronner&#x27;s is truly the only brand on the market that doesn&#x27;t contain one single nasty ingredient....</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> It also protects my hair from the harsh cold.</li>
            <li> The consistency is like a thin lotion which might be off putting, but the reality is, it works.</li>
            <li> Bottle cap was broken when recieved</li>
            <li> If your hair is remotely thin...</li>
            <li> Not happy with this</li>
            <li> However, it got expensive.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t feel so guilty when pressing snooze 3x.&lt;br /&gt;-Love</li>
            <li> Smells weird compared to the shampoo.</li>
            <li> you learn Portuguese&amp;#34; but was unable to find it.  </li>
            <li> But together they form this weird combination smell that reminds me of the flea shampoo we used to use on my dog when I was a kid.</li>
            <li> and unfortunately nothing can get rid of that \\&quot;Bronners soap\\&quot; feel except an apple cider vinegar rinse.</li>
            <li> Sorry Dr. B&#x27;s.....</li>
            <li> to, is/are how crazy he and his family are/was.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it isn&#x27;t up to the task :(  </li>
            <li> In the past I have had the worst dandruff imaginable.</li>
            <li> It ended up drying to a very heavy, clumpy texture, which is particularly awful with hip-length hair.    </li>
            <li> It is really bad.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t really bad</li>
            <li> I use it for hair growth and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> The stuff I use on my hair after coloring makes my eyes itchy :(</li>
            <li> The pump spout doesn&#x27;t work, so have to leave without a cap, and it makes my hair feel greasy as if it&#x27;s dirty!  </li>
            <li> Hate it...</li>
            <li> nasty--</li>
            <li> and it was nasty, so</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so awful.  </li>

            <li> My husband and I have been Dr. Bronner product fans for a long time, so when I learned about this hair cream I paid attention. It does not have that toxic / chemical smell so many hair products leave you stuck with, nor does it feel icky to the touch.  I think it would work on a wide range of hair types without issue. My hair has a lot of natural curl, and I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments since I started using it. Just do it!</li>
            <li> I have problems with my scalp breaking out with other conditioners - this doesnt do that and keep my scalp moist and clear - I also put this on my face after I shave while I shower and it really helps cut down on irritations</li>
            <li> This is by far the best leave-in hair conditioner I ever ran into!! I tried many many other organic hair care product, but none of them satisfied me completely except that they aren&#x27;t filled with toxic crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing my hair with homemade shampoo, I rinse my hair with apple cider vinegar with some essential oils in a glass bowl, when that&#x27;s done, I put less than a pea size and mix it in with the mixture mentioned above. Then I just soak the ends of my hair in it while combing with my hand. It makes my hair feel so silky and soft(but not oily!!) and easy to tame when drying :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is gonna last me a long long time for sure so it is an excellent buy!!</li>
            <li> I bought this soup because i really like the peppermint soup and wanted to see if their other products are as good. It is really bad. My hair didn&#x27;t feel soft and silky as it should have been. Instead it got really hard and didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair. I washed it out immediately and have never used it again. It is in a corner in my bathroom. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different and so it might worked great for someone else but not for me.</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic and it doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling greasy or slick (as long as you don&#x27;t go overboard!). My hair is coarse and curly -- this conditioner helps smooth and tame my flyaways (it may not work as well on very fine hair or oily hair.) Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> this stuff worked wonders for my course curly hair.  I&#x27;ve wasted a lot of money on anti frizz products and none worked half as well.</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s line of castile soaps are now legendary for those of us who demand safe, natural, and socially responsible products. This Magic Organic Hair Creme represents a departure from the soapy simplicity of the old Dr. Bronner&#x27;s lineup. The same quality ingredients and social consciousness are put into this product, and the results are quite wonderful.    The scent is a delicious but far from overpowering lavender. The texture is light, a little \\&quot;thin,\\&quot; and a little slippery without being viscous. If you&#x27;re already familiar with coconut oil in your hair, you&#x27;re close to knowing how your hair will respond to this product. For drier, curlier hair, there is no visible residue, no oily appearance and only a touch of shine. This is not a glossing product, and it&#x27;s not a deep moisturizer. It&#x27;s a coconut oil, jojoba oil, and hemp oil blend. If your hair doesn&#x27;t respond well to light oils, then this may not be the right product for you.    While marketed as a leave-in conditioner and styling cream, I think it&#x27;s important to know your own hair very well so that you&#x27;ll know how to use this product. I tend to need a slightly heavier conditioner to help weigh down and separate my curls; leaving in one of the Suave ([[ASIN:B0002FCD5I Suave Naturals Conditioner, Tropical Coconut - 22.5oz.]]) or VO5 ([[ASIN:B001715WH2 Alberto Vo5 Hair Conditioner Strawberries &amp; Cream 15 Oz]]) cheapie conditioners works well for me in this regard. This Magic Hair Creme doesn&#x27;t do a thing for me as a leave-in conditioner. Instead, I use it on the ends of my already-moisturized hair and as a final dressing for my hair (a small amount rubbed between my hands and smoothed over my hair). The delicate scent and the light weight of the oils helps create a finished look. What&#x27;s more, in the dry indoor heat of winter, I don&#x27;t frizz out. It also protects my hair from the harsh cold. I can&#x27;t promise the end of summer frizzies if you sweat, but if you&#x27;re in and out of air conditioning, this product as astyling/finishing cream will help you stay just a little sleeker.    If you&#x27;re a product junkie, go ahead and add this one to your list of must-tries.</li>
            <li> First off I am a HUGE fan of all Dr. Bronner products. I was introduced to the brand while visiting a friend in California. The first time I used Dr. Bronner was the peppermint soap, I have never used another soap since. So after returning home I sent out to find retailers who sold this Brand and eventually found Amazon sold a good bit of different Dr. Bronner products. I also found Dr. Bronners at Target, Walmart, and Food Lion, they were all close in price. However Amazon is the only place I came across this styling crème. Once again Dr, Bronners does it again. My hair is super soft and has a healthy shine without the oily look. The best part as with all Dr. Bronners products this stuff is concentrated( a small dot is enough if applied to wet hair). This bottle will last you a life time. Also all ingredient are plant based. and most but not all ingrediants are fair trade certified. I love supporting this company with my business.</li>
            <li> I am not overly impressed.  I really wanted to like it.  My 3 year old has very thin cotton candy hair.  And its curly.  I don&#x27;t want to put unsafe product on her hair so I thought I would give this a try.  It made her hair look greasy.  I tried it on my curls, but there wasn&#x27;t enough control.  I am going to keep trying it.  Maybe I can come up with the right amounts to use on use.</li>
            <li> It left my hair shiny with a lil bounce! Careful not to use too much. About a nickel size is perfect or it can easily leave your hair feeling icky. I love this stuff though, great product!</li>
            <li> So far, my absolute favorite leave in conditioner. I only want body/hair products not tested on animals, and have tried so many over the years that are just a big no. Either they smell wierd or don&#x27;t detangle. I have very thick hair and it&#x27;s hard to find something that cuts the frizz down. The consistency is like a thin lotion which might be off putting, but the reality is, it works. Smells awesome, and actually has a little styling use too.</li>
            <li> Smells kind of like lavender cleaner, so not what I&#x27;d hoped for but not too bad. It takes a TEENSY bit on my somewhat fine hair, or it leaves it very greasy, like you&#x27;d expect coconut oil to. I&#x27;d really suggest it to someone who uses no conditioner at all in the shower, though, which I guess might be the purpose, because it really does condition your hair.</li>
            <li> I have lots of very curly, and somewhat fine hair that tends to be frizzy and IS always very frizzy if no products are used. I bought this to replace my (chemical-laden) leave-in conditioners. I&#x27;ve used different brands of leave-in conditioners and I found this one to be perfect for me. I&#x27;ve used Paul Mitchell&#x27;s The Conditioner, MOP&#x27;s Organic Leave-in Conditioner, and Surya Henna Leave-in Conditioner. Economically, it&#x27;s great because I only use about 1/2 of the amount I used of the other brands. I love the smell of this product. I also like the feel of this product. It&#x27;s not sticky at all, like the other Leave-in&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Does this works on the color treated hair ? Is there any recommendation for color treated hair ? The stuff I use on my hair after coloring makes my eyes itchy :(</li>
            <li> Hate it...thought I would love it because it is Dr.Bronners. There is no coconut smell, just over powering lavender. Put it in my freshly washed hair and it made it look and feel like I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in a week. It doesn&#x27;t matter how much or how little I used, always makes my hair greasy and gross.</li>
            <li> Although I love the smell and consistency of this product, it is a tad too heavy/greasy for my super fine curly hair. I have to be very careful to use just the right amount otherwise my hair comes out too greasy (too much product) or too frizzy (not enough product).</li>
            <li> Love everything about this stuff! The smell is wonderful, and it makes my hair super soft! Does work as a lightweight styling cream as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution if you are using this alongside the citrus rinse - if you do not follow the directions with the rinse, and finger comb before rinsing, even if you use the leave in, it will leave your hair....well crunchy is really the only word I can think of.</li>
            <li> I tried this stuff with an open mind after reading reviews of it. It works decent in conjunction with the Citrus Orange Conditioning Rinse (which leaves the hair tough to comb through)... however, even though it works decently, it leaves a greasy- like coating on my fine hair that makes me look as if my hair is greasy. I tried putting the tiniest amount in my hair and it doesn&#x27;t make a bit of difference how little I use - it&#x27;s always greasy-looking. If I&#x27;m wearing my hair in a pony tail and I know it&#x27;s clean, that doesn&#x27;t bother me; but if I were to wear my hair down, I don&#x27;t particularly care for the greasy appearance, though. I will continue using this until it&#x27;s gone, but unsure whether to purchase it again or not at this time.</li>
            <li> I love using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps, but NOT this hair &amp;#34;conditioner&amp;#34;. It does not soften or detangle the hair at all. It&#x27;s just oily like putting mayo in your hair.</li>
            <li> It broke me out in hives. too harsh just as all other Bronner&#x27;s products</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff smells great makes my hair soft and manageable no more gel for our family we use all dr bronner products</li>
            <li> This is the BEST product I&#x27;ve tried to smooth out my very curly hair. It&#x27;s light enough not to feel \\&quot;gunky\\&quot; but really does the job.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t find it in Southern California so I stock-up when visiting northern Cal and Oregon. Even our Whole Foods, Sprouts, etc. stores don&#x27;t seem to carry this particular Dr. B product. I&#x27;m down to my last bottle now so must order online though the price is a bit high. It&#x27;s a Must Have for my sometimes frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> A previous reviewer was correct in saying that just the smallest amount does the trick with this product. After placing a small (1/8 to 1/4 of a teaspoon!)amount in my hands and rubbing it into my hands, I bend over and massage it into my hair from underneath and it really works great, don&#x27;t even need the conditioning rinse. I just use Dr Bronner&#x27;s shampoo and this.  I hope they continue to sell enough of this to keep the product line in that they must not sell much because a bottle can last such a long time!  Very environmentally correct! Love it!</li>
            <li> This is very heavy and feels greasy and gross.  I tried using a smaller amount (less than one pump) but it was still gross. I tried leaving my hair to air dry, it was gross. I tried blow drying thinking the heat would help and it looked like it hadn&#x27;t been washed in weeks. I tried using a few times in different amounts and I am very disappointed since the soap and rinse have been so wonderful.</li>
            <li> It was ok not impressed with this product &amp; usually like all dr bronners products.</li>
            <li> i have loooked everywhere for ORGANIC PRODUCTS!!...ok maybe im a organic FREAK...but i absolutely am so excited to try this..AND THANK U SOO MUCH FOR NOT PUTTING PALM OIl IN IT!</li>
            <li> It smelled very good, but it was very heavy on my medium-thick blonde hair. I could only use a little bit every couple days on the tips of my hair.</li>
            <li> When I first attempted to use this, the results were pretty nasty-- I&#x27;d also just bought some of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s lavender liquid soap and used that to wash my hair. While my hair was damp, I combed in a *lot* of this stuff as if using my usual detangler. It ended up drying to a very heavy, clumpy texture, which is particularly awful with hip-length hair.    The next night, I washed my hair with the liquid soap again and followed it with a vinegar rinse to remove any soap residue, which definitely reduced much of the \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; feeling right there.    When my hair was still somewhat drippy, I put a *teeny* amount (one small squirt) into one palm, rubbed my hands together (as if foaming up the soap) to spread it around, and then ran them through my hair as if smoothing/detangling a ponytail. (I don&#x27;t think this should be applied any closer to the scalp than ponytail starting length.) It dried to a wonderful smooth texture with almost no tangles, even in the barrette-compression zone after wearing one all day.    So I&#x27;m officially sold on this stuff, at least as a combination with the lavender soap and a vinegar rinse. It would probably be fine after a regular shampoo, but I still have a whole bottle of lavender soap to finish up.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer! Scent is more on the lavender side than coconut.</li>
            <li> I have kind of coarse, curly, frizzy hair and this is the best product I&#x27;ve found that tames it a bit but keeps it looking natural with some shine. Smells good too. Been using it for about a year now.</li>
            <li> Bottle top was unscrewed inside the box when I opened. The conditioner was spilled inside with only a little remaining in the bottle...</li>
            <li> Bottle says to put in after shampooing to make hair soft.NOT so...terrible feeling.Sticky and feel like you&#x27;d never get a brush through it! I had to rinse it out and use my normal conditioner. But...its ok after shampooing, conditioning with something else, and then use as a leave in? but still...notice nothing but the smell and that just ok.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T GET IT.  WILL DRY YOUR HAIR!!!  I should have heed the advice the comments by the previous buyers.  waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  Product also has a lemon fragrance to it that I don&#x27;t enjoy with the lavender.  I expected only lavender since product stated lavender.  Light feel to hair after application, but cannot use because I cannot tolerate the lemon &amp; lavender combo.</li>
            <li> At first, this was pretty good. I used it every day and my hair felt significantly softer within the week. This provides some control without being stiff like gel. However, it got expensive. I switched to American Crew Pomade - which is more expensive at around fifteen dollars - but the jar of pomade lasts me much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who are looking for an organic and gentle conditioner, I would recommend this, but be prepared to spend a lot of money.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try this, but it wasn&#x27;t what I expected. Who ever said this smells good your senses are way off and it was kinda liquidy. I thought it would be more thicker and creamier. Other than that the product is okay. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again though.&lt;br /&gt;Seller good, product so so.</li>
            <li> Great for frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> This can be a little heavy if you aren&#x27;t careful but all that really means is have a light touch and it will last forever. The instructions say to apply to clean hair after towel drying but this can lend to that heavy moisturized look. Almost or fully dry hair you gives you more control as far as where you need to moisturize and how heavily. I do also recommend you mostly use this on your ends or on damaged hair. Great smell of lavender that lingers!</li>
            <li> Still working with the product.  It seems to be a little heavy (using different amounts), however I&#x27;m getting a perm tomorrow and I&#x27;m hoping it will be &amp;#34;just perfect&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply to freshly blown hair to manage the frizz. Lovely scent and hair is soft, smooth, and manageable.</li>
            <li> Probably one of the few guys (with medium length hair) who uses Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products... so here goes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is an INCREDIBLE company. Environmentally, socially, financially responsible through and through. Legit fair trade, seriously organic, no one gets paid more than 5 times another (amazing considering that most CEOs nowadays make hundreds times what their factory floor workers do), employees get 100% free healthcare, and they give like a third of their profits back to charity (beyond their free trade projects, which, among other things, support peaceful Palestinian/Israeli coexistence and medical equipment for hospitals in Sri Lanka). If corporations were actually people, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s would be Gandhi (and I should know, I&#x27;m Indian :P)&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on my hair! So soft, so shiny (not greasy though), so healthy and strong...Not only that, but after using this and the conditioning rinse and leave-in conditioner, I can just run my hands through my hair to style it almost any which way I please! Do you know how much time that saves me in the morning? Now I don&#x27;t feel so guilty when pressing snooze 3x.&lt;br /&gt;-Love the strong smell of the soap when showering :) ahhh...tea tree...peppermint...so refreshing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-still experimenting on how much/little to use of each product. Right now, might be using too much shampoo, because hair becomes parched if I don&#x27;t use the leave-in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;-Price. Originally used the soap on body too, but after not seeing a noticeable difference over my Dove bar, decided to save it for just the hair.&lt;br /&gt;-Though the soap smells wonderful, it doesn&#x27;t last on your hair (like my hair doesn&#x27;t smell like peppermint or tea trees--do those actually exist?? I don&#x27;t think tea leaves grow on trees, I always imagined them growing in bushes). Anyways... I suspect my hair actually smells a bit more like some oil (for all my desi folks out there, kinda like Ayurvedic medicine). I say \\&quot;suspect\\&quot; because I don&#x27;t smell it on a day to day basis, and no one has told me my hair stinks, but if I am hot and/or sweaty, sometimes I smell it.&lt;br /&gt;-for the citrus conditioning rinse, be careful, because it really stings if you get it in your eyes or on open cuts. Also, the smell of citrus and whatever oils they use is, frankly, nauseating in the shower. Citrus and that oil smell do not mix Dr. Bronner, nuh uh, not at all. Also, not a fan of having to dilute the rinse on my own before use. First world problems, I know, but I&#x27;d appreciate it if it came pre-diluted, and preferably at the same consistency as the soap (instead of having the viscosity of water, which is harder to work through your hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the novella. TL;DR: love the company and the results, not such a big fan of the price or the slight oily smell--but that&#x27;s what you get for all-natural. Also, for guys, cut back ALOT on what they tell you to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peace!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~A Dr. Bronner&#x27;s lifetime customer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s.

            <li> This leave in is second to none. I am transitioning to natural hair and this product is great for any hair type especially for transitioners. It smells so good and a little defiantly goes a long way. I love the pump on the product. Do not use too much because you will regret it but a little goes a long way and your hair is more than conditioned with this product. Great great product with real results.</li>
            <li> Meh. Love Dr. Bronner products but this one isn&#x27;t great. I have long and sometimes very frizzy hair. This product didn&#x27;t work at all to tame the frizzies.</li>
            <li> I love this leave in conditioner. I use it as an anti-frizz agent/hair creme in my daughter&#x27;s hair after her bath and in my hair as well. It enables her hair to remain tangle free and it keeps my frizz down and allows nice waves/curls to form when I don&#x27;t blow dry and protects my hair when I straighten it. I usually use a tiny bit of this after conditioning my hair in the shower...but on days when I&#x27;m rushed and don&#x27;t condition my hair in the shower, I&#x27;ll use more as a leave in conditioner. I just have to be sure not to use too much in my daughter&#x27;s hair (or mine) as it will get weighed down and greasy--but that&#x27;s easy to figure out once you use it a couple of times. This is one of the few products we use consistently on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> To much. I have fine hair and it weighed it down to much. And the smell is awful.would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Got this because I was looking for a more natural, eco-friendly conditioner. I have thick, shoulder length curly hair and this didn&#x27;t feel like it moisturized or really nourished deeply. It barely felt like it got my hair soft- something I really look for. Smells weird compared to the shampoo. First pump I realized I didn&#x27;t like it, it didn&#x27;t detangle my hair as well as I would&#x27;ve liked to. I continue to use the castille soap but I&#x27;d suggest anyone looking for a natural conditioner to try Nurture My Body conditioner which I enjoy more than this.</li>
            <li> Love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products.  Usually order directly but they were out of stock.  This give a nice weight to my daughter&#x27;s long locks and helps with tangles.</li>
            <li> I love this product, its very light weight, smells nice and leaves my hair soft. I love it! I also have the doctor Bronners castile soap in lavender, peppermint and almond and all of course very lovely.</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes of learning Portuguese and improving my hair.  So far, my hair has improved but that&#x27;s about it.  I looked all over the label to see where it said &amp;#34;helps you learn Portuguese&amp;#34; but was unable to find it.  Perhaps my mind is playing tricks on me.  Please buy this, especially if you&#x27;re from Portugal, and let me know how this product has helped you.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a conditioner after I started making my own shampoos and I LOVE it! It smells amazing and it makes my hair silky soft! And it will last for a long time...you don&#x27;t need to glob it on for it to work. I use about a dime sized amount and I have super thick hair that comes down to my shoulders, and that is the perfect amount for me. I would recommend this to anyone that wants a healthier alternative to the chemical filled crap the stores sell!</li>
            <li> Nice smell and love that it&#x27;s a natural product, but I find it doesn&#x27;t work well as a styling product, so I recommend you use this only as a leave-in conditioner. I have curly long hair and it didn&#x27;t define my curls at all. However, when using this product my hair felt more hydrated.</li>
            <li> It was just &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;. Not overly impressed not super disappointed. I didn&#x27;t feel it did an amazing detangling job but it didn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy. I did not like it enough to finish the bottle. Would not buy again. The smell is nice.</li>
            <li> My hair feels gross after using this. I love that it&#x27;s all natural and organic but my hair looked like cr*p so I can&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> Leaves fine hair too oily feeling. May work better for other hair types. Used in conjunction with J.R. Liggetts old fashioned bar shampoo (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GJL22K/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1).</li>
            <li> Just wish it came in a larger size!!! This works well for my hair, I have dark wavy and semi-curly hair.</li>
            <li> It works fairly well. My only complaint is the smell. It isn&#x27;t really bad but I wish they had a citrus scent to match the hair rinse. The lavender smell is a little weird.</li>
            <li> It does not perform like a rinse-out conditioner or a leave-in conditioner, but I found it to be an excellent styling product.  I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 because I was expecting a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this product after shampooing and conditioning my hair.  I started with one pump, but it took about 3 to get my hair detangled properly.  After my hair air dried, I could still run my fingers through it from root to tip with ease, which is rarely the case with most products.  The product felt more like it was absorbed into my hair than sitting on top of the hair strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, my hair is natural and leans more towards tightly curled than loosely curled.</li>
            <li> It pains me to give this product 3 stars because I LOVE LOVE LOVE Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products and I really wanted to love this conditioner. It smells fantastic and is made of wonderful ingredients; however, I cannot seem to rinse it out of my hair enough to not make my hair look greasy. I have very fine and dry hair, and will save this conditioner just for putting on the dry ends for deep conditioning when I know I&#x27;m not going to be styling my hair down for a few days and have enough shampoos to wash it out.</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s natural products.  This smells wonderful!  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle. A small dab keeps my hair neatly in place and looking great all day long.</li>
            <li> I have wavy/curly hair and a while back I got on the hippie trend of not using shampoo (it can strip too much oil off your hair leaving it dry and kicking your scalp into oil-production overdrive). Now I wash my hair with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s lavender liquid castile soap (love) and, after a brief adjustment period, my hair&#x27;s doing better than ever. Instead of using a rinse-out conditioner in the shower, I&#x27;ll apply a leave-in one as a styling product/frizz tamer and let my hair air-dry. I&#x27;ve had good success with products containing coconut oil. So when I came across this product I was extremely excited to try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read other reviews on here cautioning not to use very much. I had to play around to find the right amount. Not enough product and it barely made a difference--I&#x27;d have to follow up with another product to tame my hair and in that case, I could just skip this one. Too much and I got that stringy moussed look. Even with careful application, it makes my hair take much longer to air-dry and it looks moussed while it&#x27;s drying. I don&#x27;t love it, but I will say I get super second-day hair with this product. By then the curls have lost that crunchy look and form great ringlets once revived with a little spritz of water. I decided it might not be fair to expect this product to work great on my hair since it isn&#x27;t marketed as anything other than a general leave-in, light styling product and not one specific for wavy/curly hair. If you have a different hair type you&#x27;ll probably have different results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note on the fragrance-- I love lavender, and I love coconut. But together they form this weird combination smell that reminds me of the flea shampoo we used to use on my dog when I was a kid. If you don&#x27;t have that olfactory/memory association you probably won&#x27;t mind it but it&#x27;s definitely more of a medicinal/botanical fragrance.</li>
            <li> For me this product is the easiest after shampoo conditioner that works on my  curly hair the best. I Love that it is organic too.</li>
            <li> My 1.5 year old daughter has fine, but LOTS, of type 3 curly hair.  It is usually a big poofy mop bc she does not like much to be done with her hair.  She only gets it washed once a week, twice if we are lucky.  We don&#x27;t use Bronner&#x27;s castille bc the soap burns if gets in her eyes. (we use another gentle baby shampoo) However, when I use this stuff on her hair... it looks amazing!  It is just right for her wild hair.  I can apply it several days in a row (without hair washing) and her hair looks GREAT!  It seems to soak it right up without making it look greasy.  Her baby hair is very happy with it.  It also works great as a baby styling creme bc it de-frizzes and creates a gentle hold to keep her curls separate and in place.  The bonus? it helps prevent tangled baby hair on the back of her head.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling stiff and weighed down. Smell was ok, but not wonderful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this product, my coworker recommended Dr. Bronners to me and it this creme makes my hair look and feel like I just got a fresh cut and deep conditioning.  It&#x27;s so amazing, I am going to get it for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> This is a  great product but you have to have hair that can tolerate oil to use this.  I have fine hair and it makes it look greasy but my husband has thicker hair and it has been great for him and adds texture and shape.  I use it as an overnight treatment then wash in the am to avoid the greasy look.  Overall really happy with it and love Bronners!</li>
            <li> Smells great, but wasn&#x27;t what expected at all. Couldn&#x27;t use as styling cream too heavy, good for a beach day or vaca@South Beach.</li>
            <li> I like this and many other of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products. It does not leave my hair feeling oily, takes very little to do its job, and smells nice. If I had any complaints it would be that the bottle leaked a bit upon shipping and that I kind of tire of the same scent day after day. But with rotating with other conditioners I have it&#x27;s really not a problem. Definitely recommend this product for the health conscious consumer.</li>
            <li> Only use a small (pea sized) amount for your hair or it could make it very &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner products are like magic - this one is no exception.  It smells great, it takes good care of my hair, it&#x27;s a really good cream rinse - I like it very much.</li>
            <li> works good on my  kinky thick hair</li>
            <li> Too much makes your hair really waxy and is hard to wash out but overall a great product</li>
            <li> I chose this hair conditioner because I&#x27;m looking for a more natural type of product for my hair.  Because other products on the market have harmful chemicals Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products don&#x27;t have those harmful chemicals and I&#x27;m looking for more natural types of products to use on my body.  I haven&#x27;t used it yet but when I do I&#x27;ll update my review.  I&#x27;ve used other hair products and liked them as they made my hair soft and manageable.  Will recommend Dr. Bronner&#x27;s to everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one because they actually use good ingredients. What a nut job this guy was personally! I don&#x27;t appreciate all the religious rants, which make no sense, on this product. Isn&#x27;t it enough to have your values represented in the ingredients and fair trade affiliation? I&#x27;m returning the product because I don&#x27;t want to support whack jobs like this and his family, who continue to keep the label as a memorial to Dr. Bronner. The only thing it&#x27;s a memorial to, is/are how crazy he and his family are/was. They would all do well to enroll in a business ethics 101 course. I&#x27;d hate to know how much money they are they flushing down the toilet because of their nut job rants on the label. Dr. Bronner actually spent time in mental institutions!  What a shame, I actually wanted to buy this product.  http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/dr-bronner-s-crazy-ass-magic-soap-labels-18606</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. However, a little goes a long way. If you use a lot your hair will look greasy.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a miracle conditioning cream based on reviews when I bought it. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. I used as directed in my hair and my fine/medium hair felt greasy and stretchy after. I tried it a few times altering amount. To no avail. Same results.</li>
            <li> I *love* Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soaps and either use the lavender or the peppermint depending on my mood. I won&#x27;t use anything else on my hair. I do use a drugstore brand conditioner that I like, but I only leave it in for 10 - 15 seconds...just a little to get some softness.     I really hoped I would like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s conditioner just as much, but alas, there was so much oil in it that even after a legnthy rinsing my hair felt greasy. Even after drying, my hair actually looked unwashed.    I will continue to use the soap religiously, but I will pass on the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing but I can&#x27;t really say it detangled my thick curly hair. Conditions hair.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to find a natural conditioner that would help keep my unruly hair slightly less tangled and easier to manage, like some regular conditioners do.  Sadly, it isn&#x27;t up to the task :(  Smells great, does decent moisturizing, but doesn&#x27;t help a whit with preventing tangles and knots.</li>
            <li> This product works good, it gives my hair a softness without the heavy oily look of most cremes. The smell is good if you love lavender, I&#x27;m not a big fan of it but it sounded better than the other options. The first time I used it I used a full pump (I have shoulder length, fine but thick, bleached blonde hair) and had to shake some off because I was afraid it was too much. It does help with tangles a little but don&#x27;t expect it to work miracles. If you&#x27;re hoping it will detangle and soften your hair after the Bronners soap made it a waxy mess and the shikakai rinse didn&#x27;t help much you can give up, thats the reason I ordered it and unfortunately nothing can get rid of that \\&quot;Bronners soap\\&quot; feel except an apple cider vinegar rinse. I have a review on the 32 oz peppermint scent if you&#x27;re interested, it&#x27;s long but informative i think.</li>
            <li> Bottle cap was broken when recieved</li>
            <li> I love this leave it creme! I purchased it directly from the Dr. Bronner website, but loved it so much I had to post on here! My hair type is bleached, double processed, long, fine, dry and very fragile.  I use three pumps on damp hair right out of the shower, concentrating on the ends.  My hair is no longer falling out, and I can brush it without it breaking and falling like confetti! My hair is super soft, sleek and shiny.  I love it! It feels like I have tried every leave in on the market, from cheap to expensive, and nothing has worked like this! If you think this might work for you, give it a shot.  The cost is very reasonable, and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products are insanely good for you and for the environment.  They are filled with truly organic and fair trade ingredients, and they really are a family that cares for the world around them.  I have just fallen in love with this company! If you try anything else from them, make it the hemp almond organic soap.  It last forever! I have used it to mix up natural foaming handsoap, laundry detergent, body wash, you name it! I even cleaned dark blue marker off a light pink upholstered bed (my little one decided that might be a great idea.) It came off! All of it! Crazy good products from a genuinely good company.</li>
            <li> I have been using this creme for about a month now. I love the way my hair feels each time i use it. It makes my hair soft and moisturized without making it oil. It also smells really good. Good thing is that it works as a moisturizer and a leave in conditioner. I would recommend this to black women who are looking for a good hair moisturizer/ leave in that is completely natural. I have found my staple cream and I will be using this from now on.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t find the desired effect was worth the use of the product. Leaves a heavy residue if used for leave in, doesn&#x27;t seem to condition all that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not my preferred bronner product.</li>
            <li> Love the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps for body and face however, this is a Useless product.  All it does is make your hair greasy and coarse!  Will never buy again!  Starting to wonder if there are ANY good organic hair products out there!!!???</li>
            <li> I was hoping this product would make my hair more manageable and would cut down on my daily flat ironing, all it did was make my hair greasy! I tried it first as a rinse and a leave in conditioner and it was nasty, so thinking it must be because i used it as a leave in.. so i washed my  hair again and only used it as a rinse.. same thing.. it smells ok and is a little thin. i am using it to shave my legs with just so i wont waste my money entirely.. will not buy again!!!!</li>
            <li> Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;1.) I believe this to be a quality product that came as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;2.) Smells nice, even 10 hours post use&lt;br /&gt;3.) Affordable&lt;br /&gt;4.) Good ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;1.) A bit &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; for those without super thick hair&lt;br /&gt;2.) Doesn&#x27;t apply very evenly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;If you have thick//dry hair ((I don&#x27;t -- but roommate does)) this product works well, is cost effective and of good quality. If your hair is remotely thin...you&#x27;re gonna look like you haven&#x27;t washed your hair in a week after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I liked this conditioner at first because it left a very heavy residue. I started using less and less, and finally found that I need less than 1/2 teaspoon and I have long thick hair. I put the dollop in my hand and rub it in after I pat dry my hair. Your hair will not have that chemical-conditioner softness when wet, but after my hair dries it feels soft and looks great. FYI- I use Aubrey honey suckle rose 100% natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> This smells great and I was excited to try it out along with the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castille Soap and Shikakai Hair Rinse, in preparation for a camping trip at a place that requires organic products. It took about a week before I figured out that my hair wasn&#x27;t greasy from the soap, but from this creme! To prove it, I tried the creme with my regular shampoo &amp; conditioner combo and turned into a greaseball the second it dried. My hair is really fine, so I should have figured this would happen. Oh well, the search continues!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few products I could find on Amazon that was non-greasy and had coconut oil. I use it for hair growth and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad. I&#x27;ve used Bonner&#x27;s soaps for years and love them. If your looking for something to promote hair growth you may also look into Jamaican Castor Oil. It&#x27;s by far number one for hair growth in my experience.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! In the past I have had the worst dandruff imaginable. I&#x27;ve tried countless shampoos and conditioners and none of them have helped my horribly dry scalp. My doctor even put me on a medical shampoo and it worked for a little bit but then the dandruff came back even worse! My best friend who is a vegan recommended I go for more organic/natural products. I bought Dr. Bronner shampoo and conditioner and my hair has never looked more healthy! My dandruff is basically gone. I still have a tiny bit of dandruff but its nothing like it used to be. This is the only product that has ever treated my dandruff this well and has kept it this way. This really convinced to stop using chemicals in my house so I threw out all my products and replaced all of them with Dr. Bronner products and other organic products. I&#x27;ve never felt better or looked better.</li>
            <li> I have been cleaning my home of products that have chemicals in them. I finally got around to getting new conditioner. This also works as a hair product to put on after i get out of the shower. It works great!</li>
            <li> use this daily love the product</li>
            <li> follow the direction and only use the slightest amount or it will make your hair greasy! overall I love it.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time now. Better than greasy pastes and pomades. Smells nice. Doesn&#x27;t hold like a gel.</li>
            <li> A little definitely goes a long way. Since the bottle said it was a conditioner/ styling cream  I first applied a lot of the product because i have thicker coarser curls (type 4a/b, and some 4c) and sometimes my hair can dry-out throughout the day and be hard to manage to keep the curls looking nice.  I noticed at first when I apply this conditioner it was very drying and left my hair crunchy feeling. However, once I adjusted the portions properly as some reviews suggested, it complimented my hair very well. All in all it&#x27;s an ok conditioner but I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a great styling creme.</li>
            <li> I really like how this makes my heir feel.  After I have shampooed I put a small amount in my hair and leave it in.  Weather I blow dry it straight or let it dry natural and curly this is a must.</li>
            <li> I bpught this product wanting something almost completely non toxic for my daughter. She does have fine thin hair so even with the slightest amount it leaves her hair looking greasy and stringy. I&#x27;ll have to try the conditioner and see if I have a different experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional Hair Stylist, there are a lot of leave-in conditioners I&#x27;ve tried but nothing like this one. This one leaves your hair really soft, less frizzy, it&#x27;s super affordable and i love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural. One pump goes a long way. Don&#x27;t use too much of it or you&#x27;ll look greasy. I always mix it with natural hair oils.</li>
            <li> This looks good in my son&#x27;s hair gives it a light shine and smell great you don&#x27;t have to use much</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length slightly wavy, very fine hair-- and a lot of it. And although I have a lot of hair, my biggest problem is flat hair because it is so fine. I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on products to help increase volume, but I really hadn&#x27;t found anything that worked all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend was telling me about all the bad things in regular shampoo, so I decided to switch to all natural products. I did some research and decided to initially try the home made stuff--- water, castile soap, and essential oils &#x3D; shampoo and diluted apple cider vinegar for the conditioner. I&#x27;ll say the conditioner was better than the shampoo, but it wasn&#x27;t really doing it for me so I decided to switch again. I tried a combo of three products: JR Liggett&#x27;s bar shampoo, Dr. Bonners citrus conditioner rinse, and Dr. Bonner&#x27;s Lavender and coconut conditioner and styling creme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They all came at different times (only days apart), but I got to try the Lavender and Coconut hair creme first with my homemade products. I used just a tiny drop, but it really did make a huge difference in the smoothness and softness of my hair. It also has a pleasant, but not over powering smell. I really didn&#x27;t see any difference in the volume of my hair though&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next came the bar shampoo-- big improvement over the handmade shampoo and in combination with the dr. bonner hair creme my hair was even softer. The bar shampoo says it can be used without any other products-- eh. I tried it without the conditioning products, but it isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d do again. My hair wasn&#x27;t stringy but it had a very strange texture-- not very soft. Still not a lot of increase in volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next came the Dr. Bonner Citrus Rinse. Awesome. The combination of all three products definitely seems to be the winner. It is important to use all the products according to the package instructions or your hair may not be exactly what you want it to be, but when it&#x27;s used properly-- great results. My hair is soft, smooth, feels thicker and it typically looks and feels even better the next day.. and the day after that. No more problems with oily hair and I haven&#x27;t had any dandruff. As for volume, I have seen an improvement. I even wore my hair in a ponytail for work, wore it up all day, and then took it down when I went to sleep. When I woke up-- volume! That has never, ever, ever happened before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is just worth mentioning that I did try to go without the hair creme and just use the bar soap and the citrus rinse, but my hair wasn&#x27;t as smooth and soft as before. It wasn&#x27;t a HUGE difference, but it was noticeable to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be aware that the switch did make my hair feel different in a very indescribable way. It isn&#x27;t bad at all, but it is a little different. I think it feels healthier, thicker and I&#x27;m just not used to it.smooth, feels thicker and it typically looks and feels even better the next day.. and the day after that.

            <li> Love this conditioner.  It&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t contain harmful chemicals.  I really softens my hair and allows me to comb through my hair without breakage.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I love how silky my hair feels when I use this!  The smell is wonderful!  I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I can ascertain the smell of lavender is felt on my hair, but this conditioner makes them feel silky and squeeky clean.&lt;br /&gt;Used after shampooing with J.R. Liggett&#x27;s Jojoba &amp; Pepperming bar shampoo, taking care of my hair has never been so easy, economical and organic. A great experience.</li>
            <li> I have used this 4x&#x27;s so far.  I am still trying to discover how much to use. Just a tiny amount (eraser tip size for my long hair) does the job of getting rid of dry hair.  Too much makes it feel heavy. I expect the container to last a long while because it is a leave in conditioner and so little is needed. It does detangle well after towel drying my hair. Blow drying &amp; styling with a brush works well. Hair much improved without all the chemicals in other products. Go Dr Bonner!</li>
            <li> I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile Soap for body wash and shampoo, and this is a great compliment to that.  Of course I love that it is all natural and organic.  My family and I are phasing out chemicals and toxins in our home.  This is a great product; light moisturization and light hold for curls.</li>
            <li> hubby liked the way my hair smelled and looked.  I like that it is natural.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product b/c I absolutely love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s other products.  I use his lotions, hand soaps, body soaps and chapsticks and love them all.  I was trying to find a conditioner for my hair b/c after I switched to natural hair products, they left my hair dry and brittle.  This hair conditioner was not the answer!  I first used about a nickle sized amount on my wet/damp hair after a shower and when I blow dried my hair, it was so greasy that I had to re-wash it.  The next time, I barely used any product (less than a dime size amount) and it was still mildly greasy.  It just sits on your hair and never absorbs....it&#x27;s so awful.  I stopped using it after 3 tries...each time using less and less.  The last time, my hair was no longer greasy, but it also wasn&#x27;t conditioned.  I now use it as shaving cream for my legs and chalked it up to a loss.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend every one of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products.....except this one.  It&#x27;s a bummer too b/c Dr Bronner&#x27;s is truly the only brand on the market that doesn&#x27;t contain one single nasty ingredient....and I have looked at a lot of natural products!  Sorry Dr. B&#x27;s.....back to the drawing board on this one!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and lightness of the product; however, it has left my hair slightly stiff when applied heavily or used daily.</li>
            <li> Excellent leave in conditioner if you also want a styling product.</li>
            <li> The pump spout doesn&#x27;t work, so have to leave without a cap, and it makes my hair feel greasy as if it&#x27;s dirty!  We do not have a water softener, but have our water tested yearly and it is only mildly hard, and no other hair product has ever done this to my hair!&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend...</li>
            <li> I was a little wary about purchasing this. Originally, I purchased this to go with part of an organic hair care routine using Dr. Bronner’s Citrus Rinse and J.R. Liggett’s bar soap. In actuality, I ended up using this more so after I reverted back to a conventional hair-care routine after the method with the Citrus Rinse did not work well for me (although I gave it a good 3.5 month shot!). Since then, I’m now using organic shampoos and (admittedly) Aveda products now and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my original concerns with purchasing this product were as follows – with my resolutions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. A lot of reviews state that you only need to use a dime amount. A really, really tiny amount.&lt;br /&gt;I actually found this not to matter so much. I started using a super tiny amount because of allllll the reviews warning me to, but later found that I didn’t need to be as worried amount the amount as I originally thought. I usually use a squirt of it – but I’m not overly-cautious and have not had any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. This product makes your hair greasy! Apparently, according to reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Also not true! I mainly use this product after I flat-iron my hair. I spray a thermal styling spray on my hair, flat-iron my hair in under 10 minutes (I’m not really high maintenance with my hair), and then apply this cream to my DRY hair. I just swoosh it all around and have found that it helps tame my hair from being frizzy. My hair just looks better throughout the day. I don’t use it as a conditioner, but more of a style agent. I have used it on wet hair, as well, with no problems, when I was originally aiming to use it more as a conditioning boost. However, I’ve found that I really just prefer to use it after styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. This product smells strong!&lt;br /&gt;I don’t think so at all. I can never smell it in my hair after applying it, so I wouldn’t hesitate to buy the lavender OR the peppermint next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, my hair type is thick and long. Hope this helps provide some insight!hick and long. Hope this helps provide some insight!</li>
            <li> shipped very fast, however I do not think this product is made for my hair</li>
            <li> I love Bronners. Great Quality, great product.</li>
            <li> way too greasy for my hair.</li>
            <li> The item was delivered quickly and is perfect in every way. I am extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> So good on my hair and scalp -- which need a lot of moisturizing. I know the coconut in it is for real because when i put it on and then blow dry my hair, it smells like toasted coconut :)</li>
            <li> Love it...My hair is much healthier, longer and smells awesome &amp;#60;3 The fact that it is completely organic is a plus</li>
            <li> Got this to feel comfortable about continuing to use a styling creme that&#x27;s natural.  After trying the natural way of shampoo (1.5cups virgin coconut milk + 1.75cups aloe gel) and the DrB Hair Rinse (dilute with only a few drops, not a capful, per cup of water)… this was not necessary…  If you must use something to tame hair (which I found is not necessary with the combination above), Virgin Unrefined Coconut Oil (yes, straight from the grocery shelves) is sooo much cheaper, has sooo many more uses, is just plain all-natural and it smells sooo mm, mm good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the review is … eh, I guess it&#x27;s ok but it&#x27;s not necessary at all…</li>
            <li> I like to use this product right when I am out the shower. It smells organic and i think it works great. I have curly hair and i love it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell. And I love the idea of this. But since it&#x27;s also a leave in conditioner, it made my hair look and feel quite greasy. This might not have happened had I blown my hair dry, but air drying did not look so great. However, my hair is very fine and gets greasy very quickly.</li>
            <li> Really slick texture. This stuff, as others have said, can leave your hair sticky and greasy if you use too much. But just the right amount gives you that day-after-washing look to tame frizzies. Also works well to keep my hair moisturized after straightening with flat iron. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you have thin or straight hair. Works well on my super thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner can&#x27;t do things better, all their products are so great and so natural it makes you feel like you are using nature! Best feeling in the world. Growing the items I buy from them more and more.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair</li>
            <li> I use this occasionally (trying to use up an old product) and my husband uses it every time he washes his hair with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint bar soap. We really like it and the scent is great.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair a bit to oily no matter how little I use. Not happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry.</li>
            <li> My favorite! Smells so nice. So much more natural feeling than other hair products.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an eco-friendly solution to detangle my extremely long hair. When I put it on, I was surprised because it did not &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; very creamy as I worked it thru my hair-- but when I rinsed it out, the results were very impressive-- smooth, soft, easy to comb thru hair. It takes 3-4 pumps to work thru a long head of hair, and this is a SMALL bottle-- so it would not be economical to use often. Looking into homemade solutions for cost containment-- but otherwise was extremely satisfied!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  just the tiniest amount does my hair great justice. ..and I have long red hair.</li>
            <li> Smells absolutely divine and leaves my hair looking and feeling silky smooth. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Smells nice. I used it for a while then went back to my old shampoo and conditioner. Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products are a bit expensive and I like the liquid soaps the best. Probably won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and really makes hair shiny (even course-textured hair), but for curly hair it tends to last about a day or so before the frizz kicks in or the curls flatten out.</li>
            <li> Makes my long hair shiney, does not leave it oily. The scent is light not over powering. Love it !</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair nice and silky, really tames down the flyaways. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY! If I use more then a nickle size my hair looks greasy. I have long hair.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend (she has thick hair). I tried many different ways of applying this, even put some on in shower and rinsed out, but it always left my hair looking greasy and dirty no matter how little I used or when I used it. I have fine hair. It must not be for all hair types, since others seem to love it. I do like dr. Bronners products in general and like that it is safe to use, so I gave this 2 stars. But will be giving away this hair creme!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair extremely greasy, no matter how little I use. Love the smell, but it&#x27;s obviously not for any hair type but thick and course.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because I really like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products and I like their philosophy of not harming the environment and about providing natural products without chemicals. However, this one makes my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It leaves my hair soft (even after I wash it out) and it&#x27;s great for getting rid of frizz and light hold.</li>
            <li> I do actually really like this hair creme - I have curly hair so I end up putting quite a lot of products into my hair to make it work and figured I would try some with a lot less flammability  - I love Bronner&#x27;s soap so this sounded great. It does have a nice texture - the overall smell is pleasant - more on the hemp side than lavender - however, it makes my hair have a completely flat shape to it AND my hair is still dry which I didn&#x27;t even think was possible to have both greasy and dry hair - and you absolutely cannot use it more than one day in a row. Its a good product - probably works well for other types of hair. I would love it if Bronners made lotions instead of the hair creme - I think it could work with a little less greasy-ness.</li>
