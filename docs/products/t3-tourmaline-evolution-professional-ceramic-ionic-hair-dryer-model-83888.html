            <li>This blow dryer is worth every penny!  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s right on the grip, so it&#x27;s easy to switch it off on accident during operation.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.  </li>
            <li>It really keeps your hair healthy.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair super shiny and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;Online</li>
            <li>and I was very excited and happy with it until the low setting broke after only 3 months.</li>
            <li>Easy on hair - doesn&#x27;t damage from too much heat even tho</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s worth the retail price of $340, but at $100</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>the cord is a bit long, but i love the hairdryer!</li>
            <li>my first was a hand-me-down and worked great for years after the previous owner beat on it!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s so gentle on my hair but quick,</li>
            <li>This product did not work after 9 months.the t3 stopped throwing hot air after 9 months.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast too!</li>
            <li>The fan starts going out and buzzes and dryer too hot damaging hair</li>
            <li>T3 official web site states &amp;#34;The T3 warranty only applies when tools are purchased from an authorized retailer - select retailers, e-tailers and better salons.</li>
            <li>I also recommend theirs flat irons if you want o keep your hair healthy.</li>
            <li>your order arrives, plese take a moment to leave 5 star positive feedback.</li>
            <li>This was the most I&#x27;ve spent on a hair dryer</li>
            <li>Hair becomes smooth n silky without extra hair product.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This is the all-around hair dryer I have owned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to do my hair myself with minimal effort, which saves $40 on blowouts twice a month.  </li>
            <li>This is a great buy, I have a long and curly hair and it takes me 30 mins or less to straight it with the t3 evolution 83888 dryer.</li>
            <li>My hair is also naturally really wavy, but this blow dryer, my hair&#x27;s alot strighter then normal and makes it smoother!</li>
            <li>My mom gave me a hard time for spending the loot on this unit, but honestly, it&#x27;s such a great price here compared to retail</li>
            <li>I bought the same one again as it dries my hair quickly and is not as loud as many other dryers.</li>
            <li>I use the concentrator and use it on high.  </li>
            <li>so... There was a note in the box to coax purchasers to give it a high rating that states: &amp;#34;5</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the most quiet, but it&#x27;s not exactly loud either.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, a fantastic value on a well made unit.</li>
            <li>This dryer provides the right amount of heat with serious power and is easy on the arms.  </li>
            <li>They immediately switched out my first blow dryer which didn&#x27;t function properly!</li>
            <li>Worth every single penny.</li>
            <li>: Only orders with 5 star positive fedback qualify for lifetime replacement warranty.</li>
            <li>She actually asked me if I was wearing a wig because my hair was so shiny (a real feat for a 52 year old woman...</li>
            <li>I just bought another t3 evolution dryer to replace my old one.</li>
            <li>I had her try it, and her silver strands were just as shiny and soft when she finished.</li>
            <li>very lightweight and quiet.</li>
            <li>This is my second T3 - first one last about two years.  </li>
            <li>I have super long hair and it took me about 20 minutes to blow dry my hari before this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Button&#x27;s have too soft of a touch, as such when blow-drying inadvertently turning off the dryer or changing the settings while holding the grip (where the buttons are located).  </li>

            <li> I love this dryer!!! Thank You for the great deal!</li>
            <li> I have owned this dryer for 6 years. This is a great buy, I have a long and curly hair and it takes me 30 mins or less to straight it with the t3 evolution 83888 dryer. I just bought another t3 evolution dryer to replace my old one. It really keeps your hair healthy. I also recommend theirs flat irons if you want o keep your hair healthy.</li>
            <li> Came as ordered. Can&#x27;t wait to give it to the g.f for xmas</li>
            <li> Nothing special.  Took just as long to dry my hair as my 10 year old $30 hairdryer. Questioned whether this was a knock-off.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is worth every penny!  I held out for years because of the price... Even though i had heard so many great reviews.  But I finally gave in and I LOVE it!  It leaves my hair super shiny and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;Online warehouse was terrific as well!  They immediately switched out my first blow dryer which didn&#x27;t function properly!</li>
            <li> Great blow dryer. Love it.</li>
            <li> This product did not work after 9 months.the t3 stopped throwing hot air after 9 months. Not a good product for the price</li>
            <li> Fabulous hairdryer.  Easy on hair - doesn&#x27;t damage from too much heat even tho I use the concentrator and use it on high.  The only downside is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long.  Mine usually die in less than 2 years.  But it&#x27;s so gentle on my hair but quick, I keep buying the same one again.</li>
            <li> This was the most I&#x27;ve spent on a hair dryer and I was very excited and happy with it until the low setting broke after only 3 months. I expect quality to go along with price! The warranty is no good when you don&#x27;t buy from a regular retailer also.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer really does cut drying time in half as well as style your hair as it being dried</li>
            <li> Worth every single penny. My mom gave me a hard time for spending the loot on this unit, but honestly, it&#x27;s such a great price here compared to retail, it wasn&#x27;t all that bad. And the results? AMAZING!  She actually asked me if I was wearing a wig because my hair was so shiny (a real feat for a 52 year old woman...with age hair gets dull). Best Part? I had her try it, and her silver strands were just as shiny and soft when she finished. It dries fast, and about the only thing I can find a bit negative is the placement of the on/off switch. It&#x27;s right on the grip, so it&#x27;s easy to switch it off on accident during operation. Other than that, a fantastic value on a well made unit. Shipped fast too!</li>
            <li> love it! very lightweight and quiet. the cord is a bit long, but i love the hairdryer! would def recommend it!</li>
            <li> List price on this was $369 at time of purchase life time warranty on hair dryer? 10 mo later dose not work. Petmax will not replace. Due to over 90 days old ?. I could have got 10 good hair dryers at store for the price of this junk.</li>
            <li> This is my second T3 - first one last about two years.  I bought the same one again as it dries my hair quickly and is not as loud as many other dryers.</li>
            <li> My favorite blowdryer!!!</li>

            <li> It has done magic to my hair after first use. Hair becomes smooth n silky without extra hair product. Love the touch of my hair. Great price. Fast shipping. Can&#x27;t ask for better.</li>

            <li> Great hair dryer.  Everything per description.  Button&#x27;s have too soft of a touch, as such when blow-drying inadvertently turning off the dryer or changing the settings while holding the grip (where the buttons are located).  Kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> I have super long hair and it took me about 20 minutes to blow dry my hari before this blow dryer. I have timed myself with theis dryer and it takes me about 7 minutes now. Those 13 minutes make a big difference in the morning! My hair is also naturally really wavy, but this blow dryer, my hair&#x27;s alot strighter then normal and makes it smoother! You need to use a round brush with this dryer to make your hair stright. It was a good buy and I am very happy with it!</li>
            <li> This product is fake... no better than a $19 Conair! Disregard all 5-Star ratings... keep reading to find out why. Stay Away! It&#x27;s not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The T3 official web site states &amp;#34;The T3 warranty only applies when tools are purchased from an authorized retailer - select retailers, e-tailers and better salons. Please note that Amazon and Ebay are not authorized sellers.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More so...

            <li> What an incredible dryer.  I have a mountain of thick, long curly hair thanks to my biracial heritage so finding a dryer that can power through these curls without frying my hair has been my life&#x27;s mission.  I love the dryers at the Dominican salons I go to here in NYC but they always seem to be too darn hot and my hair looks great but my scalp is burned off!  This dryer provides the right amount of heat with serious power and is easy on the arms.  It&#x27;s not the most quiet, but it&#x27;s not exactly loud either.  I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s worth the retail price of $340, but at $100 it&#x27;s a great option.  I&#x27;m able to do my hair myself with minimal effort, which saves $40 on blowouts twice a month.  Pays for itself in just a few uses.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
