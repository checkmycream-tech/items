            <li>but it is amazing to me!!!</li>
            <li>I am so happy we didn&#x27;t buy it there</li>
            <li>Admittedly, the product worked great, i could tell a difference in her wrinkles just from the sample she used at the store.  </li>
            <li>I have always had good luck with Amazon</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!!!!</li>
            <li>This is a great product from a fantastic product line.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely the best eye cream on the market!!!</li>
            <li>Gold Intensive Eye Treatment Cream is somewhat effective.</li>
            <li>Just being honest about it.</li>
            <li>I was able to see amazing result.</li>
            <li>My mother had bought this from a place at the mall and really liked it and said she wanted more for Mother&#x27;s Day.  </li>
            <li>Love this eye cream.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for better eye cream.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for about 6 weeks, along with the eye serum, and, truthfully</li>
            <li>Love the products, just got ripped off in price.</li>
            <li>Received very quickly.</li>
            <li>Received this very quickly.</li>
            <li>She said it went on smooth.</li>
            <li>I seems to absorb quickly and thoroughly.</li>
            <li>We wanted to buy it right then and there until she said $200.00.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast.  </li>
            <li>These products are results oriented with minimal amounts needed which makes them cost effective.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly like what they sell in Las Vegas.</li>
            <li>it really worked\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>and you could really see the difference.</li>
            <li>I got the whole set for under the $200.00 for just the eye treatment.  </li>
            <li>Some products tout gold-like results, but why not use real gold?</li>
            <li>They were VERY pushy to get her to buy some of this stuff, including the eye cream.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>Other people seem to have better results.</li>
            <li>I bought this and many other products in vegas.  </li>
            <li>Under eye lines and puffiness seem to disappear, a tiny amount of product is adequate for both eyes, and use of real gold feels luxurious.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really see any major improvements around my eye area, but the product is comfortable enough - not sticky, not greasy.</li>
            <li>Is this the real product or a cheap imitation.</li>
            <li>Not at all greasy, it goes on very softly.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have suffered even as an adult with acne.</li>
            <li>A young sales lady walked up to me with this lotion and said \\&quot;you need to try this\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I am 49 years old and look my age.  </li>
            <li>My husband says, \\&quot;WOW,</li>
            <li>If you see a young man with an accent at Excalibur, don&#x27;t buy.  </li>
            <li>But, I must say there really was less apparent puffiness.</li>
            <li>Long term use of colloidal gold can cause a condition called CHRYSIASIS, which, besides causing problems such as kidney failure, is famous for turning your skin blue, mauve, or grey!</li>

            <li> Long term use of colloidal gold can cause a condition called CHRYSIASIS, which, besides causing problems such as kidney failure, is famous for turning your skin blue, mauve, or grey!</li>
            <li> While reported cases of chrysiasis are usually caused by colloidal gold being injected (for rheumatoid arthritis) or taken internally, medication and toxic substances can be absorbed by the skin (think of nicotine patches or other trans-dermal patches such as those for sea-sickness).</li>
            <li> Colloidal gold used to be used to treat very severe rheumatoid arthritis in the past, but because of the possibility of serious side effects, it rarely is now.</li>
            <li> She really gave me the hard sell, even showed me something claiming to be the online prices I&#x27;d find.  </li>
            <li> But no different than other creams I have used.  </li>
            <li> I just have really dry skin</li>
            <li> After 8 months of use, the dark circles are still as ever present as before I started using this cream.</li>
            <li> Seems to do a decent job moisturizing the eye area, just not sure about the claims regarding removing dark circles and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> or if they just put something else in an empty bottle.</li>
            <li> I walked out of the store having spent well over $600 dollars.</li>
            <li> have been using both for some weeks now, but frankly, do not really see a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I received this product quite quickly but was not happy to say the least.</li>
            <li> She put it on the other eye to even them out.  </li>
            <li> When really, we are buying crap that we think is high quality product because we paid a lot of money for it.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money</li>
            <li> While short-term use of Oro Gold products is unlikely to cause any problems, I would be very cautious about using them for any length of time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at a mall kiosk and was promised that it was the cure to the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> As for any dark circles under the eyes, I saw no difference.</li>
            <li> You can seriously see instant results with this eye cream.  </li>
            <li> dark circles haven&#x27;t diminished even a little.</li>
            <li> within a few minutes the puffiness was gone.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> , I think I have worse crowsfeet and dry skin around my eyes now than I did before I started using it.    </li>
            <li> I am shocked to see the real price of these items.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, she beat me out of $100 for the same product I could have bought on Amazon for $37.00</li>
            <li> but this was not a good experience.</li>
            <li> SO we spend all this money on expensive product in a resort town like Vegas, then find on Amazon for much less!</li>
            <li> I should have know something was wrong when she told me that each product sold for around $300, she even went out of her way to show me the retail price from what I thought was Amazon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is an expensive product, so you need to think twice before buying it.</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> Tried it in Las Vegas, but didn&#x27;t buy, because of the crazy price.  </li>
            <li> Wrong!  </li>
            <li> This is all a lie, I went to Ulta after months of horrible skin problems, it felt like my acne got worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so mad I would like to return to the store and throw it at her!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference since using it.  Doesn&#x27;t bother my skin... But no different than other creams I have used.  Not worth the money</li>
            <li> My husband and I were in Las Vegas, walking around the Mall.  A young sales lady walked up to me with this lotion and said \\&quot;you need to try this\\&quot;.  I am 49 years old and look my age.  My husband said go ahead.  She put the Oro Gold on one side beside my eye.  My husband says, \\&quot;WOW, it really worked\\&quot;.  I looked in mirror and you could really see the difference. I could feel the difference also.  She put it on the other eye to even them out.  We wanted to buy it right then and there until she said $200.00.  I am so happy we didn&#x27;t buy it there but here on line.  I got the whole set for under the $200.00 for just the eye treatment.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I met a saleswoman in Las Vegas and she brought me in to her store to demonstrate the Oro Gold line. I should have know something was wrong when she told me that each product sold for around $300, she even went out of her way to show me the retail price from what I thought was Amazon. But it wasn&#x27;t. Needless to say, she beat me out of $100 for the same product I could have bought on Amazon for $37.00 I&#x27;m so mad I would like to return to the store and throw it at her! SO we spend all this money on expensive product in a resort town like Vegas, then find on Amazon for much less! We think, &#x27;What a deal!&#x27; When really, we are buying crap that we think is high quality product because we paid a lot of money for it. Buyer Beware! Oro Gold is a scam.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Tried it in Las Vegas, but didn&#x27;t buy, because of the crazy price.  She really gave me the hard sell, even showed me something claiming to be the online prices I&#x27;d find.  Wrong!  This was a third of the price and the same thing!  Received very quickly. too.</li>
            <li> When trying the product at the mall I was able to see amazing result. It was instant. within a few minutes the puffiness was gone. I get the product at home try it and nothing happen. to me its obvious the something else is being put into the product at the mall to inhance the results, so people can buy it. Final results a very big RIP OFF.</li>
            <li> This is a great product from a fantastic product line.  Under eye lines and puffiness seem to disappear, a tiny amount of product is adequate for both eyes, and use of real gold feels luxurious.  Some products tout gold-like results, but why not use real gold?</li>
            <li> Love this eye cream.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and you can tell.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for better eye cream.  I have tried everything, but this one is the best and i recommend to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I received this product quite quickly but was not happy to say the least. The bottle was damn near empty so I don&#x27;t know if I even got the product that was supposed to be in there or if they just put something else in an empty bottle. I have always had good luck with Amazon but this was not a good experience.</li>
            <li> This is a scam, I was tricked into buying their line...I walked out of the store having spent well over $600 dollars. Mind you, the salesperson went on and on about how it was an investment and how it would be the only product that I would need to help me with my skin problems. I have very sensitive skin and have suffered even as an adult with acne. This is all a lie, I went to Ulta after months of horrible skin problems, it felt like my acne got worse. Please do not buy this product, or any from this company, they are misleading and when I tried to reach out to them they turned me away. Well, I used up everything in hopes that maybe it was my skin getting used to it, and with no avail my skin only started clearing up with a mud mask I purchased at Ulta. Stay away from these people.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oroduct for almost a year now.  It immediately smooths any puffiness away, and helps with those squint lines, too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 6 weeks, along with the eye serum, and, truthfully, I think I have worse crowsfeet and dry skin around my eyes now than I did before I started using it.    Other people seem to have better results. I just have really dry skin I guess. I&#x27;ve gone back to Philosophy products.</li>
            <li> I bought this and many other products in vegas.  I am shocked to see the real price of these items.  Do not buy in vegas.  If you see a young man with an accent at Excalibur, don&#x27;t buy.  Love the products, just got ripped off in price.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Have been using product for 5 weeks and havent noticed any difference in eye puffiness&lt;br /&gt;and dark circles haven&#x27;t diminished even a little.</li>
            <li> My mother had bought this from a place at the mall and really liked it and said she wanted more for Mother&#x27;s Day.  So I looked for them back at the mall and didn&#x27;t find them so I did what anyone does looked it up on-line not only did I find it it was way cheaper then at the mall.  Shipping was very fast.  Thank you so much!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to the Oro Gold product line in a Las Vegas Hotel/Casino.  These products are results oriented with minimal amounts needed which makes them cost effective.  One bottle lasts for one year!</li>
            <li> You can seriously see instant results with this eye cream.  Not at all greasy, it goes on very softly.  This is the second time I have purchased it.  One bottle used twice a day lasts for about five months.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is to be used in conjunction with the eye serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using both for some weeks now, but frankly, do not really see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an expensive product, so you need to think twice before buying it.</li>
            <li> Love the product and results but way too expensive. I will not be buying again unless has a drastic price cut</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best eye cream on the market!!! You have to try it to believe it... I know it may not work for all but it is amazing to me!!! You will not be disappointed!!! I know that the sellers might have said it would last a year but that is only if you use it once a week....Once you try it, you will be using it daily.....</li>
            <li> my wife (thank god) was about to drop $400+ before Christmas at the Oro Gold store at the Irvine Spectrum in CA.  They were VERY pushy to get her to buy some of this stuff, including the eye cream.  Admittedly, the product worked great, i could tell a difference in her wrinkles just from the sample she used at the store.  THANKFULLY we found it on Amazon and we purchased this and the eye creams for like $120 instead of the $500+ she was going to drop at the store without the option to return...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in short, 5 STARS!  thank you!</li>
            <li> Oro Gold products are made with colloidal gold. The sales pitch promoting the use of 24k gold in their products doesn&#x27;t mention that there is probably only a fraction of 1 cent of gold in the entire tube or jar - certainly not enough to justify the inflated prices. Colloidal gold used to be used to treat very severe rheumatoid arthritis in the past, but because of the possibility of serious side effects, it rarely is now. Long term use of colloidal gold can cause a condition called CHRYSIASIS, which, besides causing problems such as kidney failure, is famous for turning your skin blue, mauve, or grey! Use of colloidal silver causes a similar condition called argyria. While reported cases of chrysiasis are usually caused by colloidal gold being injected (for rheumatoid arthritis) or taken internally, medication and toxic substances can be absorbed by the skin (think of nicotine patches or other trans-dermal patches such as those for sea-sickness). While short-term use of Oro Gold products is unlikely to cause any problems, I would be very cautious about using them for any length of time. Next time you are grabbed by one of their snake oil salesmen, shout \\&quot;Chrysiasis!!!\\&quot; in their ear and walk on.</li>
            <li> Expensive but it works!!!  A little goes a long way and I use it morning and night. I seems to absorb quickly and thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at a mall kiosk and was promised that it was the cure to the dark circles under my eyes. After 8 months of use, the dark circles are still as ever present as before I started using this cream. Since this stuff cost quite a lot, I will continue to use it until it finishes.</li>
            <li> only product by oro gold that works. use sparingly.</li>
            <li> 24k Gold Intensive Eye Treatment Cream is somewhat effective. I could see what looked like a reduction in puffiness. She said it went on smooth. As for any dark circles under the eyes, I saw no difference. But, I must say there really was less apparent puffiness. It is pricey, but she likes it and I did see some difference in her appearance. Who am I to argue? Just being honest about it.</li>
            <li> Have used Oro Gold products for a while, and I like all of them.  This one performs well, giving my eyes added moisture and helps with lines.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really see any major improvements around my eye area, but the product is comfortable enough - not sticky, not greasy. Seems to do a decent job moisturizing the eye area, just not sure about the claims regarding removing dark circles and wrinkles. I will definitely NOT spend the money on this product again.</li>
            <li> I did not see a difference after using the product. Is this the real product or a cheap imitation. Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Received this very quickly. It was exactly like what they sell in Las Vegas. Only way cheaper here. Thanks so much.</li>
