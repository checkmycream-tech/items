            <li>I have purchased all the neccessary tools to do my own home shellac mani&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It went on very easily and stayed on my fingernails for about 16 days and lasted on my toes for a month, before I decided to remove it.</li>
            <li>The shine after the CND top coat and the alcohol wipe is amazing, giving the nail a \\&quot;wet\\</li>
            <li>Great Shipping Thanks...</li>
            <li>People love this color</li>
            <li>I LOVE this polish.</li>
            <li>&quot; look which I personally love.  </li>
            <li>It is SUPER easy to do and I love that I can change my color more often.</li>
            <li>The color was as I expected for a nice bright pinkish coral.  </li>
            <li>I think it is a great color, and very similar to the bottle color.  </li>
            <li>It is a bright coral color, and is completely opaque in finish.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it yet but am not disappointed at all.  </li>
            <li>I have found that it goes on just as good as regular nail polish and looks fantastic for a couple of weeks just as advertised.</li>
            <li>Super Quality.</li>
            <li>, little more orange that I expected, but still very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was on time, product came in excellent condition</li>
            <li>beautiful color, a little more pink than the color shown in the bottle.</li>
            <li>It works exactly the way I had hoped it would.</li>
            <li>(I do it professionally) and Tropix is definitely my favorite color so far!</li>
            <li>Not only is the color super cute and bright for summer, but it truly goes on like a polish (compared to some other gels that become too thick), and after curing under the UV light, stays on like a gel!</li>
            <li>I would certainly purchase this product again</li>
            <li>but this is more pink</li>
            <li>I received this Cnd Shellac Tropix Gel Nail Polish in a very prompt and timely manner from this seller.  </li>
            <li>you, the actual polish color is lighter and very pretty.</li>
            <li>Color is orangeish/pinkish, leaning a little more to the orange side.</li>
            <li>One of my new favs.</li>
            <li>Tropix is the third CND color that I have, and I just used it for the first time on my toes.  </li>
            <li>It is an orangey pink and is a hot color for summer.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s nothing and doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not the original.</li>

            <li> Great Product.. Great Shipping Thanks...</li>
            <li> Super Quality.The product is perfect. It works exactly the way I had hoped it would. I would certainly purchase this product again</li>
            <li> good color for the summer, little more orange that I expected, but still very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was on time, product came in excellent condition</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful coral color polish. Don&#x27;t let the color of the bottle fool you, the actual polish color is lighter and very pretty. Very nice product.</li>
            <li> beautiful color, a little more pink than the color shown in the bottle. People love this color i suse them in my salon but people always expect and orange red but this is more pink</li>
            <li> I LOVE this polish. Not only is the color super cute and bright for summer, but it truly goes on like a polish (compared to some other gels that become too thick), and after curing under the UV light, stays on like a gel! I am definitely sticking with this brand from now on!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have purchased all the neccessary tools to do my own home shellac mani&#x27;s. It is SUPER easy to do and I love that I can change my color more often. It paid for itself for the price of 3 salon manicures!</li>
            <li> Love the CND polish and it is a great color too.  I thought that by being a shellac, I might have problems with the thickness of the polish as vs. &#x27;regular&#x27; nail polish.  I have found that it goes on just as good as regular nail polish and looks fantastic for a couple of weeks just as advertised.</li>
            <li> Love this nail  polish!</li>
            <li> This polish was way to thick and may have been sitting on the shelf way to long was not satisfied .</li>
            <li> Tropix is a nice, bright coral color, perfect for spring, summer, or whenever you want a touch of brightness. It went on very easily and stayed on my fingernails for about 16 days and lasted on my toes for a month, before I decided to remove it.</li>
            <li> Tropix is the third CND color that I have, and I just used it for the first time on my toes.  I think it is a great color, and very similar to the bottle color.  Tropix is a great color for the spring/summer as it is coral-like.  The shine after the CND top coat and the alcohol wipe is amazing, giving the nail a \\&quot;wet\\&quot; look which I personally love.  I love Shellac all together, and I am very pleased with my purchase of Tropix!!</li>
            <li> Color is orangeish/pinkish, leaning a little more to the orange side. I&#x27;ve gotten a ton of compliments on it already and being a DIYer it&#x27;s lasted over a week and a half already, and I beat up my hands. Perfect spring/summer color! Tip, make sure you file down ridges on your nail, helps base coat to adhere. And shake bottles (base coat, color and topcoat) well before using so it mixes gels.</li>
            <li> I love shellac polish and this color is awesome. It is an orangey pink and is a hot color for summer. One of my new favs.</li>
            <li> nice bright color. I have found it tends to mimic the colors I wear- it is an orangey red with hues of pink in it.  Plenty of compliments!</li>
            <li> I have been using Shellac for almost 3 years now (I do it professionally) and Tropix is definitely my favorite color so far! It is a bright coral color, and is completely opaque in finish.</li>
            <li> I received this Cnd Shellac Tropix Gel Nail Polish in a very prompt and timely manner from this seller.  The color was as I expected for a nice bright pinkish coral.  Haven&#x27;t used it yet but am not disappointed at all.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> The item arrived in time, the only thing that I am sceptical about is that the package has differences from the one that I bought from the official website of cnd in my country. Maybe it&#x27;s nothing and doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not the original. That will be shown from the quality and duration though.</li>
            <li> Product was very very thick.  Would not spread on nails.  Perhaps this was on their shelf too long.  None of my other CND polish is like this.  So I don&#x27;t know if it is the Seller&#x27;s fault or the color.</li>
