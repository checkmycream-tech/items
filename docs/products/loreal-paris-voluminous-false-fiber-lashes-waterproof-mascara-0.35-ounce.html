            <li>, it looked nice, however I still prefer Great lash as my first fav, but this worked</li>
            <li>This mascara creates the most lovely doe eyes.</li>

            <li>im in love with it .</li>
            <li>I had more expectations for this mascara.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>It workd good, but it doesnt give much volume.</li>
            <li>then the L&#x27;Oreal is fine.</li>
            <li>I had hoped with the reviews that this would be the end to my search for a good mascara - far from it!  </li>
            <li>&#x27;s waterproof mascara is $30.00 is because it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It clumps only rarely, and those chunks are easily removed by hand or with an eyelash comb.  </li>
            <li>I ran out of this product and purchased Lancome&#x27;s Difinicil and realized the difference between the 2 is that the latter does not clump at all (on lashes or inside the container), comes off much easier and cost more.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it got a low score (which is good) on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep site for the amount of chemicals, etc that it&#x27;s made with.  </li>
            <li>Very black, just perfect for my dark hair.</li>
            <li>Fast service, dependable product and competative pricing.  </li>
            <li>I through it out straight away.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li>and I got as many compliments, if not more, when I used it.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do anything special to my lashes but it wears well in combination with my other mascaras.</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara and it arrived earlier than due date!</li>
            <li>(I use a clear mascara brush)</li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s necessary to avoid the clumping, but it seems to run out really soon.</li>
            <li>and it was far from waterproof.</li>
            <li>The tube feels empty really fast, however.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it, and will definitely buy it again.</li>

            <li> it last long</li>
            <li> The only thing for which it loses a star is that the formula seems to be quite dry every time I use it, thus requiring that I buy a new tube every ~3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I religiously curl my lashes before application (Shu uemura curler) and this mascara does not weigh down the curl at all-</li>
            <li> Does nothing for my lashes that $3 mascara doesn&#x27;t do &amp; was very dry when I received it - after 3 tries, decided to throw it away</li>
            <li> well thought it did seem to dry out a little.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s waterproof so stays longer without black stain around your eyes!</li>
            <li> Carbon black is fabulious!</li>
            <li> Annoying, but quite worth the results!</li>
            <li> A little hard to get off though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually buy drug store cosmetics, but I gave this a try.</li>
            <li> I love l&#x27;oreal mascara, but this one was awful.</li>
            <li> It somewhat works as advertised, but is near impossible to remove.</li>
            <li> And hard to wash off as well.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that the package was opened just a little, but not to the point where I was wondering if they had changed it out with a used one.</li>
            <li> I have been trying a variety of brands lately, but I am sticking with this one.</li>
            <li> it thickens at the base and gives substantial length that stays put throughout trudging around in windy new york weather and even the longest of dancing nights.</li>
            <li> - don&#x27;t waste your money!!!@!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I read the rave reviews about this product and went for it.</li>
            <li> Always use Amazon and have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hate this mascara it was horrible and clumpy</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE STAY AWAY!!</li>

            <li> Love this mascara! It, obviously, doesn&#x27;t make you look like you are wearing falsies, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to. It does separate each individual lash, and even with three coats doesn&#x27;t clump ~ at all. It makes each lash stand out while looking both thicker and longer.  This is the best mascara I have EVER used.  I have been trying a variety of brands lately, but I am sticking with this one. I highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li> This mascara creates the most lovely doe eyes. I religiously curl my lashes before application (Shu uemura curler) and this mascara does not weigh down the curl at all- it thickens at the base and gives substantial length that stays put throughout trudging around in windy new york weather and even the longest of dancing nights. The only thing for which it loses a star is that the formula seems to be quite dry every time I use it, thus requiring that I buy a new tube every ~3 weeks. Annoying, but quite worth the results!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara im in love with it . it last long</li>
            <li> With just 1-2 combs of this mascara through my lashes, they plump up and lengthen noticeably.  It clumps only rarely, and those chunks are easily removed by hand or with an eyelash comb.  Very black, just perfect for my dark hair.</li>
            <li> I like this product for ease of use.  It separates and lengthens without clumping.  Doesn&#x27;t run or smudge. The tube feels empty really fast, however.  Maybe that&#x27;s necessary to avoid the clumping, but it seems to run out really soon.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I read the rave reviews about this product and went for it. I don&#x27;t usually buy drug store cosmetics, but I gave this a try. As it turns out the reason&lt;br /&gt;Dior&#x27;s waterproof mascara is $30.00 is because it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up with tacky, clumpy lashes, maybe it is just me.</li>
            <li> I can see the appeal of this. It somewhat works as advertised, but is near impossible to remove. I lost a ton of lashes trying to wash it off. I had mascara residue smearing off for a couple of days after use. Yuck.</li>
            <li> I had hoped with the reviews that this would be the end to my search for a good mascara - far from it!  I tried it w/ and without primer &amp; with primer all it did was glop my lashes together to the point that I had to wash it off &amp; start over!  Does nothing for my lashes that $3 mascara doesn&#x27;t do &amp; was very dry when I received it - after 3 tries, decided to throw it away - don&#x27;t waste your money!!!@!</li>
            <li> no different from regular mascara</li>
            <li> Simply great and love how my lashes look with this mascara....also I like it&#x27;s waterproof so stays longer without black stain around your eyes!</li>
            <li> Loved the product.  Fast service, dependable product and competative pricing.  Always use Amazon and have never been disappointed. Thank you!</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara and it arrived earlier than due date! Love it!</li>
            <li> This mascara is alright. It didn&#x27;t do anything special to my lashes but it wears well in combination with my other mascaras.</li>
            <li> I ran out of this product and purchased Lancome&#x27;s Difinicil and realized the difference between the 2 is that the latter does not clump at all (on lashes or inside the container), comes off much easier and cost more. If you don&#x27;t mind removing occassional clumps (I use a clear mascara brush) then the L&#x27;Oreal is fine. I would have ordered the Difinicil if it were Prime but will reorder the L&#x27;Oreal. It does work well and I got as many compliments, if not more, when I used it.</li>
            <li> I love l&#x27;oreal mascara, but this one was awful. It did not make my lashes look longer and it was far from waterproof. I looked like a racoon all day.</li>
            <li> I had more expectations for this mascara. It workd good, but it doesnt give much volume. I wouldn´t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Had this product in my wishlist for awhile. Then it went on sell! Had to buy it then. I got it when they said I would. The only bad thing is that the package was opened just a little, but not to the point where I was wondering if they had changed it out with a used one. I love L&#x27;Oreal voluminous waterproof mascare!!!!!! Carbon black is fabulious! LOVE</li>
            <li> I bought this because it got a low score (which is good) on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep site for the amount of chemicals, etc that it&#x27;s made with.  I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it, and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Hate this mascara it was horrible and clumpy ugh I through it out straight away. HORRIBLE STAY AWAY!! And hard to wash off as well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I liked this but it seemed to flake a bit at times after wearing it for a while, it looked nice, however I still prefer Great lash as my first fav, but this worked well thought it did seem to dry out a little.</li>
            <li> just ok...not too impressed with this. Crumbles and flakes.</li>
            <li> My lashes are thicker and longer without clumps. A little hard to get off though.</li>
