    <ol>
            <li>Perfect for doing gel nails at home!</li>
            <li>What more can I say when it doesn&#x27;t work  !!!!</li>
            <li>And the Amazon price was the best on the web.</li>
            <li>my manicure is perfect!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m done with shiney beautiful nails just like in a salon!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>If we have beautiful nails we also have to have beautiful hands.</li>
            <li>Great drier.  </li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>It has a sensor so the light cuts on when you stick your hand in, which is a wonderful convenience.</li>
            <li>This is a very good quality led light dryer.</li>
            <li>Great light!</li>
            <li>I bought an adapter and it still wouldn&#x27;t work and waisted 20 more dollars in that !</li>
            <li>Also,I really love the nail nipper seller send to me!</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>Would have been nice to have a longer cord.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s best to splurge on the decent opi one.</li>
            <li>Love not having to go pay $40 to get a gel manicure any more!</li>
            <li>It does take some time to get used to doing on your own nail... (not getting the foundation or top coat on your skin)</li>
            <li>I purchased two led lights 6 months ago and was working ok in the beginning although the thumbs weren&#x27;t curing correctly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;If price is an issue, this one is decent and you may get some good manicures as well.</li>
            <li>6/5/2015 - Going on two years usage, and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>The self timer with 3 settings makes a huge difference and my life a lot easier.</li>
            <li>the light works</li>
            <li>It was the light not working correctly.  </li>
            <li>It takes 5-6 minutes per coat, and that is just for light colors.  </li>
            <li>Splurge and buy the gelish led light...</li>
            <li>I also like this light because its LED.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this lamp about six times now and have had no problems...except that sometimes the auto light doesn&#x27;t come on automatically</li>
            <li>light is so user friendly and</li>
            <li>I had great results for the first several months.</li>
            <li>This light is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I got this light as a birthday present to use with my Gelish polish and i love it!</li>
            <li>The same light at the beauty supply store was about $50 more!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this light!</li>
            <li>It is well made, easy to use and does the job very well.  </li>
            <li>It looks exactly like what I would have paid $40 in a salon for!</li>
            <li>work better,  Caused me to lose clients because the lamp would not dry their nails.  </li>
            <li>did think it didn&#x27;t work when I first got it because it was sticky, but my GF taught me the trick of</li>
            <li>My first dryer was a UV CND dryer</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
            <li>but I like being able to dry one whole hand at a time!</li>
            <li>The opening is large enough to comfortably do your toes (but you can only do one foot at a time  :)  4.</li>
            <li>It is simple to use and easy to store on a shelf when not in use.</li>
            <li>recently invested in the OPI nail dryer and if you are going to get a new dryer I would recommend spending more and getting the OPI.</li>
            <li>after you dry the top coat, take a cotton ball and rubbing alcohol and rub each nail gently</li>
            <li>I have since purchased a different brand light and it works well, so</li>
            <li>so this one was much faster.</li>
            <li>It cures really well</li>
            <li>I really like the way you can set the timer for 10, 20 or 30 seconds, and that it turns on automatically when you put your hands in it.</li>
            <li>This reduces drying time by more than half.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for Gel polish.</li>
            <li>(If you take one hand out and put the other in too fast, the sensor will not trigger and the light won&#x27;t come on -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much faster than the little light i was using.</li>
            <li>I used a UV lamp for about 6 months and it took so long it wasn&#x27;t worth using the Gelish polish.  </li>
            <li>Its more than big enough to put all 5 fingers in at once, even if you have big hands.</li>
            <li>I have only used this a handful of times but it works exactly as it is intended.  </li>
            <li>This lamp would not cure the gel polish, regardless of how long nails were left in the light.  </li>
            <li>it cause it cost more and didn&#x27;t last nowhere as long as what it&#x27;s suppose to last.</li>
            <li>I am a professional nail technician and the lamps you buy at Wal-Mart</li>
            <li>The pre-set time settings are really helpful, especially if you&#x27;re using Gelish.</li>
            <li>I touched the bulbs with the tops of uncured toe nails a few times - just let the light cure the polish on the bulbs</li>
            <li>and then wipe of with soft paper towel with alcohol on it</li>
            <li>btw, I&#x27;m a professional.</li>
            <li>Also wasted my time on having to fix my clients nails for free.</li>
            <li>- came right off (if you don&#x27;t let it cure, it just smears and is more difficult to remove)  </li>
            <li>In fact, it works better than Nailuv&#x27;s little red LED lamp/dryer for a similar price.  </li>
            <li>As expected, this one does cure my LED gel polish about twice as fast as my portable one did.  </li>

            <li> The past couple of months however my manicures have only been lasting one week.</li>
            <li> Its said for 20 sec dry</li>
            <li> That person must be using the wrong polish or maybe has a defective unit because if you&#x27;re doing it right you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to turn it on and off, although you can do that with it too on the other setting.</li>
            <li> Dark colors I gave up on.  </li>
            <li> This lamp is not worth the plastic it is made of.  </li>
            <li> Not worth</li>
            <li> For base and top coats one can even cure both hands at once in it.  </li>
            <li> Then within 10 uses the gel polish just peels off right after doing it(even on acrylic nails which is almost impossible to do).</li>
            <li> it was not a problem of how heavy the gel was applied to the nail.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Although pricey, after a few uses, you will save a lot of time and money over having them done at a salon.  </li>
            <li> but I set it up 3 times which 30 sec, but still did not dry, terrible, never buy again from this seller, Be Ware!!!</li>
            <li> This LED nail lamp is horrible.  </li>

            <li> Love not having to go pay $40 to get a gel manicure any more! It does take some time to get used to doing on your own nail... (not getting the foundation or top coat on your skin) But once you get used to it the light works great.&lt;br /&gt;I did think it didn&#x27;t work when I first got it because it was sticky, but my GF taught me the trick of after you dry the top coat, take a cotton ball and rubbing alcohol and rub each nail gently and it take the stick away!&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend this light.&lt;br /&gt;Smaller lights would work as well but I like being able to dry one whole hand at a time!</li>

I have since purchased a different brand light and it works well, so it was not a problem of how heavy the gel was applied to the nail.  It was the light not working correctly.  I returned this product.</li>
            <li> This LED nail lamp is horrible.  It takes 5-6 minutes per coat, and that is just for light colors.  Dark colors I gave up on.  Definitely beware.</li>
            <li> Perfect for doing gel nails at home!</li>
            <li> It was pictured with a USA plug in and was shipped  to us with a Europe or China plug.  I bought an adapter and it still wouldn&#x27;t work and waisted 20 more dollars in that !</li>
            <li> Great drier.  I used a UV lamp for about 6 months and it took so long it wasn&#x27;t worth using the Gelish polish.  This reduces drying time by more than half.  It is well made, easy to use and does the job very well.  I highly recommend it for Gel polish.</li>
            <li> This lamp is not worth the plastic it is made of.  I am a professional nail technician and the lamps you buy at Wal-Mart work better,  Caused me to lose clients because the lamp would not dry their nails.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Bought this to use with my gelish polish.  It needed 5-10 minutes to cure each layer.  Splurge and buy the gelish led light...it works like it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
            <li> I have used this nail dryer for almost a year. I had great results for the first several months. My first dryer was a UV CND dryer so this one was much faster. The past couple of months however my manicures have only been lasting one week. I thought maybe it was hand sanitizers I use at work, but despite resorting to soap and water the manicures would not last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently invested in the OPI nail dryer and if you are going to get a new dryer I would recommend spending more and getting the OPI. My manicures with the OPI dryer have lasted over 2 weeks and I&#x27;m no longer avoiding hand sanitizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If price is an issue, this one is decent and you may get some good manicures as well.</li>
            <li> I got this light as a birthday present to use with my Gelish polish and i love it! It&#x27;s so much faster than the little light i was using. It cures really well and it doesn&#x27;t get hot. Its more than big enough to put all 5 fingers in at once, even if you have big hands. I used it to do my husbands toe nails and he got all 5 toes in with no problem and he&#x27;s a size 11 foot! lol The pre-set time settings are really helpful, especially if you&#x27;re using Gelish. I don&#x27;t have to use the timer on my phone anymore. It turns on when you put your hand in too so you don&#x27;t have to turn it on and off, although you can do that with it too on the other setting. I highly recommend this light! The same light at the beauty supply store was about $50 more! Great light!</li>
            <li> I have just now tried to use it and it doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;d like to return it What more can I say when it doesn&#x27;t work  !!!!</li>
            <li> I recently started doing gel polish myself. This is a very good quality led light dryer. And the Amazon price was the best on the web.It is simple to use and easy to store on a shelf when not in use. Also,I really love the nail nipper seller send to me!</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing. I ordered this and OPI gel color nail polish... my manicure is perfect! It looks exactly like what I would have paid $40 in a salon for! It was delivered on time, which is a plus. It has a sensor so the light cuts on when you stick your hand in, which is a wonderful convenience. I would DEF recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have only used this a handful of times but it works exactly as it is intended.  In fact, it works better than Nailuv&#x27;s little red LED lamp/dryer for a similar price.  The self timer with 3 settings makes a huge difference and my life a lot easier.</li>
            <li> I was spending $40 every 2 weeks at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;Decided to use my amazon gift card and buy this lamp along with Harmony Gelish nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am soooooo happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This light is so user friendly and fast.&lt;br /&gt;Foundation 10 seconds&lt;br /&gt;Polish 20 seconds&lt;br /&gt;top coat 30 seconds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and I&#x27;m done with shiney beautiful nails just like in a salon!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read another review that it was taking too long to dry.  That person must be using the wrong polish or maybe has a defective unit because if you&#x27;re doing it right you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this unit is that the electric cord is too short.  Would have been nice to have a longer cord.</li>
            <li> As expected, this one does cure my LED gel polish about twice as fast as my portable one did.  Of course, it is also twice the price.  1. For base and top coats one can even cure both hands at once in it.  2. I really like the way you can set the timer for 10, 20 or 30 seconds, and that it turns on automatically when you put your hands in it. (If you take one hand out and put the other in too fast, the sensor will not trigger and the light won&#x27;t come on - just wait about 2-3 seconds and the sensor will reset.)  3. The opening is large enough to comfortably do your toes (but you can only do one foot at a time  :)  4. I touched the bulbs with the tops of uncured toe nails a few times - just let the light cure the polish on the bulbs and then wipe of with soft paper towel with alcohol on it - came right off (if you don&#x27;t let it cure, it just smears and is more difficult to remove)  Although pricey, after a few uses, you will save a lot of time and money over having them done at a salon.  Updated 6/5/2015 - Going on two years usage, and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> This light is worth the money.  It does its job.  I have had NO problems with this.  My gel polish stays on for 2-3 wks.  I also like this light because its LED.  LED wont cause the wrinkles to appear on your hands.  If we have beautiful nails we also have to have beautiful hands.</li>
            <li> Its said for 20 sec dry but I set it up 3 times which 30 sec, but still did not dry, terrible, never buy again from this seller, Be Ware!!!</li>
            <li> Mine already crapped out. 35,000 hours my butt. Maybe it&#x27;s best to splurge on the decent opi one. btw, I&#x27;m a professional.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lamp about six times now and have had no problems...except that sometimes the auto light doesn&#x27;t come on automatically and I have to hit the button, but its no big deal.</li>
            <li> I purchased two led lights 6 months ago and was working ok in the beginning although the thumbs weren&#x27;t curing correctly. Then within 10 uses the gel polish just peels off right after doing it(even on acrylic nails which is almost impossible to do). I purchased these because they said the bulbs last a lot longer than the uv bulbs. Not worth it cause it cost more and didn&#x27;t last nowhere as long as what it&#x27;s suppose to last. Also wasted my time on having to fix my clients nails for free.</li>
