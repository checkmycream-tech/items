            <li>Best moisterizing cream I have tried for Dry Diabetic feet.</li>
            <li>this is the best cream i ever found to date i have a very dry skin and</li>
            <li>but this does a great job of keeping my feet soft</li>
            <li>We really like the neosporine cream, but I think this is about as good and a bit lighter.</li>
            <li>But if you ask me if my feet are better - absolutely!!.  </li>

            <li>Now my hands are soft &amp; smooth as a baby&#x27;s ass!</li>
            <li>and I was right.</li>
            <li>Diabetiderm is much more expensive but also much more effective.</li>
            <li>SHIPPING WAS VERY FAST.</li>
            <li>And, its sold in my local Kaiser pharmacy, so must have some medicinal value and safe for diabetics.</li>
            <li>The cream works very well when applied twice a day!</li>
            <li>I figured if this worked on diabetics with their circulation issues, this would be a good heavy duty cream</li>
            <li>Any product for diabetes treatment seems to be far superior to the other creams that just seem to sit at the surface.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it helped her with her very cracked heals and maybe help her neurapathy.</li>
            <li>My mom is very picky</li>
            <li>While not all the callus has disappeared, my feet are so much smoother.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really helps my feet and hands to stay healed but also helps with the chaffed skin and rashes I get on my legs and thighs sometimes as well as the eczema on my arms.</li>
            <li>As soon as I started using this, my feet got much softer.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing and not greasy.</li>
            <li>Anastasia&lt;br /&gt;Diabetic cream and much cheaper,&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am honestly not seeing much difference using it on one leg/foot and regular super moisturizing on the other, but it does go on very nicely and isn&#x27;t greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how quickly it &amp;#34;seals&amp;#34; dry cracked</li>
            <li>After putting it on the first night and then sleeping with cosmetic gloves on, the next morning there was visible improvement.  </li>
            <li>I gave this to my mom early for Christmas.</li>
            <li>but the results are noticeable as far as itch and pain</li>
            <li>My diabetic uses it frequently.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m  a diabetic and my feet get so dry and cracked.  </li>
            <li> I do recommend you give this a try for dry, rough cracked hands, heals and feet or just for preventing those problems.</li>
            <li> It had healed my rough chapped, sore hands.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers seemed to like it</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as other brands.</li>
            <li> Would recommend other to purchase.</li>
            <li> Winter can be rough on our feet,and I looked for a product that would help ease some of that trouble.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried everything, but nothing works, or at least not for very long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of lotions before with little long-lasting results.</li>
            <li> The lotion works for dry skin, but scent much to heavy for allergies!!</li>
            <li> but because Walgreens is down the street!</li>
            <li> The cracks are very painful and hurt even more if tomato juice or onion or dishwashing soap gets on them.  </li>
            <li> Diabetics usually have trouble with their feet and this product helps with the dryness.</li>
            <li> I can forsee continued use of this product versus products used in the past.</li>
            <li> However, I found it to be no better than Eucerin Intensive Repair.</li>
            <li> I do not understand how come this is so hard to find in the stores...</li>
            <li> ITS HARD TO FIND.</li>
            <li> Keeps the skin from cracking if poor circulation is a problem from any cause.</li>
            <li> BUT I must have received an old tube  because the smell was terrible.  </li>
            <li> the terrible smell it has</li>

            <li> My husband is a diabetic and has been suffering with cracks on the tips of his fingers for over a year.  We&#x27;ve tried everything, but nothing works, or at least not for very long.  The cracks are very painful and hurt even more if tomato juice or onion or dishwashing soap gets on them.  A friend of ours gave us a box of this Diabetic skin care cream and boy did it have an effect!!  After putting it on the first night and then sleeping with cosmetic gloves on, the next morning there was visible improvement.  Using the cream every night with the gloves (keeps the cream in place and helps soften the hands) for a week took almost all of the cracks away.  This is a great product and I&#x27;d recommend that everyone try it.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!  I only got this for a night treatment on my feet to keep moist through night time.  I don&#x27;t have diabetes or problems with my feet just wanted moisture.</li>
            <li> I am not a diabetic, but I use it on my feet.  I think it does help my skin.</li>
            <li> Diabetiderm is much more expensive but also much more effective. Going back to my trusted product.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my mom early for Christmas. I was hoping it helped her with her very cracked heals and maybe help her neurapathy. She didn&#x27;t like it at all. She said her feet started burning when she put it on and it was greasy, didn&#x27;t soak in. Other reviewers seemed to like it but it didn&#x27;t work for my mom. My mom is very picky so maybe she just didn&#x27;t use it long enough to work.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream before and it is very good for dryness on legs, feet and toes.  I ordered 2 of them and both of them have a short expiration date.  In fact the cream I had bought before has a longer expiration date than what I got from you.  Dissappointed!</li>
            <li> I use this cream on my face and will always keep some in my house. I like to experiment with different face creams and peels and sometimes it turns out in disaster... I have had severe chemical burns and Neoteric diabetic advanced cream has always healed my skin and brought it back looking good</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks but the results are noticeable as far as itch and pain relief.&lt;br /&gt;Healing properties are also noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;As time goes on I can forsee continued use of this product versus products used in the past.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisture cream for anyone. not just for diabetics.Keeps the skin from cracking if poor circulation is a problem from any cause.</li>
            <li> Winter can be rough on our feet,and I looked for a product that would help ease some of that trouble. This product works well. It isn&#x27;t greasy,and after my shower,I dry my feet and then slather on this stuff. I think I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of lotions before with little long-lasting results.I have used the cream on my feet now, one a day for 2 weeks  and have seen a notable difference. While not all the callus has disappeared, my feet are so much smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> This is a good product and it works well. Would recommend this product to others that were looking for good lotion.</li>
            <li> The cream is very nice and smoothing but the smell....well I have copd and can&#x27;t handle any smell of anything so I tossed it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the healing part (but maybe, even better) but I can feel the relief when this lotion is applied.  And, its sold in my local Kaiser pharmacy, so must have some medicinal value and safe for diabetics.</li>
            <li> I am a diabetic and have used this product regularly for several years now.  Really helps my feet and hands to stay healed but also helps with the chaffed skin and rashes I get on my legs and thighs sometimes as well as the eczema on my arms. I am prone to yeast infections under my arms and between my legs.  I like it&#x27;s soothing relief whereever I happen to get a yeast outbreak. It is well worth the money.[[ASIN:B000P3NG7Q DIABETIC ADV HEALING CREAM Size: 4 OZ]]</li>
            <li> We really like the neosporine cream, but I think this is about as good and a bit lighter.We will probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as other brands.</li>
            <li> I do not understand how come this is so hard to find in the stores...but it is great we can get it from Amazon.  It is just about the only cream the wife uses.</li>
            <li> The cream worked as well to heal cracked and dry skin.  It was worth the price!</li>
            <li> very  good  helps to heal cracked skin. My diabetic uses it frequently.  He generally puts it on at bedtime along with his diabetic socks</li>
            <li> Pretty good product, not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Especially effective on dry, cracked skin in the tender regions.</li>
            <li> My wife and I got this for my Step Daughter in FL who is Diabetic along with the cook books.</li>
            <li> THIS LOTION MAKES YOUR SKIN FEEL SO GOOD. HAS EXTRA OXYGEN IN IT. GOES ON SMOOTH AND IS JUST A BIT TACKY FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES BUT DOING THE JOB I BOUGHT IT FOR. SHIPPING WAS VERY FAST. I WAS GLAD. STOCKED UP ON THIS.  ITS HARD TO FIND.</li>
            <li> Having been using for a number of years and works well for a diabetic.  Excellent moisterizer and helps with tingling in feet.  Would recommend other to purchase.</li>
            <li> Have used it ,had the 2nd order, i like it , no odor,good result wish i could get discount on this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  a diabetic and my feet get so dry and cracked.  As soon as I started using this, my feet got much softer.  I use it once a day and am so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> It does the job!!!!!!!!!!  BUT I must have received an old tube  because the smell was terrible.  You know if you have hand cream lying around you haven&#x27;t used in a while and then you go to use it and the terrible smell it has - that was it !!  But if you ask me if my feet are better - absolutely!!.  Here is another tip - if you go to Walgreens or Walmart etc you will find a similar cream that costs about $10 and you get more product.  So lesson learned - I am not buying this product again but not because it doesn&#x27;t work but because Walgreens is down the street!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, exactly what we were looking for and the price is right!</li>
            <li> Very good stuff leaves feet soft and smooth</li>
            <li> The lotion works for dry skin, but scent much to heavy for allergies!!</li>
            <li> Very good product for hands, feet, elbows and arms. Very soothing and not greasy. this is the second tube I have bought for my husband and myself. Any product for diabetes treatment seems to be far superior to the other creams that just seem to sit at the surface. I do recommend you give this a try for dry, rough cracked hands, heals and feet or just for preventing those problems.</li>
            <li> Yes, this cream is effective. It is thick and rich and moisturizers well. However, I found it to be no better than Eucerin Intensive Repair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I can&#x27;t believe how quickly it &amp;#34;seals&amp;#34; dry cracked</li>
            <li> I am honestly not seeing much difference using it on one leg/foot and regular super moisturizing on the other, but it does go on very nicely and isn&#x27;t greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have bought several tubes.  I am not diabetic but this does a great job of keeping my feet soft and I sometimes use it on my legs, hands and chest.  I see immediate results.  I figured if this worked on diabetics with their circulation issues, this would be a good heavy duty cream and I was right.</li>
            <li> Helps with diabetic splotches on legs&lt;br /&gt;and feet almost as great as Anastasia&lt;br /&gt;Diabetic cream and much cheaper,&lt;br /&gt;but I keep both on hand.  Whatever works&lt;br /&gt;that day is great.</li>
            <li> It had healed my rough chapped, sore hands. they&#x27;ve been scrapped &amp; scratched. everything&#x27;s healed! Now my hands are soft &amp; smooth as a baby&#x27;s ass! I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Good cream, works great for dry feet.  Diabetics usually have trouble with their feet and this product helps with the dryness.</li>
            <li> this is the best cream i ever found to date i have a very dry skin and yhius is the only obe thatworked</li>
            <li> I bought it for my dad. He would like to use it.</li>
            <li> The cream works very well when applied twice a day!</li>
            <li> Best cream out there for dry, cracked skin</li>
            <li> Best moisterizing cream I have tried for Dry Diabetic feet. Works great on legs and hads as well. My duaghter who is a beautician tried it on her hands and arms and said it was the best she has ever used.</li>
