            <li>I LOVE THIS SOAP</li>
            <li>This soap smells great and it is very orange</li>

            <li>ENJOY</li>
            <li>help with red marks on my face and neck,lightes them up and cleans my skin and smells great son gets pimples after football keeps his clean and free of them</li>
            <li>I think my skin,always healthy and clear,looks firmer and more vibrant.</li>
            <li>This soap made my skin clear, bright and clean.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping well packed and most important it really works!!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s rich lather and the squeeky clean feeling of my skin once rinsed.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face/skin super clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin squeaky clean and thoroughly removes make up</li>
            <li>I want to be :) The soap also lasts and doesn&#x27;t melt so fast in water.</li>
            <li>and unfortunately it is true.  </li>
            <li>My nephew loved it so much that I had to purchase several more bars to keep on hand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m biracial, white and black, and black skin tends to scar and keloid very easily, which mine does, but that rarely happens with fair skinned people, so maybe it&#x27;s a better product for people who are more fair.</li>
            <li>Soap is nice and does overall makes me feel clean.</li>
            <li>This is a great soap for evening skin tone although a little drying to my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the hunt though.</li>
            <li>useful information</li>
            <li>I use it everyday (even on my face) and my skin feels so clean and smooth, its amazing.</li>
            <li>OR EVEN AFTER YOU EXFOLIATE, OR SCRUB USE THEN TOO PORES ARE OPEN BETTER, JUST USE A RICH FACE LOTION.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the smell is very strong and it left an orange residue in my shower.  </li>
            <li>Try the black and white cream in conjunction, it&#x27;s an awesome fade cream.</li>
            <li>I help get rid of dark spots and it smell good.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this soap and the fact that&#x27;s it gentle as I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I feel very clean after using it and it does not dry your skin out.</li>
            <li>Although suggested as a facial soap I love using it in the shower,too.</li>
            <li>I am now an avid consumer of the product.</li>
            <li>i have tried everything; Proactive, clean and clear, Skin id, OXY wash, neutrogena, birth control, tretinoin, benzoyl peroxide, and A LOT of anti inflammatory pills.</li>
            <li>Tried this because of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Make sure you moisturize with a lightening lotion because this soap will leave skin dry.</li>
            <li>I actually received it once with another purchase, it was free.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed much improvement on my skin.</li>
            <li>Also its very affordable.</li>
            <li>I USE IT FOR MY WHOLE BODY, AND IT MAKE UR COMPLEXION EVEN</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the smell of the soap</li>
            <li>and it really hasn&#x27;t seem do improve my complexion any.</li>
            <li>, IT REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li>This product lives up to its name delivering flawless results that people instantly saw and commented on I wish I could find a larger tube and possible a lotion, I totally swear by this bleaching.</li>
            <li>It works, it really does....can&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the smell of this soap and the lather from it was extreme.</li>
            <li>Black and white soap is really good for women of color as it helps to even your skin tone out</li>
            <li>Black and white soap is a good product.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and new!</li>
            <li>It seems to be in stock in more predominantly African American areas.  </li>
            <li>It has been difficult to find though - Walmart has them for a great price.</li>
            <li>and I live the scent.</li>
            <li>only  been  2 week see a little different , but soap make your  skin feel  good</li>
            <li>Natural is the way to go!</li>
            <li>This would not ordinarily make me want to try a product</li>
            <li>/&gt;It may be one of those products that only work well on certain types of skin.  </li>
            <li>If your skin is relatively clear, but you want to lighten some scarring, this may work.  </li>
            <li>People always compliment me on how clear my complexion looks now.</li>
            <li>It leaves you skin soft and erases brown spots.</li>
            <li>Both myself and my 17 year old son use this.</li>
            <li>I developed body acne after my son was born and this soap helped even out the scarring.  </li>
            <li>52 YEARS OLD</li>
            <li>The old faded ones are almost gone.</li>
            <li>I would say about 15% are completely gone and</li>
            <li>While the product is exactly what I wanted and works as I expect it to, it arrived several says later than I was told.</li>
            <li>but it seemed  so exceedingly odd to me that a philosopher-prophet would suggest one brand of soap above all others available.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many products over the years, certainly more expensive and now my main beauty products are this soaps that cost less than $3 a bar and an all natural facial moisturizer made by hand - by an independent distributor.</li>
            <li>GREAT SOAP, BUT STAINS TOWELS BADLY.</li>
            <li>also have some pock mark looking scars on my back that, thankfully, are not due to acne</li>
            <li>when i first started using black and white soap</li>
            <li>at first when i used black and white soap, my face was really dry</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This soap is amazing. It cleared my skin and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> its a good product..works well</li>
            <li> help with red marks on my face and neck,lightes them up and cleans my skin and smells great son gets pimples after football keeps his clean and free of them</li>
            <li> My 14 year old son had really bad acne and I tried everything (Proactive, Acne Free, dermatologist, minocycline 100, tretinoin cream .05%). My daughter who is 27 had bad acne too growing up. But I never had acne problems when I was a teenager. I remember my mom had us girls wash our face with this soap. So I googled it and found it on Amazon. My son started washing his face with it  and we saw immediate results. I wished I had taken a before and after picture. This soap has became our family soap. I has a awesome clean smell that stays with you all day long.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this particular soap - however I have used the Black Soap and the Cocoa and Shea Butter soap by the same company. I&#x27;d have to say they are exceptional, so I&#x27;m sure this skin soap is as well. I use one on my face and the other on my entire body. It has been difficult to find though - Walmart has them for a great price. I&#x27;m on their email alert as to when it comes in stock and then its only a few bars. Not every Walmart carries it. It seems to be in stock in more predominantly African American areas.  It&#x27;s well worth the hunt though. I&#x27;ve used many products over the years, certainly more expensive and now my main beauty products are this soaps that cost less than $3 a bar and an all natural facial moisturizer made by hand - by an independent distributor. Natural is the way to go! It shows on my face as I get MANY compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> I think this product helps reduce my sun spots when I am diligent and use it 2 x daily.</li>
            <li> GREAT SOAP, BUT STAINS TOWELS BADLY.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and new! Thank You</li>
            <li> This soap is great, really removes all of my makeup and has helped with my disgusting acne. Dries out your face a lot in the first week, after that it&#x27;s great. After I wash I use eminence bright skin moisturizer which also faded acne spots. These 2 combined is awesome!</li>
            <li> I heard about this product in a roundabout way;it was recommended by a friend&#x27;s father who learned about it from the Edgar Cayce Foundation.This would not ordinarily make me want to try a product but it seemed  so exceedingly odd to me that a philosopher-prophet would suggest one brand of soap above all others available.Curiousity made me buy it.    1st surprise:it is the color of salmon    2nd surprise:I loved it&#x27;s rich lather and the squeeky clean feeling of my skin once rinsed.I think my skin,always healthy and clear,looks firmer and more vibrant.Although suggested as a facial soap I love using it in the shower,too.</li>
            <li> My mom use to use this product and my gradmother used to use this product. Now I can see why. It leaves you skin soft and erases brown spots.</li>
            <li> I really love this soap! In my 3rd bar now.....Leaves my face/skin super clean and smooth. It also smells so great!</li>
            <li> It is a good product and help me a lot. I used this product with a black and white bleach</li>
            <li> I help get rid of dark spots and it smell good. My family love it. Just hard to find in local stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for only about a month and it has almost cleared out my blemishes.  Leaves skin squeaky clean and thoroughly removes make up</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I&#x27;ve used the B&amp;W cream before on my elbows because they were really dark and it lightened them in 3 days. So I decided to give the soap a try because I&#x27;d figured it would work even faster and I absolutely love it. I use it everyday (even on my face) and my skin feels so clean and smooth, its amazing. I wanted it so I could even out my skin tone (two toned, med brown/light brown) and my complexion has also gotten clearer and brighter. I&#x27;m turning the light brown comp. I want to be :) The soap also lasts and doesn&#x27;t melt so fast in water. Would definitely purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. : I use the B&amp;W skin cream with the soap to increase results</li>
            <li> this is my Favorite soap I had so many Problems with my face but now it is alomst gone since I have used this product. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! I actually received it once with another purchase, it was free. I was skeptical using it but once I did I absolutely loved it. I love the smell and it doesn&#x27;t leave a film on your skin like many soaps do. I ordred more right away!</li>
            <li> In love with this soap. Both myself and my 17 year old son use this. It controls break outs on his face and helps to even out my skin tone. Expensive but worth the price and I live the scent. I feel very clean after using it and it does not dry your skin out. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I have previous reviews that mention the odor of the soap and unfortunately it is true.  It does eventually go away though.  I have not noticed much improvement on my skin.</li>
            <li> While the product is exactly what I wanted and works as I expect it to, it arrived several says later than I was told. I alos had to pay an additional 36 cents in postage due!!</li>
            <li> This product may help in lightening scars, but for someone like me, who has acne, this soap just doesn&#x27;t do anything productive.  I get more acne than there&#x27;s time to fade a spot.  If your skin is relatively clear, but you want to lighten some scarring, this may work.  I wouldn&#x27;t know.  But if you have an acne problem, you&#x27;ll just keep getting more spots that aren&#x27;t clearing with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have some pock mark looking scars on my back that, thankfully, are not due to acne and I&#x27;ve tried using this soap on those scars, too, hoping to lighten them some, but I haven&#x27;t seen any result for that either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be one of those products that only work well on certain types of skin.  I&#x27;m biracial, white and black, and black skin tends to scar and keloid very easily, which mine does, but that rarely happens with fair skinned people, so maybe it&#x27;s a better product for people who are more fair.</li>
            <li> Black and white soap is really good for women of color as it helps to even your skin tone out</li>
            <li> only  been  2 week see a little different , but soap make your  skin feel  good</li>
            <li> Tried this because of the positive reviews. Soap is nice and does overall makes me feel clean. Also its very affordable.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell of this soap and the lather from it was extreme. I am now an avid consumer of the product. Try the black and white cream in conjunction, it&#x27;s an awesome fade cream.</li>
            <li> I am Indian and didnt work for my skin type</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SOAP IT CLEANS UR SKIN ALL SO WELL IT GETS ALL THE DIRT OUT OF UR SKIN. I USE IT FOR MY WHOLE BODY, AND IT MAKE UR COMPLEXION EVEN</li>
            <li> i love this soap it evens out skin tone!!!!</li>
            <li> This soap made my skin clear, bright and clean. People always compliment me on how clear my complexion looks now. This soap smells great and it is very orange and it last one month. However, this soap will leave orange residue and dirt soap suds in tub. Make sure you moisturize with a lightening lotion because this soap will leave skin dry.</li>
            <li> This is a great soap for evening skin tone although a little drying to my skin.  I developed body acne after my son was born and this soap helped even out the scarring.  I&#x27;ve used it for years off and on and will continue using.</li>
            <li> Great soap to use for cleansing the skin!</li>
            <li> I just started using it</li>
            <li> I use this every now and then. I don&#x27;t really like the smell of the soap and it really hasn&#x27;t seem do improve my complexion any.</li>
            <li> REALLY Nice PRODUCT! Works GREAT !</li>
            <li> 52 YEARS OLD,  I  STARTED GETTING AGE SPOTS, EVEN ON MY HANDS, IT REALLY WORKS. USE EVERY DAY ONLY ON HANDS, FACE. LEAVE SET A FEW MINS, RINSE. OR EVEN AFTER YOU EXFOLIATE, OR SCRUB USE THEN TOO PORES ARE OPEN BETTER, JUST USE A RICH FACE LOTION. YOUR SKIN WILL DRY. REMEMBER THICK IN WINTER,THIN IN SUMMER. 100% TAKES AWAY AGE SPOTS , ONCE THEY START TO DISAPPEAR USES EVERY OTHER DAY.I ALSO USE BLEACHING CREAM AFTER WARDS. GREAT TRY FOR 6 MONTHS EVERYONES SKIN TAKES LONGER OR SOONER. ENJOY</li>
            <li> Used as explained and still was ineffective after long-term use. Waste of money. Would not buy again and would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this soap and the fact that&#x27;s it gentle as I have extremely sensitive skin. It keeps my acne away and I can use it as often as two to three times a day.</li>
            <li> I have used this product since the 1960s. Black and white soap is a good product. My nephew loved it so much that I had to purchase several more bars to keep on hand.</li>
            <li> This product lives up to its name delivering flawless results that people instantly saw and commented on I wish I could find a larger tube and possible a lotion, I totally swear by this bleaching.</li>
            <li> I use this with the Black and White Fade/Bleach cream. I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference. Let me start by saying, the I&#x27;m confident that the soap by itself hasn&#x27;t faded any of my dozens of acne scars but as a cleanser, this soap is amazing. I have a combination of dry and oily skin and I breakout a lot. Not only has my acne cleared up but my face feels smoothed and evenly moisturized. However, the soap did stain my white towels slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now with the cream, I&#x27;ve noticed that my acne scars are slowly disappearing. The old faded ones are almost gone. The really dark ones may start to visibly start fading in a few months with consistent use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Possibly useful information: I have dark brown skin with over a hundred black acne scars over my face and chest. I would say about 15% are completely gone and 30% are visibly fading after about 2-3 weeks. I wash my face with the soap twice a day and then apply the cream.  On the tough and really dark marks, I put a little extra cream but I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think both products should go together.</li>
            <li> The soap works as soap - it cleans.  Otherwise, the smell is very strong and it left an orange residue in my shower.  It didn&#x27;t fade anything on my body.  If you need soap, just buy regular soap.</li>
            <li> when i first started using black and white soap i wasnt sure if it would work for me. i have had acne since i was 10, seven years later i got tired of it. i have tried everything; Proactive, clean and clear, Skin id, OXY wash, neutrogena, birth control, tretinoin, benzoyl peroxide, and A LOT of anti inflammatory pills. and most of it was prescribed by a doctor. at first when i used black and white soap, my face was really dry i started using lotion a lot and carried it with me everywhere. after almost a month the dry skin stopped and my acne slowly went away. i am VERY happy with the results :) it takes awhile to work but it works. :)</li>
            <li> It works, it really does....can&#x27;t wait to see my ew hue👍</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping well packed and most important it really works!!! Using this soap with there creams removed brown spots my Dr couldn&#x27;t make go away</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Repeat buyer. Perfect for spots.</li>
            <li> It works great for my son, clear his face up.</li>
