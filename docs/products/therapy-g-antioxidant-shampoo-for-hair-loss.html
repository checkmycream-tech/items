    <ol>
            <li>THIS is the BEST Shampoo I&#x27;ve EVER Used&#x3D;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best smelling shampoo I&#x27;ve ever had, and it does make my scalp tingle a bit with the mint part of it.</li>
            <li>some research and Therapy g seemed like it had the best results for thinning hair.</li>
            <li>One of the best for the price.</li>
            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo adds a lot of volume to hair.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m happy to submit my daughter&#x27;s email to me with her opinion):  </li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves you with a tingling sensation.</li>
            <li>LOVE I!!</li>
            <li>For wife, she said it was good for her dandruff.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for colored hair.  </li>
            <li>and I love for my hair products to smell great.</li>
            <li>This product feels great on the scalp, smells great and produces earth-shattering lather with a hearty tingle that is chock full of anti-oxidant goodness.</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>Fabulous!!</li>
            <li>The best of all the shampoos I&#x27;ve tried for thinning hair and at a much lower price point.</li>
            <li>Kind of feels thicker.  </li>
            <li>I love the lather and the tingle</li>
            <li>I use it with the conditioner and my hair has never looked more healthy and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I guess I will have to spend a ton more money on something else in order to get that.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting any more and didn&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li>It is more of a gel than a liquid and tingles on your scalp.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say much more than that yet</li>
            <li>The minty smell and refreshing tingle are fantastic and after 5 weeks of use, I&#x27;m happy to report positive results.</li>
            <li>Great clean smelling shampoo that leaves your hair very soft and clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>I do believe it is stimulating new growth, however, the most important part to me is that it makes my very fine hair more manageable and easier to style.  </li>
            <li>which for me is always a huge problem in the winter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous amounts of products and even joined the hair club (which worked great for me</li>
            <li>but this product works AMAZING and is very affordable.  </li>
            <li>This product is worth the money !</li>
            <li>The best part, which is what I bought it for is that I suffer from excessive sebum on the scalp.</li>
            <li>It seems to clean well.  </li>
            <li>It gave my hair a rich, full look.  </li>
            <li>It feels like it cleans your hair and scalp quite well and leaves what hair you might have full bodied.  </li>
            <li>Very fast delivery delivery from seller!</li>
            <li>it is a good clarifyer and can dry the hair.  </li>
            <li>I alternate this with Enjoy Sulfate-Free Shampoo and Conditioner (also gentle, also suitable for fine or thinning hair).</li>
            <li>but it appears that...perhaps...the thinnest part of my crown may be showing signs of precious, fresh new growth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and honestly can&#x27;t tell a difference in my actual hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found Therapy G via a basic Google search!</li>
            <li>and I am still on my first bottle (and I wash my hair every day).  </li>
            <li>(similar to head and shoulders tingling) :)</li>
            <li>I REALLY like this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>Thanks again for sending it!</li>
            <li>Therapy-G is ok not the same as Nioxin.</li>
            <li>and I am ordering 2 more bottles, though I still have quite a bit left.</li>
            <li>It rinses clean and leaves my hair with more body than any other shampoo I have used.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the money - I had thin hair after my daughter was born - and this has seemed to have helped; because it was becoming obvious that my hair was becoming very fine.</li>
            <li>I kept running my hands through my hair for the first few days because I couldn&#x27;t believe how nice it felt.</li>
            <li>Really does help.</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I am ordering a bottle to send to my daughter.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>made my hands and arms very hairy</li>
            <li>My hair responded very well to this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I mean as a hair treatment, all I know, is that it feels great so far.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so clean and definitely adds volume to my hair, I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>I have long straight, fine hair</li>
            <li>Highly recommend trying this product out if you&#x27;re experiencing hair loss.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made this my new shampoo, Highly recommended</li>
            <li>but I know it feels great and much like chicken soup - it couldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>I am still only working on my first bottle</li>
            <li>Saw a lot more of my hair washed away than previous regular shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The smell is strong but doesn&#x27;t linger - only down</li>
            <li>I noticed new growth instantly and now</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I noticed new growth instantly and now</li>
            <li> My hair has stayed styled and full-looking all day without falling flat mid-afternoon.  </li>
            <li> Only use it twice a week seems to dry my scalp  and causing me to itch</li>
            <li> Combined with the follicle stimulator and the conditioning treatment, it seems to have at least stopped my hair loss,&lt;br /&gt;which is the whole point.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband with fine and thinning hair and it completely dried out his hair and scalp, his hair has never looked worse.  </li>
            <li> And, it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but after a month or so, my hair was growing back stronger and thicker!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had thin, limp hair all my life and when stressed, it tends to thin, which freaks me out even more.</li>
            <li> It is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how long it will take to get results.</li>
            <li> I also like the slight tingle.  </li>
            <li> The follicle stimulator burns a little bit, makes your face &amp; ears flush and elevates your temperature slightly for 10-15mins.</li>
            <li> Causes a little dryness.</li>
            <li> A little does a lot.  </li>
            <li> I have less falling out after a shower and hair seems thicker!</li>
            <li> No static either...</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with thinning hair for the past 4 years.  </li>
            <li> Menthol is the second ingredient and peppermint oil is also listed, both very irritating to the skin.  </li>
            <li> Hard to tell if my hair looks thicker.  </li>
            <li> but the cost is ridiculous</li>
            <li> He said it would run down his face and make his face numb!  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. :(</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry!!</li>

            <li> Really does help. The best of all the shampoos I&#x27;ve tried for thinning hair and at a much lower price point. I alternate this with Enjoy Sulfate-Free Shampoo and Conditioner (also gentle, also suitable for fine or thinning hair).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had thin, limp hair all my life and when stressed, it tends to thin, which freaks me out even more. I&#x27;m glad I found Therapy G via a basic Google search! The minty smell and refreshing tingle are fantastic and after 5 weeks of use, I&#x27;m happy to report positive results. The follicle stimulator burns a little bit, makes your face &amp; ears flush and elevates your temperature slightly for 10-15mins. That&#x27;s about the only &#x27;drawback&#x27; some may find. I myself don&#x27;t mind, as I&#x27;ve noticed an increase in hair volume and shine.</li>
            <li> Give it time...I had a lot of hair breakage and thinning after radiation treatments. My stylist recommended this line for improvement of hair regrowrh and thickening.  I was skeptical at first, but after a month or so, my hair was growing back stronger and thicker! It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of fragrance...and I love for my hair products to smell great. So, I just finish with a conditioner smelling of my favorites scents. I don&#x27;t use the shampoo every day...it is a good clarifyer and can dry the hair.  Throw it in the mix a couple times a week and it does the trick! And, it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I ordered this shampoo a couple of months ago and I am still on my first bottle (and I wash my hair every day).  I love the lather and the tingle it gives my scalp.  It rinses clean and leaves my hair with more body than any other shampoo I have used.  No static either...which for me is always a huge problem in the winter.  I use it with the conditioner and my hair has never looked more healthy and shiny.  I only wish they had a spray, leave in conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo adds a lot of volume to hair.</li>
            <li> I use this in addition to the conditioner treatment. It is well worth the money - I had thin hair after my daughter was born - and this has seemed to have helped; because it was becoming obvious that my hair was becoming very fine. This product is worth the money ! Use if you like minty smells; that have the tingling effect. (similar to head and shoulders tingling) :)</li>
            <li> I REALLY like this shampoo!  I do believe it is stimulating new growth, however, the most important part to me is that it makes my very fine hair more manageable and easier to style.  I like it so much that I am ordering a bottle to send to my daughter. Once she has had the opportunity to try it, I will write another review based on her findings.  (I&#x27;m happy to submit my daughter&#x27;s email to me with her opinion):  Hi Mom,  I got the shampoo yesterday. I love it.  My hair has stayed styled and full-looking all day without falling flat mid-afternoon.  Thanks again for sending it!</li>
            <li> I like the product, it cleans and refreshes my skull when I&#x27;m taking a shower. I recommend it, although I do not know if it works yet. I mean as a hair treatment, all I know, is that it feels great so far.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. :(</li>
            <li> This product feels great on the scalp, smells great and produces earth-shattering lather with a hearty tingle that is chock full of anti-oxidant goodness. I am still only working on my first bottle but it appears that...perhaps...the thinnest part of my crown may be showing signs of precious, fresh new growth. It may simply be an observation by a wishful eye (or the low lighting I use when checking) but I know it feels great and much like chicken soup - it couldn&#x27;t hurt. I shall write another review marking my further progress with this product as I intend to continue using it.    Stay tuned, kids...</li>
            <li> Love this product!  My hair feels so clean and definitely adds volume to my hair, I highly recommend it!  You will not be sorry!!</li>
            <li> THIS is the BEST Shampoo I&#x27;ve EVER Used&#x3D;My Hair Squeaks, even B4 Rinsing! Fabulous!! Don&#x27;t Need a Conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;Just LOVE I!!</li>
            <li> Irritated my scalp.  Left hair feeling greasy.  Did not like it at all.  Returned it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference AT ALL.It was just like a regular shampoo.I do not recommend using this shampoo if you want your hair to grow back.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband with fine and thinning hair and it completely dried out his hair and scalp, his hair has never looked worse.  He said it would run down his face and make his face numb!  After looking at the ingredients I can see why.  Menthol is the second ingredient and peppermint oil is also listed, both very irritating to the skin.  Stay away from this product!</li>
            <li> Very good product. Works very well. Causes a little dryness.</li>
            <li> Nioxin was sold and is now being manufactured in Mexico. The mixture has changed and doesn&#x27;t work as before.  Looking for replacement product.  Therapy-G is ok not the same as Nioxin.</li>
            <li> made my hands and arms very hairy</li>
            <li> After using it, I feel it has no differences with the one bought in $7. It is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Combined with the follicle stimulator and the conditioning treatment, it seems to have at least stopped my hair loss,&lt;br /&gt;which is the whole point.</li>
            <li> havent seen any growth or noticable differences but its does feel a bit healthier. could be in my head though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and honestly can&#x27;t tell a difference in my actual hair. It seems to make it a bit thicker if you don&#x27;t use conditioner, but I think I was hoping for it to somehow make my hair grow back. I guess I will have to spend a ton more money on something else in order to get that. I do ADORE the smell of this though. It&#x27;s the best smelling shampoo I&#x27;ve ever had, and it does make my scalp tingle a bit with the mint part of it. I just can&#x27;t tell a difference in my hair. :/</li>
            <li> My hair responded very well to this shampoo.  It gave my hair a rich, full look.  My Dad even noticed a difference in his hair once he started using it.</li>
            <li> I bought this and lasted 2 months for 2 people. I am ordering again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with thinning hair for the past 4 years.  I&#x27;ve tried numerous amounts of products and even joined the hair club (which worked great for me but the cost is ridiculous and I just couldn&#x27;t keep up with the payments) but this product works AMAZING and is very affordable.  I noticed new growth instantly and now the crown of my head is the thickest it&#x27;s been in 4 years.  Highly recommend trying this product out if you&#x27;re experiencing hair loss.</li>
            <li> It feels like it cleans your hair and scalp quite well and leaves what hair you might have full bodied.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting any more and didn&#x27;t get it. At the same time I&#x27;ve only been using it for several months.</li>
            <li> I like this product, although it doesn&#x27;t make my hair come back. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s getting thinner. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> After 65 years, I finally found a shampoo that actually makes my hair feel thicker. I have been using this for over a month and my hair is healthier and I believe my hair does not just feel thicker, but actually is thicker. I have long straight, fine hair and I am ordering 2 more bottles, though I still have quite a bit left. I am now going to check if there is a conditioner by the same name. Oh, and my husband uses it too.</li>
            <li> Great clean smelling shampoo that leaves your hair very soft and clean feeling.  I kept running my hands through my hair for the first few days because I couldn&#x27;t believe how nice it felt. I&#x27;ve made this my new shampoo, Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Hard to tell if my hair looks thicker.  Kind of feels thicker.  A little does a lot.  I also like the slight tingle.  Will stick with this instead of the more expensive Biota.</li>
            <li> I did some research and Therapy g seemed like it had the best results for thinning hair. It smells great and leaves you with a tingling sensation. Very fast delivery delivery from seller!</li>
            <li> Did not work for me but worked for wife though.  Saw a lot more of my hair washed away than previous regular shampoo.  For wife, she said it was good for her dandruff.  For me, felt too tingly for my preference.  Wife says she don&#x27;t feel tingliness of the shampoo.  2.5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for several months. It is more of a gel than a liquid and tingles on your scalp. The best part, which is what I bought it for is that I suffer from excessive sebum on the scalp. This shampoo removes the sebum without stripping the hair. One of the best for the price.</li>
            <li> Definitely will make your hair thicker. Only use it twice a week seems to dry my scalp  and causing me to itch</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 because I haven&#x27;t used it enough yet to know if it&#x27;s going to work.  I like the consistency.  It&#x27;s good for colored hair.  I like the tingly feeling I get from it.  It seems to clean well.  Can&#x27;t say much more than that yet because I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day so I&#x27;m not sure how long it will take to get results.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for about 2 months but I must say it is working! I have less falling out after a shower and hair seems thicker! The smell is strong but doesn&#x27;t linger - only down is I dont care for the mint smell.</li>
