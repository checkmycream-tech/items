    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been real happy with this set of clippers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best clipper I&#x27;ve found for trimming my beard and around the ears between hair cuts.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, it was one of the best investments I have ever made.  </li>
            <li>It works great!!!</li>
            <li>great since haircuts [...]</li>
            <li>great close shave.  </li>
            <li>Great Product</li>
            <li>cosmatology scool works good</li>
            <li>Mr. Peanut has some good qualities, BUT, he isn&#x27;t a clipper.</li>
            <li>So, if you needed a quick shave but didnt have the time, these are absolutely perfect.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Wahl Peanut Clipper to cut my husband&#x27;s hair and am very pleased with the quality of the product.</li>
            <li>It has a finer cut than the peanut (2 days old beard if you don&#x27;t use the dual foil head - which surprisingly works awesome!).</li>
            <li>and I paid $50 for my own.  </li>
            <li>(Wahl&#x27;s own site refers to this as a \\&quot;trimmer,\\&quot; not a clipper.)</li>
            <li>love that it&#x27;s a plug-in, which gives it good power for a compact gadget -</li>
            <li>Great for traveling, not as bulky as full shaver/clippers.  </li>
            <li>a good, full size clipper, if you intend to cut all your hair.</li>
            <li>it very light</li>
            <li>This has saved on too many barber trips</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>I love the size of this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Got much more options</li>
            <li>used it about 4 or 5 times already and love it.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Give me a number 2 on top and a number 1 1/2 on the sides.\\</li>
            <li>course, if it&#x27;s in your drawer you&#x27;ll probably trim more often rather than wait for your hair to grow in....</li>
            <li>After getting used to Peanut a bit more, now he&#x27;s OK using it when he has to, but he&#x27;s still looking for something else.</li>
            <li>Love its compact size &amp; easy cleaning blade (cause it just pops off).  </li>
            <li>Also nice for doing quick touch-ups on people with longer hair (e.g., your kid).</li>
            <li>And it would work fine for the top of the head too, I guess.</li>
            <li>clipper is a bit too wide for perfect beard-trimming, but it works just fine.</li>
            <li>These units are made great and will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li>Running off of A/C, it&#x27;s much more powerful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a more powerful motor and the peanut shape, but otherwise it&#x27;s identical.&lt;br</li>
            <li>use the #1 and #2 guides to neaten my hair, and you can use it without a guide to get a neat-but-unshaven look (which looks good with a shaved or nearly shaved head).</li>
            <li>Originally, My dad had one of these</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s a great little trimmer -- comfy to hold, easy to use, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>(I forgot the blade comes off until just now, so I&#x27;ll give that a try and see if that helps clean it out.</li>
            <li>It does a good job giving the back of his neck a close trim (without any of the guide</li>
            <li>Personally, I will have one of these for my entire life, they are simpy the best.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend paying the extra money for this great product.  </li>
            <li>These are great little clippers.</li>
            <li>but well worth the inconvenience.</li>
            <li>Quite and powerful.</li>
            <li>my old one I think is still better.</li>
            <li>This is not fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum: compact, powerful, but not a clipper.</li>
            <li>It was better than most clippers I had used, as far as strength, smooth clipping and small size.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still holding the first battery charge.</li>
            <li>Soon My First Set Lasted Me</li>
            <li>If it is really an issue (its not for me), then simply give the blade a quick dip in water, dry it, and your good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are also very easy to meanuever and are able to make those precise cuts in tough to reach spots that larger sized clippers cannot.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>The hair really clumped/stuck in there.</li>
            <li>, I guess there isn&#x27;t much insulation around the motor.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone interested in purchasing a new hand help clipper.</li>
            <li>Personally I feel like I shouldn&#x27;t have to take it apart to clean it,</li>
            <li>Had the older version.</li>
            <li>Very easy to hang on to &amp; get into small spaces.  </li>
            <li>I had a peanut for over 15 years and it still worked but decided to get a new one for a little more money just because my blade was worn and</li>
            <li>He got his years before I did and his still works like new.  </li>
            <li>his coarse beard, at first he didn&#x27;t think it was doing the job at all.</li>
            <li>Blades from the old one fits.</li>
            <li>I wanted something to use instead of razors and it did the job and my beard would look like 3 days old.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s my favourite so far.</li>
            <li>I like it so far, after a month or so of use.</li>
            <li>G Wahl Peanut Professional Clipper and Trimmer]]</li>
            <li>We purchased it to replace some clippers that were 10+ years old and had lots of attachments.</li>
            <li>I have taken other trimmers apart to really clean the blade and had problems getting them back together without a professional adjusting the blades &amp;</li>
            <li>Amazon sold it for less money then my local supplier, free shipping, and no tax.</li>

            <li> My haircuts have now figured out to be about a fraction of a fraction of a penny now that my haircuts have far outweighed the small cost of these clippers.</li>

            <li> I like this less than some of the other helpful reviewers, but I don&#x27;t dislike it enough to bother returning it.</li>
            <li> Previously, I had bought a few different trimmers at marshalls and wal mart,</li>
            <li> It fits the hand, stays sharp, and with the guides (included)</li>

            <li> We have had it for 2 years and use it every few months and it works as well as the day we bought it.</li>

            <li> It is not great giving my hub&#x27;s thick, curly/wavy hair a haircut.</li>
            <li> plan on using it 1-2 times per weak and hope that it doesn&#x27;t burn out.</li>

            <li> I use the #1 to shave my head, then take the guide off and trim up.  Great for traveling, not as bulky as full shaver/clippers.  I like its shape and size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is low maintenance and I do it myself...great since haircuts [...] nowadays for just a cut, sometimes you don&#x27;t even get the wash.  My haircuts have now figured out to be about a fraction of a fraction of a penny now that my haircuts have far outweighed the small cost of these clippers.</li>
            <li> I had a peanut for over 15 years and it still worked but decided to get a new one for a little more money just because my blade was worn and the blades were only a little less than a new one but the old unit was still working.These units are made great and will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> Barbers/Hair Stylists recommend and use it ,so I bought it. It fits the hand, stays sharp, and with the guides (included) my wife has learned to trim the back of my head. This has saved on too many barber trips and I look neat all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a good, full size clipper, if you intend to cut all your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been real happy with this set of clippers. Works much better than past sets I&#x27;ve purchased (I confess, I have only purchase the inexpensive ones) and cuts closer than past clippers I have purchased. Its cutting head is a bit small, that&#x27;s my only complaint - but well worth the inconvenience.</li>
            <li> Had the older version. Shorted out after (1) year. Trying this one. Works just as well, if not better. Blades from the old one fits.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve purchased, one for my home and this one for my vacation home. It&#x27;s the best clipper I&#x27;ve found for trimming my beard and around the ears between hair cuts. Quite and powerful. Amazon sold it for less money then my local supplier, free shipping, and no tax. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> I love the size of this trimmer.  I&#x27;m a hairstylist and use this for all my edging and around the ear trimming.  Very easy to hang on to &amp; get into small spaces.  It has nicked a client or two though, not sure what that is all about.  I used this on my Dad and he had to buy one as well.  Love its compact size &amp; easy cleaning blade (cause it just pops off).  I have taken other trimmers apart to really clean the blade and had problems getting them back together without a professional adjusting the blades &amp; they just never seemed the same after that.</li>
            <li> This was referred to me by my barber. It was better than most clippers I had used, as far as strength, smooth clipping and small size. I wanted something to use instead of razors and it did the job and my beard would look like 3 days old. That served the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several months it started to need a little hit to take off. I cleaned numerous times but still won&#x27;t torn on without hitting on it with my knuckle. Then started getting worse and wouldn&#x27;t run even if I slammed it, so I had to take the head off which left no pressure on the motor, then the motor would turn on, then I&#x27;d stick the head back on quickly and it&#x27;ll stay running (slowly) 80% of the time. Died. Close to $50 at that time. I would not recommend it. Maybe at $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I discovered this one: Wahl Trimmer All-In-One Lithium Ion. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 3 months as I am writing this review and it&#x27;s still holding the first battery charge. It has a finer cut than the peanut (2 days old beard if you don&#x27;t use the dual foil head - which surprisingly works awesome!). Got much more options and it&#x27;s my favourite so far. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I have gone through a series of battery-powered beard trimmers, and they all fail because the batteries die. Plus, batteries are heavy, and tend to go dead at just the wrong moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I wanted something without batteries, and this fits the ticket. Running off of A/C, it&#x27;s much more powerful. It&#x27;s also lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper is a bit too wide for perfect beard-trimming, but it works just fine. And it would work fine for the top of the head too, I guess. (But I have to guess about that one, because I shave what little hair I have on my skull.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also seems to be well-constructed. I like it so far, after a month or so of use.</li>
            <li> We use it on our dog who has a crazy thick coat and it works great. We have had it for 2 years and use it every few months and it works as well as the day we bought it.</li>
            <li> used it about 4 or 5 times already and love it.  great close shave.  plan on using it 1-2 times per weak and hope that it doesn&#x27;t burn out.</li>
            <li> Great Product I Rate It 5 Stars Buying Another Soon My First Set Lasted Me 3years!!![[ASIN:B00181SO2G Wahl Peanut Professional Clipper and Trimmer]]</li>
            <li> Originally, My dad had one of these and I would always steal it.  Finally, he drove me to Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supplies and I paid $50 for my own.  Let me tell you, it was one of the best investments I have ever made.  He got his years before I did and his still works like new.  Previously, I had bought a few different trimmers at marshalls and wal mart, the Peanut dwarfs the competition.  The blades have not noticeably dulled and the power is still the same.  I have even shaved my entire head with 3-4 inches of hair with this thing.  It is truly a bite-sized beast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with lubricating oil, a cleaning brush, and 4 different sized brush guards for different precision styling.  I only use this for my face and for trimming my chest.  The blade by itself will almost shave your face and you will barely have any noticeable hairs showing.  So, if you needed a quick shave but didnt have the time, these are absolutely perfect.  Also, these clippers do not require countless passes over the same area, they cut EXTREMELY well. They are also very easy to meanuever and are able to make those precise cuts in tough to reach spots that larger sized clippers cannot.  And yeah, it will heat up, but only under very, very heavy use.  If it is really an issue (its not for me), then simply give the blade a quick dip in water, dry it, and your good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you purchase this Peanut, you will never even think about another pair of grooming clippers.  Personally, I will have one of these for my entire life, they are simpy the best.  I highly recommend paying the extra money for this great product.  Do not be fooled by the size or the name, it is a lawnmower of a trimmer.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Wahl Peanut Clipper to cut my husband&#x27;s hair and am very pleased with the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if the product type changed or if all of them have changed. Thought I would try this one and my old one I think is still better.</li>
            <li> gets the job done quickly, small and versatile, recommended . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> i bougth this after i finished cosmatology scool works good it very light but it is used us  the back.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves it. It works great!!! He uses it weekly, never complains of getting knicked or cut by the clippers. I would recommend this product to anyone interested in purchasing a new hand help clipper.</li>
            <li> This is the newer version of the regular Wahl Peanut (and I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s listed as \\&quot;peanut-shaped trimmer\\&quot; instead of by its name). It&#x27;s got a more powerful motor and the peanut shape, but otherwise it&#x27;s identical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s a great little trimmer -- comfy to hold, easy to use, easy to clean. I&#x27;m at the point where I tell the barber, er, stylist, \\&quot;Give me a number 2 on top and a number 1 1/2 on the sides.\\&quot; Then I pay $10 or $12 for the two-minute haircut. Ergo, this pays for itself in about three cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, if it&#x27;s in your drawer you&#x27;ll probably trim more often rather than wait for your hair to grow in....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the #1 and #2 guides to neaten my hair, and you can use it without a guide to get a neat-but-unshaven look (which looks good with a shaved or nearly shaved head). Also nice for doing quick touch-ups on people with longer hair (e.g., your kid).</li>
            <li> This is our second peanut (same model) When we wear out this one we will buy another one. We have used this for over 500 hair cuts. The last one started making a grumbling noise, so we knew it was time for another. These are great little clippers.</li>
            <li> I like this less than some of the other helpful reviewers, but I don&#x27;t dislike it enough to bother returning it. We purchased it to replace some clippers that were 10+ years old and had lots of attachments. Mr. Peanut has some good qualities, BUT, he isn&#x27;t a clipper. (Wahl&#x27;s own site refers to this as a \\&quot;trimmer,\\&quot; not a clipper.) That&#x27;s probably why it only comes with four guide attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is tiny - four inches long - and the head is narrow. This makes it terrific for some purposes and not terrific for others. It is not great giving my hub&#x27;s thick, curly/wavy hair a haircut. The hair really clumped/stuck in there. (I forgot the blade comes off until just now, so I&#x27;ll give that a try and see if that helps clean it out. Personally I feel like I shouldn&#x27;t have to take it apart to clean it, though.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For his coarse beard, at first he didn&#x27;t think it was doing the job at all. He went back to the aging clippers until those finally died. After getting used to Peanut a bit more, now he&#x27;s OK using it when he has to, but he&#x27;s still looking for something else. It does a good job giving the back of his neck a close trim (without any of the guide attachments).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it&#x27;s a plug-in, which gives it good power for a compact gadget - but here&#x27;s one thing to note: because the housing is so small, I guess there isn&#x27;t much insulation around the motor. After using it for a few minutes, boy oh boy is my hand tired from the shaking/vibration. This is not fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum: compact, powerful, but not a clipper.</li>
