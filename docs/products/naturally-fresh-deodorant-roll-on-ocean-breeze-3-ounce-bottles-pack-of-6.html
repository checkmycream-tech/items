    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve found for myself.</li>
            <li>Great deo!</li>
            <li>This is a very good product.</li>
            <li>The coverage was great</li>
            <li>a happy convert from using chemical-laced sticks to all-natural protection with this product</li>
            <li>This stuff lasts me forever too, so it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li>Great product just need to reapply.  </li>
            <li>Great deal on this fresh-smelling deodorant</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re still good by dinnertime.</li>
            <li>This had good ratings, yet does not work.</li>
            <li>good service and good price</li>
            <li>Fair price.  </li>
            <li>also is not too good on odor.</li>
            <li>She was very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li>It smells great and the smell is very mild.</li>
            <li>I chose to go natural for my health and this product is one of the best I have found.</li>
            <li>This is the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and light and does the trick!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually suitable for both males and females.</li>
            <li>The scent is not prevalent throughout the day as it is very light even upon application, but the protection from body odor is outstanding.</li>
            <li>My husband and I have tried so many \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorants we&#x27;ve lost count.</li>
            <li>From this, they have evolved to the roll-on with better sticking</li>
            <li>on the hottest, most humid days here this summer I never once experienced any body odor from my armpits even when I would sweat much of the day.</li>
            <li>I started this and it almost felt as if I am sweating more.</li>
            <li>my favorite one now is tom&#x27;s of maine.</li>
            <li>I experienced with Old Spice</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for guys or girls, so my son uses it too.  </li>
            <li>The scent is excellent and not too strong - it&#x27;s also an all natural essential oil blend (no synthetic chemicals to be found here).</li>
            <li>Light scent is clean and gender neutral, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Nice, natural product!</li>
            <li>I decided to give this product a try as it was very affordable ($3.69 at Whole Foods) and I am very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I felt comfortable knowing I could rely on this product to keep my underarms feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like the idea of potentially toxic chemicals on your skin every day, then this deodorant is a good choice.  </li>
            <li>This works better than anything else, is reasonably priced, doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on clothing, has no smell, and does not contain any alum.</li>
            <li>(you do have to re-apply more often than antiperspirant) and I really like this scent too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cost effective, it works reasonably well, and it&#x27;s free of the &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; chemicals in standard deodorants.  </li>
            <li>I decided to give this deodorant a try in my effort to switch to using more all natural hygiene products.</li>
            <li>My pits are still fresh at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m physically fit and don&#x27;t sweat more than the average person.  </li>
            <li>Amazon didn&#x27;t carry my favorite &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; of this brand deodorant, the one I had from a local store that I no longer shop at.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It holds up very well.  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t cost you much.</li>
            <li>and then just lightly spread what came out around my entire armpit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>None have really worked, until this one.  </li>
            <li>Our whole family really likes this deodorant.</li>
            <li>With that said, standard deodorants do work better, but the tradeoff isn&#x27;t enough for me to use them.</li>
            <li>I am hopeful that Amazon will soon inventory this product and make it available by subscription or at least eligible for free shipping.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Excellent non irritating and long lasting.</li>
            <li>This is the first one that&#x27;s actually worked for us.</li>
            <li>The roll-on also seems like it will last a very long time because you do not need to use much to get adequate coverage.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;ve lost all hope for natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I have found over the years that this type of natural mineral salt deoderant eliminates staining in the underarm areas of T-shirts.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a long time Old Spice user but was hesitant in trying any natural deodorant because I&#x27;d heard that they don&#x27;t tend to last throughout the day to provide adequate protection from body odor.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it as a trial run for anyone looking to make the same switch.</li>
            <li>Excellent product without all the bad stuff other deodorants have.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to stick to Old Spice, I&#x27;ll deal with the consequences later I guess.</li>
            <li>In the old days, when I used the popular brand deoderants typically advertised on TV with Aluminum Chlorohydrate, my T-shirts would develop stains after about a month that was difficult to wash off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My husband and I have tried so many \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorants we&#x27;ve lost count. This is the first one that&#x27;s actually worked for us. Roll it on in the morning and you&#x27;re still good by dinnertime. It has a pleasant scent but it&#x27;s not strong, it just keeps the stinkies away. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve lost all hope for natural deodorant.  This had good ratings, yet does not work. I&#x27;m physically fit and don&#x27;t sweat more than the average person.  I was embarrassed at work, it was as if I wasn&#x27;t wearing any deodorant at all.  I&#x27;m going to stick to Old Spice, I&#x27;ll deal with the consequences later I guess.</li>
            <li> Within ONE HOUR, I already needed another shower after applying this stuff. PLUS, the smell is men&#x27;s after shave, NOT anything like any other ocean scent I have ever smelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might work for others, as far as I am concerned it was a waste of $$!</li>
            <li> good service and good price</li>
            <li> I have found over the years that this type of natural mineral salt deoderant eliminates staining in the underarm areas of T-shirts.  In the old days, when I used the popular brand deoderants typically advertised on TV with Aluminum Chlorohydrate, my T-shirts would develop stains after about a month that was difficult to wash off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These natural mineral salt base deoderants have been around for decades, usually in the form of a solid rock salt that you wet and rub on your underarm.  The ones I used were from France.  From this, they have evolved to the roll-on with better sticking power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am fairly active and work out in the gym several days a week.  This deoderant does its job.  It holds up very well.  That said, everyone is different.  This deodrant may or may not work for you. Give it try.  It won&#x27;t cost you much.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this deodorant a try in my effort to switch to using more all natural hygiene products. I&#x27;m a long time Old Spice user but was hesitant in trying any natural deodorant because I&#x27;d heard that they don&#x27;t tend to last throughout the day to provide adequate protection from body odor. I decided to give this product a try as it was very affordable ($3.69 at Whole Foods) and I am very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even on the hottest, most humid days here this summer I never once experienced any body odor from my armpits even when I would sweat much of the day. The coverage was great and I felt comfortable knowing I could rely on this product to keep my underarms feeling fresh.

The scent is not prevalent throughout the day as it is very light even upon application, but the protection from body odor is outstanding. The roll-on also seems like it will last a very long time because you do not need to use much to get adequate coverage. I like to press hard and roll 2-3 times up and down and then just lightly spread what came out around my entire armpit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another bonus is that I&#x27;ve noticed my armpits look a lot clearer and the irritation and flaking I experienced with Old Spice is a thing of the past. The chamomile extract in this product soothes the skin and keeps it healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a happy convert from using chemical-laced sticks to all-natural protection with this product and I highly recommend it as a trial run for anyone looking to make the same switch.</li>
            <li> As someone with a severe nickel allergy and who cannot tolerate other chemicals found in deodorants and antiperspirants, I am left with few choices. This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve found for myself. It does not prevent sweating at all but it does keep b.o. at bay. This particular scent is a little man-ish but fades after a while. I will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like the idea of potentially toxic chemicals on your skin every day, then this deodorant is a good choice.  It&#x27;s cost effective, it works reasonably well, and it&#x27;s free of the &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; chemicals in standard deodorants.  With that said, standard deodorants do work better, but the tradeoff isn&#x27;t enough for me to use them.</li>
            <li> We have been using this product now for about 18 months after trying everything (and I mean everything) else out there. This works well and comes in multiple fragrances as well as no fragrance to there is something for everyone. I am hopeful that Amazon will soon inventory this product and make it available by subscription or at least eligible for free shipping. Until then we continue to purchase it locally as it is less expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand of deodorant ever since I was diagnoised with cancer and starting watching labels.  This works better than anything else, is reasonably priced, doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on clothing, has no smell, and does not contain any alum.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. I will continue to use it in the future.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re allergic to regular antiperspirants but we&#x27;re not allergic to this deodorant.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Could not use - after one application my underarms were on fire</li>
            <li> Great deo! We&#x27;ve searched for a deo without toxic/cancer causing chemicals to control b.o.. None have really worked, until this one.  My pits are still fresh at the end of the day.  Light scent is clean and gender neutral, not overpowering. Gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Amazon didn&#x27;t carry my favorite &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; of this brand deodorant, the one I had from a local store that I no longer shop at.  So I tried this.  It works just as well (you do have to re-apply more often than antiperspirant) and I really like this scent too.  It&#x27;s fine for guys or girls, so my son uses it too.  Fair price.  This stuff lasts me forever too, so it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li> My wife likes a roll on deodorant, but she gets irritation from antiperspirants. She was very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> Great product just need to reapply.  I chose to go natural for my health and this product is one of the best I have found.</li>
            <li> This is the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found. It will only work after you&#x27;ve detoxed from &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; antiperspirants and deodorants. It smells nice and light and does the trick! And it didn&#x27;t make me itchy like a lot of them do.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife . She like the stuff. this was a reorder and she probably will order again when she runs out.</li>
            <li> Great deal on this fresh-smelling deodorant; it&#x27;s $8 a bottle locally.</li>
            <li> Excellent non irritating and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Our whole family really likes this deodorant. It smells great and the smell is very mild. It&#x27;s actually suitable for both males and females. Nice, natural product! Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent product without all the bad stuff other deodorants have.</li>
            <li> i was looking for a deodorant what has not been tested on animals. I started this and it almost felt as if I am sweating more. also is not too good on odor. my favorite one now is tom&#x27;s of maine.</li>
