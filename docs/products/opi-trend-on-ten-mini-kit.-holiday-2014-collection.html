            <li>Most of the shades are really nice</li>
            <li>So these are perfect for someone who frequently changes colors.</li>
            <li>This is a really cute mini set with a nice variety of polishes.</li>
            <li>Its super nice because inside its two separate boxes of 5 which s good because i wanted to give them as gifts</li>
            <li>Gorgeous colors, reasonable price(very good quality Polish.</li>
            <li>yes all the colors i love all together great price and worth not having to go to the store and pick each color out so much more time saving to order online</li>
            <li>Unlike some sets which have a couple good colors and the rest are just &amp;#34;fillers&amp;#34; this set is full of desirable colors.</li>
            <li>First off - they came packaged very nicely.</li>
            <li>but there were a couple that I wasn&#x27;t in love with.</li>
            <li>Love OPI and</li>
            <li>even though they are still in glass also you get to try more colors for almost the price of one.</li>
            <li>Love getting the mini sets to try all the colors.</li>
            <li>Love the colors</li>
            <li>Love the colors.</li>
            <li>Love the set.</li>
            <li>Love all the colors.  </li>
            <li>Lots of great colors to try out for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>easily satisfied.</li>
            <li>I like the many colors to choose from</li>
            <li>I love all the colors and am wearing the darkest one now.</li>
            <li>and I love it. :)</li>
            <li>All in all, you can make a lot of looks with this set because there are so many colors.  </li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>So I do like it, and you can layer it if you want more</li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy.</li>
            <li>All of my favorite colors.</li>
            <li>However, two days after I bought it, the seller dropped the price so I paid way more for it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I tested out two colors today- Cajun Shrimp and on top of it, I put the princesses rule glitter color.</li>
            <li>But I love OPI</li>
            <li>this size its perfect for me and as a present!</li>
            <li>I like OPI better than China Glaze which always chips like heck for me.</li>
            <li>If you are looking at them, make sure</li>
            <li>Love almost all the colors.</li>
            <li>Cajun Shrimp is probably my favorite.</li>
            <li>again, my favorite set from OPI</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it could be better than Essie for  at-home application, but it is.</li>
            <li>I bought this set of nail polish about six months ago, and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>It was awesome to get such a variety of colors, even if most of them were in the pink-red range.</li>
            <li>My son&#x27;s girlfriend loves nail polish, so this was the gift for her!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived earlier than promised in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bubble Bath: peach-pink cream, great classic for work.</li>
            <li>Great starter for those new to OPI.</li>
            <li>so it looks super nice.</li>
            <li>Nice packaging and very pretty colors of quality OPI nail polish.</li>
            <li>More light peachy.&lt;br /&gt;Princesses</li>
            <li>They were all very distinct, and I have been able to use them through the summer, even though I bought them in the winter.  </li>
            <li>I give it 4 stars though  because the paint chips way to easy.</li>
            <li>It has many beautiful colors I love the Lincoln after dark and Alpine Snow!&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:</li>
            <li>Colors are beautiful but they didn&#x27;t last on my nails longer than one day.</li>
            <li>Super cute-</li>
            <li>The colors are great and I love the nudes even though I have to layer them with 2 coats of white then 2 coats of the color and all of the nudes you must do that way to get a full coverage.</li>
            <li>I am not giving OPI 3 stars but the distributor for not showing and noting the product properly all of the polish is great OPI quality and go on smooth and doesn&#x27;t chip easily.</li>
            <li>The little bottles are perfect for testing!</li>
            <li>Great set for trying out different colors or stocking up on travel size classics.</li>
            <li>Gave away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toucan: light orange/tangerine-coral cream.</li>
            <li>Just the right size and many colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>The colors were very nice but the Polish started to chip off by the second day.</li>
            <li>They are smaller than I originally thought but it worked out great because who uses a full size bottle of polish anyway</li>
            <li>and they are travel friendly</li>
            <li>I have used full size OPI in the past and was very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>and no if you were wondering I don&#x27;t have rough skin lol.</li>
            <li>Overall, it was a good purchase and arrived promptly.</li>
            <li>Okay, good.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s so much color and pretty,&lt;br /&gt;Applies</li>
            <li>Most of the pinks in this set are much lighter than they appear in the bottle.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong at first but will go away.</li>
            <li>have been a long time fan and this review is in no way a reflection of the quality of the polish but in the distributor who should have showed or noted that 5 out of the 10 polishes are \\&quot;very-very\\&quot; light coverage while the others are very opaque and have great coverage.</li>
            <li>Great product, delivery when expected!</li>
            <li>Honestly some of the colors look like one I already own, just with different names, but I did get to discover new colors.  </li>
            <li>Came really quick and in time for christmas too.</li>
            <li>My daughter loved these when opening at Christmas!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect gift at the right price for those who only use OPI polish.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pretty</li>
            <li>Price is way to high!!!</li>
            <li>Great little sampler.  </li>
            <li>Great nail kit a little bit of a number of colors</li>
            <li>best color interpretation of the rest: Alpine Snow (matte white), Bubble Bath (matte baby pink),</li>
            <li>Super Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>I also love mini nailpolishes because I rarely finish an entire full sized bottle.</li>
            <li>price was right, too</li>
            <li>such a good price other sets are like 10 dollars more.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t suggest one coat because it&#x27;s very very thin.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>OMG, this pink glittery color is amazing.  </li>
            <li>These were more tiny then mini.</li>
            <li>and I know I will use this fast!</li>
            <li>Love all these colors has made me have to have the bigger bottle which I am buying from amazon.</li>
            <li>Pretty packaging and color collection.</li>
            <li>Pretty colors but</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>Gave it away as gifts for baby shower game winners, everyone loved the colors!</li>
            <li>Not what I expected, but great for a French Manicure.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And having smaller sizes is great so polish doesn&#x27;t thicken up if you don&#x27;t use it as often as other people do.</li>
            <li>Daughter loved having all the colors to try in small bottles.</li>
            <li>I use two coats and OPI Top coat (not included) to make it last a week with normal activity.  </li>
            <li>Apple Red: bright classic red cream.</li>
            <li>I really like the variety in this gift set.</li>
            <li>You can always buy a normal sized bottle of whichever colors you end up liking and running out of first.</li>
            <li>Fast</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very</li>
            <li>I think it turned out very pretty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pros are that I don&#x27;t paint my nails enough to go through an entire bottle of nail polish, so the tiny bottles were a great compromise.  </li>
            <li>Love this nail polish kit but was surprised to see that they are not regular sized.</li>
            <li>I rarely use a whole bottle of polish before it gets old and needs to be thrown away.</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t mind because honestly who ever actually finishes an entire nail polish anyways.</li>
            <li>I love the wide range of colors!</li>
            <li>They all came off my nails more quickly than other brands or OPI&#x27;s regular size</li>
            <li>Love the colors--OPI never lets me down.</li>
            <li>One of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;Malaga Wine: classic burgundy cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so sad because I love OPI products and historically they have been of such great quality, but these adorable little bottles leave much to be desired.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very much a classic pink / red / sparkly / silver / frost kind of a person, so overall, this set worked for me for the price.</li>
            <li>OPI is the smaller one ;) )</li>
            <li>Purchased for my 13 year old niece who loves the colors and doesn&#x27;t care for a mani/pedi where strangers touch your hand and feet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never tried it before, being an Essie girl, and wanted to try OPI out without committing to a color at nearly $10 a pop.</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s worth the price if you want to test out the different color shades or if you don&#x27;t plan to paint your nails as often but would like several colors.</li>
            <li>They are very small, so ADORABLE as party favors.  </li>
            <li>Kind of looks awfully teenage in bottle, but comes out as a subtle sheer sparkle.</li>
            <li>Two coats of OPI with a top and base coat lasted most of the week</li>
            <li>I used the bottom coat a color and the top coat waited like an he for them to dry because usually I&#x27;m the cause of the chipping but not this time.  </li>
            <li>Colors are vibrant although they take a while to dry.</li>
            <li>Bought these for a young relative.</li>
            <li>the polish is so thick it doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>My niece liked these, can never go wrong with OPI</li>
            <li>The pink is very pretty, just not very colored.  </li>
            <li>these little bottles are hard to use, but great if you are not sure of the color.  </li>
            <li>High quality polish that lasts forever while other polish just chips off in a day.  </li>
            <li>If You Try (shiny coral), Cajun Shrimp (shiny dark, deep coral) and Big Apple Red (shiny dark, true red).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> So I do like it, and you can layer it if you want more</li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy.</li>
            <li> All of my favorite colors.</li>
            <li> However, two days after I bought it, the seller dropped the price so I paid way more for it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I tested out two colors today- Cajun Shrimp and on top of it, I put the princesses rule glitter color.</li>
            <li> But I love OPI</li>
            <li> this size its perfect for me and as a present!</li>
            <li> I like OPI better than China Glaze which always chips like heck for me.</li>
            <li> If you are looking at them, make sure</li>
            <li> Love almost all the colors.</li>
            <li> Cajun Shrimp is probably my favorite.</li>
            <li> again, my favorite set from OPI</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it could be better than Essie for  at-home application, but it is.</li>
            <li> I bought this set of nail polish about six months ago, and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> It was awesome to get such a variety of colors, even if most of them were in the pink-red range.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s girlfriend loves nail polish, so this was the gift for her!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived earlier than promised in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bubble Bath: peach-pink cream, great classic for work.</li>
            <li> Great starter for those new to OPI.</li>
            <li> so it looks super nice.</li>
            <li> Nice packaging and very pretty colors of quality OPI nail polish.</li>
            <li> More light peachy.&lt;br /&gt;Princesses</li>
            <li> They were all very distinct, and I have been able to use them through the summer, even though I bought them in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars though  because the paint chips way to easy.</li>
            <li> It has many beautiful colors I love the Lincoln after dark and Alpine Snow!&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:</li>
            <li> Colors are beautiful but they didn&#x27;t last on my nails longer than one day.</li>
            <li> Super cute-</li>
            <li> The colors are great and I love the nudes even though I have to layer them with 2 coats of white then 2 coats of the color and all of the nudes you must do that way to get a full coverage.</li>
            <li> I am not giving OPI 3 stars but the distributor for not showing and noting the product properly all of the polish is great OPI quality and go on smooth and doesn&#x27;t chip easily.</li>
            <li> The little bottles are perfect for testing!</li>
            <li> Great set for trying out different colors or stocking up on travel size classics.</li>
            <li> Gave away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toucan: light orange/tangerine-coral cream.</li>
            <li> Just the right size and many colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> The colors were very nice but the Polish started to chip off by the second day.</li>
            <li> They are smaller than I originally thought but it worked out great because who uses a full size bottle of polish anyway</li>
            <li> and they are travel friendly</li>
            <li> I have used full size OPI in the past and was very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> and no if you were wondering I don&#x27;t have rough skin lol.</li>
            <li> Overall, it was a good purchase and arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> Okay, good.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s so much color and pretty,&lt;br /&gt;Applies</li>
            <li> Most of the pinks in this set are much lighter than they appear in the bottle.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong at first but will go away.</li>
            <li> have been a long time fan and this review is in no way a reflection of the quality of the polish but in the distributor who should have showed or noted that 5 out of the 10 polishes are \\&quot;very-very\\&quot; light coverage while the others are very opaque and have great coverage.</li>
            <li> Great product, delivery when expected!</li>
            <li> Honestly some of the colors look like one I already own, just with different names, but I did get to discover new colors.  </li>
            <li> Came really quick and in time for christmas too.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved these when opening at Christmas!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect gift at the right price for those who only use OPI polish.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pretty</li>
            <li> Price is way to high!!!</li>
            <li> Great little sampler.  </li>
            <li> Great nail kit a little bit of a number of colors</li>
            <li> best color interpretation of the rest: Alpine Snow (matte white), Bubble Bath (matte baby pink),</li>
            <li> Super Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> I also love mini nailpolishes because I rarely finish an entire full sized bottle.</li>
            <li> price was right, too</li>
            <li> such a good price other sets are like 10 dollars more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t suggest one coat because it&#x27;s very very thin.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> OMG, this pink glittery color is amazing.  </li>
            <li> These were more tiny then mini.</li>
            <li> and I know I will use this fast!</li>
            <li> Love all these colors has made me have to have the bigger bottle which I am buying from amazon.</li>
            <li> Pretty packaging and color collection.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors but</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> Gave it away as gifts for baby shower game winners, everyone loved the colors!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, but great for a French Manicure.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And having smaller sizes is great so polish doesn&#x27;t thicken up if you don&#x27;t use it as often as other people do.</li>
            <li> Daughter loved having all the colors to try in small bottles.</li>
            <li> I use two coats and OPI Top coat (not included) to make it last a week with normal activity.  </li>
            <li> Apple Red: bright classic red cream.</li>
            <li> I really like the variety in this gift set.</li>
            <li> You can always buy a normal sized bottle of whichever colors you end up liking and running out of first.</li>
            <li> Fast</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very</li>
            <li> I think it turned out very pretty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pros are that I don&#x27;t paint my nails enough to go through an entire bottle of nail polish, so the tiny bottles were a great compromise.  </li>
            <li> Love this nail polish kit but was surprised to see that they are not regular sized.</li>
            <li> I rarely use a whole bottle of polish before it gets old and needs to be thrown away.</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t mind because honestly who ever actually finishes an entire nail polish anyways.</li>
            <li> I love the wide range of colors!</li>
            <li> They all came off my nails more quickly than other brands or OPI&#x27;s regular size</li>
            <li> Love the colors--OPI never lets me down.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;Malaga Wine: classic burgundy cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad because I love OPI products and historically they have been of such great quality, but these adorable little bottles leave much to be desired.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very much a classic pink / red / sparkly / silver / frost kind of a person, so overall, this set worked for me for the price.</li>
            <li> OPI is the smaller one ;) )</li>
            <li> Purchased for my 13 year old niece who loves the colors and doesn&#x27;t care for a mani/pedi where strangers touch your hand and feet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never tried it before, being an Essie girl, and wanted to try OPI out without committing to a color at nearly $10 a pop.</li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s worth the price if you want to test out the different color shades or if you don&#x27;t plan to paint your nails as often but would like several colors.</li>
            <li> They are very small, so ADORABLE as party favors.  </li>
            <li> Kind of looks awfully teenage in bottle, but comes out as a subtle sheer sparkle.</li>
            <li> Two coats of OPI with a top and base coat lasted most of the week</li>
            <li> I used the bottom coat a color and the top coat waited like an he for them to dry because usually I&#x27;m the cause of the chipping but not this time.  </li>
            <li> Colors are vibrant although they take a while to dry.</li>
            <li> Bought these for a young relative.</li>
            <li> the polish is so thick it doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> My niece liked these, can never go wrong with OPI</li>
            <li> The pink is very pretty, just not very colored.  </li>
            <li> these little bottles are hard to use, but great if you are not sure of the color.  </li>
            <li> High quality polish that lasts forever while other polish just chips off in a day.  </li>
            <li> If You Try (shiny coral), Cajun Shrimp (shiny dark, deep coral) and Big Apple Red (shiny dark, true red).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really small, but favorites are the two almost translucent ones, big apple red, alpine snow, and the really shiney silver (pictured).  </li>
            <li> The brushes on this product makes it virtually impossible to get a nice coating of polish.  </li>
            <li> Aside from the packaging which is adorable, the actual polish is thin, hard to apply and doesn&#x27;t even last as long as a department store polish.</li>
            <li> I recommend this very much as long as you don&#x27;t mind the size!!!&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> The Foggiest: silver grey frost, has texture to it.</li>
            <li> I like the small bottles because so much of my nail polish has dried</li>
            <li> I dont do my nails too often and my favorite nail polish go bad,</li>
            <li> you expected OPI quality.</li>
            <li> Warning: this is not a baby pink.</li>
            <li> The tiny con is that they are a little bit more difficult to use because of the small size, but I don&#x27;t think that that is the biggest deal!</li>
            <li> After Dark (shiny black), Malaga Wine (shiny deep burgundy) and Tickle My Fancy (slightly matte mauve).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Snow: thick white cream.</li>
            <li> I am a chinese .The goods look good,but it is too slow&#x27;.</li>
            <li> , I bought the OPI base coat and top coat polishes.  </li>
            <li> After Dark: really dark black purple cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly purple</li>
            <li> /&gt;In addition to these little bottles</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m keeping a few colors for myself, of course.</li>
            <li> Super tiny and the brush is TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> They are mini sizes and are 3.75 liters each so quite small.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are small bottles.</li>
            <li> Not sure why.</li>
            <li> They are really small</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the small ones at all.</li>
            <li> Very small bottles.</li>
            <li> Even with a base coat and clear coat over the color.  </li>
            <li> Awful colors, super small sizes!!</li>
            <li> One of the polishes had leaked, but it was contained in the packaging and the bottle wasn&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li> Not happy about that.</li>
            <li> They are small! :(</li>
            <li> Disappointed on size.</li>
            <li> so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this purchase.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like the variety in this gift set. I also love mini nailpolishes because I rarely finish an entire full sized bottle. I would recommend this as a nice christmas gift to a friend. Most of the shades are really nice but there were a couple that I wasn&#x27;t in love with. Overall, it was a good purchase and arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> Love OPI and have been a long time fan and this review is in no way a reflection of the quality of the polish but in the distributor who should have showed or noted that 5 out of the 10 polishes are \\&quot;very-very\\&quot; light coverage while the others are very opaque and have great coverage. The colors are great and I love the nudes even though I have to layer them with 2 coats of white then 2 coats of the color and all of the nudes you must do that way to get a full coverage. I am not giving OPI 3 stars but the distributor for not showing and noting the product properly all of the polish is great OPI quality and go on smooth and doesn&#x27;t chip easily. They are smaller than I originally thought but it worked out great because who uses a full size bottle of polish anyway and they are travel friendly even though they are still in glass also you get to try more colors for almost the price of one.</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish kit but was surprised to see that they are not regular sized. They are mini sizes and are 3.75 liters each so quite small. However I still like the colors and they are great for the holidays!</li>

            <li> Great value. I rarely use a whole bottle of polish before it gets old and needs to be thrown away. So these are perfect for someone who frequently changes colors.</li>

            <li> Really nice set. Its super nice because inside its two separate boxes of 5 which s good because i wanted to give them as gifts so it looks super nice. such a good price other sets are like 10 dollars more. they are mini but i don&#x27;t mind because honestly who ever actually finishes an entire nail polish anyways.</li>

            <li> Beautiful colors, great quality.  I exclusively purchase OPI because of the quality. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> We purchased these items for favors for a bridal shower and it is not for awhile yet so I cannot comment on how they are.</li>
            <li> Happy with product. Great size to figure out what works for you.</li>

            <li> Awful colors, super small sizes!!</li>
            <li> I thought these were regular sized nail polishes because I didn&#x27;t read the details. They are small! :(</li>
            <li> The brushes on this product makes it virtually impossible to get a nice coating of polish.  The colors are very pretty and it&#x27;s you expected OPI quality.</li>
            <li> Great colors, great deal</li>
            <li> Disappointed on size. Wanted to return and was told I couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Gave it away as gifts for baby shower game winners, everyone loved the colors!</li>
            <li> OPI is the only polish I use &amp;#34;no formaldehyde&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Nice variety of colors - but they don&#x27;t all go on that well</li>
            <li> Love the colors--OPI never lets me down. I use it and it has been the best nail polish I ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift and was well received.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad because I love OPI products and historically they have been of such great quality, but these adorable little bottles leave much to be desired. Aside from the packaging which is adorable, the actual polish is thin, hard to apply and doesn&#x27;t even last as long as a department store polish.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for a friend.  Lots of great colors to try out for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous colors, reasonable price(very good quality Polish. They are very small, so ADORABLE as party favors.  The smell is strong at first but will go away. I recommend this very much as long as you don&#x27;t mind the size!!!&lt;br /&gt;Here is a pick of a regular OPI vs this one:&lt;br /&gt;(This OPI is the smaller one ;) )</li>
            <li> Price is way to high!!! I give it 4 stars though  because the paint chips way to easy. I used the bottom coat a color and the top coat waited like an he for them to dry because usually I&#x27;m the cause of the chipping but not this time.  I went to scratch my arm and it chipped and no if you were wondering I don&#x27;t have rough skin lol.</li>
            <li> Okay, good.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s so much color and pretty,&lt;br /&gt;Applies easily satisfied.</li>
            <li> Are much smaller than they look like. Meh.</li>
            <li> Excellent products! Super Fast Shipping! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Purchased as a stocking stuffer. Nice packaging and very pretty colors of quality OPI nail polish. Seller shipped immediately to me. Very happy with seller and product and would recommend them to others. Daughter loved having all the colors to try in small bottles.</li>
            <li> Great product, delivery when expected!</li>
            <li> Just the right size and many colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> Love all these colors has made me have to have the bigger bottle which I am buying from amazon.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved these when opening at Christmas!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect gift at the right price for those who only use OPI polish.</li>
            <li> I like the many colors to choose from</li>
            <li> One of the polishes had leaked, but it was contained in the packaging and the bottle wasn&#x27;t broken. I love all the colors and am wearing the darkest one now. It&#x27;s slightly purple and I love it. :)</li>
            <li> OMG, this pink glittery color is amazing.  OPI is always a solid choice for polish.</li>
            <li> these little bottles are hard to use, but great if you are not sure of the color.  price was right, too</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves these sets.</li>
            <li> I loved this nail color kit. The little bottles are perfect for testing!</li>
            <li> Really small, but favorites are the two almost translucent ones, big apple red, alpine snow, and the really shiney silver (pictured).  I use two coats and OPI Top coat (not included) to make it last a week with normal activity.  The pink is very pretty, just not very colored.  All in all, you can make a lot of looks with this set because there are so many colors.  High quality polish that lasts forever while other polish just chips off in a day.  You can always buy a normal sized bottle of whichever colors you end up liking and running out of first.</li>
            <li> Great set for trying out different colors or stocking up on travel size classics. I gave away three of these to a friend, but that&#x27;s because of my personal color preferences. I&#x27;m very much a classic pink / red / sparkly / silver / frost kind of a person, so overall, this set worked for me for the price. The product quality is very good, no problem with brushes, etc. Fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my take on them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t The Foggiest: silver grey frost, has texture to it. From the San Fran collection. I love this, it&#x27;s very classy.&lt;br /&gt;Alpine Snow: thick white cream. Not what I expected, but great for a French Manicure.&lt;br /&gt;Bubble Bath: peach-pink cream, great classic for work. Warning: this is not a baby pink. More light peachy.&lt;br /&gt;Princesses Rule: see-through sparkly salmon-pink. Kind of looks awfully teenage in bottle, but comes out as a subtle sheer sparkle. So I do like it, and you can layer it if you want more sparkle.&lt;br /&gt;Tickle My Francy: greyish mauve cream. Gave away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toucan: light orange/tangerine-coral cream. Gave away.&lt;br /&gt;Cajun shrimp: really bright orange-red cream. Great for toes in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;Big Apple Red: bright classic red cream. One of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;Malaga Wine: classic burgundy cream. One of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;Lincoln Park After Dark: really dark black purple cream. Gave away.</li>
            <li> I am a chinese .The goods look good,but it is too slow&#x27;.I can receive in June 16.I&#x27;m so disappointed. I have received the goods in June 10. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> OPI is really last for over one week.</li>
            <li> I used these as party of my baby shower favors and it was a hit! They are so adorable!!</li>
            <li> Great little sampler.  I got this for Christmas from my wish-list.  Honestly some of the colors look like one I already own, just with different names, but I did get to discover new colors.  I never would have given &amp;#34;Tickle my France-y&amp;#34; a second thought but it is actually nice nude for the hands.  Overall I am very happy.</li>
            <li> Such a great kit and perfect size bottles because let&#x27;s face it we buy tons of nail polish and never finish them be for they get too gloopy. Came really quick and in time for christmas too.</li>
            <li> I bought for a gift, and later i bought one for me</li>
            <li> Great nail kit a little bit of a number of colors</li>
            <li> This was a gift for someone. they loved it.</li>
            <li> Great set of mini polish. Very small bottles.</li>
            <li> Very excited! All of my favorite colors. However, two days after I bought it, the seller dropped the price so I paid way more for it. Not happy about that.</li>
            <li> First off - they came packaged very nicely. The box was wrapped in bubble wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are small bottles. Very tiny. But I still like them because it gives me the option to figure out what colors I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested out two colors today- Cajun Shrimp and on top of it, I put the princesses rule glitter color. I think it turned out very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s worth the price if you want to test out the different color shades or if you don&#x27;t plan to paint your nails as often but would like several colors.</li>
            <li> I like the sampling of smaller amounts.  As with OPI in larger containers the brush and application worked well.  May not use all the colors  but like the variety.</li>
            <li> Excellent product worth the experience</li>
            <li> Colors are beautiful but they didn&#x27;t last on my nails longer than one day. Even with a base coat and clear coat over the color.  Not sure why. Makes me question about the authenticity of this product. I also tried several different colors and had the same result each time. They all came off my nails more quickly than other brands or OPI&#x27;s regular size</li>
            <li> I used them for gift bags. They are really small I will say tho. The bottle its selfis about the size of a quarter. But I love OPI so I was pleasedwith them.</li>
            <li> OPI is a nice nail polish. This was great for the money. And having smaller sizes is great so polish doesn&#x27;t thicken up if you don&#x27;t use it as often as other people do.</li>
            <li> I love these they are perfect for my granddaughters!!!</li>
            <li> yes all the colors i love all together great price and worth not having to go to the store and pick each color out so much more time saving to order online</li>
            <li> I dont do my nails too often and my favorite nail polish go bad, this size its perfect for me and as a present!</li>
            <li> Great gift for the nail polish lover!</li>
            <li> Great value, nice gift for college student. Pretty packaging and color collection.</li>
            <li> Colors are vibrant although they take a while to dry.</li>
            <li> Great product and  price</li>
            <li> This is a really cute mini set with a nice variety of polishes. All except Haven&#x27;t The Foggiest and Princesses Rule are satiny (those are frosted). My favorites are Haven&#x27;t The Foggiest (frosted slate gray), Lincoln Park After Dark (shiny black), Malaga Wine (shiny deep burgundy) and Tickle My Fancy (slightly matte mauve).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My best color interpretation of the rest: Alpine Snow (matte white), Bubble Bath (matte baby pink), Toucan Do It If You Try (shiny coral), Cajun Shrimp (shiny dark, deep coral) and Big Apple Red (shiny dark, true red).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They all wear well. I like OPI better than China Glaze which always chips like heck for me. Two coats of OPI with a top and base coat lasted most of the week and I wash my hands a lot.</li>
            <li> our granddaughter loved it</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these!  If you are looking at them, make sure you know they are MINI bottles.  However, I think she will still get several nail paintings out of each bottle.  Unlike some sets which have a couple good colors and the rest are just &amp;#34;fillers&amp;#34; this set is full of desirable colors.</li>
            <li> Love almost all the colors. Cajun Shrimp is probably my favorite. I got these for a giftbag party i&#x27;m going to but i&#x27;m keeping a few colors for myself, of course.</li>
            <li> I Love this set! It has many beautiful colors I love the Lincoln after dark and Alpine Snow!&lt;br /&gt;TIPS: Add two coats of nail polish for a beautiful color, three for best results. I don&#x27;t suggest one coat because it&#x27;s very very thin.&lt;br /&gt;Once again, my favorite set from OPI</li>
            <li> Nice product, would use seller again</li>
            <li> Great holiday gift, perfect way to sample colors.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift and my friend loved it! All the colors are amazing!</li>
            <li> Great starter for those new to OPI. I&#x27;d never tried it before, being an Essie girl, and wanted to try OPI out without committing to a color at nearly $10 a pop. This set is great and OPI is amazing - I didn&#x27;t think it could be better than Essie for  at-home application, but it is.</li>
            <li> Bought these for a young relative. Not always knowing what is &amp;#34;on trend&amp;#34; I was hoping some of the colors would be to her liking. Thankfully, she liked them all.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors but the polish is so thick it doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly.  I have used full size OPI in the past and was very happy with the results.  I don&#x27;t care for the small ones at all.</li>
            <li> Great deal on amazon.  Most of the pinks in this set are much lighter than they appear in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this set of nail polish about six months ago, and I absolutely love it.  It was awesome to get such a variety of colors, even if most of them were in the pink-red range. They were all very distinct, and I have been able to use them through the summer, even though I bought them in the winter.  All of them were great colors, and I have used all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to these little bottles, I bought the OPI base coat and top coat polishes.  In combination, all of these colors have lasted about a week and have been bright and gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller bottles have pros and cons. The pros are that I don&#x27;t paint my nails enough to go through an entire bottle of nail polish, so the tiny bottles were a great compromise.  The tiny con is that they are a little bit more difficult to use because of the small size, but I don&#x27;t think that that is the biggest deal!</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping! Great price!</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s girlfriend loves nail polish, so this was the gift for her!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived earlier than promised in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Super cute- I love the wide range of colors!</li>
            <li> My niece liked these, can never go wrong with OPI</li>
