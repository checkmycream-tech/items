            <li>Great product at a good price.</li>
            <li>The tube design is good, works well.</li>
            <li>and I was looking for a good moisturizer to use with the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>A good product.</li>
            <li>it does have all the attributes of a good man lotion.</li>
            <li>Good.</li>
            <li>The prices with my prime account couldn&#x27;t be beat and the quick shipping is the best.</li>
            <li>This was a gift and they were very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Great deal with quick response.</li>
            <li>Smells good, light fragance smell.  </li>
            <li>series multi action face wash is great though!</li>
            <li>Face feels awesome, soft and protected.</li>
            <li>I have tried a bunch of others and this is, by far, the best.</li>
            <li>My husband loves this moisturizer and he is not a metro sexual moisturizing kind of guy.</li>
            <li>I used the skin cleanser and this lotion before a nice evening dinner once, and a lady next to me told me I have a GREAT complexion, &amp;#34;better than your wife&#x27;s&amp;#34; :p  </li>
            <li>The Gillette absorbs better, smells better, and</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite SPF moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;v been using Lab Series since they came out many years ago.</li>
            <li>My wife says she is jealous, it is better than her lotions which she pays much much more</li>
            <li>and I have had many compliments over the years.</li>
            <li>but she runs away howling with disgust that it is for men :)</li>
            <li>Most sun blocks cause me to break out when used on my face.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite skin moisturizers.</li>
            <li>(I was planing on spending $25 at most), but I thought I&#x27;d try it out anyways.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a week, it started feeling smooth again!  </li>
            <li>The sunblock is effective (probably the most important part of the product, long-term).</li>
            <li>Whenever I go to squeeze some out of the tube more than I&#x27;d like to use comes out.</li>
            <li>i have been using this stuff for years, and now that i just turned 48, i really notice my friends&#x27; skin more and can tell this is working great.  </li>
            <li>gotta love it.  </li>
            <li>Product was safely arrived.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and has a nice smooth feel to it.</li>
            <li>This lotion is great, very smooth, high quality, leaves my face feeling very fresh.</li>
            <li>Tried other stuff as well and this one seems to work the best for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re going to be in the sun, but I don&#x27;t recommend it if you&#x27;re inside all day or prior to any evenings out.</li>
            <li>It is light, absorbs quickly and does not have a strong scent.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t leave any streak on your face, dries well and the SPF protection is adequate if you don&#x27;t spend a lot of time in the sun.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m the best reviewer.</li>
            <li>i also get compliments, or more comments, i guess,  on how nice my skin is and how do i get it that way (only from women, of course!).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bene looking for a good daily SPF lotion and have worn Lubriderm, Nivea, Kiehl&#x27;s and Lab Series.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly into the skin.  </li>
            <li>Bought as a present for relative who has used for years and claims it is the best.</li>
            <li>is the exception and this is well worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Wish there were more natural ingredients in it.</li>
            <li>The sun screen also gives it that distinct sun screen odor -- which I could do without.</li>
            <li>I like the lotion especially for the summer because it does not feel too greasy like a sun screen, and it is a great facial lotion too.</li>
            <li>i have nice, hydrated skin that does not look dry or wrinkly.  </li>
            <li>I have been told by numerous friends and family member, weeks after using this stuff, that my skin looks so much more radiant and youthful and they all ask what have I been doing/using.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Lab Series consistently, and without interruption, since December of 1989</li>
            <li>I have given my husband various moisturizers over the years and this one is his favorite.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy it at first</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li>I will go back to my Kiehl&#x27;s Facial Fuel SPF 15 moisturizer, which costs about the same but has a much more pleasant smell (reminds me of the ocean) and does not leave an oily feel.</li>
            <li>As long as you use it sparingly, and use the right amount for your skin, you will get consistent satisfied results.</li>
            <li>B001GIOW36 Clean &amp; Clear Advantage Acne Control Kit]].  </li>
            <li>Something far better and far cheaper is Medline&#x27;s Remedy Skin Repair Cream.</li>
            <li>I have a normal to slightly oily skin type and this is the single best moisturizer I have used.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes very well and yet keeps the skin feeling non-oily, which is exactly what I want from a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>As my title states, you have to make sure you use the right amount, else it will do absolutely nothing beneficial other than annoy</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t feel or smell any real difference.  </li>
            <li>it much, much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s too much money for what you get, and the whole texture/smell thing isn&#x27;t my bag.  </li>
            <li>but this is really helping in the interim.</li>
            <li>Worked really well.</li>
            <li>The entire process of order, delivery and use were as smooth a silk, not to mention my face as well.</li>
            <li>and it really helps your skin</li>
            <li>So it is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>goes on with not too much effort.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, non greasy, and give you solid SPF protection.</li>
            <li>The entire process of order, delivery and use were as smooth a silk, not to mention my face as well.</li>
            <li>It is 3.4 ounces, so take that into consideration since many other products are 1.7 ounces or so.</li>
            <li>That slightly greasy coating and smell remains for most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I really think this is a great product, but way too expensive.</li>
            <li>and it still feels very comfortable to use, whereas other moisturizers in the heat feel like they are trapping sweat and thus make you feel pretty gross right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li>,, highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>But overall, the reason to get this is for the UV protection, and if you have the money to spare then it&#x27;s worth a shot.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily and seems to dry quickly just leaving my skin feeling soft and dry.</li>
            <li>moisturizer/sunblock seems to do OK with the daily protection I wanted for short outdoor exposures, but to me it makes my skin feel exceptionally greasy by the end of the day, as if there&#x27;s a thin layer of lightly viscous oil on my forehead, and I find myself wiping down my entire face with a damp paper towel by early afternoon just to avoid feeling so oily.  </li>
            <li>The one Clean &amp; Clear provided was constantly drying my face, especially around my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>I JUST LIKE MANY OTHER GENTLEMEN HAVE OVERLY DRY TISTICLE</li>
            <li>I am a 23 years old.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soothing and lasts forever because you just use the tiniest amount possible to cover your face after you shave.</li>
            <li>I have been using the same moisturizer for a while now, which I do really like, but wanted to see what else was on the market</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m 44 and everyone thinks I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It absorbs well, but can&#x27;t really say if it makes much of a difference over other brands.</li>
            <li>Less flaky, dry skin and more healthy-looking skin.  </li>
            <li>If this was half the price, it&#x27;d be 5 stars, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>Young or old, and I&#x27;m the latter.</li>
            <li>I tried other cheaper lotions with SPF 15 with similar active ingredients, like the Gillette ProFusion SPF15, and I like them better.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend for anyone with dry</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t yet had the opportunity to use it during the winter season, but it&#x27;s approaching 95F daily where I live</li>
            <li>The SPF is 15, so it&#x27;s not a superb sun screen, but if you are just blocking out the sun for normal daily activities instead of laying under the sun on the beach, it should be more than enough.</li>
            <li>Four stars instead of five was due to its high price.</li>

            <li> Four stars instead of five was due to its high price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dry skin for years and no face lotion seemed to help.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been forced to put aquaphor or vaseline on my face in the fast as these were the only things that seems to help.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and then my face is dry again.</li>
            <li> finally broke down and scheduled an appointment with a dermatologist</li>
            <li> I completely agree with a previous reviewer who said this product has an odd odor, which he described as dairy-like, only I will say that I find this smell to be more than a little unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> It definitely smells heavily of sunblock chemical.  </li>
            <li> So heavily, in fact, that I&#x27;ve noticed that sunblock chemical smells similar to green spanish olives.  </li>
            <li> seems to expensive for what it is worth.</li>
            <li> But if you want to give yourself a treat and have a few extra dollars, go for it.</li>
            <li> you knowing you spent upwards of $40 on this \\&quot;Defense Lotion\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive, but I have always found it worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Also, I think is not good for young skin.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is probably the steep price, but that&#x27;s Lab Series for you...</li>
            <li> btw, i also use the LAB undereye stuff for the dark circles and bags.  </li>
            <li> Less expensive and works much</li>
            <li> After a shower and a shave when a guy&#x27;s face / skin is drawn tight; this lotion does the job.  </li>
            <li> , I could see where I got slightly burned where I missed a few spots, so the SPF 15 does its job.  </li>
            <li> a little too drying for me.  </li>
            <li> After a few days, I started seeing some noticeable improvement.  </li>

            <li> NO MORE PEALING OR LOSS OF HAIRS</li>
            <li> Perhaps the tube I received was uniquely bad, but to me the scent of this lotion reminds me of expired, sour milk and the only reason I will use the rest of this supply is because of the price of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is too thick to apply and when it dries the skin feels weird and if it is windy my skin gets dry in minutes.</li>
            <li> negative side to this product:  </li>
            <li> While I like the Lab series line, this product feels thick and greasy...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for decades and plan to continue its use. It works well and I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bene looking for a good daily SPF lotion and have worn Lubriderm, Nivea, Kiehl&#x27;s and Lab Series.  This one is a solid lotion, but not for the price.  It&#x27;s significantly more expensive than Nivea and I can&#x27;t feel or smell any real difference.  If this was half the price, it&#x27;d be 5 stars, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for almost 10 years and have no plans on stopping anytime soon.  A bit pricey but if you cherish your skin, money is no factor.  I have been told by numerous friends and family member, weeks after using this stuff, that my skin looks so much more radiant and youthful and they all ask what have I been doing/using.  After those comments, I decided Lab Series was now a part of my life.  This stuff will NOT disappoint you.  Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> I cannot attest to the lotion&#x27;s effectiveness as a \\&quot;defense lotion\\&quot;, but don&#x27;t get fooled by the \\&quot;fragrance free/san parfum\\&quot; label.  It definitely smells heavily of sunblock chemical.  So heavily, in fact, that I&#x27;ve noticed that sunblock chemical smells similar to green spanish olives.  If you don&#x27;t mind smelling like an overgrown olive all day, this lotion isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> a little too drying for me.  seems to expensive for what it is worth.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, it was hard to find men&#x27;s face lotions with some UV protection.  So I gave Lab Series a try.  All I needed is something lightweight to put on my face after shaving, and that will bring a bit of UV protection.  I like the fact is has avobenzone, that the UVA protection that you need to ward off deep cell damage that can cause melanoma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So some impressions:&lt;br /&gt;1. It does go on just a bit greasy. I think that is done on purpose in order to give your face a \\&quot;healthy\\&quot; glow in the morning.  As well, there is a bit of a background smell that I can&#x27;t put my finger on, like a bit of dairy product.  That slightly greasy coating and smell remains for most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;2. Out and about in the sun it does give protection, I could see where I got slightly burned where I missed a few spots, so the SPF 15 does its job.  Of course if you&#x27;ll be out in the sun all day, you&#x27;d have to stick with \\&quot;real\\&quot; suntan lotion&lt;br /&gt;3. I tried other cheaper lotions with SPF 15 with similar active ingredients, like the Gillette ProFusion SPF15, and I like them better.  The Gillette absorbs better, smells better, and it much, much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m not buying the Lab Series anymore, it&#x27;s too much money for what you get, and the whole texture/smell thing isn&#x27;t my bag.  But overall, the reason to get this is for the UV protection, and if you have the money to spare then it&#x27;s worth a shot.  It is 3.4 ounces, so take that into consideration since many other products are 1.7 ounces or so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dry skin for years and no face lotion seemed to help.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been forced to put aquaphor or vaseline on my face in the fast as these were the only things that seems to help.&lt;br /&gt;This is the exception and this is well worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend for anyone with dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I finally broke down and scheduled an appointment with a dermatologist but this is really helping in the interim.</li>
            <li> The best moisture defense I&#x27;ve used..Works well and keeps the face in shape..Young or old, and I&#x27;m the latter. Great for any age skin</li>
            <li> This was a gift and they were very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I like the lotion especially for the summer because it does not feel too greasy like a sun screen, and it is a great facial lotion too. The SPF is 15, so it&#x27;s not a superb sun screen, but if you are just blocking out the sun for normal daily activities instead of laying under the sun on the beach, it should be more than enough. The only complaint is probably the steep price, but that&#x27;s Lab Series for you...</li>
            <li> Worked really well. Wish there were more natural ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Works great</li>
            <li> When will they put the ingredients on this product? After the FDA tests the product and tells us it&#x27;s cancer causing? I really think this is a great product, but way too expensive.</li>
            <li> The entire process of order, delivery and use were as smooth a silk, not to mention my face as well. Great product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years but have found an easier and cheaper way to get a hold of it.</li>
            <li> I am a 23 years old. I think all Lab Series produt is all greasy.&lt;br /&gt;It is not good for oil skin. Also, I think is not good for young skin.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite SPF moisturizer.  Been using it for over five years now.  Tried other stuff as well and this one seems to work the best for me.  Easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t leave any streak on your face, dries well and the SPF protection is adequate if you don&#x27;t spend a lot of time in the sun.  Smells good, light fragance smell.  The tube design is good, works well.</li>
            <li> Have to agree with the reviewer who says this product smells.  It certainly has a chemical taint to it, that nasty sunblock stench.  Also feels greasy on the skin, just like regular sunblock.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as a \\&quot;daily moisturizer\\&quot; -- no way!  Something far better and far cheaper is Medline&#x27;s Remedy Skin Repair Cream.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes for about two minutes and then my face is dry again. Requires a lot of lotion to cover face. I&#x27;ll be sticking with Bulldog from now on. Less expensive and works much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lab series multi action face wash is great though!</li>
            <li> I have a normal to slightly oily skin type and this is the single best moisturizer I have used. It moisturizes very well and yet keeps the skin feeling non-oily, which is exactly what I want from a moisturizer. I haven&#x27;t yet had the opportunity to use it during the winter season, but it&#x27;s approaching 95F daily where I live and it still feels very comfortable to use, whereas other moisturizers in the heat feel like they are trapping sweat and thus make you feel pretty gross right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Obviously, it&#x27;s very expensive.</li>
            <li> I JUST LIKE MANY OTHER GENTLEMEN HAVE OVERLY DRY TISTICLE OR &#x27;BAG&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LAB SERIOUS MOSTURE DEFENSE HELP ENRICH THE SCROTUM AN MOISTEN IT SO THER IS NO MORE PEALING OR LOSS OF HAIRS</li>
            <li> One of the best SPF lotions I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It&#x27;s very soothing and lasts forever because you just use the tiniest amount possible to cover your face after you shave.</li>
            <li> My husband LOVES this product and has for 30 years</li>
            <li> An excellent product. Goes on easily and has a nice smooth feel to it. A very subtle scent mixes well with lots of after shaves or colognes. The SPF rating is a bonus. Four stars instead of five was due to its high price. But if you want to give yourself a treat and have a few extra dollars, go for it.</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price.</li>
            <li> One of the worst moisturizers I have ever tried. It is too thick to apply and when it dries the skin feels weird and if it is windy my skin gets dry in minutes. Not recomended at all</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and it really helps your skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;v been using Lab Series since they came out many years ago. This lotion is great, very smooth, high quality, leaves my face feeling very fresh. My wife says she is jealous, it is better than her lotions which she pays much much more for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in combination with the Lab Series shower gel and the Lab Series skin cleanser and I have had many compliments over the years. I used the skin cleanser and this lotion before a nice evening dinner once, and a lady next to me told me I have a GREAT complexion, &amp;#34;better than your wife&#x27;s&amp;#34; :p  I hear that every so often now but NEVER before I started Lab Series. Not even once. So it is the real deal. It works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried to put a dab on my teen daughter but she runs away howling with disgust that it is for men :)</li>
            <li> I have been using the same moisturizer for a while now, which I do really like, but wanted to see what else was on the market so I decided to give this a try.  I completely agree with a previous reviewer who said this product has an odd odor, which he described as dairy-like, only I will say that I find this smell to be more than a little unpleasant.  Perhaps the tube I received was uniquely bad, but to me the scent of this lotion reminds me of expired, sour milk and the only reason I will use the rest of this supply is because of the price of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer/sunblock seems to do OK with the daily protection I wanted for short outdoor exposures, but to me it makes my skin feel exceptionally greasy by the end of the day, as if there&#x27;s a thin layer of lightly viscous oil on my forehead, and I find myself wiping down my entire face with a damp paper towel by early afternoon just to avoid feeling so oily.  Immediately after applying it does leave a noticeable sheen on your face, so if you are going to take pictures and do not want the appearance of a shiny face you might want to avoid this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product a mediocre 3 stars because it did manage to leave my skin soft and smooth after several days of use, but the horrid smell/oily residue-to-price ratio will guarantee that I will not purchase again.  I will go back to my Kiehl&#x27;s Facial Fuel SPF 15 moisturizer, which costs about the same but has a much more pleasant smell (reminds me of the ocean) and does not leave an oily feel.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I provides me with SPF protection without being oily or greasy. Most sun blocks cause me to break out when used on my face. No problems with this.</li>
            <li> Face feels awesome, soft and protected.,, highly recommended.  I have tried a bunch of others and this is, by far, the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lab Series consistently, and without interruption, since December of 1989 so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m the best reviewer. However, I&#x27;m 44 and everyone thinks I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s. I recommend using every Lab Series product you can afford.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite skin moisturizers. Worked when others didn&#x27;t. Hydrates and protects skin quite well. I&#x27;d say it has some anti-aging properties as well.</li>
            <li> I have given my husband various moisturizers over the years and this one is his favorite. He asks for it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and I was looking for a good moisturizer to use with the [[ASIN:B001GIOW36 Clean &amp; Clear Advantage Acne Control Kit]].  The one Clean &amp; Clear provided was constantly drying my face, especially around my cheeks.  So i started looking for a replacement, when I noticed LAB&#x27;s Moisturizer.  I was hesitant to buy it at first (I was planing on spending $25 at most), but I thought I&#x27;d try it out anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this in the mornings after I showered once a day.  After a few days, I started seeing some noticeable improvement.  Less flaky, dry skin and more healthy-looking skin.  After a week, it started feeling smooth again!  Not like a baby, but close enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One negative side to this product:  As my title states, you have to make sure you use the right amount, else it will do absolutely nothing beneficial other than annoy you knowing you spent upwards of $40 on this \\&quot;Defense Lotion\\&quot;.  Speaking of which, the SPF15 does work well, but it is NOT a replacement for suntan lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second bottle in 4 months.  As long as you use it sparingly, and use the right amount for your skin, you will get consistent satisfied results.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It goes on easily and seems to dry quickly just leaving my skin feeling soft and dry. The sunblock is effective (probably the most important part of the product, long-term). It helps with occasional shaving soreness.</li>
            <li> Years (and years) ago, Aramis had a face moisturizer but then their Lab Series line started offering a similar product.  I have been using this lotion for over a decade.  It is expensive, but I have always found it worth the price.  After a shower and a shave when a guy&#x27;s face / skin is drawn tight; this lotion does the job.  Non-greasy.  Absorbs quickly into the skin.  Feels great.  A good product.</li>
            <li> No difference with NIVEA. More expensive than NIVEA .</li>
            <li> it does have all the attributes of a good man lotion. minimum if any scent. goes on with not too much effort. doesn&#x27;t sweat out like cheaper lotions.  would get 5 stars but the price...</li>
            <li> My husbands loves this product.</li>
            <li> Kinda watery. Whenever I go to squeeze some out of the tube more than I&#x27;d like to use comes out. It absorbs well, but can&#x27;t really say if it makes much of a difference over other brands.</li>
            <li> i have been using this stuff for years, and now that i just turned 48, i really notice my friends&#x27; skin more and can tell this is working great.  i have nice, hydrated skin that does not look dry or wrinkly.  i also get compliments, or more comments, i guess,  on how nice my skin is and how do i get it that way (only from women, of course!).  gotta love it.  btw, i also use the LAB undereye stuff for the dark circles and bags.  it works.</li>
            <li> While I like the Lab series line, this product feels thick and greasy... no doubt because of the included solar screen. It&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re going to be in the sun, but I don&#x27;t recommend it if you&#x27;re inside all day or prior to any evenings out. The sun screen also gives it that distinct sun screen odor -- which I could do without.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this moisturizer and he is not a metro sexual moisturizing kind of guy. It is light, absorbs quickly and does not have a strong scent. The prices with my prime account couldn&#x27;t be beat and the quick shipping is the best.</li>
            <li> Have been using this lotion for years. It&#x27;s light, non greasy, and give you solid SPF protection. You can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> great product thank you</li>
            <li> Bought as a present for relative who has used for years and claims it is the best.</li>
            <li> The entire process of order, delivery and use were as smooth a silk, not to mention my face as well. Great product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years but have found an easier and cheaper way to get a hold of it.</li>
            <li> Product was safely arrived. No doubt to say it was awesome. Great deal with quick response. Thanks a lot! Loved it!</li>
            <li> Good. Not oil feeling</li>
