            <li>I love how this serum is light and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to find in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;Come</li>
            <li>The fine lines went away since the puffiness was gone.</li>
            <li>I have not seen a huge improvement, but don&#x27;t expect to until I have used it for a while.</li>
            <li>I think around the eyes will light up</li>
            <li>It is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>After seeing that this was being launched at a discounted rate, I was so excited to order mine.</li>
            <li>It is so cool and soothing like going to the spa.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When I put the gel on the eye area of my face, it felt very soothing and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I put it on before I went to bed and in the morning, my eyes really looked better.</li>
            <li>but I have really noticed that the skin around my eyes is firmer and more supple.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It came in a beautiful little bag</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying this!!!</li>
            <li>The serum arrived in a cute little bag which I thought was a nice idea.</li>
            <li>The clear rich gel is easy to pump out from the bottle and apply to the eye.  </li>
            <li>So far, it works much better than I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Cool, non greasy, and down right refreshing!  </li>
            <li>It has this instant cooling effect, that is great for my puffiness almost instantly.</li>
            <li>eye.&lt;br /&gt;After you first put the serum on, it creates a warming sensation.</li>
            <li>It really smoothes out lines and wrinkles and reduces puffiness!</li>
            <li>This pretty bottle came in an elegant blue sachet.  </li>
            <li>We seen and tried many other similar products but fell in love with this one.</li>
            <li>And appears to have a slight radiant shine giving you a nice glow.</li>
            <li>I have been using Pure Vitamin C Serum for Eyes for about a month now.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, really, but it is so soothing, I noticed results almost immediately.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It seemed to smooth out the fine lines and sooth the puffiness I usually have under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to report that this is definitely a product I will be using everyday! A+++</li>
            <li>Vitamin C is my new obsession!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone that needs some help for the skin around your eyes and to minimize the puffiness.</li>
            <li>What I really like is the fact that the pump doesn&#x27;t squirt out too much of the liquid, like some products, and you are totally in control of how much you want to use.</li>
            <li>and I see a big difference already makes your eyes feel fresh.</li>
            <li>One more thing is the label of the bottle turn kinda sticky after a few days but doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>This little bottle should last a long time which makes it a great value.</li>
            <li>My skin is brighter and FINALLY my dark circles have been reduced a huge amount.</li>
            <li>and I am 59 years old and have lots of lines and puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to fool myself into thinking it worked if it really didn&#x27;t, so I started out just applying it to my left</li>
            <li>im 38 years old</li>
            <li>She loves how it smells and how soft it is on her</li>
            <li>I am seeing a difference in the puffiness, and lines near my eyes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll probably try it just on my left eye for a few more days to see the difference, but I&#x27;m eager to start using it on both eyes.</li>
            <li>Love the pump so much easier and less waste when applying.</li>
            <li>already looks a few years younger than my right eye!</li>
            <li>My main concern is I have an area which is very dry</li>
            <li>but I sleep only 5-6 hours a day due to heavy work and it&#x27;s easily understandable.</li>

            <li> I am 40 years old and have noticed alot of changes in the last few years.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I did not like this eye serum at all...it was expensive and I saw no difference at all, did not help puffiness or anything else. Just laid on my skin in a yucky way.  Store brands work much better and feel better too. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. My puffiness went away in 2 weeks. I started to notice changes in 5 days. The fine lines went away since the puffiness was gone. My skin is brighter and FINALLY my dark circles have been reduced a huge amount. Cannot do without this. So glad I can now stop spending TONS of money on things that say they work and DO NOT. My search is over! My pocket book and I am very happy!</li>
            <li> This product is really great. I wanted something that would help reduce puffiness and make my wrinkles not so noticeable and this is working for me. It&#x27;s hard to find a product like this that actually works. I&#x27;m going to be using this everyday from now on!</li>
            <li> Cheap is a very good product.</li>
            <li> Awesome love it. It is so cool and soothing like going to the spa.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a difference in just 2 days and I am 59 years old and have lots of lines and puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;I telling all my friends they need to order this.&lt;br /&gt;I keep it with me all the time so I have it handy and my friends can try it.&lt;br /&gt;It came in a beautiful little bag so it&#x27;s easy to find in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;Come gals and guys too you have to give a try.</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift for my wife and says she could feel the difference from day one! So that was nice.</li>
            <li> This is very good and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The product comes in a little bag not a box. It feels lovely on my skin around the eyes. And appears to have a slight radiant shine giving you a nice glow. What I really like is the fact that the pump doesn&#x27;t squirt out too much of the liquid, like some products, and you are totally in control of how much you want to use. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I just got this serum a few days ago. I didn&#x27;t want to fool myself into thinking it worked if it really didn&#x27;t, so I started out just applying it to my left eye.&lt;br /&gt;After you first put the serum on, it creates a warming sensation. It&#x27;s a pleasant one.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to see an immediate improvement just a few minutes after application. Above my eye, puffiness reduced that I didn&#x27;t even realize I had. I&#x27;ve been applying it in the morning after my shower and at night before bed - and just to my left eye.&lt;br /&gt;My left eye already looks a few years younger than my right eye! Lots less puffiness and my wrinkles are less deep and harder to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably try it just on my left eye for a few more days to see the difference, but I&#x27;m eager to start using it on both eyes. So far, it works much better than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> This product is really awesome. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, really, but it is so soothing, I noticed results almost immediately. It really smoothes out lines and wrinkles and reduces puffiness! Amazing. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This pretty bottle came in an elegant blue sachet.  Makes a good gift too.  The clear rich gel is easy to pump out from the bottle and apply to the eye.  There is a 30 day money back guarantee label on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother to waste your money.  This product does not work</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait for my vitamin c serum to arrive!  I washed my face, and applied it under my eyes.  What a great feeling!  Cool, non greasy, and down right refreshing!  I&#x27;ve been using it every day for about two weeks and the results are amazing!  Between work and school I put in some long hours... many of them staring at a monitor.  Needless to say my eyes get very puffy, but Serendipity Life has really helped soothe my poor tired eyes and and remove the puffiness... it has even softened the wrinkles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift to my girl friend. she likes it a lot saying it is better than the one she used before. I will buy this again for her again.</li>
            <li> I was very anxious to receive this Vitamin C eye serum. My skin around my eyes seems to always look puffy and dry and I&#x27;ve been looking for a cream that was specifically made to use around the eyes. I&#x27;m so glad I found this one. The serum arrived in a cute little bag which I thought was a nice idea. When I put the gel on the eye area of my face, it felt very soothing and refreshing. I put it on before I went to bed and in the morning, my eyes really looked better. It seemed to smooth out the fine lines and sooth the puffiness I usually have under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion and review. I highly recommend this product for anyone that needs some help for the skin around your eyes and to minimize the puffiness.</li>
            <li> 5 stars! im 38 years old, this is very good item to me.</li>
            <li> Excellent product as well as customer support answering all of our questions promptly. We seen and tried many other similar products but fell in love with this one. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I ordered it for my mom because she complained about having puffy under eye bags. She swears that this cream works! She loves how it smells and how soft it is on her skin.&lt;br /&gt;It should be noted though, that at the same time with this cream she started taking biotin. So, it&#x27;s hard to say what exactly worked for her.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I like using it to soothe my puffy tired eyes. It has this instant cooling effect, that is great for my puffiness almost instantly. After seeing that this was being launched at a discounted rate, I was so excited to order mine. After using, and sharing my experience and honest opinion I&#x27;m happy to report that this is definitely a product I will be using everyday! A+++</li>
            <li> received at a reduced cost for honest opinion. I like this cream after only a few days I am seeing a difference in the puffiness, and lines near my eyes. Nice cooling feeling when applied. Love the pump so much easier and less waste when applying. I have been using in the morning and at night before bed and I see a big difference already makes your eyes feel fresh. Thanks great product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product! Vitamin C is my new obsession! I swear I look better &amp; my wrinkles have been disappearing! I highly recommend trying this!!! I will continue to use!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent !!&lt;br /&gt;Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
            <li> I love this eye serum. I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about 1 week but I have really noticed that the skin around my eyes is firmer and more supple. My eye make also goes on a lot more smoothly and doesn&#x27;t creaseâ€¦.an added bonus!</li>
            <li> I love how this serum is light and easy to apply. The pump dispense correct amount serum and when you use it leaves a very nice feeling around my eyes. I see only little bit brightness yet but I sleep only 5-6 hours a day due to heavy work and it&#x27;s easily understandable. My main concern is I have an area which is very dry and my skin peels. With this serum they totally disappeared. One more thing is the label of the bottle turn kinda sticky after a few days but doesn&#x27;t bother me. I got this eye serum for my honest review and I definitely recommend anyone...</li>
            <li> I have been using Pure Vitamin C Serum for Eyes for about a month now. It is super easy to use. I just dab a tiny amount on my finger and dab it on the outer part of my eyes and under my eyes (circles). It seems to be firming up the area a bit. I have not seen a huge improvement, but don&#x27;t expect to until I have used it for a while. Thus far, I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I think around the eyes will light up</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old and have noticed alot of changes in the last few years. My eyes being 1 of them. I wanted an eye serum that would take the puffiness and tired look away, This has helped with that. Just a tiny amount of this goes a long way. This little bottle should last a long time which makes it a great value. I bought this product during a promotional period in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> my eye more brightning. good~</li>
