            <li>Product good.</li>
            <li>good price on wax, but did not come with bags to wrap your hands/feet.  </li>

            <li>A good product at a good price.</li>
            <li>I cant speak for the smell when melted because I added scented oil to make it smell good.</li>
            <li>They arrived on time and in good shape.</li>
            <li>very good product I recommend to everyone, very good and affordable price, high quality, never regret,good,good,good,good</li>
            <li>love it works great relief</li>
            <li>I am using it much more frequently than I thought I would which make this the best product for the best price.</li>
            <li>It was 2 dollars more then the price of the product!</li>
            <li>Love the feel of this paraffin!  </li>
            <li>It is very challenging to find wax with a nice texture for hand spas.  </li>
            <li>Unscented wax is fantastic quality at a great price.</li>
            <li>Too soon to tell how effective using paraffin wax for this use.    </li>
            <li>This is no problem for me and the wax has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>I bought the unscented paraffin, and it is effective and soothing when melted in a paraffin bath.  </li>
            <li>It would have been nice if they were in the block form so that I can use them easier.</li>
            <li>warning would have been nice.</li>
            <li>Feels nice does what my wife wanted.</li>
            <li>I liked these because they were unscented.  </li>
            <li>Melted nice in my wax melter from another manufacturer.</li>
            <li>The price was very good and the shipping was very fast but the item description did NOT say it was antibacterial.  </li>
            <li>item is perfect in replacing old used wax in a paraffin bath for transferring heat to arthritic hands and feet</li>
            <li>I ordered this item and was kind of happy at first.</li>
            <li>Great buy and very reasonable.</li>
            <li>so I know it is very accurate.  </li>
            <li>It was plenty full with 4 of the 6 bags, so I would expect that this quantity should be good for most users.  </li>
            <li>However, the shipping charges - @ $.95 per lb. - came to $15.00 (more than the price of the product itself).</li>
            <li>ordered them for my wife and kids who love using them in their spa.  </li>
            <li>Love the size and the price.  </li>
            <li>Nothing helps more than using a hand spa with melted wax to coated our hands.  </li>
            <li>There are many scented waxes for the wax bath, not too many with unscented.</li>
            <li>This company is outstanding.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to too many fragrances</li>
            <li>andit comes off better.</li>
            <li>I love that these are unscented.  </li>
            <li>This wax is great for what its supposed to do, albeit VERY overpriced.</li>
            <li>This one was a lot better.  </li>
            <li>It helped relieve pain and made exercising my fingers better..</li>
            <li>After a short misunderstanding about the shipment size, which we straightened out with just one email, the order was perfect!  </li>
            <li>IT REALLY WORKS GREAT ON MY HANDS.</li>
            <li>Love the unscented paraffin.</li>
            <li>So The wax is ok.</li>
            <li>I love the consistency of the wax &amp; the fragrance isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li>The paraffin beads that came with my unit break apart and melt much more easily.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love my hot wax foot bath now because I can use it!</li>
            <li>This paraffin melted as expected and is of excellent quality.  </li>
            <li>It is not as soft as the wax that came with my warmer, but I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li>These worked great for my 91 year old mom in her homemedics parrafin unit.  </li>
            <li>so I can find it easily and watch for the price to drop.</li>
            <li>These blocks are convenient and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>These blocks of paraffin were good replacements for the older wax in my machine.</li>
            <li>Honestly, one brick is pretty close to another.  </li>
            <li>works fine for therabath</li>
            <li>It still seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li>Worked great to replace the wax in my machine and I have 2 1-lb packs for spares as it gets low.</li>
            <li>Works fantastic with my machine.</li>
            <li>Wish I had just got the great stuff I did last time, which I think was &amp;#34;therabath refill&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>and it fit the bill</li>
            <li>I bought these for my sister and she was happy with them.&lt;br /&gt;She said that they will take forever to melt unless you break them up into smaller pieces.</li>
            <li>Used with scened paraffin to soothe joints, smooth skin and soften my skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what it is, but when this melts, it doesn&#x27;t come out smooth no matter</li>
            <li>These are great for refills and the fact that they are unscented is definitely a plus.  </li>
            <li>This paraffin wax had a light oil in it which made my hands smoother.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making the unscented available.</li>
            <li>You can add fragrance essential oils if you like, but it is great even without them.</li>
            <li>Nice wax refill, but was very oily.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and melts relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li>UPS lost my original order.  </li>
            <li>The original wax was way better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I originally got this to lube my cast bullets.</li>
            <li>Clean out your wax bath before using for and excelletn hand or foot wax</li>
            <li>I use these to clean up my palette and brushes when I am working with encaustics...</li>
            <li>This was use to clean the tip of a glue gun.  </li>
            <li>It helps and clean itself with the glue over spray.</li>
            <li>I used the unscented paraffin and love the nice oil that is left on my hands after a treatment, which I massage in.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to scents of all kinds so was pleased to be able to find these.</li>
            <li>The light scent adds a clean fresh smell to the paraffin treatment.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find wax for my paraffin waxing spa that doesn&#x27;t have perfumes but this was perfect</li>
            <li>This wax is excellent for it&#x27;s melting quality and how long it will last before becoming unusable.  </li>
            <li>I think this is true, it definately was not blocks.  </li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used it yet, but i trust it will be as good as last year when i got some from a store.</li>
            <li>Doesnt leave a nice soft conditioned feeling.</li>
            <li>My hands are nice and soft now.</li>
            <li>Well what can I say about this other than it is a great product and serves its purpose.</li>
            <li>However, unlike the purchase price which was printed in bold type, the shipping price was not.</li>
            <li>It has no scent melts quickly ,and has moisturizer ...</li>
            <li>Great product and much cheaper than in your local store.  </li>
            <li>Ok product...but high quality</li>
            <li>and i want, i love it thanks very  much,</li>
            <li>One pound bags allows user to decide how much paraffin to melt at a time and makes it easy to add to the bath.</li>
            <li>The oil residue worked great for my dried and chapped hands.</li>
            <li>Product is worth its price.</li>
            <li>I just add my own essential oils to it to have the smell I want with no dyes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, when I ordered this paraffin, it did not say the wax was antibacterial.&lt;br /&gt;The paraffin is for my own personal use.</li>
            <li>Just a fun thing to do with lint.</li>
            <li>Nice wax, low melting point.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I bought this product thinking it was just unscented paraffin wax for my friend who is sensitive to many things.  </li>
            <li>i absolutely love this SPA experience right in my own home and even though this is not available in the store, I order it before i run out</li>
            <li>The wax is as good as any other paraffin wax.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using paraffin in my bullet lube but haven&#x27;t found the right formula.  </li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t feel right compared to my doctor&#x27;s office</li>
            <li>Just the right amount for the machine.  </li>
            <li>There is no smell, which is really important as I am very sensitive to perfumes.</li>
            <li>Expensive, but this wax works just perfectly in the hot wax machine I bought.</li>
            <li>The wax comes as chips but in Texas hot weather it will be a block when it gets to you.</li>
            <li>Needed to replenish wax in hot wax bath&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li>and I would not of had time to go to the supply house to get it before my first appt.</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying using it daily in my paraffin wax spa.</li>
            <li>It is a different weight of parafin with more oils in it for the purpose of a parafin</li>
            <li>The wax was too powerful and stirred up  my allergies too much.</li>
            <li>Purchased to refill for hot wax therapy equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It left an oil on my skin which I was able to rub in.</li>
            <li>I mixed 2 bars of unscented with one bar of scented wax and then the scent was not too overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Very soothing on arthritic hands!</li>
            <li>am using it for my hot wax hand therapy unit.  </li>
            <li>I treat my arthritic hands with hot wax.</li>
            <li>Exactly as written.</li>
            <li>,i recommend to everyone who need this,but smells funny</li>
            <li>I would be interested in trying the scented version.</li>
            <li>Since the wax bars were heavy, the seller would like to charge a good sum for the shipping if I order this by itself.  </li>
            <li>It shipped quickly and is a high quality of parafin.</li>
            <li>it seems to be softer than the other kind that came with it.</li>
            <li>I found the original wax by Conair better, but it&#x27;s not available.  </li>
            <li>This hot wax product works very well.</li>
            <li>I got it quickly, it melts well and leaves my hands soft.  </li>
            <li>Seems like it is that exact same product that originally came with my kit.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone using a hot spa.</li>
            <li>; she loves that it is so cheap and comes in such a large amount.</li>
            <li>I have an accurate cooking scale which is an electronic digital scale which will tell me when a one ounce letter is overweight</li>
            <li>and she says they work very well.</li>
            <li>This paraffin product leaves a really oily residue on the patient&#x27;s hands when the wax is removed from their hands.</li>
            <li>Very well priced and works as well as</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t really heal well, and it doesn&#x27;t peel off as well either.  </li>
            <li>This wax was VERY greasy and didn&#x27;t stick to my hands or retain heat.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had read the reviews more carefully before purchasing</li>
            <li>Thanks so much</li>
            <li>It has been very helpful for my husband&#x27;s arthritic hands.</li>
            <li>Whole bunch of wax that didn&#x27;t smell like anything.</li>
            <li>It really is helping me heal from an injury to</li>
            <li>Really works well.  </li>
            <li>thank you for everything thanks i need</li>
            <li>These did not work as well as the paraffin wax beads which melted much quicker.</li>
            <li>so I can add my own essential oils, Feels extra oily (a plus to me) and dries like the wax that came with my spa.</li>
            <li>My wife thought it was same wax as with the Thermabath original.  </li>
            <li>This product is more moisturizing than some other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>MUCH BETTER THAN OTHER &amp;#34;WAXES&amp;#34</li>
            <li>However, I found these blocks very hard to break up so that they would melt more easily.</li>
            <li>This is one of those items that was priced in a way to either trying to recoup the shipping cost for the seller, or making you to order another item less useful to qualify for free shipping.  </li>
            <li>melts nicely, came in pellets actually, not sure if that&#x27;s the norm for this listing, but if it is, I will be buying again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like this wax - it has an oily feel to it which is just different than what I&#x27;ve used before but not bad</li>
            <li>You can find much better wax elsewhere for less.</li>
            <li>A classic case of &#x27;let the buyer beware&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I got the unscented, and do not care for the smell, but it&#x27;s mild enough.  </li>
            <li>Now her hands are super supple and smooth - no more cracking and bleeding.</li>
            <li>the paraffin is of high quality and would highly recommend</li>
            <li>The shipping charges for six one-pound blocks was somewhat high.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This wax is really good, the price is right &amp; it is not a large block of wax, it is small beads that melt up faster.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of pain in left hand due to R.A. hot paraffin gives some temporary relief, so for an hour or two, I&#x27;m pain free!</li>
            <li>I have used other wax but this wax is thicker, holds in the heat, and comes off easily.  </li>
            <li>but this block takes about 2 1/2-3 hours to melt so using a new block</li>
            <li>Left them feeling smooth and younger.</li>
            <li>; FOR WE OF THE ARTHRITIS GENERATION. DOES NOT DRY OUT THE SKIN AS THE PURE WAXES DO.</li>
            <li>Makes your hands and feet feel brand new; loaded with moisture leaving your extremities extremely soft.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and slightly oily.  </li>
            <li>The paraffin leaves the hands feeling soft and not oily.</li>
            <li>my 81 year old sore thumbs</li>
            <li>FEELING MOIST AND SOFT</li>
            <li>I dumped the old, cleaned it, and replenished the unit.  </li>
            <li>So if you are sensitive to lanolin, do not purchase this.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this  to anyone who wants deep heat therapy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too soft for that.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find this product in any of the stores near me.  </li>
            <li>I made fire starters using old dryer lint and wax.</li>
            <li>It was well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>In fact, I think it&#x27;s probably better to have antibiotic properties considering the wax cools down and sits for long periods of time (unless you keep your bath on all the time).</li>
            <li>This stuff is VERY soft and melts at pretty low temperatures so just sitting on my doorstep on a 100 degree day was enough to convert them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>actually I thought I was getting blocks of parafin, but these bags of chips are fine as easier to use a half bag.  </li>
            <li>I am going to try to find the unscented paraffin beads at a local beauty supply in order to avoid the high shipping charges.</li>
            <li>The wax bars were fine, and there was not much to rate on, good or bad.  </li>
            <li>Not sure it saves any money but for some reason I enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I did not realize I was ordering so much of it and will not need to order again for a long time</li>
            <li>Exactly what we had expected.</li>
            <li>Good basic wax that doesn&#x27;t smell like fake rain :0</li>
            <li>you ever played with &amp;#34;goop&amp;#34; as a child or spilled pure glycerine on yourself, you have a rough idea of how this stuff feels.</li>
            <li>too soft to stick to hands properly</li>
            <li>This particular paraffin wax melts and resolidifies just as expected.</li>
            <li>This product was very helpful to my hand and it did not smell so that other medical problems did not start up.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a bunch of little flakes left on our hands afterwards, and it gets pretty</li>

            <li> Product good.</li>
            <li> good price on wax, but did not come with bags to wrap your hands/feet.  </li>
            <li> This wax was good for the price.  </li>

            <li> A good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> I cant speak for the smell when melted because I added scented oil to make it smell good.</li>
            <li> They arrived on time and in good shape.</li>
            <li> very good product I recommend to everyone, very good and affordable price, high quality, never regret,good,good,good,good</li>
            <li> love it works great relief</li>
            <li> I am using it much more frequently than I thought I would which make this the best product for the best price.</li>
            <li> It was 2 dollars more then the price of the product!</li>
            <li> Love the feel of this paraffin!  </li>
            <li> It is very challenging to find wax with a nice texture for hand spas.  </li>
            <li> Unscented wax is fantastic quality at a great price.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell how effective using paraffin wax for this use.    </li>
            <li> This is no problem for me and the wax has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> I bought the unscented paraffin, and it is effective and soothing when melted in a paraffin bath.  </li>
            <li> It would have been nice if they were in the block form so that I can use them easier.</li>
            <li> warning would have been nice.</li>
            <li> Feels nice does what my wife wanted.</li>
            <li> I liked these because they were unscented.  </li>
            <li> Melted nice in my wax melter from another manufacturer.</li>
            <li> The price was very good and the shipping was very fast but the item description did NOT say it was antibacterial.  </li>
            <li> item is perfect in replacing old used wax in a paraffin bath for transferring heat to arthritic hands and feet</li>
            <li> I ordered this item and was kind of happy at first.</li>
            <li> Great buy and very reasonable.</li>
            <li> so I know it is very accurate.  </li>
            <li> It was plenty full with 4 of the 6 bags, so I would expect that this quantity should be good for most users.  </li>
            <li> However, the shipping charges - @ $.95 per lb. - came to $15.00 (more than the price of the product itself).</li>
            <li> ordered them for my wife and kids who love using them in their spa.  </li>
            <li> Love the size and the price.  </li>
            <li> Nothing helps more than using a hand spa with melted wax to coated our hands.  </li>
            <li> There are many scented waxes for the wax bath, not too many with unscented.</li>
            <li> This company is outstanding.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to too many fragrances</li>
            <li> andit comes off better.</li>
            <li> I love that these are unscented.  </li>
            <li> This wax is great for what its supposed to do, albeit VERY overpriced.</li>
            <li> This one was a lot better.  </li>
            <li> It helped relieve pain and made exercising my fingers better..</li>
            <li> After a short misunderstanding about the shipment size, which we straightened out with just one email, the order was perfect!  </li>
            <li> IT REALLY WORKS GREAT ON MY HANDS.</li>
            <li> Love the unscented paraffin.</li>
            <li> So The wax is ok.</li>
            <li> I love the consistency of the wax &amp; the fragrance isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li> The paraffin beads that came with my unit break apart and melt much more easily.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love my hot wax foot bath now because I can use it!</li>
            <li> This paraffin melted as expected and is of excellent quality.  </li>
            <li> It is not as soft as the wax that came with my warmer, but I am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> These worked great for my 91 year old mom in her homemedics parrafin unit.  </li>
            <li> so I can find it easily and watch for the price to drop.</li>
            <li> These blocks are convenient and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> These blocks of paraffin were good replacements for the older wax in my machine.</li>
            <li> Honestly, one brick is pretty close to another.  </li>
            <li> works fine for therabath</li>
            <li> It still seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li> Worked great to replace the wax in my machine and I have 2 1-lb packs for spares as it gets low.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic with my machine.</li>
            <li> Wish I had just got the great stuff I did last time, which I think was &amp;#34;therabath refill&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and it fit the bill</li>
            <li> I bought these for my sister and she was happy with them.&lt;br /&gt;She said that they will take forever to melt unless you break them up into smaller pieces.</li>
            <li> Used with scened paraffin to soothe joints, smooth skin and soften my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is, but when this melts, it doesn&#x27;t come out smooth no matter</li>
            <li> These are great for refills and the fact that they are unscented is definitely a plus.  </li>
            <li> This paraffin wax had a light oil in it which made my hands smoother.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making the unscented available.</li>
            <li> You can add fragrance essential oils if you like, but it is great even without them.</li>
            <li> Nice wax refill, but was very oily.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and melts relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li> UPS lost my original order.  </li>
            <li> The original wax was way better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I originally got this to lube my cast bullets.</li>
            <li> Clean out your wax bath before using for and excelletn hand or foot wax</li>
            <li> I use these to clean up my palette and brushes when I am working with encaustics...</li>
            <li> This was use to clean the tip of a glue gun.  </li>
            <li> It helps and clean itself with the glue over spray.</li>
            <li> I used the unscented paraffin and love the nice oil that is left on my hands after a treatment, which I massage in.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to scents of all kinds so was pleased to be able to find these.</li>
            <li> The light scent adds a clean fresh smell to the paraffin treatment.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find wax for my paraffin waxing spa that doesn&#x27;t have perfumes but this was perfect</li>
            <li> This wax is excellent for it&#x27;s melting quality and how long it will last before becoming unusable.  </li>
            <li> I think this is true, it definately was not blocks.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it yet, but i trust it will be as good as last year when i got some from a store.</li>
            <li> Doesnt leave a nice soft conditioned feeling.</li>
            <li> My hands are nice and soft now.</li>
            <li> Well what can I say about this other than it is a great product and serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> However, unlike the purchase price which was printed in bold type, the shipping price was not.</li>
            <li> It has no scent melts quickly ,and has moisturizer ...</li>
            <li> Great product and much cheaper than in your local store.  </li>
            <li> Ok product...but high quality</li>
            <li> and i want, i love it thanks very  much,</li>
            <li> One pound bags allows user to decide how much paraffin to melt at a time and makes it easy to add to the bath.</li>
            <li> The oil residue worked great for my dried and chapped hands.</li>
            <li> Product is worth its price.</li>
            <li> I just add my own essential oils to it to have the smell I want with no dyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, when I ordered this paraffin, it did not say the wax was antibacterial.&lt;br /&gt;The paraffin is for my own personal use.</li>
            <li> Just a fun thing to do with lint.</li>
            <li> Nice wax, low melting point.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it was just unscented paraffin wax for my friend who is sensitive to many things.  </li>
            <li> i absolutely love this SPA experience right in my own home and even though this is not available in the store, I order it before i run out</li>
            <li> The wax is as good as any other paraffin wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using paraffin in my bullet lube but haven&#x27;t found the right formula.  </li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t feel right compared to my doctor&#x27;s office</li>
            <li> Just the right amount for the machine.  </li>
            <li> There is no smell, which is really important as I am very sensitive to perfumes.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but this wax works just perfectly in the hot wax machine I bought.</li>
            <li> The wax comes as chips but in Texas hot weather it will be a block when it gets to you.</li>
            <li> Needed to replenish wax in hot wax bath&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li> and I would not of had time to go to the supply house to get it before my first appt.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying using it daily in my paraffin wax spa.</li>
            <li> It is a different weight of parafin with more oils in it for the purpose of a parafin</li>
            <li> The wax was too powerful and stirred up  my allergies too much.</li>
            <li> Purchased to refill for hot wax therapy equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It left an oil on my skin which I was able to rub in.</li>
            <li> I mixed 2 bars of unscented with one bar of scented wax and then the scent was not too overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very soothing on arthritic hands!</li>
            <li> am using it for my hot wax hand therapy unit.  </li>
            <li> I treat my arthritic hands with hot wax.</li>
            <li> Exactly as written.</li>
            <li> ,i recommend to everyone who need this,but smells funny</li>
            <li> I would be interested in trying the scented version.</li>
            <li> Since the wax bars were heavy, the seller would like to charge a good sum for the shipping if I order this by itself.  </li>
            <li> It shipped quickly and is a high quality of parafin.</li>
            <li> it seems to be softer than the other kind that came with it.</li>
            <li> I found the original wax by Conair better, but it&#x27;s not available.  </li>
            <li> This hot wax product works very well.</li>
            <li> I got it quickly, it melts well and leaves my hands soft.  </li>
            <li> Seems like it is that exact same product that originally came with my kit.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone using a hot spa.</li>
            <li> ; she loves that it is so cheap and comes in such a large amount.</li>
            <li> I have an accurate cooking scale which is an electronic digital scale which will tell me when a one ounce letter is overweight</li>
            <li> and she says they work very well.</li>
            <li> This paraffin product leaves a really oily residue on the patient&#x27;s hands when the wax is removed from their hands.</li>
            <li> Very well priced and works as well as</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t really heal well, and it doesn&#x27;t peel off as well either.  </li>
            <li> This wax was VERY greasy and didn&#x27;t stick to my hands or retain heat.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had read the reviews more carefully before purchasing</li>
            <li> Thanks so much</li>
            <li> It has been very helpful for my husband&#x27;s arthritic hands.</li>
            <li> Whole bunch of wax that didn&#x27;t smell like anything.</li>
            <li> It really is helping me heal from an injury to</li>
            <li> Really works well.  </li>
            <li> thank you for everything thanks i need</li>
            <li> These did not work as well as the paraffin wax beads which melted much quicker.</li>
            <li> so I can add my own essential oils, Feels extra oily (a plus to me) and dries like the wax that came with my spa.</li>
            <li> My wife thought it was same wax as with the Thermabath original.  </li>
            <li> This product is more moisturizing than some other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> MUCH BETTER THAN OTHER &amp;#34;WAXES&amp;#34</li>
            <li> However, I found these blocks very hard to break up so that they would melt more easily.</li>
            <li> This is one of those items that was priced in a way to either trying to recoup the shipping cost for the seller, or making you to order another item less useful to qualify for free shipping.  </li>
            <li> melts nicely, came in pellets actually, not sure if that&#x27;s the norm for this listing, but if it is, I will be buying again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like this wax - it has an oily feel to it which is just different than what I&#x27;ve used before but not bad</li>
            <li> You can find much better wax elsewhere for less.</li>
            <li> A classic case of &#x27;let the buyer beware&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I got the unscented, and do not care for the smell, but it&#x27;s mild enough.  </li>
            <li> Now her hands are super supple and smooth - no more cracking and bleeding.</li>
            <li> the paraffin is of high quality and would highly recommend</li>
            <li> The shipping charges for six one-pound blocks was somewhat high.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This wax is really good, the price is right &amp; it is not a large block of wax, it is small beads that melt up faster.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of pain in left hand due to R.A. hot paraffin gives some temporary relief, so for an hour or two, I&#x27;m pain free!</li>
            <li> I have used other wax but this wax is thicker, holds in the heat, and comes off easily.  </li>
            <li> but this block takes about 2 1/2-3 hours to melt so using a new block</li>
            <li> Left them feeling smooth and younger.</li>
            <li> ; FOR WE OF THE ARTHRITIS GENERATION. DOES NOT DRY OUT THE SKIN AS THE PURE WAXES DO.</li>
            <li> Makes your hands and feet feel brand new; loaded with moisture leaving your extremities extremely soft.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and slightly oily.  </li>
            <li> The paraffin leaves the hands feeling soft and not oily.</li>
            <li> my 81 year old sore thumbs</li>
            <li> FEELING MOIST AND SOFT</li>
            <li> I dumped the old, cleaned it, and replenished the unit.  </li>
            <li> So if you are sensitive to lanolin, do not purchase this.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this  to anyone who wants deep heat therapy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soft for that.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this product in any of the stores near me.  </li>
            <li> I made fire starters using old dryer lint and wax.</li>
            <li> It was well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> In fact, I think it&#x27;s probably better to have antibiotic properties considering the wax cools down and sits for long periods of time (unless you keep your bath on all the time).</li>
            <li> This stuff is VERY soft and melts at pretty low temperatures so just sitting on my doorstep on a 100 degree day was enough to convert them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> actually I thought I was getting blocks of parafin, but these bags of chips are fine as easier to use a half bag.  </li>
            <li> I am going to try to find the unscented paraffin beads at a local beauty supply in order to avoid the high shipping charges.</li>
            <li> The wax bars were fine, and there was not much to rate on, good or bad.  </li>
            <li> Not sure it saves any money but for some reason I enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I did not realize I was ordering so much of it and will not need to order again for a long time</li>
            <li> Exactly what we had expected.</li>
            <li> Good basic wax that doesn&#x27;t smell like fake rain :0</li>
            <li> you ever played with &amp;#34;goop&amp;#34; as a child or spilled pure glycerine on yourself, you have a rough idea of how this stuff feels.</li>
            <li> too soft to stick to hands properly</li>
            <li> This particular paraffin wax melts and resolidifies just as expected.</li>
            <li> This product was very helpful to my hand and it did not smell so that other medical problems did not start up.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a bunch of little flakes left on our hands afterwards, and it gets pretty</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, leave it on for at least 10 minutes</li>
            <li> It took a long time to receive and I only hope it didn&#x27;t ruin my spa.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> how long it&#x27;s been sitting in the paraffin machine, I&#x27;m not recommending this.  </li>
            <li> This saves my hands all year long!</li>
            <li> THE WAX TREATMENT IS ALSO BENEFICIAL FOR DRY, CRACKED SKIN OF HANDS AND FEET.</li>
            <li> THE TREATMENT LEAVES DRY SKIN</li>
            <li> The last one I got, by Homedics, was too soft and thick on the hands.  </li>
            <li> Old was was pretty dirty.  </li>
            <li> Her hands were dry, cracking, bleeding and rough before she began dipping her hands.</li>
            <li> and the paraffin refills for his paraffin bath are super expensive elsewhere.</li>
            <li> It is a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> of Paraffin wax I expected to be charged for that weight.</li>
            <li> I am not comfortable using anything that contains Triclosan, which has been linked to antibacterial resistance, and in a recent study was shown to restrict muscle performance in mice and fish.</li>
            <li> Not very theuroputic.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about it.  </li>
            <li> I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR ANYONE WITH HAND JOINT DAMAGE DUE TO INJURY OR ARTHRITIS.  </li>
            <li> extremely greasy when peeled from the hands - feels as if soaked with oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like that the wax comes in small compartment-sized packages so that I only need to use what I need.</li>
            <li> The product I received was \\&quot;antibacterial\\&quot; paraffin, which has Triclosan listed as the active ingredient.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This may have been slightly cheaper, and I was to lazy to look at my history, and besides all unscented paraffin wax is the same, isn&#x27;t it?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard finding additional blocks of paraffin for a machine you purchased earlier.</li>
            <li> Wax was slightly mashed and soiled, but usable.</li>
            <li> Added half a pound by just breaking it in half.  </li>
            <li> Melts quickly, no odor.  </li>
            <li> it doesnt make a mess when I peel it off.</li>
            <li> It pulls off while putting on the liners and just winds up a mess.</li>
            <li> the wax was in little round pellets so it was easier and quicker to melt.</li>
            <li> This is not your everyday paraffin was.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like going through the trouble of returning them, so I will keep it</li>
            <li> The texture is a little different for the pellets...not bad just different.</li>
            <li> Not really sure what else can be said about it, would order again.</li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to find in retail stores where I live.</li>
            <li> Due to the cold weather my hands get very dry.  </li>
            <li> I see at least a couple of people complaining about it being beads instead of blocks.  </li>
            <li> Wax is thick after two to three dips.</li>
            <li> This was lots less expensive than the name brand and works just as well at the name brand.</li>
            <li> It does wpnders for my teenage daughter, who has painful tendonitus in both hands.</li>
            <li> Packaging was broken.  </li>
            <li> poor heat retention&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used this in a paraffin bath process for broken fingers.</li>
            <li> I just not happy that its antibacterial and won&#x27;t buy it again for this reason.</li>
            <li> In cold weather our hands get dry, chapped and cold.  </li>
            <li> Giving one * because the product failed to perform.</li>
            <li> It stinks.  </li>
            <li> UNHappy Customer</li>
            <li> I use it alot to help my arthritis during this cold weather.</li>
            <li> I took away one star because it put me, the buyer in a awkward position.  </li>
            <li> it stinks... badly.</li>
            <li> He has really bad arthritis in his hands.</li>
            <li> Helps to ease painful joints.</li>
            <li> These took forever to get to me and once they did I was disappointed with my purchase.</li>
            <li> three times and stopped, as it is so annoying to use it.</li>
            <li> stuff is slimy, nasty wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product.</li>
            <li> Also, the wax in the container smells terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Worked great to replace the wax in my machine and I have 2 1-lb packs for spares as it gets low.</li>
            <li> The product does its job but it leaves a film on my hands that  takes a lot of massaging to get  off and then I still have to use a towel to get the rest off..I will not buy this product again</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. Works fantastic with my machine. Would like to try one of the scented wax refills next.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend and she says they work very well. Great buy for the price and quality.</li>
            <li> Well what can I say about this other than it is a great product and serves its purpose. Great buy and very reasonable. I think I will try the scented next time.</li>
            <li> Wish I had just got the great stuff I did last time, which I think was &amp;#34;therabath refill&amp;#34;. Instead, I got this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may have been slightly cheaper, and I was to lazy to look at my history, and besides all unscented paraffin wax is the same, isn&#x27;t it? Nope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is slimy, nasty wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you ever played with &amp;#34;goop&amp;#34; as a child or spilled pure glycerine on yourself, you have a rough idea of how this stuff feels. I&#x27;m getting the &amp;#34;eww&amp;#34; shivers just thinking back on using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yuck. Yuck. Yuck. Yuck. Yuck.</li>
            <li> I bought a 6 pound order.  When it came I weighed every 1 pound pack it weighed 15 3/8 ounces for 5 packs and one weighed 15 1/2 ounces.  I have an accurate cooking scale which is an electronic digital scale which will tell me when a one ounce letter is overweight so I know it is very accurate.  Don&#x27;t have my recommendation if they cheat n the eight.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product. It doesn&#x27;t set up. It&#x27;s incredibly oily. It stinks.  It is a total waste of money. It took a long time to receive and I only hope it didn&#x27;t ruin my spa.</li>
            <li> My wife thought it was same wax as with the Thermabath original.  Definitely not the same.  Will reorder from manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but this wax works just perfectly in the hot wax machine I bought. There is no smell, which is really important as I am very sensitive to perfumes.</li>
            <li> actually I thought I was getting blocks of parafin, but these bags of chips are fine as easier to use a half bag.  the package came fast-I would order from this seller again. No complaints</li>
            <li> Loved the wax, except the parafin bath I purchased two weeks ago is not working.  Now I have the wax in the machine and cannot use it!</li>
            <li> The product works as it should and had no problems with the order or company that shipped product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using paraffin in my bullet lube but haven&#x27;t found the right formula.  Maybe I&#x27;ll have to make some candels with this instead.</li>
            <li> I have been waiting patiently for the paraffin wax but none has been delivered as yet.    The order was placed on October 26, 2009.  I tracked the order and it only shows there was an Attempt to deliver this package on November 2, 2009.    It is now Friday, November 27, 2009, and no product.        I haven&#x27;t checked yet to see if my credit card was charged, but I bet it was.       [[ASIN:B0008GGH58 Paraffin Wax Refills - Unscented - 6 lb pkg]]        UNHappy Customer</li>
            <li> what can I say? Great packaging, it moisturizes the hands well and you can melt it over and over again!</li>
            <li> The paraffin is, well, paraffin. The light scent adds a clean fresh smell to the paraffin treatment. The paraffin leaves the hands feeling soft and not oily.</li>
            <li> When I ordered 6 lbs. of Paraffin wax I expected to be charged for that weight. However, the shipping charges - @ $.95 per lb. - came to $15.00 (more than the price of the product itself). Later, when reviewing the order I saw that if fact, this was the price they stated on the order preview. However, unlike the purchase price which was printed in bold type, the shipping price was not. And so of course, I missed it. A classic case of &#x27;let the buyer beware&#x27;. And by the way - why does it take 4 lbs. of packaging to ship 6 lbs. of anything?</li>
            <li> Got them in good time and they are in the machine and great that they are unscented as he is using the machine for arthritis of his hands.  Too soon to tell how effective using paraffin wax for this use.    Lynne Weis</li>
            <li> I ordered this item and was kind of happy at first.Product is worth its price. Then I decided to reorder it ones again and checked the shipping cost.It was 2 dollars more then the price of the product! Would have to look for something else.</li>
            <li> This paraffin product leaves a really oily residue on the patient&#x27;s hands when the wax is removed from their hands.</li>
            <li> love it works great relief</li>
            <li> I was expecting to get the bricks, that&#x27;s what is pictured, but got pellets. The texture is a little different for the pellets...not bad just different. If I can&#x27;t find the brick style would order this again.</li>
            <li> The wax comes as chips but in Texas hot weather it will be a block when it gets to you. This is no problem for me and the wax has a nice smell. Good value for the money</li>
            <li> Product good. Packaging was broken.  Wax was slightly mashed and soiled, but usable. I accepted it anyway.</li>
            <li> This saves my hands all year long! Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find wax for my paraffin waxing spa that doesn&#x27;t have perfumes but this was perfect</li>
            <li> Good basic wax that doesn&#x27;t smell like fake rain :0 Very well priced and works as well as the stuff you buy at salons. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Needed to replenish wax in hot wax bath&lt;br /&gt;for my 81 year old sore thumbs and it fit the bill&lt;br /&gt;nicely.</li>
            <li> It takes quite a while to melt but is wonderful on the hands.</li>
            <li> I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR ANYONE WITH HAND JOINT DAMAGE DUE TO INJURY OR ARTHRITIS.  PAIN AND SWELLING WERE GONE AFTER USING THIS PRODUCT FOR SEVERAL WEEKS.  I NOW USE IT ONCE A WEEK AS MAINTENANCE OBJECTIVE TO CONTROL/PREVENT THE PAIN AND SWELLING.  THE WAX TREATMENT IS ALSO BENEFICIAL FOR DRY, CRACKED SKIN OF HANDS AND FEET. THE TREATMENT LEAVES DRY SKIN FEELING MOIST AND SOFT WHILE ALSO HEALING CRACKS CAUSED BY OVERUSE OR ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE.</li>
            <li> good price on wax, but did not come with bags to wrap your hands/feet.  the wax was in little round pellets so it was easier and quicker to melt. wouldve been a 5 rating if they included the bags.</li>
            <li> This wax is excellent for it&#x27;s melting quality and how long it will last before becoming unusable.  I would recommend this product anyone using a wax machine.</li>
            <li> I work in a spa and need this product for when I came back from vacation and I would not of had time to go to the supply house to get it before my first appt. I ordered and it was wait at the salon when I got back from vacation</li>
            <li> This wax was good for the price.  I just add my own essential oils to it to have the smell I want with no dyes.</li>
            <li> We tried it because it was the cheapest option, and we like to buy in bulk.  I guess you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This paraffin doesn&#x27;t work like the paraffin that came with our warmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t really heal well, and it doesn&#x27;t peel off as well either.  There&#x27;s a bunch of little flakes left on our hands afterwards, and it gets pretty messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Ordered on Prime so shipping was $0.  I see at least a couple of people complaining about it being beads instead of blocks.  I think this is true, it definately was not blocks.  My recommendation for people who don&#x27;t want beads is for them to order for delivery to Arizona.  The bags that I received were essentially blocks by the time I received them.  This stuff is VERY soft and melts at pretty low temperatures so just sitting on my doorstep on a 100 degree day was enough to convert them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered them for my wife and kids who love using them in their spa.  Old was was pretty dirty.  I dumped the old, cleaned it, and replenished the unit.  It was plenty full with 4 of the 6 bags, so I would expect that this quantity should be good for most users.  Remember, it is unscented if you care.</li>
            <li> Great quality and melts nicely in our home wax machine.  So soothing for over-worked hands and feet!</li>
            <li> Love the size and the price.  We use this to make fire place starters for the winter and this ism the perfect size</li>
            <li> This wax was VERY greasy and didn&#x27;t stick to my hands or retain heat.  Also, it contains lanolin, which was not listed in the description.  So if you are sensitive to lanolin, do not purchase this.  I wish I had read the reviews more carefully before purchasing</li>
            <li> These blocks of paraffin were good replacements for the older wax in my machine. I use it alot to help my arthritis during this cold weather.</li>
            <li> Just what was needed for deep heat hand therapy . Great  price,worked with my machine perfectly. I would recommend this  to anyone who wants deep heat therapy.It has no scent melts quickly ,and has moisturizer ...</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use this product.  In cold weather our hands get dry, chapped and cold.  Nothing helps more than using a hand spa with melted wax to coated our hands.  It takes a while to melt the wax but I swear it saves our skin.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful, inexpensive product.  It has helped keep my hands and fingers from cracking in the winter.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my sister and she was happy with them.&lt;br /&gt;She said that they will take forever to melt unless you break them up into smaller pieces.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the paraffin.  I got it quickly, it melts well and leaves my hands soft.  Great price, great product.</li>
            <li> There are many scented waxes for the wax bath, not too many with unscented. This product work perfectly. Melting and remelting. Clean out your wax bath before using for and excelletn hand or foot wax</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother. She says it is awesome, also; she loves that it is so cheap and comes in such a large amount.</li>
            <li> She has an allergy to scented paraffin this did the trick  the paraffin is of high quality and would highly recommend</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome! i absolutely love this SPA experience right in my own home and even though this is not available in the store, I order it before i run out so NO worries!</li>
            <li> I would prefer scented but husband has to use also, he didn&#x27;t want scented..takes the soreness out  and heals..would not be with out</li>
            <li> Used with scened paraffin to soothe joints, smooth skin and soften my skin. Helps to ease painful joints. I like to add scented paraffin for added touch.</li>
            <li> It came as advertised and worked as specified. I am really enjoying using it daily in my paraffin wax spa.</li>
            <li> This is not your everyday paraffin was. I has a wonderful, moisturizing addition and feels so good on your hands. I highly recommend this to anyone using a hot spa.</li>
            <li> Smells good melts well but this block takes about 2 1/2-3 hours to melt so using a new block takes some planning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WRL</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard finding additional blocks of paraffin for a machine you purchased earlier. My search is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem, it says you can not add oils to it...bummer was so looking forward to a lavender or tea tree.</li>
            <li> UPS lost my original order.  ParaCare shipped a replacement overnight.  Paraffin is paraffin.  This company is outstanding.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s remarkable. Only thing to relieve some pain in hands.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is, but when this melts, it doesn&#x27;t come out smooth no matter how long it&#x27;s been sitting in the paraffin machine, I&#x27;m not recommending this.  It just doesn&#x27;t feel right compared to my doctor&#x27;s office</li>
            <li> Works great in my Wax melting kit.</li>
            <li> Love it. Price was great. Wax is so soothing. Thanks so much</li>
            <li> I finally bought myself a parafin bath for my feet, hands and elbows. This seller has a great price on the essentual product needed. It shipped quickly and is a high quality of parafin. You CAN NOT use canning wax or candles!!!! It is a different weight of parafin with more oils in it for the purpose of a parafin bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on my wish list so I can find it easily and watch for the price to drop. I am using it much more frequently than I thought I would which make this the best product for the best price.</li>
            <li> Great price must needed for paraffin treatment.</li>
            <li> I love the consistency of the wax &amp; the fragrance isn&#x27;t too strong. Wax is thick after two to three dips.</li>
            <li> The ONLY reason I gave this product such a low rating is b/c my skin does not tolerate antibacterial properties.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, when I ordered this paraffin, it did not say the wax was antibacterial.&lt;br /&gt;The paraffin is for my own personal use.</li>
            <li> Ok product...but high quality</li>
            <li> These are great for refills and the fact that they are unscented is definitely a plus.  A good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> Due to the cold weather my hands get very dry.  This paraffin wax had a light oil in it which made my hands smoother.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of pain in left hand due to R.A. hot paraffin gives some temporary relief, so for an hour or two, I&#x27;m pain free!</li>
            <li> This is one of those items that was priced in a way to either trying to recoup the shipping cost for the seller, or making you to order another item less useful to qualify for free shipping.  The wax bars were fine, and there was not much to rate on, good or bad.  I took away one star because it put me, the buyer in a awkward position.  Since the wax bars were heavy, the seller would like to charge a good sum for the shipping if I order this by itself.  So, I ended up finding something &amp;#34;not so needed&amp;#34; to order at the same time, and I felt it was a marketing ploy.</li>
            <li> This wax is great deal for what you pay. It does wpnders for my teenage daughter, who has painful tendonitus in both hands.</li>
            <li> Works great in my paraffin spa</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t make candles but I do make wood projects. The size and shape of these refills are perfect for waxing plane soles.  Mike -- [...]</li>
            <li> He has really bad arthritis in his hands. and the paraffin refills for his paraffin bath are super expensive elsewhere. so. . .I ordered him some from here. they were no different then the store stuff, except cheaper.</li>
            <li> Silky feeling on hands after use</li>
            <li> Unscented wax is fantastic quality at a great price.</li>
            <li> We use this wax in a Homedics therapeutic paraffin wax bath to dip our hand for medical reasons. Also leaves your hands softer after every use.</li>
            <li> This product works well. It is smooth and slightly oily.  It has been very helpful for my husband&#x27;s arthritic hands.</li>
            <li> I bought the unscented paraffin, and it is effective and soothing when melted in a paraffin bath.  However, I found these blocks very hard to break up so that they would melt more easily. The paraffin beads that came with my unit break apart and melt much more easily. The shipping charges for six one-pound blocks was somewhat high.  I am going to try to find the unscented paraffin beads at a local beauty supply in order to avoid the high shipping charges.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love my hot wax foot bath now because I can use it! I am allergic to too many fragrances so I couldn&#x27;t use it the way it came. The wax was too powerful and stirred up  my allergies too much. Now I use it every night!! Thank you for making the unscented available.</li>
            <li> Very nice paraffin.. This product is more moisturizing than some other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of this paraffin!  Heats up quickly, leave it on for at least 10 minutes andit comes off better.</li>
            <li> Purchased to refill for hot wax therapy equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. extremely greasy when peeled from the hands - feels as if soaked with oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. too soft to stick to hands properly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. poor heat retention&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. on removal it sticks to plastic gloves resulting in wastage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used three times and stopped, as it is so annoying to use it. The original wax was way better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product. Giving one * because the product failed to perform.</li>
            <li> I originally got this to lube my cast bullets. It&#x27;s too soft for that. Now my daughter uses it in a wax warmer. Her hands were dry, cracking, bleeding and rough before she began dipping her hands. Now her hands are super supple and smooth - no more cracking and bleeding. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The price was very good and the shipping was very fast but the item description did NOT say it was antibacterial.  You might think that if we are ordering unscented stuff that we would not want triclosan in there either.  Not the end of the world but I wouldn&#x27;t have purchsed it if I knew that stuff was in there.</li>
            <li> This paraffin melted as expected and is of excellent quality.  I will use this again in the future and recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I used this wax in my paraffin bath. It left an oil on my skin which I was able to rub in. The oil residue worked great for my dried and chapped hands. Left them feeling smooth and younger.</li>
            <li> I like this wax and the price! It is not as soft as the wax that came with my warmer, but I am happy with the results. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love that these are unscented.  I mixed 2 bars of unscented with one bar of scented wax and then the scent was not too overwhelming.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Like this wax - it has an oily feel to it which is just different than what I&#x27;ve used before but not bad</li>
            <li> Melts well. Great quality  Good portions to add as needed.</li>
            <li> These took forever to get to me and once they did I was disappointed with my purchase. I won&#x27;t be ordering this specific type again.</li>
            <li> This came in 6 1lb pags of parafin beads. Tiny beads. Not the blocks that it looks like. It would have been nice if they were in the block form so that I can use them easier. I use these to clean up my palette and brushes when I am working with encaustics... I don&#x27;t feel like going through the trouble of returning them, so I will keep it ....... I guess..... and just figure out how to work around the fact that it&#x27;s not in solid blocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some warning would have been nice.</li>
            <li> ...it stinks... badly. This wax is great for what its supposed to do, albeit VERY overpriced. Also, the wax in the container smells terrible. I cant speak for the smell when melted because I added scented oil to make it smell good. You can find much better wax elsewhere for less. I would keep looking and pass this one by.</li>
            <li> Makes your hands and feet feel brand new; loaded with moisture leaving your extremities extremely soft.</li>
            <li> works fine for therabath</li>
            <li> I order these \\&quot;unscented Paraffin wax refills,\\&quot; but the product I received differs from the product description (I haven&#x27;t actually used the product).  The product I received was \\&quot;antibacterial\\&quot; paraffin, which has Triclosan listed as the active ingredient.  Had I know this was \\&quot;antibacterial\\&quot; paraffin I would not have placed the order.  I am not comfortable using anything that contains Triclosan, which has been linked to antibacterial resistance, and in a recent study was shown to restrict muscle performance in mice and fish.</li>
            <li> I like that the wax comes in small compartment-sized packages so that I only need to use what I need.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the purchase because I have allergies so using the unscented products are best for me. I was happy to find the unscented wax.</li>
            <li> These blocks are convenient and easy to use.  They are unscented, which helps me because I am not into scented candles or perfumes.</li>
            <li> This was lots less expensive than the name brand and works just as well at the name brand. I just wish they would melt quicker!</li>
            <li> This was use to clean the tip of a glue gun.  It helps and clean itself with the glue over spray.</li>
            <li> Best price for paraffin unscented wax.  The wax is as good as any other paraffin wax. I believe paraffin wax is paraffin wax. Product came in six individual 1lb. packs which makes it convenient to add to the Hand Wax Bath.  Added half a pound by just breaking it in half.  Prime Amazon shipping is excellent.  Ordered the product on Monday and received it on Wednesday.</li>
            <li> item is perfect in replacing old used wax in a paraffin bath for transferring heat to arthritic hands and feet</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind that these are antibiotic. It still seems to work just fine. In fact, I think it&#x27;s probably better to have antibiotic properties considering the wax cools down and sits for long periods of time (unless you keep your bath on all the time).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what we had hoped.  Unscented it is!</li>
            <li> These worked great for my 91 year old mom in her homemedics parrafin unit.  Very soothing on arthritic hands!</li>
            <li> MUCH BETTER THAN OTHER &amp;#34;WAXES&amp;#34; FOR WE OF THE ARTHRITIS GENERATION. DOES NOT DRY OUT THE SKIN AS THE PURE WAXES DO.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this product in any of the stores near me.  I use the wax for arthritis therapy for my hands.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the peach paraffin that came with the Thermal Spa unit. I used the unscented paraffin and love the nice oil that is left on my hands after a treatment, which I massage in. Since I am using the spa unit for physical therapy after hand surgery, I decided to avoid the scented paraffin for now.</li>
            <li> Whole bunch of wax that didn&#x27;t smell like anything. Not really sure what else can be said about it, would order again.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it yet, but i trust it will be as good as last year when i got some from a store.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long. Doesnt leave a nice soft conditioned feeling. Dries out my skin. Also one on the boxes (1/2 my order) was wintergreen scented rather than unscented. What do you suggest?</li>
            <li> This wax is really good, the price is right &amp; it is not a large block of wax, it is small beads that melt up faster.</li>
            <li> ordered this to go with waxwell heat machine and this works perfectly with it and melted just like it was suppose to</li>
            <li> Works well for me.  I will get this product again once I deplete this shipment.&lt;br /&gt;I am using it for my hot wax hand therapy unit.  It really is helping me heal from an injury to&lt;br /&gt;my wrist.</li>
            <li> They arrived on time and in good shape. I made fire starters using old dryer lint and wax. I put the lint in cardboard egg cartons and fill with wax. It makes great fire starters and I go camping a lot. Just a fun thing to do with lint. Not sure it saves any money but for some reason I enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I have used other wax but this wax is thicker, holds in the heat, and comes off easily.  I also like it unscented.</li>
            <li> I just bought this paraffin, and I was amazed because there is a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it woks great to hydrate skin.</li>
            <li> I was having a lot pain on my elbow and ultrasound and Tens unit did not work for me...But the paraffin did great for me!! no pain anymore!! and it is very good price comparing to the others on the market.</li>
            <li> It is very challenging to find wax with a nice texture for hand spas.  The last one I got, by Homedics, was too soft and thick on the hands.  This one was a lot better.  I found the original wax by Conair better, but it&#x27;s not available.  I got the unscented, and do not care for the smell, but it&#x27;s mild enough.  I may get scented next time.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and melts relatively quickly.  One pound bags allows user to decide how much paraffin to melt at a time and makes it easy to add to the bath.</li>
            <li> Nice wax, low melting point. Worth the money. I would buy it again and will when I need it.  A+</li>
            <li> Great product and much cheaper than in your local store.  Seems like it is that exact same product that originally came with my kit.</li>
            <li> Feels nice does what my wife wanted.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it was just unscented paraffin wax for my friend who is sensitive to many things.  On the packaging it states: Paraffin, Mineral Oil, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, Lanolin, Soybean Oil.  So it may be unscented but I don&#x27;t want these others additions.  The product details did not disclose this.</li>
            <li> I treat my arthritic hands with hot wax. I purchased this wax because I didn&#x27;t want the &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; scent of the wax that came with my melting pot.&lt;br /&gt;  It works for my hands, and I&#x27;ve also used it to wax the string on my compound bow.</li>
            <li> A great product. Will purchase again</li>
            <li> Exactly what we had expected.</li>
            <li> have not used yet, but expect it is a quality product</li>
            <li> My hands are nice and soft now.</li>
            <li> Used this in a paraffin bath process for broken fingers. It helped relieve pain and made exercising my fingers better..</li>
            <li> Really works well.  Melts quickly, no odor.  Just the right amount for the machine.  Packed and shipped well to my home.</li>
            <li> This is a great refill for your paraffin bath.  You can add fragrance essential oils if you like, but it is great even without them.</li>
            <li> After a short misunderstanding about the shipment size, which we straightened out with just one email, the order was perfect!  Price was excellent, ship time was expedient.</li>
            <li> THE UNSCENTED PARAFFIN IS GREAT. I HAVE SEVERE ARTHRITIS IN MY HANDS SO WHEN I MELT IT IN MY  MACHINE IT REALLY WORKS GREAT ON MY HANDS. IT WARMS UP THE HANDS WHEN MELTED.</li>
            <li> Exactly as written. 6Lb&#x27;s of paraffin wax to use in a warmer if you already have one.</li>
            <li> melts nicely, came in pellets actually, not sure if that&#x27;s the norm for this listing, but if it is, I will be buying again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to get the paraffin baths that have a temp control.</li>
            <li> This hot wax product works very well. Besides smoothing your skin, the heated wax helps me with aches and pains of arthritis.</li>
            <li> Love the unscented paraffin. It is almost impossible to find in retail stores where I live.</li>
            <li> I got this for my foot wax warmer. it seems to be softer than the other kind that came with it. I like that it is softer it doesnt make a mess when I peel it off.</li>
            <li> very good product I recommend to everyone, very good and affordable price, high quality, never regret,good,good,good,good,i recommend to everyone who need this,but smells funny but its doesn&#x27;t bother</li>
            <li> thank you for everything thanks i need and i want, i love it thanks very  much, appretiation i like me</li>
            <li> I liked these because they were unscented.  I am sensitive to scents of all kinds so was pleased to be able to find these.</li>
            <li> Great quality product</li>
            <li> This product was very helpful to my hand and it did not smell so that other medical problems did not start up.  It was well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> There is an additive in this paraffin that causes it to not &amp;#34;set up&amp;#34; on the skin.  It pulls off while putting on the liners and just winds up a mess.</li>
            <li> Not very theuroputic.  Through out and ordered from my regular supplier.</li>
            <li> VERY NICE PARAFFIN WAX. DOES THE JOB</li>
            <li> These did not work as well as the paraffin wax beads which melted much quicker. I did not realize I was ordering so much of it and will not need to order again for a long time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s paraffin.  Honestly, one brick is pretty close to another.  There&#x27;s not much to say about it.  This particular paraffin wax melts and resolidifies just as expected.</li>
            <li> Do not like it as well as the HoMedic because it leaves an oily feel when done and does not peel away from hands as well after use.</li>
            <li> Nice wax refill, but was very oily. Melted nice in my wax melter from another manufacturer. I would be interested in trying the scented version.</li>
            <li> So The wax is ok. No smell to it so I can add my own essential oils, Feels extra oily (a plus to me) and dries like the wax that came with my spa. I just not happy that its antibacterial and won&#x27;t buy it again for this reason.</li>
