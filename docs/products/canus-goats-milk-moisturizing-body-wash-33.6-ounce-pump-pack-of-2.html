            <li>I bought this because I saw the good reviews on Amazon</li>
            <li>Probably a good reason not to use this ...</li>
            <li>Plus it smells good</li>
            <li>Dont be fooled in thinking this soap is organic or even good for your skin because it contains Methylparaben.</li>
            <li>It also has a mild scent that is very pleasant.</li>
            <li>So glad to find this on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Its a great product with a definitely cool smell</li>
            <li>Honestly, the soap&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I am 69 years old and have used many products but this is the best ever.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend prefers dial, that fine, more for me!  </li>
            <li>Since we switched her to the Lil Goats milk, she is totally fine!</li>
            <li>and they all use it and love it.</li>
            <li>The body lotion is my favorite daily moisturizer and the soap pump is wonderful in my kitchen and powder room!</li>
            <li>I love the Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk wash and the body lotion too.</li>
            <li>and my husband love it, too.</li>
            <li>For anyone with many skin allergies this is a miracle in my book.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to order more.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I am 100% satisfied.   </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>The body wash is very rich and creamy.</li>
            <li>Rich, moisturizing, nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is rich, moisturizing and I love the clean smell!!  </li>
            <li>I am going against the grain, but no one in my house likes the scent (original)!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering; it&#x27;s not feminine or masculine; and it doesn&#x27;t stay with you (which: great, if you wear scented lotions and/or perfume/cologne).</li>
            <li>Oh and since loving these so much the entire family now uses all the Canus products and we LOVE then too!!!!</li>
            <li>Its very gentle on my skin and leaves me feeling super clean and smelling great.</li>
            <li>In fact it smells a bit sophisticated yet not contrived, and that&#x27;s what I love most about it.</li>
            <li>the Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Body Wash. It smells amazing and really makes you feel clean!</li>
            <li>- The scent is fine.</li>
            <li>I take a shower, use the body wash, and welcome back grime, my you haven&#x27;t changed.</li>
            <li>I did wash my hands with it and the quality of the soap seems nice, as it really softened my hands.  </li>
            <li>Amazon.com is a great place to order from, fast service,packed very well.</li>
            <li>The original fragrance doesn&#x27;t overpower so you can still use your perfume of choice.</li>
            <li>(i get the original scent).</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Even so I prefer to use it in the morning because it leaves my skin feeling VERY clean and its scent is appropriate for a man (or woman) -compared to most commercial brands, that is.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin and very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>However, this works great and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily or dry--</li>
            <li>This is a great producd,I have dry skin problem &amp; this is a great body wash for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>So, to make sure the whole family was using soap that wouldn&#x27;t bother her we switched to</li>
            <li>Canus Li&#x27;l Goat&#x27;s Milk Baby Wipes, 80-Count Tub (Pack of 4)]]We use all the baby products for my grandson but we have used the wipes since birth and he is 16 months old and has never had a rash of any kind.</li>
            <li>I would for sure recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin or anyone that wants a great natural product that gives you the softest skin ever!</li>
            <li>I love their service thanks very much.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, so many \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; soaps don&#x27;t fare well with my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the Canus Goat Milk products I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>The reviewer who said it smells like goat&#x27;s milk might have a more sensitive nose than me, because I don&#x27;t think it smells like goat&#x27;s milk.</li>
            <li>So the tub will get cleaned, and it&#x27;s nice, white, and sparkly.</li>
            <li>The fresh odor is intoxicating, too.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>so one of the bottles leaked when I received them, not very bad leak, but</li>
            <li>It smells like very light scent of lavendar and give me enough moisture in the winter days</li>
            <li>I am very pleased that Canus is eliminating the parabens from their products and going all natural, although this particular product was NOT the all natural one.  </li>
            <li>After unlocking the pump on the first bottle, I thought, \\&quot;Huh.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>You end up with super soft skin and no irritation!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this body wash since February 2010, when I first purchased it (thanks for reminding me, Amazon).</li>
            <li>My son and I have super sensitive skin (he has excema)</li>
            <li>It says is all natural, soap free, rich in aloe and oatmeal to sooth dry</li>
            <li>The fragrance is fresh and natural, seems very lavender-y.</li>
            <li>This make a very usable all-in-one wash because I use it on my hair, too.  </li>
            <li>Also, product contains methylparaben which can potentially cause skin damage when you&#x27;re exposed to UV light.</li>
            <li>My husband and I really enjoy this product equally.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t spend much making it.</li>
            <li>After trying several different types of wipes and diapers trying to solve my son&#x27;s diaper rash problems we tried these and within a day it vanished....and has never come back...smells nice too....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s saved me money and works better than any other soap I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I saw several five star ratings and was excited to get this body wash.  </li>
            <li>- The oils in the body wash are nice, especially if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li>Yeah, there&#x27;s a slight whiff of goat&#x27;s milk, sure, but it&#x27;s not the dominating scent in my opinion.</li>
            <li>you know maybe I was just lucky this time, I hope the seller will pack them a little better next time.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s as high as the pump gets?</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Not even body lotions that are more concentrated and rich in ingredients are this expensive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a busy gal and (b.)</li>
            <li>I have dermatitis frequently and nothing has made my skin feel so soft and supple.</li>
            <li>My husband loves it for his sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>cause I don&#x27;t want to go around smelling like old milk.</li>
            <li>I thought since it had a masculine, musky scent I would put it in my sons&#x27; bathroom, but they don&#x27;t like the scent either.</li>
            <li>Makes skin feel so soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>Still too early to say if it works well, but I won&#x27;t pay Canus prices anymore</li>
            <li>I will say that I don&#x27;t necessarily like the scent, but only because I like clean-smelling scents (think Philosophy&#x27;s Pure Grace).     </li>
            <li>I live in a northern state and used to have all sorts of dry skin problems, after using this soap, they all went away.</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona which has very hard water that is rich in minerals, and that alone tends to leave my skins dry regardless of the body wash, including this one (I imagine it works wonders elsewhere).</li>

            <li> These bottles lasted for an long time.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from Eczema in the winter and this body wash does not irritate or  dry my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is not at all dry.</li>
            <li> A little seems to go a long way too.</li>
            <li> The second bottle was the same way, so I surmised that the pump is just poorly designed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in local shops.</li>
            <li> The pump is not powerful enough to distribute the soap, which is thick.</li>
            <li> It cost me almost $30 less than the 4 that make one gallon of Canus.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Canus products for a few years now.</li>
            <li> In a few nutshells:    </li>
            <li> and it never irritated my skin even using it everyday.</li>
            <li> I mean, can you imagine lifting a 33.6-ounce bottle with wet hands?</li>
            <li> This product did very little to moisturize my skin.  </li>
            <li> I used this product for 3 consecutive years, ordering 4 each time, one per bathroom, but it became so expensive with shipping that I decided to look for a similar product.</li>
            <li> simple body wash should not be that expensive.</li>
            <li> But they&#x27;re not nice on the tub.</li>
            <li> This is expensive and not worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Both pumps arrived broken.  </li>
            <li> it stinks.</li>
            <li> When I smelled it, I was disappointed.  </li>

Rich, moisturizing, nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> This product did very little to moisturize my skin.  Also, the pump does not work well and it takes awhile to get the soap out of the bottle.  This is expensive and not worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Canus products for a few years now. It is rich, moisturizing and I love the clean smell!!  It is a steal considering the quality of the wash and quantity of the bottle.    My boyfriend prefers dial, that fine, more for me!  The packaging is another story. Both pumps arrived broken.  The seller should consider wrapping the tops in bubble wrap before shipping</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin and very moisturizing.  A little seems to go a long way too.</li>
            <li> This soap smells so good! I have very sensitive skin, so many \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; soaps don&#x27;t fare well with my skin. However, this works great and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily or dry--just right. I bought this for all the women in my family this Christmas and they all use it and love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk line of products!! It&#x27;s hard to find in local shops. The body lotion is my favorite daily moisturizer and the soap pump is wonderful in my kitchen and powder room! The original fragrance doesn&#x27;t overpower so you can still use your perfume of choice.</li>
            <li> I love the Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk wash and the body lotion too. My son and I have super sensitive skin (he has excema) and this is wonderful for our skin. You end up with super soft skin and no irritation! What a great value too! I would for sure recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin or anyone that wants a great natural product that gives you the softest skin ever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this body wash since February 2010, when I first purchased it (thanks for reminding me, Amazon). I&#x27;m only now starting to come to the end of my second bottle, and it&#x27;s looking like I won&#x27;t be buying this body wash again. In a few nutshells:    - The scent is fine. It&#x27;s not overpowering; it&#x27;s not feminine or masculine; and it doesn&#x27;t stay with you (which: great, if you wear scented lotions and/or perfume/cologne). The reviewer who said it smells like goat&#x27;s milk might have a more sensitive nose than me, because I don&#x27;t think it smells like goat&#x27;s milk. Yeah, there&#x27;s a slight whiff of goat&#x27;s milk, sure, but it&#x27;s not the dominating scent in my opinion. I will say that I don&#x27;t necessarily like the scent, but only because I like clean-smelling scents (think Philosophy&#x27;s Pure Grace).     - The pump is definitely dodgy. After unlocking the pump on the first bottle, I thought, \\&quot;Huh. That&#x27;s as high as the pump gets? Noooo. I must have a defective pump.\\&quot; Yeah, no. The second bottle was the same way, so I surmised that the pump is just poorly designed. But look, I&#x27;d rather have a dodgy pump than no pump at all. I mean, can you imagine lifting a 33.6-ounce bottle with wet hands? Look out belooooow.     - The oils in the body wash are nice, especially if you have dry skin. But they&#x27;re not nice on the tub. **And this is why I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.** The oils contribute to build-up and residue in the tub. So the tub will get cleaned, and it&#x27;s nice, white, and sparkly. I take a shower, use the body wash, and welcome back grime, my you haven&#x27;t changed. I suppose you could use a daily shower cleaner to avoid it, but (a.) I&#x27;m a busy gal and (b.) A cleaner for my cleaner? Pass.</li>
            <li> My daughter is allergic to almost every scent and every soap. Since we switched her to the Lil Goats milk, she is totally fine! So, to make sure the whole family was using soap that wouldn&#x27;t bother her we switched to the Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk Body Wash. It smells amazing and really makes you feel clean!</li>
            <li> The body wash is very rich and creamy. It smells like very light scent of lavendar and give me enough moisture in the winter days and my husband love it, too. I will definitely purchase it again. One thing I do have to mention is the item was not well protected in the shipping box, they did not secured or sealed the pump, so one of the bottles leaked when I received them, not very bad leak, but you know maybe I was just lucky this time, I hope the seller will pack them a little better next time.</li>
            <li> For anyone with many skin allergies this is a miracle in my book. I can&#x27;t wait to order more. I have dermatitis frequently and nothing has made my skin feel so soft and supple. ***** 5 stars for Canus Goats Milk Moisturizing Body Wash</li>
            <li> I bought this because I saw the good reviews on Amazon and it was a liquid bath soap. Honestly, the soap&#x27;s okay, it&#x27;s the bottle I have a problem with. The pump is not powerful enough to distribute the soap, which is thick. I&#x27;m resorting to transferring the soap to another bottle just so I have a working pump.    Also, product contains methylparaben which can potentially cause skin damage when you&#x27;re exposed to UV light. Probably a good reason not to use this ... [...]</li>
            <li> I discovered Canus Goat&#x27;s Milk products while staying at a B&amp;B in Montreal last year. I have eczema and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Plus it smells good (i get the original scent). I highly recommend these products. Anyone that I&#x27;ve let try the lotion or soap, has absolutely loved it!</li>
            <li> I live in a northern state and used to have all sorts of dry skin problems, after using this soap, they all went away. No need for lotion, no itchy back anymore. PLUS the two pack has lasted me over a year! It&#x27;s saved me money and works better than any other soap I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  I love it.  Doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry and itchy.  I&#x27;ve also introduced it to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> This is a great producd,I have dry skin problem &amp; this is a great body wash for my dry skin. I would recomend this for any one who use a body wash. Amazon.com is a great place to order from, fast service,packed very well. I love their service thanks very much.</li>
            <li> Bought this to try against Dove, supurb and not drying.  Living in the desert this helps a lot to keep the wrinkles at bay and doesn&#x27;t feel oily. Great Product!</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona which has very hard water that is rich in minerals, and that alone tends to leave my skins dry regardless of the body wash, including this one (I imagine it works wonders elsewhere). Even so I prefer to use it in the morning because it leaves my skin feeling VERY clean and its scent is appropriate for a man (or woman) -compared to most commercial brands, that is. In fact it smells a bit sophisticated yet not contrived, and that&#x27;s what I love most about it.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap. My husband loves it for his sensitive skin. It also has a mild scent that is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think the product would actually smell like goat&#x27;s milk. Ugh. I&#x27;ve tried it several times thinking my nose was off or something, but, no, it stinks. Yes, it lathers, cleans, probably moisturizes but I can&#x27;t use it cause I don&#x27;t want to go around smelling like old milk. (and the pump didn&#x27;t work)</li>
            <li> After trying several different types of wipes and diapers trying to solve my son&#x27;s diaper rash problems we tried these and within a day it vanished....and has never come back...smells nice too....LOVE THESE WIPES!!!! Oh and since loving these so much the entire family now uses all the Canus products and we LOVE then too!!!!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001E96N8O Canus Li&#x27;l Goat&#x27;s Milk Baby Wipes, 80-Count Tub (Pack of 4)]]We use all the baby products for my grandson but we have used the wipes since birth and he is 16 months old and has never had a rash of any kind. The fresh odor is intoxicating, too. Whether it&#x27;s body wash or zinc ointment or cream, you can&#x27;t miss with these products. Joyce - Oak Park IL</li>
            <li> I suffer from Eczema in the winter and this body wash does not irritate or  dry my skin.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the Body Wash after using the Lotion (which is awesome).  I was not disappointed.  It is so creamy and smells wonderful!  So glad to find this on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I am 69 years old and have used many products but this is the best ever. It leaves your skin soft and smooth. I searched for months trying to buy this in the stores but i finally found it here. I am 100% satisfied.   Joanaselbekian@aol.com</li>
            <li> I am going against the grain, but no one in my house likes the scent (original)!  I saw several five star ratings and was excited to get this body wash.  When I smelled it, I was disappointed.  I thought since it had a masculine, musky scent I would put it in my sons&#x27; bathroom, but they don&#x27;t like the scent either. I even tried to give it to a friend who said  he wouldn&#x27;t use is because he didn&#x27;t like the way it smelled. I did wash my hands with it and the quality of the soap seems nice, as it really softened my hands.  I just discovered there is a fragrance-free and like the soap enough to order it.</li>
            <li> My husband and I really enjoy this product equally.  Makes skin feel so soft and silky.  As a bonus, the pump applicator works beautifully.  I&#x27;m planning on reordering.</li>
            <li> Its very gentle on my skin and leaves me feeling super clean and smelling great. I have very sensitive skin and it never irritated my skin even using it everyday.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 3 consecutive years, ordering 4 each time, one per bathroom, but it became so expensive with shipping that I decided to look for a similar product. I ended up ordering [[ASIN:B000KHKKT4 Shikai Moisturizing Shower Gel Sandalwood -- 1 Gallon]]. It cost me almost $30 less than the 4 that make one gallon of Canus. It says is all natural, soap free, rich in aloe and oatmeal to sooth dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got it and it came well packed. Still too early to say if it works well, but I won&#x27;t pay Canus prices anymore, that&#x27;s for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A simple body wash should not be that expensive. They don&#x27;t spend much making it. Not even body lotions that are more concentrated and rich in ingredients are this expensive.</li>
            <li> Dont be fooled in thinking this soap is organic or even good for your skin because it contains Methylparaben. I will not be purchasing this soap.</li>
            <li> I was told by someone I used to work with about goats milk soap and lotion and let me tell you, this stuff is awesome! it moisturizes and cleans all at the same time. Its a great product with a definitely cool smell and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have used this for 12 months and I love it. My skin is not at all dry. I ordered 2 pack and briefly switched to a nation brand and I regret it. These bottles lasted for an long time. Great lather and quality skin care. I recommend it highly.</li>
