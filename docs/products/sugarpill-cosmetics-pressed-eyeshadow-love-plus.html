            <li>Like this one, for example] underneath their pigments to get the best colors.</li>

            <li>Always great color payoff.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also always happy to announce that it&#x27;s Vegan, if you&#x27;re into that sort of thing.</li>

            <li>very nice color.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>This is wonderful and well worth the $12.00 I paid for it.</li>
            <li>Very beautiful color and very satisfied worth the wait and purchase.</li>
            <li>what&#x27;s not to love!?</li>
            <li>I had never tried this brand before, but I&#x27;m glad I took the chance!</li>
            <li>She is completely in love and keeps sending me pictures!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard so many good things and seen so many YouTubers using sugarpill eyeshadows</li>
            <li>It arrived very quick!  </li>
            <li>I love all of the products in the Sugarpill line but this is one of my favorite shadows I own.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s SUPER pigmented and bright.</li>
            <li>the perfect red!</li>
            <li>Might buy more of this company, but atm</li>
            <li>Love all Sugerpill&#x27;s eye shadows.</li>
            <li>Great bright red eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I found it has bright pigment with staying power and is awesome for creating really fun and different eyes.</li>
            <li>I already have my eyes on about 6 more colors.</li>
            <li>and I was really impressed when I finally used some on myself.</li>
            <li>great color it stays on and very pigmented.</li>
            <li>The colour is fantastic and intense and it&#x27;s a good size!</li>
            <li>Cool!</li>
            <li>Enjoy what you see is what you get.</li>
            <li>This is Sugarpill, and Sugarpill is an amazing brand for strongly pigmented, opaque and vivid, long-lasting colors.</li>
            <li>It goes on so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>This was my first time use with this brand, and I love it.</li>
            <li>Most definitely will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li>By far the best red eyeshadow I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>I bought this for a friend who wanted a GOOD red eye shadow and specifically was looking for a cruelty free brand.</li>
            <li>I also like the idea shown in the pic - a bright blue liner on the bottom.</li>
            <li>This is a really bright red, and it goes well with gold, which I blend to create a sunset effect on my eyelids.</li>
            <li>but I personally feel like I get the most effective results out of these eyeshadows when applying Asylum over Love Plus; along with many other of Sugarpill&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>High pigment long lasting works beautifully!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have to use much to get the full color.</li>
            <li>I got to do a bold makeup look for my new englad patriots going to super bowl this Sunday.  </li>
            <li>This shadow is not intended for all over the lid - unless you are going for a stye look. :*)</li>
            <li>I will most definitely be buying this brand again.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loveee this eye shadow!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d try using the blue on the top too (with the black.)</li>
            <li>If you use an eye primer and a strong white base under this, it pops and has incredible lasting power.</li>
            <li>My girl friend loves sugar pill and so far they have yet to disappoint.</li>
            <li>I really have enough eye-shadows!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a red that does admittedly lean on pink - if you want a more fiery red then I recommend their Asylum Pigment instead -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be surprised if you can find another shadow of this quality for the price.</li>
            <li>A good shadow base first is essential to bring out the true color of the shadow.</li>
            <li>Super pigmented and really long lasting.</li>
            <li>The shade of red is perfect don&#x27;t even need a base</li>
            <li>used a white primer and the red stood out much brighter red than not using a primer.  </li>
            <li>Overall decent color payoff only concern, even with a primer it rubbed off on my upper eyelid when I wore it as a eye liner, this was after a 6-7 hour day.  </li>
            <li>And ladies if you&#x27;re really out for a festive look apply some extra long lashes with colored tips that match your liner (electric blue here.)</li>
            <li>Even with primer I have to basically put the whole container on my eyelid to get red instead of orangey pink.</li>
            <li>Used on its own, it was dark-ish red-red (no purple, no orange), fused with the other 2 colours I wore it turned a dark pink, so basically as expected!</li>
            <li>It looks to me like they have a VERY light pink and a subtle, but color staying power white under the arch of the brow - to open the eyes.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Mac, Nars etc. can cost $25 for a similar single shadow color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not necessary in the least for a impressively-pigmented color, but I highly advocate using their Matte eyeshadows [</li>
            <li> Plus there&#x27;s not much product to begin with.</li>
            <li> Of course, you need to blend it with other colors.</li>
            <li> Looks dark burgundy in package.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Looks even better over a white base and primer!</li>
            <li> but I wear it almost everyday now...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why some don&#x27;t care for this shadow, and no I don&#x27;t work for the company.</li>
            <li> The color is dull on olive toned skin.</li>
            <li> Will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> Maybe the others didn&#x27;t use a shadow base to sustain the color all night?</li>

Good stuff. Highly recommended.  [Sorry I don&#x27;t have a better picture to show it off in]</li>
            <li> I use it so often for smoky editorial eye looks</li>
            <li> Great bright red eyeshadow. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and lasts all day. Love it.</li>
            <li> This made my amber eyes pop. Loooved it !~</li>

Mac, Nars etc. can cost $25 for a similar single shadow color. And, this has a lot of product in it. It&#x27;s a sizeable container - like it looks in the pic. I&#x27;d be surprised if you can find another shadow of this quality for the price. Cheers!!</li>

Overall decent color payoff only concern, even with a primer it rubbed off on my upper eyelid when I wore it as a eye liner, this was after a 6-7 hour day.  I got to do a bold makeup look for my new englad patriots going to super bowl this Sunday.  I Would have given 4 stars IF it didn&#x27;t smudge on me.</li>
            <li> Wonderful eye shadow. I&#x27;ve been looking for red eyeshadow for ages, and I finally found one. And it&#x27;s a great product! Don&#x27;t have to use much to get the full color.</li>
