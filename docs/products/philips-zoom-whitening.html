            <li> Works great. I used to get this from my dentist but now he charges $100. I use it every 3 months for 3 consecutive days to keep my teeth white</li>
            <li> Great whitener if you have bleaching trays.</li>
            <li> Phillips Zoom Day White Gel is my favorite product to use to whiten my teeth.  I use it in trays that I got from my dentist.  It works better than the crest white strips. I used it for two weeks, and my teeth look great!!</li>
            <li> It whitens teeth very fast, however may leave you sensitiveness.&lt;br /&gt;I used it once in a while, i couldn&#x27;t use it every day, my teeth hurts for 24h</li>
            <li> Work fantastic, hurt the first few times.</li>
            <li> This whitening kit works really well.  I used it for about a week and a half, in trays that were fit to my mouth.  I could tell a definite difference in the whiteness of my teeth, and the product did not create any noticeable sensitivity.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Careful!!!Product was two months away from being expired when it arrived. Very disappointing! For a little more money, I could have bought the same (AND newer) product from my dentist!</li>
            <li> This product works quickly to remove coffee stains from my teeth.</li>
            <li> This may be a good product but it just didn&#x27;t work for me. I used bleaching trays that were custom made by my orthodontist. When I used this I noticed a very slight whitening on part of my teeth but I didn&#x27;t get the level of whitening that I wanted. The only upside is that I have sensitive teeth and this didn&#x27;t cause any issues. Maybe I just have hard to bleach teeth.</li>
            <li> Substantial savings over purchasing at my dental office. Great quality. Genuine Philips.</li>
            <li> This whitener was recommended by my dentist. Purchasing it through their office was much more expensive than ordering it through Amazon.  So I am a repeat purchaser! And, it works well.</li>
            <li> This is the same exact product that I get from my dentist at half the price! Use it twice a day for 15 minutes in whitening trays for white teeth. I use one tube every 3 months to keep the original whitening done by my dentist.</li>
            <li> Zoom Whitening worked great, my teeth were pretty yellow.I  was surprised how quick it worked. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Periodic use, as directed, maintains teeth whiteness superbly.  One caution:  the material works best after initial bleaching process by a dentist.</li>
            <li> This product has worked great in the past, but this last order I received doesn&#x27;t seem to have much power.  I drink a lot of coffee, so I use this about once a year for the last 4 or 5 years to whiten my teeth back up.  It usually works great, so I must have got a bad batch.  I couldn&#x27;t tell if the box I got was expired or not because there was a sticker placed over the expiration date and I wasn&#x27;t able to get the sticker off without the expiration date coming with it.</li>
            <li> Very good stregnth *****WARNING****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DONOT under no circumstances brush or floss immediately BEFORE using this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made this mistake and I accidentally flossed to firmly and cut or somehow injured my gum to tooth border and when I did this treatment the bubbles migrated INTO and under surface of gum and made it white and painfull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was like Hell Fire and Brimb Stone in my gum .... no lie</li>
            <li> This is the same stuff for which my dentist charges twice as much, so the price is right! However, I&#x27;ve noticed on several tubes that there&#x27;s sometimes an air bubble, so as you&#x27;re putting the whitener in the teeth mold the plunger will advance without dispensing whitener, so you may end up one or two teeth &amp;#34;short&amp;#34;. Philips ought to make sure the vials are bubble-free, it shouldn&#x27;t be that difficult...</li>
            <li> In a word:  PAINFUL!!!!  Burned beyond my tolerance level, and temporarily bleached my gums white!  Awful!  Returned it for the 22% Night White.  Waaaay better!  No issues.</li>
            <li> I actually got this from the dentist. paid like $100 for it. my teeth were like beigy yellow. I whitened them followed instructions. used every day In the mouth tray for 1/2 hour. after 2 weeks. my teeth were noticeably 4 or 5 shades lighter. not like super white but like pearly white I would say... it is pretty close to being white .  I am impressed. after I got them whitened I got my 2 front teeth bonded. and removed the old bonding. ( bonded teeth do not whiten so my 2 front bonded beige teeth looked stupid compared to my other white teeth until I just got them bonded my teeth looked good now. I will get this online from now on though. was $100 at the dentist.</li>
            <li> This product worked wonderfully for me.  I used it twice a day for 20 minutes each time over a period of 4 days and my teeth are white again!&lt;br /&gt;My front teeth are not perfectly flat; they have a small indented ridge up the middle of each tooth so I put the drops of whitener more toward the front of my molds and the whitener filled into the ridges perfectly.</li>
            <li> Can purchase here vs the Dentist which sells for double this price. Great product! Thanks again!</li>
            <li> The product is identical to the one I purchased at my dentist and at a better cost. I will definitely order these again!  H.Mc.F.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disapointed in this product.  I&#x27;ve purchased whitening from my dentist in the past and expected this to be somewhat equivalent, it&#x27;s definitely not.  I used this product every day for 2 weeks.  It worked but my teeth don&#x27;t look as white as I would have expected.  When using the product from my dentist my teeth were dental ad white after the initial 2 weeks.  So although it works I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again.  I&#x27;d buy crest white stripes over this.</li>
            <li> Same product that I purchased from dentist, but at a much lower price!!  Your tray will still need to be fitted by your dentist which is VERY important, but the results are amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  I have used it for a couple of years but made the mistake of buying through my dentist at twice the price.  I was glad to see it on-line.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> compared to dentist: same but WAY less money -goos deal- same whitening</li>
            <li> Dentist office tried to sell me the same thing for $64.00!!!!  Exact same product and I made absolutely sure before I purchased it.  Totally happy with product.</li>
            <li> The expiration date on this product was over a year from now ... and since I purchase this set every three to five months, that&#x27;s perfectly fine. (But, do remain vigilant ... some third-party sellers are more responsible than others. If you get an expired product, let Amazon know. They will rectify the situation immediately. The expired product will have lost efficacy, so it will not be very helpful to you).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little concerned when this product was purchased by Philips (since I LOVE DayWhite and have used it for over ten years!) I inquired with my hygienist and she said that this product is as effective as ever (she also uses it). So, rest assured, this IS the product you know and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a little confusion here, so I thought I would help with some advice (as a long time user):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-This product is intended to be used with trays created by your dentist (typically after a Zoom in-office treatment). These trays are vastly superior to \\&quot;do-it-yourself\\&quot; trays since the professional trays are the result of impressions (the kind you may have had if you had braces). They conform to the teeth and allow for optimal results. (The product you are purchasing here DOES NOT come with a tray set ... it only comes with what you see).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-To avoid chemical burns to your gums (which is temporary but unsightly and sometimes painful), put the syringe tip right where the bottom of your tooth would be in the tray. Press the plunger until you see a small dot. Do this for each tooth. The product will be distributed naturally. Also, if you feel it helps, put these dots in place and then use the tip to more evenly distribute the product in the bottom of the tray. (Wipe the tip with a Q-Tip or paper-towel before returning to the case to avoid dried on gunk).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-If you want to take risks and go for the paper-white teeth: the closer to the gums, the more difficult it is to get bright white. You can distribute the product higher than thebottom of the tray, just be VERY careful and use a SUPER light touch! (I have insanely white ... like \\&quot;Ross Geller glow-in-black-light\\&quot; white teeth ... and this was how my hygienist said to maintain that look).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Do take days off. I only maintain (at this point). In order to keep my teeth super white, I use this for about twenty minutes once a week. (I also use a Sonicare toothbrush 2-3 times a day, floss at night, use a Sonicare Air-flosser in the morning, use Listerine at night and ACT in the morning ... that probably helps). Using this product too frequently will cause pain and sensitivity to hot and cold foods. (Or even just breathing hot and cold air in extreme cases. I&#x27;ve done it by accident. LOL!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fantastic product! Ask your dentist to set you up with trays (you will probably pay about $199.99 for the trays and an introductory kit). THEN, buy the whitening treatment here! (For me, it is nearly HALF the price as in my dentist&#x27;s office).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIVE-STARS! (And over ten years of love for this product!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(The third-party distributor for this was GH Medical ... they seem to be extremely trustworthy. If at all possible, purchase these here at Amazon with GH Medical as your distributor).</li>
            <li> Best whitening Gel I have found.  Very effective and doesnt sting too much.</li>
            <li> Much better than Opalescence.  Zoom does the job and it lasts.</li>
