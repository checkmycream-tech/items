            <li>So i went back to Shelter &lt;3</li>
            <li>I love the Philosophy Miracle Worker moisturizer also, and I always apply that under this SPF55 product.  </li>
            <li>I love the lightweight feel, I just hope it works.</li>
            <li>I hope to learn more about the line.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer because it contains sunscreen, however I use it at night and in the morning.</li>
            <li>My favorite face cream</li>
            <li>and I have tried many and now i do not need to try any thing else</li>
            <li>Love the SPF protection as well</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell if it works any better than the drug store products I have been  using.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>On a fluke, I decided to check Amazon and am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>light and effective.</li>
            <li>I love philosophy products</li>
            <li>I golf 3 times each week all year long, and it is the best product I have used.</li>
            <li>I ordered this originally from another Internet source at quite a lot more money.  </li>
            <li>It applies easily.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 2 months, and my face is smooth, and even some of the wrinkles seem to be disappearing.  </li>
            <li>Makeup applies smoothly over it.  </li>
            <li>Make-up goes on smoothly over it.  </li>
            <li>The pump on the top allows just the right amount of moisturizer, and the lotion itself is light and goes on</li>
            <li>skinny mini sister looks amazing, and she&#x27;s older than I am.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re both great products for dry, aging skin.</li>
            <li>Reasonable priced and I like the fact that it has the sunscreen built into the moisturizer made it even better.</li>
            <li>Quick absorbent and non-shinny.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and disappears quickly into my skin.  </li>
            <li>but i recently bought this one thinking its SPF 55 itl pretect my skin from the sun way better!</li>
            <li>It separates, in the tube, too easily, so when it comes out, no matter how many times you shake the tube, it&#x27;s not mixed.  </li>
            <li>And so far I love the pump.</li>
            <li>It is super lightweight, I almost wonder if its working, and haven&#x27;t been out in the sun yet to really know.</li>
            <li>well, &#x27;seasoned.&#x27;</li>
            <li>This is the first Philosophy product I have used</li>
            <li>This is my first summer using this product and my first summer when I don&#x27;t have burned red nose and cheeks :)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been told you can really trust the Philosophy name.</li>
            <li>1.7 ounces didn&#x27;t sound like it would be that much, but given how easily the lotion applies, I can see it lasting much longer than other products that are twice its size.</li>
            <li>As far as moisture goes, I can&#x27;t exactly tell the difference.</li>
            <li>No fragrance, which I particularly like.  </li>
            <li>I like the moisturizer without sun screen a little better.</li>
            <li>i definately will tell you if your oily and sensitive DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT!!!!i even applied just a tiny bit all over my face... pretty dissapointed and way too much money for it!</li>
            <li>There are so many Philosophy products, I have a hard time knowing what my skin could really benefit from as far as their line is concerned.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I do not look 20 yrs younger as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s too thick and it doesn&#x27;t go on very smooth.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the smell of this product at all, and I sometimes mix it with my old moisturizer</li>
            <li>Beware if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I normally use the regular Miracle Worker moisturizer, but wanted to switch to something with sun protection for summer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m highly optimistic, as my (previously-mentioned in other reviews)</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry skin (lady in early 70&#x27;s), and this moisturizer with SPF55 leaves my skin hydrated and glowing.  </li>

            <li> SPF 50 has not let me down so far this summer.  </li>
            <li> It seems to work well with my dry skin.</li>

            <li> but within the second day i broke out all over my face and not only that it makes your make-up oily and looks horrible...</li>
            <li> This goes on very thick, but evaporates in about a minute.  </li>
            <li> It was very thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> and it made it worse.</li>
            <li> Obviously my rosacea hated it.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any uncomfortable feeling on my face when I am wearing it.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed considering how expensive Philosophy products are.</li>
            <li> I was sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Philosophy&#x27;s worst product yet!!!</li>

            <li> I normally use the regular Miracle Worker moisturizer, but wanted to switch to something with sun protection for summer.  SPF 50 has not let me down so far this summer.  This goes on very thick, but evaporates in about a minute.  Love the results</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Reasonable priced and I like the fact that it has the sunscreen built into the moisturizer made it even better.</li>
            <li> I was using Philosophy&#x27;s Shelter Oil Free SPF 30 which i LOVE!!! but i recently bought this one thinking its SPF 55 itl pretect my skin from the sun way better! Well it does that...but within the second day i broke out all over my face and not only that it makes your make-up oily and looks horrible... i definately will tell you if your oily and sensitive DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT!!!!i even applied just a tiny bit all over my face... pretty dissapointed and way too much money for it! So i went back to Shelter &lt;3 and it gives you a matte finish!!</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin (lady in early 70&#x27;s), and this moisturizer with SPF55 leaves my skin hydrated and glowing.  I&#x27;m always looking for hydrating skin care but none of them work like the Miracle Worker SPF55.  I love the Philosophy Miracle Worker moisturizer also, and I always apply that under this SPF55 product.  They&#x27;re both great products for dry, aging skin.</li>
            <li> great product  works like a charm  cannot believe the low price and great service received the product as promised  Thank you Amazon</li>
            <li> There are so many Philosophy products, I have a hard time knowing what my skin could really benefit from as far as their line is concerned. I figured I&#x27;d go with a moisturizer with SPF to start. It is super lightweight, I almost wonder if its working, and haven&#x27;t been out in the sun yet to really know. I love the lightweight feel, I just hope it works. I don&#x27;t like the smell of this product at all, and I sometimes mix it with my old moisturizer (that I found out doesn&#x27;t work!) just to tolerate the smell. As far as moisture goes, I can&#x27;t exactly tell the difference. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel amazing after using it or anything. I just hope it has beneficial ingredients in it that are good for my skin and I&#x27;ve been told you can really trust the Philosophy name. I hope to learn more about the line. What is the difference between this product and the one that comes in the round tub?</li>
            <li> I actually received 50 SPF instead of 55. False advertisement is the reason I only gave 2 stars. I could have purchased 50 SPF for a lower cost. The product has kept me from getting sunburned.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 months, and my face is smooth, and even some of the wrinkles seem to be disappearing.  I golf 3 times each week all year long, and it is the best product I have used.</li>
            <li> Feels great on your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer because it contains sunscreen, however I use it at night and in the morning. It&#x27;s light enough to fade into a non-greasy feel on the skin, but keeps those nasty UV rays off my delicate skins. Very important, that. A bit pricey, but a little goes a long way, and I have very dry skin, so for me that&#x27;s a BIG plus! Best to shop for the kits that have this product in it--that way you can try more of the Philosophy Miracle line and decide if you like this stuff as much as I do. I&#x27;m also going to be using the moisturizer for neck and decolletage... We&#x27;ll see how THAT one works! I&#x27;m highly optimistic, as my (previously-mentioned in other reviews) skinny mini sister looks amazing, and she&#x27;s older than I am. Which is amazing in itself, since I&#x27;m... well, &#x27;seasoned.&#x27; TRY THIS!! You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> My favorite face cream and I have tried many and now i do not need to try any thing else</li>
            <li> Quick absorbent and non-shinny.I don&#x27;t have any uncomfortable feeling on my face when I am wearing it. I will recommend it to every one.</li>
            <li> Saw this mentioned in a magazine article, so thought I&#x27;d give it a try. The pump on the top allows just the right amount of moisturizer, and the lotion itself is light and goes on oh-so-easily. 1.7 ounces didn&#x27;t sound like it would be that much, but given how easily the lotion applies, I can see it lasting much longer than other products that are twice its size.</li>
            <li> This is a very small tube for the price and mine came saying SPF 50 instead of 55. It was very thick and greasy. My face broke out in a rash within 2 applications. Obviously my rosacea hated it. Beware if you have sensitive skin. To use enough to avoid sun exposure you will go through a tube probably in a month so this will be super expensive. I just did not love this enough to pay this much for irritation, rash and breakouts and to power through that. I was sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li> My favorite moisturizer, I have used this for years and it make my skin feel great..Love the SPF protection as well</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer with sun screen. Unfortunately I do not look 20 yrs younger as I had hoped. Can&#x27;t tell if it works any better than the drug store products I have been  using.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Won&#x27;t play tennis or go to the beach without it on my face and neck and chest.  NO breakouts.</li>
            <li> I did not like this moisturizer. I have oily skin and it made it worse. I was disappointed considering how expensive Philosophy products are.</li>
            <li> It applies easily.  Settles into my skin nicely.  Makeup applies smoothly over it.  Non-greasy all day.  No fragrance, which I particularly like.  This is the first Philosophy product I have used and I will be re-ordering.</li>
            <li> I ordered this originally from another Internet source at quite a lot more money.  On a fluke, I decided to check Amazon and am so glad I did.  I want to continue to use the product on a daily basis when no make-up is required.  Otherwise, I use a tinted moisturizer with sunscreen or a foundation with sunscreen.</li>
            <li> light and effective. I am allergic to almost all skin products but this one is one of a few that doesn&#x27;t give me any allergies at all. This is my first summer using this product and my first summer when I don&#x27;t have burned red nose and cheeks :)</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and disappears quickly into my skin.  Make-up goes on smoothly over it.  And so far I love the pump.</li>
            <li> I like this mositurizer. It seems to work well with my dry skin. I use this mositurizer on my face and neck when I walk. It does the trick.  I will continue to purchase it. I like Philosophy products overall.</li>
            <li> It seems to moisturize skin well enough and the SPF seems to be helpful. I like the moisturizer without sun screen a little better.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It gives you a wonderful light moisturizer with some great sunscreen. I love philosophy products</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s greasy/oily., It&#x27;s too thick and it doesn&#x27;t go on very smooth.  It separates, in the tube, too easily, so when it comes out, no matter how many times you shake the tube, it&#x27;s not mixed.  Philosophy&#x27;s worst product yet!!!</li>
