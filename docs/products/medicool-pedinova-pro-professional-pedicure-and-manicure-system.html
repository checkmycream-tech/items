            <li>Used it immediately and I am extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li>It is a great tool even though i had some problem with the voltage</li>
            <li>but Amazon has been great</li>
            <li>I spoke with a very nice person named Erka who assisted me in my purchase of additional &#x27;heads&#x27; for my unit.</li>
            <li>It is good to have the CD as well.</li>
            <li>Good variety of bits in the kit&lt;br</li>
            <li>This tool does a good job.  </li>
            <li>Does an amazing job of cleaning up feet and nails&lt;</li>
            <li>also puts a nice shine to them.</li>
            <li>This one comes in a nice case that holds everything in its place.</li>
            <li>and now I can do my own nails the way I want them.  </li>
            <li>Files and buffers nicely.</li>
            <li>Compact unit fits nicely in my hand and it did not overheat.</li>
            <li>If you wear sandles, then this is a great set to have to clean up the ruffly looking nails-</li>
            <li>very light wieght.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic nail filing system!  </li>
            <li>The motor starts off sounding like a clunky truck then is OK.</li>
            <li>Will update as I get more use from the drill.</li>
            <li>It does everything I want it to do and more.</li>
            <li>so I can use this for more than just trimming my nails.</li>
            <li>All I&#x27;ll have to do is use it three more times and it will be paid for.</li>
            <li>and I was able to buy another charger to be able to use it here in Australia.</li>
            <li>This is a super great thing for doing your toenails and fixing your calluses, very easy and fast to use.</li>
            <li>Most devices of this type available on line do not have the power or tool gripping capability to perform the work for which they were designed.</li>
            <li>Needs to come with more fine disc</li>
            <li>Easy to hold</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, motor is powerful and adjustable.</li>
            <li>You can get precise filing and shaping without the hassle of trying to do it all manually.  </li>
            <li>It reminds me of the cheap gift manicure battery operated machines you can buy for about $15.</li>
            <li>which is important to me after the cheap version fell apart.  </li>
            <li>It may cost more, but it is definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>your machine is available to work with  220V or not&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works pretty good, but as others had stated if you used it on higher settings it overheats too quickly</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, plus their customer service is amazing.</li>
            <li>My Manicure/Pedicure set arrives very fast, and I love it very much: all tool and bins in one cute , zipped box</li>
            <li>So far I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Also good for filing a toe nail that has been plagued by a fungus for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the the money.</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon is very reasonable and it comes with more drill bits than my old one did.</li>
            <li>I decided I needed to spend a little more money and get a better product.  </li>
            <li>the tip of the machine is hot.</li>
            <li>I think I did a better jobs filing my heels with my wooden file than what the cone did.</li>
            <li>I love all the different bits for it.  </li>
            <li>Dremel tools have a stronger motor, have an adapter for different size shafts, carry many bits (I prefer the sanding belts), won&#x27;t overheat, is durable, and has a 4-5 year warranty.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is really good for toe nails and cuticles and dead skin.  </li>
            <li>It has a much longer expandable cord which makes it easier to use compared to the first one that i bought.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with a DVD that pretty much shows how to do pedicures, manicures, and even acrylic nails.  </li>
            <li>Are they only xtra fine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all the bits and find they really don&#x27;t take much off.</li>
            <li>Works better than expected.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this set for my friends and might get another one for my daughter as a Christmas gift!</li>
            <li>It has many other tools for finger nails and extensions.</li>
            <li>Other than that is ok, does what is suppose to</li>
            <li>It devotes some time to teaching how to clean everything properly, especially if used in a salon.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product if you are looking for something to make pedicures easier.  </li>
            <li>You plug it and feel yourself a real professional.</li>
            <li>today i receive this medicool&lt;br /&gt;i live in uae e;electricity here</li>
            <li>Also, my cheap imitation product came in a zip lock bag.  </li>
            <li>It is very similar to the old one (Medicool as well) but twice as powerful.</li>
            <li>Very professional.</li>
            <li>I first bought a really cheap imitation version of this product (not the same brand) on Ebay.  </li>
            <li>and it takes a while to cool down..</li>
            <li>I would return it if it wasn&#x27;t going to be such a hassle to do so from where I live.</li>
            <li>I now can sit on a vanity bench several feet away from the outlet at my vanity compared to having to sit on the floor right next to an outlet due to the short cord of the cheap imitation product.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really used it as much for manicures except to file away some dead dry skin around the nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The motor on my old one just gave out, but after so long it&#x27;s not that suprising.</li>
            <li>More of that Company provides you with a training DVD, so you will get a clear idea how to work on your natural or artificial nails.</li>

            <li> Worth its weight in GOLD,.so easy to use, I can round my mom&#x27;snails without filing, cutting, trimming hurting her.  </li>

            <li> Generally not included .</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>

            <li> Cools off in a few minutes for reuse, but overheats quickly&lt;</li>
            <li> I suggest buying a few bits separately and using a dremel (model 3000 or 4000) instead.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all in one small zip up case</li>
            <li> This device chomps down on those tough toenails, and polishes them to a glow.</li>
            <li> Why was nothing bad that can come in.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the durability of this product and do not recommend it.</li>

            <li> Needs to come with more fine disc</li>
            <li> very light wieght.  We will see how long it last.</li>
            <li> awesome, will buy again!</li>
            <li> Two days ago i received medicool pedinova pro and found that it does not work ...Why was nothing bad that can come in. Generally not included .</li>
            <li> If it was cordless it would be 10star!</li>
            <li> Worth its weight in GOLD,.so easy to use, I can round my mom&#x27;snails without filing, cutting, trimming hurting her.  works Terrific on tough dry areas of heals!!!  This is a must for us</li>
            <li> The Medicool Pedinova Pro was delivers on time. So far I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I like it and use it all the time.</li>
            <li> This device chomps down on those tough toenails, and polishes them to a glow. If you wear sandles, then this is a great set to have to clean up the ruffly looking nails-also puts a nice shine to them.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic nail filing system!  You can get precise filing and shaping without the hassle of trying to do it all manually.  Everything packs up well so it can be stored conveniently.  It even has an attachment for cleaning nails as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s size and weight are great ,but that&#x27;s about it.It is good to have the CD as well. The motor starts off sounding like a clunky truck then is OK. After about 5 min. the tip of the machine is hot. The saphire disc squeels. It reminds me of the cheap gift manicure battery operated machines you can buy for about $15. I think I did a better jobs filing my heels with my wooden file than what the cone did. I&#x27;ve tried all the bits and find they really don&#x27;t take much off. Are they only xtra fine and that&#x27;s why? I would return it if it wasn&#x27;t going to be such a hassle to do so from where I live.</li>
            <li> I first bought a really cheap imitation version of this product (not the same brand) on Ebay.  I only paid about $10 and thought &amp;#34;what a bargain!&amp;#34;. But it fell apart after the 2nd use.  I decided I needed to spend a little more money and get a better product.  This product is great.  It is built well which is important to me after the cheap version fell apart.  I love all the different bits for it.  It has a much longer expandable cord which makes it easier to use compared to the first one that i bought.  I now can sit on a vanity bench several feet away from the outlet at my vanity compared to having to sit on the floor right next to an outlet due to the short cord of the cheap imitation product.  Also, my cheap imitation product came in a zip lock bag.  This one comes in a nice case that holds everything in its place. It may cost more, but it is definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is really good for toe nails and cuticles and dead skin.  Also good for filing a toe nail that has been plagued by a fungus for a long time.  It smooths out ridges and uneven toe nails and makes them all look so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product if you are looking for something to make pedicures easier.  I haven&#x27;t really used it as much for manicures except to file away some dead dry skin around the nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a DVD that pretty much shows how to do pedicures, manicures, and even acrylic nails.  It devotes some time to teaching how to clean everything properly, especially if used in a salon.</li>
            <li> This was the perfect gift that I ordered for myself. It has all the bits and bobs that I will need and it includes a video showing how to use them. This item has been on my wish list for two years and now I finally have it.</li>
            <li> Excellent buy! Very professional. Works better than expected. Excellent quality!  I am very happy with this purchase. Well worth the the money.</li>
            <li> My Manicure/Pedicure set arrives very fast, and I love it very much: all tool and bins in one cute , zipped box ( I am a neat freak ). You plug it and feel yourself a real professional. More of that Company provides you with a training DVD, so you will get a clear idea how to work on your natural or artificial nails. I would highly recommend this set for my friends and might get another one for my daughter as a Christmas gift!</li>
            <li> The product is great but it says it comes with a DVD on the box and there is not one.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift to replace one I have had about 6 years. It is very similar to the old one (Medicool as well) but twice as powerful. The motor on my old one just gave out, but after so long it&#x27;s not that suprising. The price on Amazon is very reasonable and it comes with more drill bits than my old one did. It also came with the CD, and the sanding disk bit with 5 sanding disks as a bonus! Will update as I get more use from the drill.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase.  It does everything I want it to do and more. It&#x27;s all in one small zip up case so everything stays put.  I like having all the different tools so I can use this for more than just trimming my nails.</li>
            <li> I got this to trim ny wifes toe nails as she could not get out to a doctor. It has many other tools for finger nails and extensions. Worked well for my purpose.</li>
            <li> Some aspects of this product are good:&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to hold&lt;br /&gt;- Good variety of bits in the kit&lt;br /&gt;- Adjustable speed&lt;br /&gt;- Does an amazing job of cleaning up feet and nails&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some aspects are poor:&lt;br /&gt;- Overheats after 10-15 minutes of use (even on low speeds)&lt;br /&gt;- Cools off in a few minutes for reuse, but overheats quickly&lt;br /&gt;- Motor burned out after 16 months of use (warrantied for 12 months)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this tool twice a month for a year and a half. I was disappointed with the durability of this product and do not recommend it. I suggest buying a few bits separately and using a dremel (model 3000 or 4000) instead. Dremel tools have a stronger motor, have an adapter for different size shafts, carry many bits (I prefer the sanding belts), won&#x27;t overheat, is durable, and has a 4-5 year warranty.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and now I can do my own nails the way I want them.  All I&#x27;ll have to do is use it three more times and it will be paid for.</li>
            <li> I just received this excellent product. Used it immediately and I am extremely happy with it. Files and buffers nicely. It is very easy to use, motor is powerful and adjustable. Compact unit fits nicely in my hand and it did not overheat. My feet feel and look beautiful. I highly recommend this product, plus their customer service is amazing. I spoke with a very nice person named Erka who assisted me in my purchase of additional &#x27;heads&#x27; for my unit. Yes, I&#x27;m thinking ahead since this is going to be used A LOT.</li>
            <li> This is a super great thing for doing your toenails and fixing your calluses, very easy and fast to use.</li>
            <li> Most devices of this type available on line do not have the power or tool gripping capability to perform the work for which they were designed. This one does.</li>
            <li> today i receive this medicool&lt;br /&gt;i live in uae e;electricity here is 220&lt;br /&gt;plz your machine is available to work with  220V or not&lt;br /&gt;if not what i do to ues it ?</li>
            <li> Good Product! Does what it says!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent with good quality</li>
            <li> It works pretty good, but as others had stated if you used it on higher settings it overheats too quickly and it takes a while to cool down.. Other than that is ok, does what is suppose to</li>
            <li> It is a great tool even though i had some problem with the voltage but Amazon has been great and I was able to buy another charger to be able to use it here in Australia.</li>
            <li> The cord that inserts into the unit keeps on coming off. Not worth the money. Plenty of aggravation when attempting to use it.</li>
            <li> This tool does a good job.  I still haven&#x27;t  handle it with ease.</li>
    </ol>
