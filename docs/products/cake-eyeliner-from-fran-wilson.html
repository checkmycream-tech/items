            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li>they all weren&#x27;t as great as this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried many liners and this works the best for me.</li>
            <li>packaging of the Fran Wilson liner is nice - that&#x27;s why I gave it one star - but the plastic cover on the application brush WOULD NOT come off!</li>
            <li>I bought it according to good reviews.</li>
            <li>Fair price.</li>
            <li>Even MAC Carbon would be a good alternative.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>and this is a really good one.</li>
            <li>(Mary Kay used to offer an excellent cake eyeliner, but it&#x27;s no longer available.</li>
            <li>This product is SO superior to any type of eyeliner I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I loved</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the quality, packaging (brush included) and creamy texture of the product.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased</li>

            <li>but am so glad that I found this one!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best!  </li>
            <li>2 if honest).</li>
            <li>This is the kind of eyeliner I grew up with</li>
            <li>Girlfriend is happy and it was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I rate the color better than Clinique&#x27;s cake eyeliner, which tends to fade, but not as good as Laura Mercier, however the price is much better.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I think this problem may have been user error on my part because the first couple of times (when it turned out great)</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I am so glad to find it again.</li>
            <li>I also love the eyeliner brush that comes with this product.</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the better eye lining paints, however.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this product and recommend it to anyone that loves using cake eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Many years ago Maybelline had cake eye liner and discontinued the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>no matter how many times I applied.</li>
            <li>I like the color, but most of all I like the ease of application.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be able to find any more.</li>
            <li>Tried many in the search for the one and found this.</li>
            <li>for I do not keep more then a month</li>
            <li>(okay maybe</li>
            <li>Most of the products are either too sticky or watery.  </li>
            <li>However I do like gel liner better.</li>
            <li>For the most part, I like it.  </li>
            <li>I love the idea, but the execution was lacking.</li>
            <li>I used to use this product many years ago.  </li>
            <li>This was better.</li>
            <li>It works terrifically and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product, never used cake eyeliner before, but after using this, i am hooked!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This goes on smoothly and stays put and the price point is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I would get a better brush to use with it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The seller was very prompt and delivery was great.</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this Cake Eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It is indeed in many products but</li>
            <li>Thank you for making this product available!</li>
            <li>but easier for me to purchase via Amazon Prime for about a dollar or 2 more than I was buying my La Femme cake liner</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;ll be here in 2 days rather than a week or more shipping for the La</li>
            <li>The liquids are OK, but this goes on with much more control.  </li>
            <li>LOVE CAKE EYELINER...</li>
            <li>For some reason it shows up on my eyes better.</li>
            <li>I like this eyeliner pretty good.</li>
            <li>The best part is my eyes look amazing, not at all harsh or fake-looking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve use this eyeliner for years 20+ and just love it easy to put on lasts and isn&#x27;t costly.</li>
            <li>Contrary to what a lot of people say here, I find it extremely easy to remove and love the fact that it stays on until I take it off.</li>
            <li>When I opened it, I had a mild happy flashback to the first mascara I ever bought.</li>
            <li>This shows a great natural line.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found another that is as good or priced as reasonably.</li>
            <li>This is a good product and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Fran Wilson for many years and it has never disappointed me.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and then stays put.  </li>
            <li>It wears well and is easy to repair when applying.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Cake eyeliner is easy to put on and has a finer looking line then the pencils or even the liquid.  </li>
            <li>and it washes off easily.</li>
            <li>Went on easily</li>
            <li>And getting it off isn&#x27;t easy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a breeze to apply, it is easy to draw the line and control the color and intensity and shape of the line.  </li>
            <li>It lasts forever, no fading,water based and easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Easily removed.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier if you&#x27;re like me and aren&#x27;t very good at drawing precise, straight lines.  </li>
            <li>This eyeliner is easy to use, goes on smoothly and stays on until you remove it.    </li>
            <li>Does not go on smooth..</li>
            <li>This Eyeliner is as great as it was back 20 years ago.  </li>
            <li>I used to think it was fantastic.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is a nice color, and lasts much longer than the pencil style.</li>
            <li>If you want your eyes to look great and want to save yourself a lot of time and money, you should definitely try this product!</li>
            <li>The eyeliner available in stores today does not provide the flexibility this cake eyeliner provides.</li>
            <li>Cake eyeliner is a really good value, it lasts for a very long time and that&#x27;s probably why they decided to take it away from us for so many years.  </li>
            <li>I was not disappointed in the quality.</li>
            <li>I always buy them in bulk and keep in original package till I need for fear</li>
            <li>However, I was encouraged by the many positive reviews I read about this product, so I ordered it from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you but a bold line on, use a clean damp shadow brush to soften it for a smoky eye.</li>
            <li>you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can take this BOLD-which I prefer with a nice 60&#x27;s flick at the edge-or you can take this natural, or smudgy...</li>
            <li>can achieve the &amp;#34;Cat eye&amp;#34; look or more natural, either way, it stays on with out smudging through out the day, i&#x27;ve used other &amp;#34;gel liners&amp;#34; and they start fading or smudging, with this one i didn&#x27;t get that, and it goes on so smooth, so no tugging your eyelid, and looking great.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product, both brown and black.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to paint a straight line.  </li>
            <li>Talc has been called a carcinogen by many groups due to its similarity to asbestos, but it seems controversial.  </li>
            <li>Great little product.  </li>
            <li>It makes a fine or broad line and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>The first few times i used it, it worked beautifully.  </li>
            <li>The thin line that remains is perfect!</li>
            <li>Because of my having to use a lot more eyeliner to make my eyes look good, I realize that the eyeliner will not last as long as it had</li>
            <li>WHen my eyes watered it came right off.  </li>
            <li>This special brand was not to my liking, gave it to a friend who really likes it.</li>
            <li>this eyeliner is fine, all cake eyeliners run, this one is an eyeshadow too that goes on smooth,  so a double bonus.</li>
            <li>The water dries up pretty quickly, so I had to re-wet it several times to finish lining my eyes, but I&#x27;m relatively ok with that.  </li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve drawn the line with this liner, you can easily take the brush and fan it, creating a soft, natural, look or even go right over it again to make it more intense.</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>This liner is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to try it with the filtered water again and see if i get the results I was getting when I first started using it.</li>
            <li>(Many years ago and probably a different brand.)</li>
            <li>Would most definitely  recommend this to a friend!</li>
            <li>When I applied it for the first time, I could not believe my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I have never liked liquid or pencil eyeliners and this Cake Eyeliner works great for me.</li>
            <li>You are greatly appreciated!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s terrific, love the brush....</li>
            <li>It makes it that much better that it is so economically effective...not to mention the long wearability and the actual look of it seems more...</li>
            <li>and I think it actually works better than gel eyeliner.</li>
            <li>So I was really intrigued to find the Fran Wilson Cake Eyeliner on the Internet and decided to take a gamble, figuring I&#x27;d probably toss it right in the trash after trying it.</li>
            <li>I have missed the other cake eyeliner brands that I liked and used before</li>
            <li>By the time I was old enough to have my own, they were gone from drugstore shelves.</li>
            <li>I had used benefit cake eyeliner in the past and I have yet to find anything as good</li>
            <li>Mixing the two gives a nice dark grayish liner.  </li>
            <li>Lasting results and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It is a little old school, but it looks really good and stays on really well.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get much color</li>
            <li>so much finding a cake eyeliner that works.  </li>
            <li>This works very well</li>
            <li>When I used it before, it seemed like the liner was ready to go with just 1 drop of water on your brush and one stroke on the cake eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>Now, I have to moisten the brush really often and draw it over the cake eyeliner</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for the speedy drlivery.</li>
            <li>I much prefer the cake eyeliners over the liquid, but could not find any at the department/drug store.</li>
            <li>all depending on how much water you add, the brush you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I discovered gel eyeliner about a year ago and after the compact I had purchased started becoming dry, I decided to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a pain to get enough product on the brush to make a clean straight line.</li>
            <li>So excited to find this product as I tried several brands of pencils and they all smeared.  </li>
            <li>Like other reviewers, I am dismayed that some of my favorite cake eyeliners have been discontinued.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is pigmented, so if you love a DARK and INTENSE liner go ahead and try this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was really easy to use, you use very little product in each application, it comes with a tiny brush that i really don&#x27;t use, because i already have another one that i find more useful.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I may be old fashioned, but you need cake eyeliner to get real cat eye perfection!  </li>
            <li>I had hoped that if I used a little more water it would appear lighter, as I really would prefer a gray shade.</li>
            <li>Stays put - easy to control the line - best eyeliner out there for me and I have been trying a lot of different products lately to find the right one - unbelievable price (I cut the brush just a tiny bit shorter to make it even easier to apply.)</li>
            <li>Easy to blend with a wet brush.</li>
            <li>The only thing more I could ask for would be a midnight blue shade, which I don;t</li>
            <li>I noticed that one of the main ingredients is talc.  </li>
            <li>la femme pots used nearly daily last me around 8 months or more</li>
            <li>black being my classic favorite.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised how much I like this eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t understand how people rate this product so high.</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend this product if you like cake eye liners.</li>
            <li>I have used cake for years because you can make it as light or dark as you want by how much water you use.</li>
            <li>Also it smudges easily, the consistency is not right.</li>
            <li>It looks like my old cake eyeliner, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t perform like my old one did.  </li>
            <li>This is so much easier to use compared to premixed liner that is more commonly sold.  </li>
            <li>What I disliked was it came on beautifully, but usually evaporated all over my face.  </li>
            <li>It took me a few tries to get good at putting on this type of eyeliner, but I&#x27;m not looking back - it&#x27;s much easier to put on, and lasts all day (and even through the next day pretty much.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this product in the past and was always satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had problems in the past finding it but not any more.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I came across this product, as I never liked the pencils or the liquid eyeliners.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s \\&quot;old school\\&quot; but works.</li>
            <li>I was unable to use the very tiny brush that comes in the case, but use a longer, more expensive brush and get a perfect line everytime.  </li>
            <li>I still have my old Clinique brush, and have been using that.</li>
            <li>Mary Kay has good ones but they&#x27;re so expensive for what she gives you that I would never pay those prices.</li>
            <li>as in, it looked more grey than black.  </li>
            <li>that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s safe.</li>
            <li>it is small, but the size makes it easy to control the application and the width of the line.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on smooth and it isn&#x27;t quite dark enough.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice any smudging, which is the wonderful thing about a good cake liner, if you apply it wet over some sort of primer or powdered base, then let it dry, maybe add a little sealant (or a spray of mac fix+, urban decay or skindinavia setting sprays, whatever your fancy)it&#x27;s going to stay quite well for</li>
            <li>did notice some strange slight silver sparkle when I held the liner up to the light..</li>
            <li>I only line my top eyelid and after a couple of hours, half of the eyeliner has fallen down to my bottom eye lid or under my eye.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that when it dries, it is gray, not black.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t listen to the few negative reviewers here or you could miss out on a product that will change your life for the better!</li>
            <li>Applying it takes about 1/3 of the time I used to spend fooling with the pencil, trying to sharpen the pencil, often ending up with a mess and having to resharpen and resharpen, not to mention making corrections since the pencil is so easy to mess up.</li>
            <li>As I said when reviewing the brush for this eyeliner, I haven&#x27;t found a product that makes a nice thin line other than cake eyeliner</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that they could have put in a full size applicator brush with it.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Girlfriend is happy and it was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I rate the color better than Clinique&#x27;s cake eyeliner, which tends to fade, but not as good as Laura Mercier, however the price is much better.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I think this problem may have been user error on my part because the first couple of times (when it turned out great)</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to find it again.</li>
            <li> I also love the eyeliner brush that comes with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the better eye lining paints, however.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this product and recommend it to anyone that loves using cake eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Many years ago Maybelline had cake eye liner and discontinued the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> no matter how many times I applied.</li>
            <li> I like the color, but most of all I like the ease of application.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be able to find any more.</li>
            <li> Tried many in the search for the one and found this.</li>
            <li> for I do not keep more then a month</li>
            <li> (okay maybe</li>
            <li> Most of the products are either too sticky or watery.  </li>
            <li> However I do like gel liner better.</li>
            <li> For the most part, I like it.  </li>
            <li> I love the idea, but the execution was lacking.</li>
            <li> I used to use this product many years ago.  </li>
            <li> This was better.</li>
            <li> It works terrifically and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product, never used cake eyeliner before, but after using this, i am hooked!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This goes on smoothly and stays put and the price point is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I would get a better brush to use with it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> The seller was very prompt and delivery was great.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this Cake Eyeliner.</li>
            <li> It is indeed in many products but</li>
            <li> Thank you for making this product available!</li>
            <li> but easier for me to purchase via Amazon Prime for about a dollar or 2 more than I was buying my La Femme cake liner</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;ll be here in 2 days rather than a week or more shipping for the La</li>
            <li> The liquids are OK, but this goes on with much more control.  </li>
            <li> LOVE CAKE EYELINER...</li>
            <li> For some reason it shows up on my eyes better.</li>
            <li> I like this eyeliner pretty good.</li>
            <li> The best part is my eyes look amazing, not at all harsh or fake-looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use this eyeliner for years 20+ and just love it easy to put on lasts and isn&#x27;t costly.</li>
            <li> Contrary to what a lot of people say here, I find it extremely easy to remove and love the fact that it stays on until I take it off.</li>
            <li> When I opened it, I had a mild happy flashback to the first mascara I ever bought.</li>
            <li> This shows a great natural line.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found another that is as good or priced as reasonably.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Fran Wilson for many years and it has never disappointed me.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and then stays put.  </li>
            <li> It wears well and is easy to repair when applying.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Cake eyeliner is easy to put on and has a finer looking line then the pencils or even the liquid.  </li>
            <li> and it washes off easily.</li>
            <li> Went on easily</li>
            <li> And getting it off isn&#x27;t easy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a breeze to apply, it is easy to draw the line and control the color and intensity and shape of the line.  </li>
            <li> It lasts forever, no fading,water based and easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Easily removed.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier if you&#x27;re like me and aren&#x27;t very good at drawing precise, straight lines.  </li>
            <li> This eyeliner is easy to use, goes on smoothly and stays on until you remove it.    </li>
            <li> Does not go on smooth..</li>
            <li> This Eyeliner is as great as it was back 20 years ago.  </li>
            <li> I used to think it was fantastic.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is a nice color, and lasts much longer than the pencil style.</li>
            <li> If you want your eyes to look great and want to save yourself a lot of time and money, you should definitely try this product!</li>
            <li> The eyeliner available in stores today does not provide the flexibility this cake eyeliner provides.</li>
            <li> Cake eyeliner is a really good value, it lasts for a very long time and that&#x27;s probably why they decided to take it away from us for so many years.  </li>
            <li> I was not disappointed in the quality.</li>
            <li> I always buy them in bulk and keep in original package till I need for fear</li>
            <li> However, I was encouraged by the many positive reviews I read about this product, so I ordered it from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you but a bold line on, use a clean damp shadow brush to soften it for a smoky eye.</li>
            <li> you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can take this BOLD-which I prefer with a nice 60&#x27;s flick at the edge-or you can take this natural, or smudgy...</li>
            <li> can achieve the &amp;#34;Cat eye&amp;#34; look or more natural, either way, it stays on with out smudging through out the day, i&#x27;ve used other &amp;#34;gel liners&amp;#34; and they start fading or smudging, with this one i didn&#x27;t get that, and it goes on so smooth, so no tugging your eyelid, and looking great.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product, both brown and black.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to paint a straight line.  </li>
            <li> Talc has been called a carcinogen by many groups due to its similarity to asbestos, but it seems controversial.  </li>
            <li> Great little product.  </li>
            <li> It makes a fine or broad line and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> The first few times i used it, it worked beautifully.  </li>
            <li> The thin line that remains is perfect!</li>
            <li> Because of my having to use a lot more eyeliner to make my eyes look good, I realize that the eyeliner will not last as long as it had</li>
            <li> WHen my eyes watered it came right off.  </li>
            <li> This special brand was not to my liking, gave it to a friend who really likes it.</li>
            <li> this eyeliner is fine, all cake eyeliners run, this one is an eyeshadow too that goes on smooth,  so a double bonus.</li>
            <li> The water dries up pretty quickly, so I had to re-wet it several times to finish lining my eyes, but I&#x27;m relatively ok with that.  </li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve drawn the line with this liner, you can easily take the brush and fan it, creating a soft, natural, look or even go right over it again to make it more intense.</li>
            <li> The price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> This liner is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to try it with the filtered water again and see if i get the results I was getting when I first started using it.</li>
            <li> (Many years ago and probably a different brand.)</li>
            <li> Would most definitely  recommend this to a friend!</li>
            <li> When I applied it for the first time, I could not believe my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have never liked liquid or pencil eyeliners and this Cake Eyeliner works great for me.</li>
            <li> You are greatly appreciated!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s terrific, love the brush....</li>
            <li> It makes it that much better that it is so economically effective...not to mention the long wearability and the actual look of it seems more...</li>
            <li> and I think it actually works better than gel eyeliner.</li>
            <li> So I was really intrigued to find the Fran Wilson Cake Eyeliner on the Internet and decided to take a gamble, figuring I&#x27;d probably toss it right in the trash after trying it.</li>
            <li> I have missed the other cake eyeliner brands that I liked and used before</li>
            <li> By the time I was old enough to have my own, they were gone from drugstore shelves.</li>
            <li> I had used benefit cake eyeliner in the past and I have yet to find anything as good</li>
            <li> Mixing the two gives a nice dark grayish liner.  </li>
            <li> Lasting results and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It is a little old school, but it looks really good and stays on really well.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get much color</li>
            <li> so much finding a cake eyeliner that works.  </li>
            <li> This works very well</li>
            <li> When I used it before, it seemed like the liner was ready to go with just 1 drop of water on your brush and one stroke on the cake eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> Now, I have to moisten the brush really often and draw it over the cake eyeliner</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for the speedy drlivery.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the cake eyeliners over the liquid, but could not find any at the department/drug store.</li>
            <li> all depending on how much water you add, the brush you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I discovered gel eyeliner about a year ago and after the compact I had purchased started becoming dry, I decided to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a pain to get enough product on the brush to make a clean straight line.</li>
            <li> So excited to find this product as I tried several brands of pencils and they all smeared.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I am dismayed that some of my favorite cake eyeliners have been discontinued.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is pigmented, so if you love a DARK and INTENSE liner go ahead and try this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was really easy to use, you use very little product in each application, it comes with a tiny brush that i really don&#x27;t use, because i already have another one that i find more useful.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I may be old fashioned, but you need cake eyeliner to get real cat eye perfection!  </li>
            <li> I had hoped that if I used a little more water it would appear lighter, as I really would prefer a gray shade.</li>
            <li> Stays put - easy to control the line - best eyeliner out there for me and I have been trying a lot of different products lately to find the right one - unbelievable price (I cut the brush just a tiny bit shorter to make it even easier to apply.)</li>
            <li> Easy to blend with a wet brush.</li>
            <li> The only thing more I could ask for would be a midnight blue shade, which I don;t</li>
            <li> I noticed that one of the main ingredients is talc.  </li>
            <li> la femme pots used nearly daily last me around 8 months or more</li>
            <li> black being my classic favorite.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised how much I like this eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t understand how people rate this product so high.</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend this product if you like cake eye liners.</li>
            <li> I have used cake for years because you can make it as light or dark as you want by how much water you use.</li>
            <li> Also it smudges easily, the consistency is not right.</li>
            <li> It looks like my old cake eyeliner, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t perform like my old one did.  </li>
            <li> This is so much easier to use compared to premixed liner that is more commonly sold.  </li>
            <li> What I disliked was it came on beautifully, but usually evaporated all over my face.  </li>
            <li> It took me a few tries to get good at putting on this type of eyeliner, but I&#x27;m not looking back - it&#x27;s much easier to put on, and lasts all day (and even through the next day pretty much.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product in the past and was always satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems in the past finding it but not any more.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I came across this product, as I never liked the pencils or the liquid eyeliners.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s \\&quot;old school\\&quot; but works.</li>
            <li> I was unable to use the very tiny brush that comes in the case, but use a longer, more expensive brush and get a perfect line everytime.  </li>
            <li> I still have my old Clinique brush, and have been using that.</li>
            <li> Mary Kay has good ones but they&#x27;re so expensive for what she gives you that I would never pay those prices.</li>
            <li> as in, it looked more grey than black.  </li>
            <li> that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s safe.</li>
            <li> it is small, but the size makes it easy to control the application and the width of the line.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on smooth and it isn&#x27;t quite dark enough.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any smudging, which is the wonderful thing about a good cake liner, if you apply it wet over some sort of primer or powdered base, then let it dry, maybe add a little sealant (or a spray of mac fix+, urban decay or skindinavia setting sprays, whatever your fancy)it&#x27;s going to stay quite well for</li>
            <li> did notice some strange slight silver sparkle when I held the liner up to the light..</li>
            <li> I only line my top eyelid and after a couple of hours, half of the eyeliner has fallen down to my bottom eye lid or under my eye.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that when it dries, it is gray, not black.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to the few negative reviewers here or you could miss out on a product that will change your life for the better!</li>
            <li> Applying it takes about 1/3 of the time I used to spend fooling with the pencil, trying to sharpen the pencil, often ending up with a mess and having to resharpen and resharpen, not to mention making corrections since the pencil is so easy to mess up.</li>
            <li> As I said when reviewing the brush for this eyeliner, I haven&#x27;t found a product that makes a nice thin line other than cake eyeliner</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they could have put in a full size applicator brush with it.</li>
            <li> With an angled eye liner brush, has really made my eye-liner application much less stressful!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the manufacturer did to the product, but no matter how much water you use, the eyeliner does not adhere to the brush and is it almost grey instead of being black.</li>
            <li> The color is a pretty dark black, but you can get it to be a little lighter if you want, depending on how much water you use.</li>
            <li> This is not black enough, it is like a dark charcoal blue.</li>
            <li> Very long lasting.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a more dramatic black liner, this is the one to get.  </li>
            <li> I am a make up artist and have found it so hard to find a reasonably priced cake eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> All I could find in stores were liquid eyeliners that smudged and wouldn&#x27;t stay on for a long time.    </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t have good staying power; if I apply it on my lower lash line it \\&quot;melts\\&quot; down into my undereye area, making me look sick</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t bleed, smear or take 10 minutes to dry.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a round tipped brush, not a flat one, and I&#x27;m used to using a flat one, but thankfully I have one.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get it dark enough.</li>
            <li> quite a bit before there is enough liner on the brush to make a dark line on my eyelid.  </li>
            <li> was not very intense.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend using a matte black eyeshadow mixed with water instead.</li>
            <li> The product is so porous, it simply won&#x27;t apply really black.</li>
            <li> I like that you can use this wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure I could achieve the same results using the tiny brush they include with this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, a bold liquid line will always have always place and time...</li>
            <li> This dinosaur eyeliner, from back in the day, is hard to find, but definately worth the search, thin lines with heavinesss control.</li>
            <li> and I am just not ready for that.</li>
            <li> found it to be difficult to mix with water to get the right consistency.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use any other.</li>
            <li> I used it with filtered water and the other times</li>
            <li> Not exactly the look I was going for.</li>
            <li> I put it on and let it dry a little and then wipe it off.</li>
            <li> I bought this in black &amp; brown a couple years ago and am still using it.  </li>
            <li> B0001431AG Fran Wilson Cake Eyeliner Black]]</li>
            <li> This eyeliner says it&#x27;s black, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> I believe the &amp;#34;formula&amp;#34; for this eyeliner has changed since I used it previously.  </li>
            <li> Very controllable, and can apply it thin, unlike those thick liquid eyeliners.</li>
            <li> All I got was a little pigment</li>
            <li> It comes with a little brush.  </li>
            <li> I used cake eyeliner for years but then had trouble finding the product.</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times.</li>
            <li> and they did not respond to my request to return, waste of money.</li>
            <li> However, the times I&#x27;ve used it since then, it dried kinda chalky...</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> And although it is not waterproof, I&#x27;ve been through a few tearful moments and the liner never smudged.  </li>
            <li> I used to use the old Bob Kelly cake eyeliner for stage and was so disappointed when it finally was gone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find black cake eyeliners that wear well...  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers mentioned the liner turning silvery/gray after application, and I&#x27;m very disappointed to find that to be true of the one I purchased.  </li>
            <li> I am a long time user of Clinique&#x27;s cake eyeliner, which they sadly discontinued making.</li>
            <li> Cake eyeliner has been very, very hard to find since it was basically replaced with eyeliner pencils and bottles of liner a few years ago.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find cake eyeliner now days.</li>
            <li> Cake eyeliner is hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Was a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> The pencils tug at the delicate skin around the eyes and probably cause wrinkles for a lot of people.  </li>
            <li> Some people complained about the brush...</li>
            <li> The consistency is the same as the very expensive liners.  </li>
            <li> You can create a thin or thick line depending on your preferences.</li>
            <li> Goes on watery and pigment poor.</li>
            <li> I received wrong color.  </li>
            <li> the creamy cake liner, just the regular stuff, the creamy is awful)...</li>
            <li> I have always hated the pencils, but had no choice since the bottled eyeliners looked so harsh on me.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Then I tried cutting it off.</li>
            <li> disappointment.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> It is impossible to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m terrible with eyeliner pencils.  </li>
            <li> Annoying!!!  </li>

            <li> I love this product. You can create a thin or thick line depending on your preferences. I used cake eyeliner for years but then had trouble finding the product. I am so glad to find it again. I also love the eyeliner brush that comes with this product. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I received wrong color.  Package was mis labelled</li>
            <li> I bought this in black &amp; brown a couple years ago and am still using it.  Very happy with it.  I like the fact that I control the thickness of the eyeliner.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner.  I have missed the other cake eyeliner brands that I liked and used before but am so glad that I found this one!  I&#x27;m going to be stocking up so I never run out again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product - color was not very intense.  Couldn&#x27;t get it dark enough.</li>
            <li> I miss the Yardley Gimmerick paintbox that my big sister had in the swingin&#x27; sixties. By the time I was old enough to have my own, they were gone from drugstore shelves. I&#x27;ve looked for watercolor eye paint ever since, but nothing came close. This is one of the better eye lining paints, however. Easy to blend with a wet brush. If you but a bold line on, use a clean damp shadow brush to soften it for a smoky eye.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! I used to use the old Bob Kelly cake eyeliner for stage and was so disappointed when it finally was gone. All I could find in stores were liquid eyeliners that smudged and wouldn&#x27;t stay on for a long time.    This eyeliner is easy to use, goes on smoothly and stays on until you remove it.    I am so glad I found this product and recommend it to anyone that loves using cake eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Many years ago Maybelline had cake eye liner and discontinued the product. I am so glad I came across this product, as I never liked the pencils or the liquid eyeliners. It works great.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing eyeliner since the sixties.  This is the absolute best!  Easy to apply and then stays put.  Doesn&#x27;t bleed, smear or take 10 minutes to dry.  You can just slap it on and go.  Hope they never stop making it.  Probably should order in a couple dozen just in case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years.  It  is the best cake liner around.  Conveniently packaged with the brush, Ive carried this item in my travels around the world.  The only thing more I could ask for would be a midnight blue shade, which I don;t think anyone makes in a cake eyeliner.  Fran Wilson&#x27;s product is the best</li>
            <li> Girlfriend is happy and it was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find cake eyeliner now days. It all seems to be liquid, pencil or gel.  I have used cake for years because you can make it as light or dark as you want by how much water you use. It wears well and is easy to repair when applying.  The price was very reasonable. I was not disappointed in the quality. I would order from this site again!</li>
            <li> Great product. Just what I wanted</li>
            <li> I have been using this cake eyeliner for years and I love it.  I haven&#x27;t found another that is as good or priced as reasonably.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t understand how people rate this product so high. I bought it according to good reviews. Was a big disappointment. I couldn&#x27;t get much color no matter how many times I applied. All I got was a little pigment but it came off in couple hours. I will not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Does not go on smooth.. it&#x27;s a pain to get enough product on the brush to make a clean straight line.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0001431AG Fran Wilson Cake Eyeliner Black]] This is the best cake eyeliner on the market (or not). It is impossible to find in the stores. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner says it&#x27;s black, but it&#x27;s not. It goes on gray, even if you put on several coats. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years....have total control on how it goes on.  I&#x27;ve tried others and don&#x27;t like them.  With the brush and the amount of water to add, I get the perfect line.  Wouldn&#x27;t use any other.</li>
            <li> this eyeliner is fine, all cake eyeliners run, this one is an eyeshadow too that goes on smooth,  so a double bonus. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Cake eyeliner is hard to find.  This is the second time that I purchased this product.  I like the color, but most of all I like the ease of application. I will continue to buy this eyeliner</li>
            <li> This is great eyeliner.  I&#x27;m terrible with eyeliner pencils.  I find it way easier to use cake eyeliner.  It&#x27;s much easier if you&#x27;re like me and aren&#x27;t very good at drawing precise, straight lines.  It helps make my eyes look a bit darker as well so they pop.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s \\&quot;old school\\&quot; but works. I always buy them in bulk and keep in original package till I need for fear I won&#x27;t be able to find any more. I have tried many liners and this works the best for me. I use to like maybelline but they changed the formula and it flaked on me all the time. Tried many in the search for the one and found this. Easy to apply. Stays on well. Not waterproof though. Fair price. I go through alot of it for I do not keep more then a month (okay maybe 2 if honest). Bottom line on the liner.... Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Great little product.  I&#x27;ve struggled so much finding a cake eyeliner that works.  Most of the products are either too sticky or watery.  This shows a great natural line.</li>
            <li> This liner is exactly what I was looking for.  I highly reccommend this product if you like cake eye liners.</li>
            <li> No pigment at all and doesn&#x27;t last. I even used cake eyeliner sealer. It started to chip as well. Don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> With an angled eye liner brush, has really made my eye-liner application much less stressful! It is a little old school, but it looks really good and stays on really well.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Cake eyeliner is easy to put on and has a finer looking line then the pencils or even the liquid.  It is the best!</li>
            <li> The only problem is that when it dries, it is gray, not black.</li>
            <li> I am using my husbands account. I like this eyeliner pretty good. I have used it a few times. However I do like gel liner better. To me using this is about the same as using your eye shadow for eyeliner which I do from time to time.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product.  Does the job. I rate the color better than Clinique&#x27;s cake eyeliner, which tends to fade, but not as good as Laura Mercier, however the price is much better.  I would definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product in the past and was always satisfied.  I don&#x27;t know what the manufacturer did to the product, but no matter how much water you use, the eyeliner does not adhere to the brush and is it almost grey instead of being black.</li>
            <li> This is not black enough, it is like a dark charcoal blue. Also it smudges easily, the consistency is not right. I had used benefit cake eyeliner in the past and I have yet to find anything as good, I wish they did not discontinue it. I don&#x27;t like this product and they did not respond to my request to return, waste of money. Will keep looking for a cake eyeliner, this doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> I got this a while back and have used it several times.  For the most part, I like it.  The first few times i used it, it worked beautifully.  The water dries up pretty quickly, so I had to re-wet it several times to finish lining my eyes, but I&#x27;m relatively ok with that.  However, the times I&#x27;ve used it since then, it dried kinda chalky...as in, it looked more grey than black.  I think this problem may have been user error on my part because the first couple of times (when it turned out great) I used it with filtered water and the other times I just used water out of the faucet.  I&#x27;ll have to try it with the filtered water again and see if i get the results I was getting when I first started using it.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers mentioned the liner turning silvery/gray after application, and I&#x27;m very disappointed to find that to be true of the one I purchased.  It looks like my old cake eyeliner, but it certainly doesn&#x27;t perform like my old one did.  (Many years ago and probably a different brand.)</li>
            <li> Not an opaque line no matter how much I mixed the liner. Goes on watery and pigment poor. I love the idea, but the execution was lacking. I would recommend using a matte black eyeshadow mixed with water instead. NYX makes a great one. Even MAC Carbon would be a good alternative. Staying power was lacking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good.  I like it.  I use it everyday.  I hope you keep carrying it.&lt;br /&gt;  DIANE BROOKS</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find black cake eyeliners that wear well...  I may be old fashioned, but you need cake eyeliner to get real cat eye perfection!  I&#x27;ve used Fran Wilson for many years and it has never disappointed me.</li>
            <li> This Eyeliner is as great as it was back 20 years ago.  It makes a fine or broad line and is easy to use.  I use it daily.</li>
            <li> This works very well and it&#x27;s easy to paint a straight line.  I like it because it has no odor and it washes off easily.</li>
            <li> I used to use this product many years ago.  I believe the &amp;#34;formula&amp;#34; for this eyeliner has changed since I used it previously.  When I used it before, it seemed like the liner was ready to go with just 1 drop of water on your brush and one stroke on the cake eyeliner.  Now, I have to moisten the brush really often and draw it over the cake eyeliner quite a bit before there is enough liner on the brush to make a dark line on my eyelid.  Because of my having to use a lot more eyeliner to make my eyes look good, I realize that the eyeliner will not last as long as it had previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they hadn&#x27;t changed the formula for this product.  I used to think it was fantastic.</li>
            <li> Fran Wilson Cake Eyeliner&lt;br /&gt;Fast service, received the product within 4 days. Very satisfied with the quality, packaging (brush included) and creamy texture of the product.  Lasting results and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> When I opened it, I had a mild happy flashback to the first mascara I ever bought. This was better. It works terrifically and I love it. The bambooish liner brush I bought from Amazon worked like a dream with it.&lt;br /&gt;Marlys</li>
            <li> Stays put - easy to control the line - best eyeliner out there for me and I have been trying a lot of different products lately to find the right one - unbelievable price (I cut the brush just a tiny bit shorter to make it even easier to apply.)</li>
            <li> WHen my eyes watered it came right off.  no staying power at all.  Went on easily but I will not wear it again</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product, both brown and black.  Mixing the two gives a nice dark grayish liner.  Will buy often.  Great price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  It lasts a long time and I only have to order it once a year.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t stay where I put it. I only line my top eyelid and after a couple of hours, half of the eyeliner has fallen down to my bottom eye lid or under my eye. Not exactly the look I was going for.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is a nice color, and lasts much longer than the pencil style. It comes with a round tipped brush, not a flat one, and I&#x27;m used to using a flat one, but thankfully I have one. The color is a pretty dark black, but you can get it to be a little lighter if you want, depending on how much water you use. It took me a few tries to get good at putting on this type of eyeliner, but I&#x27;m not looking back - it&#x27;s much easier to put on, and lasts all day (and even through the next day pretty much.)</li>
            <li> As I said when reviewing the brush for this eyeliner, I haven&#x27;t found a product that makes a nice thin line other than cake eyeliner and this is a really good one.</li>
            <li> Love this product, never used cake eyeliner before, but after using this, i am hooked!&lt;br /&gt;It was really easy to use, you use very little product in each application, it comes with a tiny brush that i really don&#x27;t use, because i already have another one that i find more useful.&lt;br /&gt;You can achieve the &amp;#34;Cat eye&amp;#34; look or more natural, either way, it stays on with out smudging through out the day, i&#x27;ve used other &amp;#34;gel liners&amp;#34; and they start fading or smudging, with this one i didn&#x27;t get that, and it goes on so smooth, so no tugging your eyelid, and looking great. You get a lot of product at a bargain of a price!! Would most definitely  recommend this to a friend!</li>
            <li> This is so much easier to use compared to premixed liner that is more commonly sold.  You can mix to the desired consistency.  Very long lasting.</li>
            <li> So excited to find this product as I tried several brands of pencils and they all smeared.  This goes on smoothly and stays put and the price point is amazing.  Love!</li>
            <li> For me, the only eyeliner is a cake liner.  I am a make up artist and have found it so hard to find a reasonably priced cake eyeliner.  (ie Clinique wanted $18.00 2 years ago, Chanel is around $75)  I got this in the mail yesterday and tried it.  It is wonderful and the price is right.  It comes with a little brush.  I used my longer brush.  The consistency is the same as the very expensive liners.  &lt;br /&gt;Thanks for carrying this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use this eyeliner for years 20+ and just love it easy to put on lasts and isn&#x27;t costly. I&#x27;ve had problems in the past finding it but not any more.I would get a better brush to use with it.</li>
            <li> The product is so porous, it simply won&#x27;t apply really black. (Mary Kay used to offer an excellent cake eyeliner, but it&#x27;s no longer available. I&#x27;m trying to find a replacement.)&lt;br /&gt;The packaging of the Fran Wilson liner is nice - that&#x27;s why I gave it one star - but the plastic cover on the application brush WOULD NOT come off! I tugged and tugged, and pulled the bristles from the handle. Then I tried cutting it off. Finally, I threw the brush (which is teeny-weeny, anyway) in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;Huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is inexpensive, but it tends to get all over your eyes.  And getting it off isn&#x27;t easy.  What I disliked was it came on beautifully, but usually evaporated all over my face.  The problem, I think, is it&#x27;s too powdery.  Cake eyeliner should stay in one place.  That&#x27;s one thing I want in an eyeliner.  So I am looking elsewhere for cake eyeliner.  Mary Kay has good ones but they&#x27;re so expensive for what she gives you that I would never pay those prices.</li>
            <li> This dinosaur eyeliner, from back in the day, is hard to find, but definately worth the search, thin lines with heavinesss control. Love it. Thanks Amazon for the speedy drlivery.</li>
            <li> This is the kind of eyeliner I grew up with and it works perfectly. The seller was very prompt and delivery was great. I would get this again. A friend of mine had the permanent make up done and I am just not ready for that.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  I was unable to use the very tiny brush that comes in the case, but use a longer, more expensive brush and get a perfect line everytime.  Unlike pencil liners, there is no caking.  And although it is not waterproof, I&#x27;ve been through a few tearful moments and the liner never smudged.  If you are looking for a more dramatic black liner, this is the one to get.  I had hoped that if I used a little more water it would appear lighter, as I really would prefer a gray shade.</li>
            <li> Cake eyeliner has been very, very hard to find since it was basically replaced with eyeliner pencils and bottles of liner a few years ago. I have always hated the pencils, but had no choice since the bottled eyeliners looked so harsh on me.  The pencils tug at the delicate skin around the eyes and probably cause wrinkles for a lot of people.  They basically wear off after about 3 hours and need to be reapplied.  On cooler days, they need to be heated up with a hairdryer in order for them to work at all.  Annoying!!!  So I was really intrigued to find the Fran Wilson Cake Eyeliner on the Internet and decided to take a gamble, figuring I&#x27;d probably toss it right in the trash after trying it. I have heard that makeup artists prefer cake eyeliner and now I know why! When I applied it for the first time, I could not believe my eyes.  This product is SO superior to any type of eyeliner I have ever used.  It&#x27;s a breeze to apply, it is easy to draw the line and control the color and intensity and shape of the line.  Applying it takes about 1/3 of the time I used to spend fooling with the pencil, trying to sharpen the pencil, often ending up with a mess and having to resharpen and resharpen, not to mention making corrections since the pencil is so easy to mess up. Once you&#x27;ve drawn the line with this liner, you can easily take the brush and fan it, creating a soft, natural, look or even go right over it again to make it more intense. Contrary to what a lot of people say here, I find it extremely easy to remove and love the fact that it stays on until I take it off. The best part is my eyes look amazing, not at all harsh or fake-looking. I hope everyone will buy this product so that they will keep making it. But I&#x27;m not taking any chances, I&#x27;m buying about 50 of these so I never run out. Cake eyeliner is a really good value, it lasts for a very long time and that&#x27;s probably why they decided to take it away from us for so many years.  If you want your eyes to look great and want to save yourself a lot of time and money, you should definitely try this product! Don&#x27;t listen to the few negative reviewers here or you could miss out on a product that will change your life for the better!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this Cake Eyeliner. It lasts forever, no fading,water based and easy to remove. I have never liked liquid or pencil eyeliners and this Cake Eyeliner works great for me. I apply it with a bent eyeliner brush so I have a lot of control also. Buy this product you will not be dis-appointed.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I am dismayed that some of my favorite cake eyeliners have been discontinued.  However, I was encouraged by the many positive reviews I read about this product, so I ordered it from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it to be difficult to mix with water to get the right consistency. It also doesn&#x27;t have good staying power; if I apply it on my lower lash line it \\&quot;melts\\&quot; down into my undereye area, making me look sick and/or like I haven&#x27;t slept in days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I noticed that one of the main ingredients is talc.  Talc has been called a carcinogen by many groups due to its similarity to asbestos, but it seems controversial.  It is indeed in many products but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s safe. The cosmetics industry is not as thoroughly regulated as foods and drugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, my experiment with this product was a flop.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I excepted I loved may Belline hoping it was similar but, it wasn&#x27;t I am a makeup artist and no one has come close to msybelline cake eyeliner</li>
            <li> Great product. Very controllable, and can apply it thin, unlike those thick liquid eyeliners.</li>
            <li> This special brand was not to my liking, gave it to a friend who really likes it.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the cake eyeliners over the liquid, but could not find any at the department/drug store. This is a good product and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I used it as a kid and now my daughter can use it too! The eyeliner available in stores today does not provide the flexibility this cake eyeliner provides. I put it on and let it dry a little and then wipe it off. The thin line that remains is perfect! Thank you for making this product available! You are greatly appreciated!</li>
            <li> Have been using for years and plan on using forever. Glides on, stays on. No pulling of the eyelid. Easily removed.</li>
            <li> but easier for me to purchase via Amazon Prime for about a dollar or 2 more than I was buying my La Femme cake liner for(NOT the creamy cake liner, just the regular stuff, the creamy is awful)...but it&#x27;ll be here in 2 days rather than a week or more shipping for the La Femme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is pigmented, so if you love a DARK and INTENSE liner go ahead and try this. I don&#x27;t notice any smudging, which is the wonderful thing about a good cake liner, if you apply it wet over some sort of primer or powdered base, then let it dry, maybe add a little sealant (or a spray of mac fix+, urban decay or skindinavia setting sprays, whatever your fancy)it&#x27;s going to stay quite well for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can take this BOLD-which I prefer with a nice 60&#x27;s flick at the edge-or you can take this natural, or smudgy...all depending on how much water you add, the brush you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The la femme pots used nearly daily last me around 8 months or more I&#x27;d say...I&#x27;m assuming the Franny Wilson liner will be about the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice some strange slight silver sparkle when I held the liner up to the light..but I don&#x27;t see it on my eye at ALL, so I don&#x27;t really care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy so far...will update if my opinion changes.</li>
            <li> I used Maybelline cake eyeliner for years and then couldn&#x27;t find cake at all.  The liquids are OK, but this goes on with much more control.  I like that you can use this wet or dry.  Some people complained about the brush...it is small, but the size makes it easy to control the application and the width of the line.  Would recommend and definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product like this....it&#x27;s terrific, love the brush....</li>
            <li> LOVE CAKE EYELINER...</li>
            <li> I was very surprised how much I like this eyeliner.  It is what I was looking for.  I am very pleased</li>
            <li> Disappointing. It doesn&#x27;t go on smooth and it isn&#x27;t quite dark enough.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup fiend. I have literally hundreds of eyeliners alone...black being my classic favorite. I have struggled for years trying to find one that worked as well as it should for me. Gels, liquids, pencils...they all weren&#x27;t as great as this product. It makes it that much better that it is so economically effective...not to mention the long wearability and the actual look of it seems more...idk..romantic vs liquids and pencils. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, a bold liquid line will always have always place and time...but this is simply perfect.</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of Clinique&#x27;s cake eyeliner, which they sadly discontinued making. I bought this as an alternative. It goes on easily and lasts all day. My only complaint is that they could have put in a full size applicator brush with it. I still have my old Clinique brush, and have been using that. I am not sure I could achieve the same results using the tiny brush they include with this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the cake eyeliner! I discovered gel eyeliner about a year ago and after the compact I had purchased started becoming dry, I decided to look elsewhere. I stumbled across cake eyeliner online and I think it actually works better than gel eyeliner. For some reason it shows up on my eyes better.</li>
