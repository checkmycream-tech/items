            <li>Awesome.</li>
            <li>Smells great too!</li>
            <li>That said, I would not recommend this product for anyone who doesn&#x27;t like mint, but for those who don&#x27;t mind it, it is excellent.</li>
            <li>Best conditioner ever.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention this is the best deal on this product I have found!</li>

            <li>I will continue to use this conditioner, it really good!</li>
            <li>It smells great and feels great on my scalp and on my hair.  </li>
            <li>It may be great in its ability to restore moisture to your hair, I don&#x27;t know, but I do know that I don&#x27;t like the way my hair feels after I use it.</li>
            <li>That is a sign of a great conditioner.</li>
            <li>Works great, smells good, will purchase again.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have sulfates, so that&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE this conditioner!!!</li>
            <li>It is awesome and worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The best part is when you dry your hair it falls perfectly with no residue on it.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>favorite thing about this conditioner is the tingly feeling my head has after I wash it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and a while I use Abba detox to strip the shampoo out of my hair and the conditioner does a nice job of re-moisturizing it afterwards.</li>
            <li>would have given this a 5 star review if it were just as good as potent as the conditioner it replaced, the abba Moisture Scentsation, but it is still great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found this shampoo and the matching conditioner perfect for my hair as well as not irritating to my skin</li>
            <li>I have been using ABBA Pure Moisture Conditioner (now just called Moisture Conditioner) for many years, and it&#x27;s the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair smelling wonderful for days, I also get compliments on how soft my hair feels!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a great fragrance, works into my hair well, rinses out easy and makes my hair smooth.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and good price!</li>
            <li>I love using Abba Conditioner and Shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for more than 15 years and it has never made my hair feel over conditioned.</li>
            <li>you shouldn&#x27;t have to pay more than $25 for a liter.  </li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I tend to have frizzy hair on the top layer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Biolage used to be my favorite shampoo and conditioner until I got the abba Moisture shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE the Abba moisture hair products line.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the scent and have been using it for many years.  </li>
            <li>I have not found another product that I and my hair love better than this.</li>
            <li>The peppermint adds a refreshing tingle.</li>
            <li>(one of my problems with many products).</li>
            <li>Abba shampoo (and conditioner) has always been a favorite.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The new formula is what I received and I&#x27;m completely happy with it.</li>
            <li>Though you have to rinse for a good while because it leaves this waxy oily feeling on my roots and ends but other than that, the results are great.</li>
            <li>It really does a good job of moisturizing my hair.  </li>
            <li>Have used this product for 15+ years and have fine hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells super minty and makes your head tingle, love it.</li>
            <li>So when I realized that I could get a huge bottle of it on Amazon for a fraction of the price it sells for in stores (by ounce), it was a no brainer.  </li>
            <li>Love the product and the price is right.  </li>
            <li>The new formula has peppermint and smells really fresh and good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It rinses cleanly, but does the job</li>
            <li>It contains mint which is great for calming a dry, itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li>But either way, smells amazing (clean and minty), no heavy residue, smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I have used this for several years and absolutely LOVED the smell,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you are rich, get the older slightly better products here before they are gone.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, Amazon did the right thing and issued a refund and will keep my business.</li>
            <li>I got the conditioner quickly and the cap was taped to prevent spillage.  </li>
            <li>Product came quickly and was well packaged with no leaking.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has beautiful healthy thick hair, and she uses this product as well with the same amazing results.  </li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!!</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not!</li>
            <li>I tried it, and I have to agree that the new formula is just as good as the old.  </li>
            <li>so my hair is sensitive and many shampoos cause dandruff and dryness.</li>
            <li>stumbled on this shampoo and conditioner searching for products with a more natural lean, although I know some people have issues with some ingredients here.</li>
            <li>Originally it was Moisture Scentsation, now called Pure Moisture.  </li>
            <li>When I got the conditioner from Amazon, I noticed that the formula had changed significantly vs. the tube I had purchased in a local store back in July 2012 - which didn&#x27;t make me happy.  </li>
            <li>But as a mom who doesnt enjoy spending hours getting ready in the morning, and one who simply cant even spend more than 45 minutes weekdays (if Im lucky), I always struggle with this.</li>
            <li>It better be that I get the exact product - sage, geranium and wild mint because that is what I am expecting as was advertised.</li>
            <li>Especially for normal or fine hair, if you use the shampoo and conditioner, your hair will come out like silk and lay perfect (with no weighed down residue feeling) after a blow</li>
            <li>It leaves my fine, straight hair so soft and smooth and well-conditioned.  </li>
            <li>It is more expensive but worth it as it is not tested on animals and contains great moisturizers, not soapy fillers.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much I had to buy this 33 ounce big bottle of conditioner and shampoo!</li>
            <li>I have used ABBA I think for about twenty years or more - I would never use anything different.  </li>
            <li>This is very misleading!</li>
            <li>This is the only conditioner I have used for many years.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Diane!</li>
            <li>I have used only Abba conditioner for many years.  </li>
            <li>My hair is basically frizz free right as it dries thanks to this, and a little bit of my fave hair serum, and its almost perfect (its only ever \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; when I flat iron!).</li>
            <li>I was too excited to have found the Sage, Geranium and Wild Mint version,</li>
            <li>a significant savings.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself has a wonderul scent of mint which I prefer over floral or fruity-smelling products, and leaves your hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>This product is normally 16 dollars for 6 ounces!!</li>
            <li>and this conditioner makes my hair look soooo healithy and feel so soft and full of life.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other top of the line products and simply fell in love with ABBA&#x27;s pure moisture conditioner, pure detox shampoo, and pure recovery conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Leaves the hair super supple and soft.  </li>
            <li>so the only drawback I can see is the strong mint odor.</li>
            <li>I have been using Abba Pure Moisture Conditioner for over 15 years.  </li>
            <li>Been using this product for years (also the shampoo is pure moisture by ABBA)</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s mild once a person&#x27;s hair is dry, and makes mine smell fresh!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great stuff, and has kept my hair (About 27 inches long) soft and shiny for several months now.</li>
            <li>I was quite upset when I went to buy some more today and found the new products replacing it had different scents that I didn&#x27;t care for at all.  </li>
            <li>So I called ABBA, and they told me that the formula was changed in order to comply with new, more stringent FDA guidelines, but that the product benefits and results should remain the same.  </li>
            <li>Has made a HUGE difference in the overall feel and look of my hair.</li>
            <li>I personally am a mint-lover, so I don&#x27;t mind the smell so much, and I enjoy the cooling, tingly feel.</li>
            <li>I used this product in conjunction with the conditioner, as that too works really well and also smells minty and makes your scalp tingle.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how you know the product works really well.  </li>
            <li>This was very convenient.</li>
            <li>I felt very mislead because it was a product that cannot be returned, and I will not order from SalonDirect again.</li>
            <li>I really expected better from an ABBA product.</li>
            <li>conditioner also has really helped with damaged ends.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>ABBA really soothes and softens my hair, while strengthening it and without leaving any additional weight or residue feeling.</li>
            <li>I loved how soft and shiny the old version of the conditioner left my hair, the new version is fine, and is as good as any other brand i have tried but does not have quite the same effect on my rather porous, mature, wavy  hair as the prior version.</li>
            <li>I have been using ABBA conditioner for many years and would not use any other.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have found it here - the last 2 bottles apparently.  </li>
            <li>Pure moisture conditioner leaves my hair soft, silky, and very shiny.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely extraordinary and necessary product for our hygiene needs ...</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this conditioner (the older product Moisture Scentsation.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Unlike many other moisturizers that feel like they coat my hair with a film this one feels like to caused the hair to retain natural moisture.  </li>
            <li>You may have to use a bit more to get the same effect, but its worth the cost savings if you&#x27;re not rich.</li>
            <li>The picture shows the older geranium mint moisture conditioner, which is what i wanted, the conditioner which was sent was the new peppermint conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Smells really goid and leave your hair soft and manageable for days.</li>
            <li>and she has thinning hair and very sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>good stuff, but not the same product with the same name in the little tube.</li>
            <li>note I will make is that this is a new replacement product for the smaller more potent (and expensive) abba Moisture Scentsation shampoo.</li>
            <li>No more static electricity.  </li>
            <li>As a last resort and having to try many products with no success, I purchased Abba.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is slightly less potent than the previous product it replaced Moisture Scentsation, but with all the  extra amount you get for the cheaper price, you can still get the same effect by using a bit more conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also feel that this is pure enough for my 10-year old to use.</li>
            <li>It does not weigh hair down, rinses out clean, yet repairs and leaves hair soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li>The picture for this listing shows the old formula with sage and geranium.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an all natural 100% vegan product.</li>
            <li>It cleaned my scalp, took away the dryness and the itchyness without stripping my hair of it&#x27;s natural moisture.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Sage, Geranium and Wild Mint version for over 15 years.  </li>
            <li>The picture clearly shows the label with Sage, Geranium and Wild Mint.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say, my hair appreciates a good conditioner.  </li>
            <li>, so it&#x27;s pretty dry</li>
            <li>At first I was reluctant to purchase Abba because of the price, but I was in dire need of finding a shampoo that would take away my dandruff and my dry itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>We used to be committed to Aveda, but found that the ABBA moisture shampoo and conditioner is not only less pricey but works better for both my fine Nordic hair and my husband&#x27;s thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>I mention this only because I want to be clear that I am not attracted to only higher end</li>
            <li>Despite the advertising above about being all natural and vegan, this contains the chemicals parabens.</li>
            <li>My hair and scalp are so much healthier than they ever were with other products.  </li>
            <li>It is only a little less potent.</li>
            <li>If the company (ABBA) has issued a whole new version of a product, it is flat out dishonest to sell it based on old information and pictures.</li>
            <li>I have really thin, easily damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a male 35 male with normal hair that has thinned a bit as I&#x27;ve aged, but I&#x27; not balding or anything.</li>

            <li> I have used ABBA I think for about twenty years or more - I would never use anything different.  </li>
            <li> This is very misleading!</li>
            <li> This is the only conditioner I have used for many years.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Diane!</li>
            <li> I have used only Abba conditioner for many years.  </li>
            <li> My hair is basically frizz free right as it dries thanks to this, and a little bit of my fave hair serum, and its almost perfect (its only ever \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; when I flat iron!).</li>
            <li> I was too excited to have found the Sage, Geranium and Wild Mint version,</li>
            <li> a significant savings.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself has a wonderul scent of mint which I prefer over floral or fruity-smelling products, and leaves your hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> This product is normally 16 dollars for 6 ounces!!</li>
            <li> and this conditioner makes my hair look soooo healithy and feel so soft and full of life.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other top of the line products and simply fell in love with ABBA&#x27;s pure moisture conditioner, pure detox shampoo, and pure recovery conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Leaves the hair super supple and soft.  </li>
            <li> so the only drawback I can see is the strong mint odor.</li>
            <li> I have been using Abba Pure Moisture Conditioner for over 15 years.  </li>
            <li> Been using this product for years (also the shampoo is pure moisture by ABBA)</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s mild once a person&#x27;s hair is dry, and makes mine smell fresh!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great stuff, and has kept my hair (About 27 inches long) soft and shiny for several months now.</li>
            <li> I was quite upset when I went to buy some more today and found the new products replacing it had different scents that I didn&#x27;t care for at all.  </li>
            <li> So I called ABBA, and they told me that the formula was changed in order to comply with new, more stringent FDA guidelines, but that the product benefits and results should remain the same.  </li>
            <li> Has made a HUGE difference in the overall feel and look of my hair.</li>
            <li> I personally am a mint-lover, so I don&#x27;t mind the smell so much, and I enjoy the cooling, tingly feel.</li>
            <li> I used this product in conjunction with the conditioner, as that too works really well and also smells minty and makes your scalp tingle.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how you know the product works really well.  </li>
            <li> This was very convenient.</li>
            <li> I felt very mislead because it was a product that cannot be returned, and I will not order from SalonDirect again.</li>
            <li> I really expected better from an ABBA product.</li>
            <li> conditioner also has really helped with damaged ends.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> ABBA really soothes and softens my hair, while strengthening it and without leaving any additional weight or residue feeling.</li>
            <li> I loved how soft and shiny the old version of the conditioner left my hair, the new version is fine, and is as good as any other brand i have tried but does not have quite the same effect on my rather porous, mature, wavy  hair as the prior version.</li>
            <li> I have been using ABBA conditioner for many years and would not use any other.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have found it here - the last 2 bottles apparently.  </li>
            <li> Pure moisture conditioner leaves my hair soft, silky, and very shiny.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely extraordinary and necessary product for our hygiene needs ...</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this conditioner (the older product Moisture Scentsation.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Unlike many other moisturizers that feel like they coat my hair with a film this one feels like to caused the hair to retain natural moisture.  </li>
            <li> You may have to use a bit more to get the same effect, but its worth the cost savings if you&#x27;re not rich.</li>
            <li> The picture shows the older geranium mint moisture conditioner, which is what i wanted, the conditioner which was sent was the new peppermint conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Smells really goid and leave your hair soft and manageable for days.</li>
            <li> and she has thinning hair and very sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> good stuff, but not the same product with the same name in the little tube.</li>
            <li> note I will make is that this is a new replacement product for the smaller more potent (and expensive) abba Moisture Scentsation shampoo.</li>
            <li> No more static electricity.  </li>
            <li> As a last resort and having to try many products with no success, I purchased Abba.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is slightly less potent than the previous product it replaced Moisture Scentsation, but with all the  extra amount you get for the cheaper price, you can still get the same effect by using a bit more conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also feel that this is pure enough for my 10-year old to use.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh hair down, rinses out clean, yet repairs and leaves hair soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li> The picture for this listing shows the old formula with sage and geranium.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an all natural 100% vegan product.</li>
            <li> It cleaned my scalp, took away the dryness and the itchyness without stripping my hair of it&#x27;s natural moisture.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Sage, Geranium and Wild Mint version for over 15 years.  </li>
            <li> The picture clearly shows the label with Sage, Geranium and Wild Mint.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, my hair appreciates a good conditioner.  </li>
            <li> , so it&#x27;s pretty dry</li>
            <li> At first I was reluctant to purchase Abba because of the price, but I was in dire need of finding a shampoo that would take away my dandruff and my dry itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> We used to be committed to Aveda, but found that the ABBA moisture shampoo and conditioner is not only less pricey but works better for both my fine Nordic hair and my husband&#x27;s thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> I mention this only because I want to be clear that I am not attracted to only higher end</li>
            <li> Despite the advertising above about being all natural and vegan, this contains the chemicals parabens.</li>
            <li> My hair and scalp are so much healthier than they ever were with other products.  </li>
            <li> It is only a little less potent.</li>
            <li> If the company (ABBA) has issued a whole new version of a product, it is flat out dishonest to sell it based on old information and pictures.</li>
            <li> I have really thin, easily damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male 35 male with normal hair that has thinned a bit as I&#x27;ve aged, but I&#x27; not balding or anything.</li>
            <li> I also dont want to use a flat iron every day, because my hair is starting to get fried from it and hair</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and I use a blow dryer and hot iron to style it.  </li>
            <li> After drying hair does not lay down like it is coated with a film of something, they are natural feeling.  </li>
            <li> After only a few applications my hair is now soft and looks fuller.  </li>
            <li> Its all natural and you just need a little of it.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, somewhat coarse auburn red hair and this along with the shampoo make it soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> When I use a hairdryer it takes longer to dry as it feel like the hair is retaining water.  </li>
            <li> My hair is dry and thinning, Abba Moisture Conditioner has changed that.  </li>
            <li> While this product change is not the fault of this particular seller, the false advertising, or incorrect picture is entirely their fault.</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for years as my hair and scalp are very dry.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo helped to bring the dull color and split-ends and overall texture back to life again.  </li>
            <li> Been using this for years but getting harder to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> A little product goes a long way, and it is very moisturizing without leaving residue behind.  </li>
            <li> With other shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners I&#x27;ve always felt the need to switch them up - this one seems to do the trick -</li>
            <li> They got discontinued from what I understand due to this product replacing it.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Abba-Moisture-Scentsation-Shampoo-Conditioner/dp/</li>
            <li> And I have been through the whole assortment of professional products, so I feel qualified to tell you that when I use Abba products I do not have a bad hair day.  </li>
            <li> Other conditioners made my hair feel and look weighed down like it was coated too heavily, but not this stuff.</li>
            <li> It has different ingredients also when I compared it with my ABBA pure moisture I got from the salon :-(</li>
            <li> got compliments almost everyday from people that also thought my hair smelled wonderful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is one of the few conditioners I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Will order again in a few months.  </li>
            <li> As for the people who are reporting that it makes there hair smell like wet dog, I have not experienced that smell at all.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t care for it as much :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one less thing to worry about, and it&#x27;s a lot less expensive than what I used to buy.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a minty scent that it leaves behind that I like as well.</li>
            <li> I,m 31 and have baby thin hair</li>
            <li> I have seen the product change for the worse.  </li>
            <li> I am BEYOND livid regarding this false advertising.  </li>
            <li> My hair was heavily damaged from a bad coloring.  </li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t real thick anymore though.</li>
            <li> sad</li>
            <li> Sadly, this formula has been discontinued.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> Ill try anything, and have tried an insane number of all things potion and lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> LOVE this stuff! I color and straighten my hair, so it&#x27;s pretty dry and this conditioner makes my hair look soooo healithy and feel so soft and full of life.  The picture for this listing shows the old formula with sage and geranium.  The new formula has peppermint and smells really fresh and good.  The new formula is what I received and I&#x27;m completely happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have used ABBA I think for about twenty years or more - I would never use anything different.  I especially like the spearmint/mint scent and the way it always leaves my hair.</li>
            <li> I love using Abba Conditioner and Shampoo. Leaves the hair super supple and soft.  There&#x27;s a minty scent that it leaves behind that I like as well.</li>
            <li> My mom is over 65 and she has thinning hair and very sensitive scalp. This is the only shampoo that has worked for her to prevent dryness and irritated itchy scalp feeling. I,m 31 and have baby thin hair so my hair is sensitive and many shampoos cause dandruff and dryness. This shampoo works wonders for me as well. Though you have to rinse for a good while because it leaves this waxy oily feeling on my roots and ends but other than that, the results are great.</li>
            <li> I have thick, somewhat coarse auburn red hair and this along with the shampoo make it soft and shiny.  I have been using it for over a year every once and a while I use Abba detox to strip the shampoo out of my hair and the conditioner does a nice job of re-moisturizing it afterwards.</li>
            <li> At first I was reluctant to purchase Abba because of the price, but I was in dire need of finding a shampoo that would take away my dandruff and my dry itchy scalp. As a last resort and having to try many products with no success, I purchased Abba. To my surprise it works wonderfully well. It&#x27;s an all natural 100% vegan product. As I was washing my hair I could feel my scalp tingle, and I could smell the minty freshness. It cleaned my scalp, took away the dryness and the itchyness without stripping my hair of it&#x27;s natural moisture. I used this product in conjunction with the conditioner, as that too works really well and also smells minty and makes your scalp tingle. That&#x27;s how you know the product works really well.  As for the people who are reporting that it makes there hair smell like wet dog, I have not experienced that smell at all. My hair smells minty after washing my hair, so maybe it has something to do with their genes or ph level.</li>
            <li> I got the conditioner quickly and the cap was taped to prevent spillage.  Great!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this and I&#x27;ve been using it for years on my color-treated hair. Works great, smells good, will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely extraordinary and necessary product for our hygiene needs ...</li>
            <li> good stuff, but not the same product with the same name in the little tube.</li>
            <li> Despite the advertising above about being all natural and vegan, this contains the chemicals parabens. This is very misleading! Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than 15 years and it has never made my hair feel over conditioned.</li>
            <li> A hairdresser recommended. I didn&#x27;t see any difference</li>
            <li> Been using this for years but getting harder to find in stores.  This was very convenient.</li>
            <li> The best for curly hair the best! Smells really goid and leave your hair soft and manageable for days. Will order again!</li>
            <li> This is the only conditioner I have used for many years. Has made a HUGE difference in the overall feel and look of my hair. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to the ABBA hair care line while in cosmetology school in the 90&#x27;s.  I&#x27;ve tried other top of the line products and simply fell in love with ABBA&#x27;s pure moisture conditioner, pure detox shampoo, and pure recovery conditioner.  My hair and scalp are so much healthier than they ever were with other products.  Pure moisture conditioner leaves my hair soft, silky, and very shiny.  I can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> I have really thin, easily damaged hair.  It&#x27;s awful.  And I have been through the whole assortment of professional products, so I feel qualified to tell you that when I use Abba products I do not have a bad hair day.  My daughter has beautiful healthy thick hair, and she uses this product as well with the same amazing results.  It&#x27;s botanical, and not tested on animals.  Shop around...you shouldn&#x27;t have to pay more than $25 for a liter.  It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I used this conditioner at a spa I go to, and decided to buy some for at home.  A little product goes a long way, and it is very moisturizing without leaving residue behind.  Awesome.</li>
            <li> I have used this for several years and absolutely LOVED the smell,&lt;br /&gt;I got compliments almost everyday from people that also thought my hair smelled wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;But, they have recently changed the formula and I don&#x27;t care for it as much :(</li>
            <li> I have been using ABBA conditioner for many years and would not use any other.  Originally it was Moisture Scentsation, now called Pure Moisture.  It does not weigh hair down, rinses out clean, yet repairs and leaves hair soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li> This conditioner compliments the shampoo...very tingly on my scalp.  This was recommended by my stylist, and it works!  Thanks to Diane!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Fast shipping and good price!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  It smells great and feels great on my scalp and on my hair.  Product came quickly and was well packaged with no leaking.  Would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product.  I have used only Abba conditioner for many years.  I have seen the product change for the worse.  I think it is time to look around for a replacement conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair was heavily damaged from a bad coloring.  This shampoo helped to bring the dull color and split-ends and overall texture back to life again.  Very good for highlighted and/or damaged hair.  Smells great too!</li>
            <li> This is one of the few conditioners I&#x27;ve tried that actually *feels* like a conditioner. It&#x27;s great stuff, and has kept my hair (About 27 inches long) soft and shiny for several months now. It rinses cleanly, but does the job well. I personally am a mint-lover, so I don&#x27;t mind the smell so much, and I enjoy the cooling, tingly feel. However, my aunt showers after me some days, and complains about the &amp;#34;weird smell&amp;#34; in the bathroom...so the only drawback I can see is the strong mint odor. But, it&#x27;s mild once a person&#x27;s hair is dry, and makes mine smell fresh! That said, I would not recommend this product for anyone who doesn&#x27;t like mint, but for those who don&#x27;t mind it, it is excellent.</li>
            <li> Good Product! Fast Shipping!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for years as my hair and scalp are very dry.  It is more expensive but worth it as it is not tested on animals and contains great moisturizers, not soapy fillers.  It contains mint which is great for calming a dry, itchy scalp.  I tend to use it just on my scalp and use another moisturizer on the legnth of my hair but you can use it as an all-over conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have been using Abba Pure Moisture Conditioner for over 15 years.  I have been using the Sage, Geranium and Wild Mint version for over 15 years.  This is NOT what they are selling.  The picture clearly shows the label with Sage, Geranium and Wild Mint.  I am livid.  No.  I am BEYOND livid regarding this false advertising.  I was too excited to have found the Sage, Geranium and Wild Mint version, that I did not read the reviews.  Big mistake.  If you are looking for the quality product that Abba used to sell, you&#x27;re not going to find it here.  They have changed their product.  While this product change is not the fault of this particular seller, the false advertising, or incorrect picture is entirely their fault.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years (also the shampoo is pure moisture by ABBA) as well. With other shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners I&#x27;ve always felt the need to switch them up - this one seems to do the trick - haven&#x27;t felt that urge to switch. I probably will now that I said that. But either way, smells amazing (clean and minty), no heavy residue, smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> The product was not the same as pictured nor described. If the company (ABBA) has issued a whole new version of a product, it is flat out dishonest to sell it based on old information and pictures. I felt very mislead because it was a product that cannot be returned, and I will not order from SalonDirect again. Fortunately, Amazon did the right thing and issued a refund and will keep my business.</li>
            <li> I ordered this conditioner -- thinking that it would be similar to the former ABBA &amp;#34;Moisture Scentsation&amp;#34; conditioner. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not! This conditioner leaves a residue on your hair even after several rinses. It may be great in its ability to restore moisture to your hair, I don&#x27;t know, but I do know that I don&#x27;t like the way my hair feels after I use it. I really expected better from an ABBA product.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner ever.  Its all natural and you just need a little of it.  No more static electricity.  Have used this product for 15+ years and have fine hair.  No buildup.</li>
            <li> The picture shows the older geranium mint moisture conditioner, which is what i wanted, the conditioner which was sent was the new peppermint conditioner.  I loved how soft and shiny the old version of the conditioner left my hair, the new version is fine, and is as good as any other brand i have tried but does not have quite the same effect on my rather porous, mature, wavy  hair as the prior version.</li>
            <li> Moisture is the key word for this conditioner.  Unlike many other moisturizers that feel like they coat my hair with a film this one feels like to caused the hair to retain natural moisture.  When I use a hairdryer it takes longer to dry as it feel like the hair is retaining water.  After drying hair does not lay down like it is coated with a film of something, they are natural feeling.  That is a sign of a great conditioner.</li>
            <li> Good product. Cheaper than buying it at the hair salon. We used to be committed to Aveda, but found that the ABBA moisture shampoo and conditioner is not only less pricey but works better for both my fine Nordic hair and my husband&#x27;s thick curly hair. I also feel that this is pure enough for my 10-year old to use.</li>
            <li> I received a different bottle than pictured. It has different ingredients also when I compared it with my ABBA pure moisture I got from the salon :-( sad</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and thinning, Abba Moisture Conditioner has changed that.  After only a few applications my hair is now soft and looks fuller.  I will continue to use this conditioner, it really good!</li>
            <li> This product is normally 16 dollars for 6 ounces!! So this is a bargain. For curly hair, this conditioner is a dream.</li>
            <li> Love the product and the price is right.  Appreciate the availability.  Will order again in a few months.  Thank YOU!</li>
            <li> I am a beauty product addict. Price doesnt matter to me, Ill try anything, and have tried an insane number of all things potion and lotion. My fave hair serum is $5. My fave face cream is $200. I mention this only because I want to be clear that I am not attracted to only higher end lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I tend to have frizzy hair on the top layer. But as a mom who doesnt enjoy spending hours getting ready in the morning, and one who simply cant even spend more than 45 minutes weekdays (if Im lucky), I always struggle with this. I also dont want to use a flat iron every day, because my hair is starting to get fried from it and hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled on this shampoo and conditioner searching for products with a more natural lean, although I know some people have issues with some ingredients here. My hair is basically frizz free right as it dries thanks to this, and a little bit of my fave hair serum, and its almost perfect (its only ever \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; when I flat iron!). Soemtimes I dont even use the serum, and its still great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner also has really helped with damaged ends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male 35 male with normal hair that has thinned a bit as I&#x27;ve aged, but I&#x27; not balding or anything. My hair isn&#x27;t real thick anymore though. I got a sample of this conditioner (the older product Moisture Scentsation. I liked it so much I had to buy this 33 ounce big bottle of conditioner and shampoo! The conditioner is slightly less potent than the previous product it replaced Moisture Scentsation, but with all the  extra amount you get for the cheaper price, you can still get the same effect by using a bit more conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells super minty and makes your head tingle, love it. The best part is when you dry your hair it falls perfectly with no residue on it. Other conditioners made my hair feel and look weighed down like it was coated too heavily, but not this stuff. It is awesome and worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this a 5 star review if it were just as good as potent as the conditioner it replaced, the abba Moisture Scentsation, but it is still great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biolage used to be my favorite shampoo and conditioner until I got the abba Moisture shampoo and conditioner. Especially for normal or fine hair, if you use the shampoo and conditioner, your hair will come out like silk and lay perfect (with no weighed down residue feeling) after a blow dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note I will make is that this is a new replacement product for the smaller more potent (and expensive) abba Moisture Scentsation shampoo. It is only a little less potent. You may have to use a bit more to get the same effect, but its worth the cost savings if you&#x27;re not rich. If you are rich, get the older slightly better products here before they are gone. They got discontinued from what I understand due to this product replacing it.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Abba-Moisture-Scentsation-Shampoo-Conditioner/dp/B001DAUKG0/ref&#x3D;sr_1_fkmr0_1?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1361383065&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1-fkmr0&amp;keywords&#x3D;abba+mint+scentsation+shampoo</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE the Abba moisture hair products line. Leaves my hair smelling wonderful for days, I also get compliments on how soft my hair feels!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing about this conditioner is the tingly feeling my head has after I wash it! Not to mention this is the best deal on this product I have found!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It has a mint smell to it.  It really does a good job of moisturizing my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t have sulfates, so that&#x27;s good.  It&#x27;s one less thing to worry about, and it&#x27;s a lot less expensive than what I used to buy.</li>
            <li> I go out of my way to find this conditioner.  My hair is thick and I use a blow dryer and hot iron to style it.  Needless to say, my hair appreciates a good conditioner.  ABBA really soothes and softens my hair, while strengthening it and without leaving any additional weight or residue feeling.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this conditioner!!! It has a great fragrance, works into my hair well, rinses out easy and makes my hair smooth.  Great Product!!!</li>
            <li> Sadly, this formula has been discontinued.  I absolutely love the scent and have been using it for many years.  I was quite upset when I went to buy some more today and found the new products replacing it had different scents that I didn&#x27;t care for at all.  I&#x27;m glad to have found it here - the last 2 bottles apparently.  It better be that I get the exact product - sage, geranium and wild mint because that is what I am expecting as was advertised.</li>
            <li> I have not found another product that I and my hair love better than this. I have even got my husband to use it now. The peppermint adds a refreshing tingle. I&#x27;ve found this shampoo and the matching conditioner perfect for my hair as well as not irritating to my skin (one of my problems with many products).</li>
            <li> I have been using ABBA Pure Moisture Conditioner (now just called Moisture Conditioner) for many years, and it&#x27;s the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  So when I realized that I could get a huge bottle of it on Amazon for a fraction of the price it sells for in stores (by ounce), it was a no brainer.  When I got the conditioner from Amazon, I noticed that the formula had changed significantly vs. the tube I had purchased in a local store back in July 2012 - which didn&#x27;t make me happy.  So I called ABBA, and they told me that the formula was changed in order to comply with new, more stringent FDA guidelines, but that the product benefits and results should remain the same.  I tried it, and I have to agree that the new formula is just as good as the old.  It leaves my fine, straight hair so soft and smooth and well-conditioned.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Abba shampoo (and conditioner) has always been a favorite. It hasn&#x27;t been on store shelves for years but can be found a specialty hair care stores - for a hefty price. Buying the larger bottle through Amazon is a significant savings.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself has a wonderul scent of mint which I prefer over floral or fruity-smelling products, and leaves your hair feeling soft. Love it.</li>
