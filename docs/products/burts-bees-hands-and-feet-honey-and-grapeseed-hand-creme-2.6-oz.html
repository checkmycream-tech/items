            <li>The smell is just amazing.</li>
            <li>I will probably give the rest of my mostly-full tube to a friend who liked the way it smelled.</li>
            <li>so that I always have some handy.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>It is a pleasant smell, but it&#x27;s much more potent than I want on my hands.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs well, has a pleasant smell, and genuinely moisturizes my parched hands.</li>
            <li>Has a very light scent which is ok since I&#x27;m a man.  </li>

            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this stuff better than anything I have ever used and plan to throw out everything else that has collected over the years and stick with this one product.</li>
            <li>I love it.....</li>
            <li>I love almost everything Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s sells.</li>
            <li>More and more</li>
            <li>This hand cream was my favorite item in the sample box.  </li>
            <li>My favorite hand lotion of all time.</li>
            <li>Works better than this one.</li>
            <li>Nice creamy texture, AMAZING fragrance,and it makes nice, soft skin!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good, but the tube I have leaves a sticky residue.</li>
            <li>This worked wonders and my dry cracked hands are glowing again, not to mention it smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Liked product so much originally that I bought two more tubes worth!  </li>
            <li>Ok but strong it has a strong smell.</li>
            <li>It smells very nice and keeps my hands soft without being greasy.</li>
            <li>Smells great and makes hands super soft.</li>
            <li>I prefer fragrance free products, but this lotion smells great workout being &#x27;girly&#x27; (though the smell might actually make you hungry.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s greasy, messy, and best you stay away from this product.</li>
            <li>This newer version I received the manufacturer replaced Sunflower Oil (all natural, good for you) with Canola Oil.</li>
            <li>Try Neutrogena Norwegian Formula, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>This hand creme smells great and is very soothing and soft.</li>
            <li>Does a great job hydrating extremely dry and even cracked skin without a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>I like to think I&#x27;m pretty easy to please.</li>
            <li>I have been buying different Burt&#x27;s products and have been more than satisfied with all of  them.  </li>
            <li>I have been a Burt&#x27;s Bees loyal customer for years.</li>
            <li>I have a mild of eczema on my hands.</li>
            <li>Doing some pregnancy research, the fragrance in products is usually the most toxic thing, so products like this are good news.</li>
            <li>and your hands feel dry again, which makes me think it acts more as a moisture barrier and just sits on top of your skin.</li>
            <li>The kind of smell that, for some people, turns your stomach and gives you an instant headache.</li>
            <li>For those of us with finicky skin, this product is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>Goes on a bit tacky at first but then quickly gets absorbed by your skin as I massage in.  </li>
            <li>This is just right.  </li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>I threw away them right away.</li>
            <li>I had bought this cream at a pretty good price, and having been a fan of the other products and moisturizers</li>
            <li>This has a delicate honey scent that is very natural, very pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I was encouraged by the old reviews on this product, as it sounded fantastic.</li>
            <li>Stay away from Canola Oil as I had health problems related to it before I knew about the dangers and is now being used in many foods as well as lotions.</li>
            <li>It felt greasy at first, and then after I continued rubbing my hands together for a while it started to feel sticky.</li>
            <li>The deep moisturizing version made by Burts Bees is definitely better.</li>
            <li>The funny thing is that id found this cream by mistake.</li>
            <li>Some other reviewers have commented on a mild smell; I found it extremely strong.  </li>
            <li>Really good stuff, stops the dry skin itching caused by the sun beating my skin for the last 50 years!</li>
            <li>This has happened to much of the Burt&#x27;s Bees lineup.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much and it lasts along time.  </li>
            <li>I have really dry skin, and Burt&#x27;s Bees is the only lotion I&#x27;ve found to be truly effective.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little bit strong, but at least it&#x27;s a nice smell (makes me think of apple pie)!</li>
            <li>fantastic product if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li>Ultimate Hand Creme to have a nice texture, my skin feels soft after, and it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this feels on my hands and skin, but find the &amp;#34;honey&amp;#34; scent a little overpowering.  </li>
            <li>And for general use, DOES leave regular skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>and this is another one, just as nice as the regular cream that comes in the little tins and even richer.</li>
            <li>The older version of this was all natural.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to smells and this is not perfumey at all.</li>
            <li>Leaves hands very soft and non greasy.</li>
            <li>I do realize that all sounds very dramatic, and that many other people loved this product.</li>
            <li>And it keeps my hands soft and moisturized!</li>
            <li>Leaves a light oily layer once applied, but doesn&#x27;t leave a mess on everything you touch.</li>
            <li>It has a tiny hint of rotten honey (if that&#x27;s possible) and something else that&#x27;s far, far too sweet.</li>
            <li>The lotion does feel wonderfully soft and hydrating.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not pleasing as it has a scent resembling old lotion or Vaseline.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hands moisterized all day unless I wash my hands frequently then I re-apply.</li>
            <li>It quickly absorbs into the skin and the scent is subtle, but smells so good it tends to be just enough to make me a little hungry when I wear it!  </li>
            <li>So far the only cream that has transformed my hand back to 70% normal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little sticky at first but your skin absorbs it and what&#x27;s left is amazingly soft hands.</li>
            <li>I have 4-5 patches of dry skin on my hands and this cream seems like is the only thing that works thus far and putting my skin back to normal in those areas.</li>
            <li>This particular one has a very strong unpleasant odor.  </li>
            <li>Went on with my day and noticed the next morning my hands were still moisterized and not dry looking.  </li>
            <li>The smell is a little too strong, and it doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as I expected based on the performance of the Ultimate Hand Creme.  </li>

            <li> The smell is a little too strong, and it doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as I expected based on the performance of the Ultimate Hand Creme.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of problems with dry hands, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> This was a gift from a friend who knew my hands would be dry from washing bottles what seems to be constantly and she knew her stuff.  </li>
            <li> and they now use more artificial fragrances and ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Definitely moisturizing, and it feels like it sinks in when you put it on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 6 months pregnant and for the last couple months I&#x27;ve had this really weird spot of eczema on my knuckle.</li>
            <li> and he said since it&#x27;s not a big thing that we should should wait until after birth to try stronger cortisone or other steroid treatments.</li>
            <li> Must be the honey.... but even just raw natural honey from a farm didn&#x27;t work as well as this</li>
            <li> I use this because my hands are so dry.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to aggravate eczema for me after several days of use; an initial patch test didn&#x27;t fail, and for the first couple of days my hands were much less dry than they had been--but after using it for about five days I noticed a few persistent and growing dry patches and a few spots where my skin started peeling, which improved when I switched back to a different lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin in the winter and for years have been looking for a hand creme that would resolve this.  </li>
            <li> The consistency in the cream is rather rough and grainy.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> Walking down the isle opened the tube just to try it out.</li>
            <li> , so other ingredients must help too!</li>
            <li> find the Burt&#x27;s Bees Thoroughly Therapeutic Honey &amp; Grapeseed Oil Hand Crème to be slightly liquidy as if it has separated in the container.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super picky about product smells, but this one does smell like honey</li>
            <li> But it was pretty annoying having this endless itchy spot on my knuckle, especially since I work with my hands.</li>
            <li> Wish they would tone that down a little.</li>
            <li> It goes on feeling a little greasy</li>
            <li> and I keep rubbing my hands together after using it, feeling a little like Lady MacBeth.  </li>
            <li> The grape seed note is not dissolved well and just hangs heavy after you have applied the lotion.</li>
            <li> A bit on the pricey side but at least I don&#x27;t have to experiment with other creams and toss them out after not working at all.  </li>
            <li> My one complaint is that it&#x27;s a little tacky as it dries.</li>
            <li> However, I have noticed during the past year that the formulations have changed</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s just lotion</li>
            <li> and you will see that it is unnatural, and is a GMO&#x27;d version of Rapeseed Oil (not good for you either).</li>
            <li> It does not have alcohol...which is very hard to find.  </li>
            <li> If you like fake scented lotions, this will probably not be up your alley.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too sad about that part though, because soon I will have finished it</li>
            <li> However, this product was (imho) awful and should be left on the shelf.</li>
            <li> So I was disappointed to receive a product that had a cloying fake honey smell, felt like liquid plastic, and was difficult for my hands to absorb.</li>
            <li> They have bad smell.</li>
            <li> How disappointing!</li>
            <li> I hated the texture, too.</li>
            <li> My grandchildren swear this cures the worst type of chapped hands.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> the smell is good, the function is great</li>
            <li> Love this Hand Cream.&lt;br /&gt;Best ever.</li>
            <li> My grandchildren swear this cures the worst type of chapped hands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, but the tube I have leaves a sticky residue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best hand moisturizer I have found for my hands.</li>
            <li> fantastic product if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this hand cream!  I don&#x27;t like anything from Bath and Body Works, way too stinky stuff.  This is just right.  This price is way cheaper than buying it at Target.</li>
            <li> Absorbs well, has a pleasant smell, and genuinely moisturizes my parched hands.</li>
            <li> Have become a big fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products for skin and facial care.  Good price, the products work, and not spending a fortune on &amp;#34;prestidge&amp;#34; products.  These all work just as well or better.</li>
            <li> This has become my go to hand cream. It quickly absorbs into the skin and the scent is subtle, but smells so good it tends to be just enough to make me a little hungry when I wear it!  It must be the honey!!</li>
            <li> Ok but strong it has a strong smell.</li>
            <li> I have been buying Burt&#x27;s Bees products for years and loved them all.  However, I have noticed during the past year that the formulations have changed and they now use more artificial fragrances and ingredients.  This particular one has a very strong unpleasant odor.  I won&#x27;t buy or recommend their products anymore.  I do recommend Yes to Carrots Intensive Hand Care Cream.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have found for my eczema.  It does not have alcohol...which is very hard to find.  And, it smell good!!!</li>
            <li> Creamy, smooth, smells great!  The smell is a little bit strong, but at least it&#x27;s a nice smell (makes me think of apple pie)! :) And it keeps my hands soft and moisturized!</li>
            <li> Truly works on even the driest cracked hands and cuticles.  I keep one in different rooms of my house and in my purse too!</li>
            <li> ...and this is another one, just as nice as the regular cream that comes in the little tins and even richer.</li>
            <li> Definitely moisturizing, and it feels like it sinks in when you put it on. However, when you next wash your hands you can feel it come off and your hands feel dry again, which makes me think it acts more as a moisture barrier and just sits on top of your skin.</li>
            <li> Some other reviewers have commented on a mild smell; I found it extremely strong.  It is a pleasant smell, but it&#x27;s much more potent than I want on my hands.  The lotion does feel wonderfully soft and hydrating.  It seemed to aggravate eczema for me after several days of use; an initial patch test didn&#x27;t fail, and for the first couple of days my hands were much less dry than they had been--but after using it for about five days I noticed a few persistent and growing dry patches and a few spots where my skin started peeling, which improved when I switched back to a different lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is probably a good option to consider if you&#x27;re looking for a scented lotion.  I will probably give the rest of my mostly-full tube to a friend who liked the way it smelled.</li>
            <li> I was encouraged by the old reviews on this product, as it sounded fantastic. So I was disappointed to receive a product that had a cloying fake honey smell, felt like liquid plastic, and was difficult for my hands to absorb. Later I discovered that the product had changed. This has happened to much of the Burt&#x27;s Bees lineup.</li>
            <li> I bought three and it&#x27;s $2 cheaper each.</li>
            <li> LOVE Burts Bees products and this is no exception. This hand creme smells great and is very soothing and soft. LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> The older version of this was all natural. This newer version I received the manufacturer replaced Sunflower Oil (all natural, good for you) with Canola Oil. Look up Canola Oil online and you will see that it is unnatural, and is a GMO&#x27;d version of Rapeseed Oil (not good for you either). I contacted Burt&#x27;s Bees about why the change and the dangers of Canola Oil and I was ignored. Went to find at local health food stores a substitute that doesn&#x27;t use the cheaper bad-for-you Canola. Stay away from Canola Oil as I had health problems related to it before I knew about the dangers and is now being used in many foods as well as lotions. I have since taken Canola out of my diet and the problems I had have gone away.</li>
            <li> I had bought this cream at a pretty good price, and having been a fan of the other products and moisturizers I thought I would give this one a try. The consistency in the cream is rather rough and grainy. The smell is not pleasing as it has a scent resembling old lotion or Vaseline. The grape seed note is not dissolved well and just hangs heavy after you have applied the lotion. It&#x27;s greasy, messy, and best you stay away from this product.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent performance, superior product quality, giving a sense of comfort when using bright eye-catching package design.Very good</li>
            <li> This lotion smells amazing, and does not go on greasy at all.</li>
            <li> good smell, but doesn&#x27;t work at all! I have a lot of problems with dry hands, especially in the winter. I tried this, but it didn&#x27;t make a difference, could as well been without. Try Neutrogena Norwegian Formula, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> This is my second tube of this stuff! I love it! Smells and feels wonderful on my hands! I keep it beside the bed and enjoy using it before I go to sleep !!!</li>
            <li> Liked product so much originally that I bought two more tubes worth!  Love that beeswax scent. Protects my hands well.</li>
            <li> The texture of this is a bit different and does take a minute or two to absorb into the skin.  If you like fake scented lotions, this will probably not be up your alley.  This has a delicate honey scent that is very natural, very pleasant.  My only compliant is it doesn&#x27;t last longer.</li>
            <li> This was a gift from a friend who knew my hands would be dry from washing bottles what seems to be constantly and she knew her stuff.  This worked wonders and my dry cracked hands are glowing again, not to mention it smells wonderful.  A little goes a very long way.  It&#x27;s a little sticky at first but your skin absorbs it and what&#x27;s left is amazingly soft hands.</li>
            <li> It smells very nice and keeps my hands soft without being greasy. My one complaint is that it&#x27;s a little tacky as it dries.</li>
            <li> Was not the scent I was expecting, but still a good product.</li>
            <li> Nice creamy texture, AMAZING fragrance,and it makes nice, soft skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Ultimate Hand Creme for a while and thought I would try something else in the Burt&#x27;s Bees line.  I read through a lot of reviews about the smell and texture of this lotion before buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the Burt&#x27;s Bees Thoroughly Therapeutic Honey &amp; Grapeseed Oil Hand Crème to be slightly liquidy as if it has separated in the container.  It goes on feeling a little greasy and I keep rubbing my hands together after using it, feeling a little like Lady MacBeth.  The smell is a little too strong, and it doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as I expected based on the performance of the Ultimate Hand Creme.  I&#x27;m not too sad about that part though, because soon I will have finished it and then I can go back to what I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ultimate Hand Creme to have a nice texture, my skin feels soft after, and it goes a long way.  You should go buy that instead.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. Does a great job hydrating extremely dry and even cracked skin without a greasy feel. Have 3 bottles for my purse, night stand and desk at work so that I always have some handy.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin, and Burt&#x27;s Bees is the only lotion I&#x27;ve found to be truly effective. I use Burt&#x27;s Bees Hand Salve in the winter, and this hand cream in the summer. The combination of the two has done wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff better than anything I have ever used and plan to throw out everything else that has collected over the years and stick with this one product. I even use it on my face after shower and I can see a difference in my skin on my face. I love it.....</li>
            <li> I love almost everything Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s sells. I thought this would be no different. However, I dislike everything about this product. To me, the smell is horrid. It has a tiny hint of rotten honey (if that&#x27;s possible) and something else that&#x27;s far, far too sweet. Cloying. The kind of smell that, for some people, turns your stomach and gives you an instant headache. I hated the texture, too. It felt greasy at first, and then after I continued rubbing my hands together for a while it started to feel sticky. I thought it would go away but 45 minutes I had to wash my hands. I returned it just hours after buying it. I do realize that all sounds very dramatic, and that many other people loved this product. I like to think I&#x27;m pretty easy to please. I mean, it&#x27;s just lotion, right? However, this product was (imho) awful and should be left on the shelf.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin in the winter and for years have been looking for a hand creme that would resolve this.  Could not find anything until I tried the Bee&#x27;s wax.  More and more I have been buying different Burt&#x27;s products and have been more than satisfied with all of  them.  I am a convert.</li>
            <li> I love the way this feels on my hands and skin, but find the &amp;#34;honey&amp;#34; scent a little overpowering.  Wish they would tone that down a little.</li>
            <li> I have been a Burt&#x27;s Bees loyal customer for years. When I saw the deal of the Burt&#x27;s Bee hand creme on Amazon, I ordered two tubes. However, the ones I received seemed to be spoiled.  They have bad smell. When being squeezed, some watery liquid drips out. I threw away them right away. How disappointing!</li>
            <li> My wife is a florist and her hands suffer constant abuse.  I purchased this hand cream as a stocking stuffer and she loved it.  Burt&#x27;s Bees makes a great product with great form and function.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 6 months pregnant and for the last couple months I&#x27;ve had this really weird spot of eczema on my knuckle. I tried everything OTC, from cortisone cream to antibiotic cream, to gold bond. I asked my doctor about it and he said since it&#x27;s not a big thing that we should should wait until after birth to try stronger cortisone or other steroid treatments. But it was pretty annoying having this endless itchy spot on my knuckle, especially since I work with my hands. My husband got me the &amp;#34;Tips and Toes&amp;#34; kit as a gift and this came with it. It is literally the ONLY thing that keeps it itch-free and not inflamed. Must be the honey.... but even just raw natural honey from a farm didn&#x27;t work as well as this, so other ingredients must help too! I&#x27;m not super picky about product smells, but this one does smell like honey so that&#x27;s nice. Doing some pregnancy research, the fragrance in products is usually the most toxic thing, so products like this are good news. And for general use, DOES leave regular skin soft and smooth. For those of us with finicky skin, this product is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> This hand cream feels and smells SO good!  I want it in a body lotion,however, it only comes in the hand cream.  I received a sample of Burt&#x27;s Bees products through O&#x27;s Circle of Friends, it included salves and creams for feet and hands and Burt&#x27;s lip balm.  This hand cream was my favorite item in the sample box.  I don&#x27;t want to ever run out of it!</li>
            <li> I use this because my hands are so dry.  You don&#x27;t need much and it lasts along time.  Five star.</li>
            <li> Really good stuff, stops the dry skin itching caused by the sun beating my skin for the last 50 years!</li>
            <li> Best scent and keep my hands moisturized all day without having to re use. My favorite hand lotion of all time.</li>
            <li> I prefer fragrance free products, but this lotion smells great workout being &#x27;girly&#x27; (though the smell might actually make you hungry.) Leaves a light oily layer once applied, but doesn&#x27;t leave a mess on everything you touch. The deep moisturizing version made by Burts Bees is definitely better.</li>
            <li> So far the only cream that has transformed my hand back to 70% normal. I have a mild of eczema on my hands. Have tried all types of cream that the 3 different dermatologists have prescribed. I have 4-5 patches of dry skin on my hands and this cream seems like is the only thing that works thus far and putting my skin back to normal in those areas. Keeps my hands moisterized all day unless I wash my hands frequently then I re-apply. Goes on a bit tacky at first but then quickly gets absorbed by your skin as I massage in.  I have tried all types of creams apart from the prescribed stuff and this is the only thing that has done the job! Has a very light scent which is ok since I&#x27;m a man.  A bit on the pricey side but at least I don&#x27;t have to experiment with other creams and toss them out after not working at all.  The funny thing is that id found this cream by mistake. Walking down the isle opened the tube just to try it out. Went on with my day and noticed the next morning my hands were still moisterized and not dry looking.  Update:  also try neutrogena eczema hand cream. Works better than this one.</li>
            <li> This is addictive. The smell is just amazing. I am very sensitive to smells and this is not perfumey at all.</li>
            <li> very good. will come back again</li>
            <li> Best hand creme on the market.  Leaves hands very soft and non greasy.</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes hands super soft.</li>
    </ol>
