            <li>I did not think my skin would ever look this good and even toned.</li>

            <li>This product it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>No burning or irritation of any kind.</li>
            <li>I have tried every kind of bleaching cream you could by over the counter.</li>
            <li>it makes your skin feel sooo fresh, thats also really good to use along with the piona, keeps you fresh and not grimy :D</li>
            <li>and it is very strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this cream amazing product.</li>
            <li>Believe me when I say its strong !</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s how strong it is !</li>
            <li>I also heard of Fair and Flawless products who I&#x27;ve already ordered from to lighten dark lips.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works great and really fast</li>
            <li>Thank you! :)</li>
            <li>YET, I&#x27;ll order more now..</li>
            <li>it sure did</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products and I cannot believe I haven&#x27;t even heard about it before...</li>
            <li>It did all that it said and more.</li>
            <li>I have hyper-pigmented elbows and thought this would lighten them, Used this product faithfully for more than 3 weeks with no discernible difference.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>so im sure it will so what it says with continued use.  </li>
            <li>not too many breakouts just wanted to have a blended complexion..  </li>
            <li>but its okay i found another product that works for me</li>
            <li>stars all the way and may buy more of this product....</li>
            <li>But yet again, I am using kojic acid soap so I can not be sure if the darkspots are cuased by peona or the kojic soap.</li>
            <li>I have had hyper-pigmentation for many years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more to use on hands, arms, etc.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>i wasnt sure</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>but I can stand most fragrances.</li>
            <li>and I still haven&#x27;t seen any results and for those of you who are using it on your face remember this product is not non-comedogenic; there are many lipids and thickening agents that might cause block pores which leads to breakouts.</li>
            <li>It works &amp; it works FAST!!!!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it say it will do!!!</li>
            <li>Amazing cream best bleaching cream ever am a light complexion black girl work wonders to even out</li>
            <li>have tried other products before but I will recommend this one for best results.</li>
            <li>A few more usage, and my skin will be as flawless as it used to be..</li>
            <li>This has got to be the best lightening cream that I have used since Black Opal, ( which isn&#x27;t made any longer).</li>
            <li>What can i say, this is so good and super fast</li>
            <li>My opinion is, if you have a light scar or just wanna use this to lighten up your skin tone, give it a shot, it&#x27;ll probably work for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m light skinned</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic and for those that say that this doesn&#x27;t work ....</li>
            <li>cause it got such great reviews.</li>
            <li>i have blemishes from breakouts on my chin and with my skin being so light</li>
            <li>Great product that actually works.</li>
            <li>Noticed a difference right away but didn&#x27;t seem to lighten much more.</li>
            <li>my face is back to its original complexion and im so happy.</li>
            <li>First off let me start by saying the picture is deceiving!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly light-skinned and was concerned about lightening my scars too much, but everything evened out pretty well</li>
            <li>and I always was discolored but now with very little concealer my face is flawless and one toned.</li>
            <li>&amp; I becames three shades lighter than what I originally was,</li>
            <li>Its definitely worth the price !</li>
            <li>I was so so excited I had to post this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks now and by week 2 I seen a significant improvement.</li>
            <li>my skin got significantly lighter in just 2-3 weeks...</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many bleaching creams out there, but this by far is my favorite one.</li>
            <li>But that could be since my forehead is now dry and bumpy lol.</li>
            <li>Works right away!</li>
            <li>This is by far an amazing bleaching cream.</li>
            <li>will update on full results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back with that good review</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really helped lighten up my acne scars :)</li>
            <li>Love this product, the cream works so fast you start seeing the difference in evening</li>
            <li>super soft face looks amazing even without make up works in just 2weeks</li>
            <li>it works really quickly, i used it in the morning and at night and it lightened my skin pretty quick!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with the quick results in a matter of 3-4 days.</li>
            <li>it has faded it so quickly.</li>
            <li>It kept my acne at bay and my skin complexion improved tremendously.</li>
            <li>but if you rub it in really well and rub an itty bit of water after followed by lightly patting it down, your in good business!</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the money and the shipping was extremely quick.</li>
            <li>Warning to all of you interested in purchasing this product...do not buy!</li>
            <li>It does work fast &amp; you must be precise.</li>
            <li>Powerful stuff</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s totally worth every $</li>
            <li>Added bonus: I would often put on the cream right before heading out the door for work, and it didn&#x27;t discolor my clothes.</li>
            <li>U must not be using it right or as directed</li>
            <li>have be use this cream for like a good week and a half</li>
            <li>Delivery was super fast and I Cant wait to see the results.. will update in a week..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent so much money on prescribed creams that didn&#x27;t work as good as this cream.</li>
            <li>Piona works faster, is so gentle and is pretty much a worry free product.</li>
            <li>its pretty greasy feeling</li>
            <li>my skin smooth and clear skin was glowing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m brown skin it did not give me results in days like others or even wishing a week, but I was still consistent.</li>
            <li>Here is pictures of my process in order- from brown clear skin to light brown acne skin</li>
            <li>When I was about to my this product I first read the comment a lot of people dislike it and a lot of people like do</li>
            <li>I will say safely this product has not turned me alabaster or shades lighter, just evened me out to the lighter tones of my same shading.</li>
            <li>It really starts working the moment you put it on your skin !</li>
            <li>Within the first application I saw results.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to apply only to the spots you are trying to lighten because, IT WILL LIGHTEN YOUR SKIN.</li>
            <li>Works so fast!</li>
            <li>Hello everyone, first I would like to say that this cream WORKS.</li>
            <li>I did my neck first</li>
            <li>This product works and I encourage anyone who wants to lighten up for whatever reason to use this!</li>
            <li>it first start to peel the target skin area</li>
            <li>and complained!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it religiously for more than 2 months</li>
            <li>This is the first product that I can see visible results.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery!  </li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>You have to just give it time to see the difference about a week ;)</li>
            <li>things work differently from person to person; skin sensitivity depends on many factors.</li>
            <li>Be sure it&#x27;s only applied where you really need it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed positive results within 3 days.</li>
            <li>Truly, amazing, I had these dark marks on my face for years, I never thought they would ever leave, in about</li>
            <li>This product really works like Really !</li>
            <li>The deep set scars I assume will take longer, but thats fine with me as it has already done so much already!</li>
            <li>I read other reviews that said when you stop using it it makes your skin darker, well I had to find out for myself and it is very true!</li>
            <li>I was so thrilled, and the acne still has barely came back.</li>
            <li>I mixed Piona Strong Bleaching Cream with Ambi</li>
            <li>but my face has been super clear my whole life</li>
            <li>I am thrilled that this cream worked in so little time.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>This cream really works.</li>
            <li>This product really works .</li>
            <li>I absolutely can&#x27;t deny that this bleaching lightens you..</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m tell u this cream really works</li>
            <li>VERY WELL</li>
            <li>Thanks to this vendor as well.</li>
            <li>Now I am very even.</li>
            <li>It works and it works fast.</li>
            <li>It was very lumpy and would not mix even after trying.</li>
            <li>Very unsatisfied</li>
            <li>And, my face and neck are beginning to match the lighter skin on my chest which doesn&#x27;t get much sun.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really work for me.  </li>
            <li>it really works so mouch that i had to leave a review</li>
            <li>Hello to everyone, i just want to say Piona really really works.</li>
            <li>Wow!!!</li>
            <li>make sure u use it all over or your skin will appear lighter on one side and another shade on the other will buy again</li>
            <li>a dark skin african american)my brother even called me light skin, and then I continued using this product, and within a couple more days, almost all my acne was off my face</li>
            <li>The other jar from another company I bought as much better and stronger.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on day 4 using morning &amp; night &amp; am starting to see significant fading of the melasma &amp; age spots.</li>
            <li>I wanted this product to be one single color because I honestly had been feeling like a freak of nature with two to three different skin tones.</li>
            <li>You have to be consistent and use it twice a day, washing &amp; exfoliating in between, to slough off the old discolored skin cells.</li>
            <li>I got a better product for way less money at Walmart.</li>
            <li>No seriously... Just go to a doctor and ask for a solution.</li>
            <li>and this helped take that sunburn like unevenness from my forehead, nose and seemingly look a tad younger which is better than the opposite imo.</li>
            <li>make sure to ONLY put it on the actual spot though because it will lighten the area around it.</li>
            <li>Results probably last a few weeks before you start resorting back to your old self and on top of that it kind of breaks you out a wee bit.</li>
            <li>If you want high levels of fading/lightening maybe go to the dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>If I get any acne scars they clear up fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s broke my whole face out and gave me huge dark spots.</li>
            <li>Works fast as long as your consistent.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin plus eczema</li>
            <li>My arms and face are extremely darker than my original caramel skin color from spending hours in the sun doing sports.</li>
            <li>so your face wont be light while your body is dark ha .</li>
            <li>It only took exactly 2 weeks of using it day and night to see results</li>
            <li>first time I used it I seen results 2 days later.</li>
            <li>Imagine a light brown face and dark skin hands.</li>
            <li>My face was light brown, as well as my chest, legs and half of my arms.</li>
            <li>My skin turn dark red within a couple minutes &amp; to ok a couple days to heal from what seemed like a chemical burn.</li>
            <li>My dark marks actually showed more but my skin was getting lighter.</li>
            <li>Im a 30 yr old dark skinned african american female with fair skin texture,</li>
            <li>My boyfriend noticed it may have lightened up a TINY bit, but considering how often I used it (1-2 times a day), you would think it did a little bit more than that.</li>
            <li>All I wanted to do was clear up blemishes, it did just that in just a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>I have confidence that with continued use, I will have clear skin again.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>near matched my skin complexion.</li>
            <li>and I see results in my skin, and it cleared up acne that I did have and makes my skin sooo soft.  </li>
            <li>With continued use, I believe it has really helped to even out my tone without actually bleaching the areas that shouldn&#x27;t be lightened.</li>
            <li>Works fast but doesn&#x27;t give lasting results.</li>
            <li>Wow, I wish I would&#x27;ve known about this product years ago.</li>
            <li>My blemishes were completely gone in about 10 days.</li>
            <li>I am 22yrs old, medium/light brown skin.</li>
            <li>Here has been my experience with Piona thus far</li>
            <li>So I waited approximately 2 weeks before reviewing this produce because I wanted to see if it was, in fact, effective.</li>
            <li>I am a light skinned black lady, and i had a face full of very dark blemishes from an acne outbreak.</li>
            <li>I mean I haven&#x27;t been able to leave the house without makeup for all these years until now.</li>
            <li>The new container says \\&quot;new look same formula\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>was the skin on my chin become extremely dry so its important to moisturize it was so dry if i tried to stretch the skin you would see lines in my chin.</li>
            <li>I just received my product &amp; was shocked &amp; not in a good way!</li>
            <li>Helped with old scars but be careful, it does bleach your skin quickly and can make skin so much lighter than what&#x27;s expected</li>
            <li>THIS JAR IS VERY LITTLE and depending on how many times a day you use it it may not last two -three weeks</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s PERFECT for the bikin line, dark knees, dark elbows &amp; any other dark spots you want to make ligter.</li>
            <li>but it really does work what i did in order to help the dry skin peel faster was use a skin peeling gel and it sped the process up</li>
            <li>I apply the cream every night before bed and in the mornings, I wash my face and my face is instantly brighter and absolutely clear!</li>
            <li>So next its important to only apply this to the blemish because it will turn the area dark.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product did lightn up some problem areas on my knees and elbows, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that its a strong bleaching cream,since the jar is so small I only use it on those areas</li>
            <li>if it greases up your face and gives you bad pimples use Noxema classic clean face wash!!!</li>
            <li>Despite the bumps I do notice the four little dark marks have since faded more...</li>
            <li>Everything busted out and barely had any in it.</li>
            <li>It BARELY works.</li>
            <li>It is actually kind of scary</li>
            <li>My regimen when using this (and regularly) is to wash my face with Pure African Black soap, tone with a mixture of water and apple cider vinegar, let that dry and apply coconut oil and fresh aloe plant gel.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very small and is like an light orange color</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to test on a small spot before applying to your whole face.</li>
            <li>I used it on my entire face (not thinking it would really be effective, BOY WAS I WRONG)</li>
            <li>, I would use the whole tube but my dark marks remained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought other skin lightening products and they didnt do to much lightening, so i got this on the 20th of August</li>
            <li>My skin is hyperpigmented, so I have a pretty uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li>My dark spots have faded almost completely in just 4 days!!!</li>
            <li>my skin complexion is a olive brown, light brown, tan complexion, so when I scar the hyper pigmented skin turns very black like a car tire due to genetics.</li>

            <li> he chest and around clothing areas and did not feel good about the oiliness feel and the color.</li>
            <li> It gives you a nice blast a moisturization but isn&#x27;t greasy which is great for me since I have oily skin.</li>
            <li> I did not think my skin would ever look this good and even toned.</li>

            <li> Amazing cream for the price.</li>
            <li> This product it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> No burning or irritation of any kind.</li>
            <li> I have tried every kind of bleaching cream you could by over the counter.</li>
            <li> it makes your skin feel sooo fresh, thats also really good to use along with the piona, keeps you fresh and not grimy :D</li>
            <li> and it is very strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this cream amazing product.</li>
            <li> Believe me when I say its strong !</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how strong it is !</li>
            <li> I also heard of Fair and Flawless products who I&#x27;ve already ordered from to lighten dark lips.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works great and really fast</li>
            <li> Thank you! :)</li>
            <li> YET, I&#x27;ll order more now..</li>
            <li> it sure did</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products and I cannot believe I haven&#x27;t even heard about it before...</li>
            <li> It did all that it said and more.</li>
            <li> I have hyper-pigmented elbows and thought this would lighten them, Used this product faithfully for more than 3 weeks with no discernible difference.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> so im sure it will so what it says with continued use.  </li>
            <li> not too many breakouts just wanted to have a blended complexion..  </li>
            <li> but its okay i found another product that works for me</li>
            <li> stars all the way and may buy more of this product....</li>
            <li> But yet again, I am using kojic acid soap so I can not be sure if the darkspots are cuased by peona or the kojic soap.</li>
            <li> I have had hyper-pigmentation for many years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering more to use on hands, arms, etc.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> i wasnt sure</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> but I can stand most fragrances.</li>
            <li> and I still haven&#x27;t seen any results and for those of you who are using it on your face remember this product is not non-comedogenic; there are many lipids and thickening agents that might cause block pores which leads to breakouts.</li>
            <li> It works &amp; it works FAST!!!!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it say it will do!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing cream best bleaching cream ever am a light complexion black girl work wonders to even out</li>
            <li> have tried other products before but I will recommend this one for best results.</li>
            <li> A few more usage, and my skin will be as flawless as it used to be..</li>
            <li> This has got to be the best lightening cream that I have used since Black Opal, ( which isn&#x27;t made any longer).</li>
            <li> What can i say, this is so good and super fast</li>
            <li> My opinion is, if you have a light scar or just wanna use this to lighten up your skin tone, give it a shot, it&#x27;ll probably work for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m light skinned</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic and for those that say that this doesn&#x27;t work ....</li>
            <li> cause it got such great reviews.</li>
            <li> i have blemishes from breakouts on my chin and with my skin being so light</li>
            <li> Great product that actually works.</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference right away but didn&#x27;t seem to lighten much more.</li>
            <li> my face is back to its original complexion and im so happy.</li>
            <li> First off let me start by saying the picture is deceiving!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly light-skinned and was concerned about lightening my scars too much, but everything evened out pretty well</li>
            <li> and I always was discolored but now with very little concealer my face is flawless and one toned.</li>
            <li> &amp; I becames three shades lighter than what I originally was,</li>
            <li> Its definitely worth the price !</li>
            <li> I was so so excited I had to post this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks now and by week 2 I seen a significant improvement.</li>
            <li> my skin got significantly lighter in just 2-3 weeks...</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many bleaching creams out there, but this by far is my favorite one.</li>
            <li> But that could be since my forehead is now dry and bumpy lol.</li>
            <li> Works right away!</li>
            <li> This is by far an amazing bleaching cream.</li>
            <li> will update on full results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be back with that good review</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really helped lighten up my acne scars :)</li>
            <li> Love this product, the cream works so fast you start seeing the difference in evening</li>
            <li> super soft face looks amazing even without make up works in just 2weeks</li>
            <li> it works really quickly, i used it in the morning and at night and it lightened my skin pretty quick!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with the quick results in a matter of 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> it has faded it so quickly.</li>
            <li> It kept my acne at bay and my skin complexion improved tremendously.</li>
            <li> but if you rub it in really well and rub an itty bit of water after followed by lightly patting it down, your in good business!</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the money and the shipping was extremely quick.</li>
            <li> Warning to all of you interested in purchasing this product...do not buy!</li>
            <li> It does work fast &amp; you must be precise.</li>
            <li> Powerful stuff</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s totally worth every $</li>
            <li> Added bonus: I would often put on the cream right before heading out the door for work, and it didn&#x27;t discolor my clothes.</li>
            <li> U must not be using it right or as directed</li>
            <li> have be use this cream for like a good week and a half</li>
            <li> Delivery was super fast and I Cant wait to see the results.. will update in a week..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent so much money on prescribed creams that didn&#x27;t work as good as this cream.</li>
            <li> Piona works faster, is so gentle and is pretty much a worry free product.</li>
            <li> its pretty greasy feeling</li>
            <li> my skin smooth and clear skin was glowing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m brown skin it did not give me results in days like others or even wishing a week, but I was still consistent.</li>
            <li> Here is pictures of my process in order- from brown clear skin to light brown acne skin</li>
            <li> When I was about to my this product I first read the comment a lot of people dislike it and a lot of people like do</li>
            <li> I will say safely this product has not turned me alabaster or shades lighter, just evened me out to the lighter tones of my same shading.</li>
            <li> It really starts working the moment you put it on your skin !</li>
            <li> Within the first application I saw results.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to apply only to the spots you are trying to lighten because, IT WILL LIGHTEN YOUR SKIN.</li>
            <li> Works so fast!</li>
            <li> Hello everyone, first I would like to say that this cream WORKS.</li>
            <li> I did my neck first</li>
            <li> This product works and I encourage anyone who wants to lighten up for whatever reason to use this!</li>
            <li> it first start to peel the target skin area</li>
            <li> and complained!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it religiously for more than 2 months</li>
            <li> This is the first product that I can see visible results.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery!  </li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> You have to just give it time to see the difference about a week ;)</li>
            <li> things work differently from person to person; skin sensitivity depends on many factors.</li>
            <li> Be sure it&#x27;s only applied where you really need it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed positive results within 3 days.</li>
            <li> Truly, amazing, I had these dark marks on my face for years, I never thought they would ever leave, in about</li>
            <li> This product really works like Really !</li>
            <li> The deep set scars I assume will take longer, but thats fine with me as it has already done so much already!</li>
            <li> I read other reviews that said when you stop using it it makes your skin darker, well I had to find out for myself and it is very true!</li>
            <li> I was so thrilled, and the acne still has barely came back.</li>
            <li> I mixed Piona Strong Bleaching Cream with Ambi</li>
            <li> but my face has been super clear my whole life</li>
            <li> I am thrilled that this cream worked in so little time.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> This cream really works.</li>
            <li> This product really works .</li>
            <li> I absolutely can&#x27;t deny that this bleaching lightens you..</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m tell u this cream really works</li>
            <li> VERY WELL</li>
            <li> Thanks to this vendor as well.</li>
            <li> Now I am very even.</li>
            <li> It works and it works fast.</li>
            <li> It was very lumpy and would not mix even after trying.</li>
            <li> Very unsatisfied</li>
            <li> And, my face and neck are beginning to match the lighter skin on my chest which doesn&#x27;t get much sun.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work for me.  </li>
            <li> it really works so mouch that i had to leave a review</li>
            <li> Hello to everyone, i just want to say Piona really really works.</li>
            <li> Wow!!!</li>
            <li> make sure u use it all over or your skin will appear lighter on one side and another shade on the other will buy again</li>
            <li> a dark skin african american)my brother even called me light skin, and then I continued using this product, and within a couple more days, almost all my acne was off my face</li>
            <li> The other jar from another company I bought as much better and stronger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on day 4 using morning &amp; night &amp; am starting to see significant fading of the melasma &amp; age spots.</li>
            <li> I wanted this product to be one single color because I honestly had been feeling like a freak of nature with two to three different skin tones.</li>
            <li> You have to be consistent and use it twice a day, washing &amp; exfoliating in between, to slough off the old discolored skin cells.</li>
            <li> I got a better product for way less money at Walmart.</li>
            <li> No seriously... Just go to a doctor and ask for a solution.</li>
            <li> and this helped take that sunburn like unevenness from my forehead, nose and seemingly look a tad younger which is better than the opposite imo.</li>
            <li> make sure to ONLY put it on the actual spot though because it will lighten the area around it.</li>
            <li> Results probably last a few weeks before you start resorting back to your old self and on top of that it kind of breaks you out a wee bit.</li>
            <li> If you want high levels of fading/lightening maybe go to the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If I get any acne scars they clear up fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s broke my whole face out and gave me huge dark spots.</li>
            <li> Works fast as long as your consistent.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin plus eczema</li>
            <li> My arms and face are extremely darker than my original caramel skin color from spending hours in the sun doing sports.</li>
            <li> so your face wont be light while your body is dark ha .</li>
            <li> It only took exactly 2 weeks of using it day and night to see results</li>
            <li> first time I used it I seen results 2 days later.</li>
            <li> Imagine a light brown face and dark skin hands.</li>
            <li> My face was light brown, as well as my chest, legs and half of my arms.</li>
            <li> My skin turn dark red within a couple minutes &amp; to ok a couple days to heal from what seemed like a chemical burn.</li>
            <li> My dark marks actually showed more but my skin was getting lighter.</li>
            <li> Im a 30 yr old dark skinned african american female with fair skin texture,</li>
            <li> My boyfriend noticed it may have lightened up a TINY bit, but considering how often I used it (1-2 times a day), you would think it did a little bit more than that.</li>
            <li> All I wanted to do was clear up blemishes, it did just that in just a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I have confidence that with continued use, I will have clear skin again.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> near matched my skin complexion.</li>
            <li> and I see results in my skin, and it cleared up acne that I did have and makes my skin sooo soft.  </li>
            <li> With continued use, I believe it has really helped to even out my tone without actually bleaching the areas that shouldn&#x27;t be lightened.</li>
            <li> Works fast but doesn&#x27;t give lasting results.</li>
            <li> Wow, I wish I would&#x27;ve known about this product years ago.</li>
            <li> My blemishes were completely gone in about 10 days.</li>
            <li> I am 22yrs old, medium/light brown skin.</li>
            <li> Here has been my experience with Piona thus far</li>
            <li> So I waited approximately 2 weeks before reviewing this produce because I wanted to see if it was, in fact, effective.</li>
            <li> I am a light skinned black lady, and i had a face full of very dark blemishes from an acne outbreak.</li>
            <li> I mean I haven&#x27;t been able to leave the house without makeup for all these years until now.</li>
            <li> The new container says \\&quot;new look same formula\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> was the skin on my chin become extremely dry so its important to moisturize it was so dry if i tried to stretch the skin you would see lines in my chin.</li>
            <li> I just received my product &amp; was shocked &amp; not in a good way!</li>
            <li> Helped with old scars but be careful, it does bleach your skin quickly and can make skin so much lighter than what&#x27;s expected</li>
            <li> THIS JAR IS VERY LITTLE and depending on how many times a day you use it it may not last two -three weeks</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s PERFECT for the bikin line, dark knees, dark elbows &amp; any other dark spots you want to make ligter.</li>
            <li> but it really does work what i did in order to help the dry skin peel faster was use a skin peeling gel and it sped the process up</li>
            <li> I apply the cream every night before bed and in the mornings, I wash my face and my face is instantly brighter and absolutely clear!</li>
            <li> So next its important to only apply this to the blemish because it will turn the area dark.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product did lightn up some problem areas on my knees and elbows, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that its a strong bleaching cream,since the jar is so small I only use it on those areas</li>
            <li> if it greases up your face and gives you bad pimples use Noxema classic clean face wash!!!</li>
            <li> Despite the bumps I do notice the four little dark marks have since faded more...</li>
            <li> Everything busted out and barely had any in it.</li>
            <li> It BARELY works.</li>
            <li> It is actually kind of scary</li>
            <li> My regimen when using this (and regularly) is to wash my face with Pure African Black soap, tone with a mixture of water and apple cider vinegar, let that dry and apply coconut oil and fresh aloe plant gel.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very small and is like an light orange color</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to test on a small spot before applying to your whole face.</li>
            <li> I used it on my entire face (not thinking it would really be effective, BOY WAS I WRONG)</li>
            <li> , I would use the whole tube but my dark marks remained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought other skin lightening products and they didnt do to much lightening, so i got this on the 20th of August</li>
            <li> My skin is hyperpigmented, so I have a pretty uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> My dark spots have faded almost completely in just 4 days!!!</li>
            <li> my skin complexion is a olive brown, light brown, tan complexion, so when I scar the hyper pigmented skin turns very black like a car tire due to genetics.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started scarring there it&#x27;s been a sensitive topic for me, but within a week a noticed a slight difference in coloring and within two weeks there was a big difference.</li>
            <li> What an absolute waste of money!</li>
            <li> In the beginning it did make my skin soft and supple and did lighten the dark spots</li>
            <li> Also I only buy the 1oz size and it lasts  long time.</li>
            <li> I used it religiously for over a week and was careful to apply the cream only on the affected area and not on the surrounding skin.  </li>
            <li> But overall, I would recommend this product to anyone with harsh tans, extreme or mild discoloration and plain skin brightening.</li>
            <li> I had a dark cut/ abrasion across the bridge of my nose, a large very dark acne scaring across the side of my face.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for less than a week, and already I have noticed that the dark spots on my face have lightened up considerably!</li>
            <li> WOW it lightened SOO much that it&#x27;s noticeable and lighter than my entire face, unfortunately I ran out of cream</li>
            <li> I am African American &amp; started using it for my dark spots.</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman that has dark skin.</li>
            <li> I barely had any dark spots before using this.</li>
            <li> I wish I had found this treasure a long time ago.</li>
            <li> she kept the cream on too long</li>
            <li> Patience and consistency goes and long way.</li>
            <li> I have some scarring on my neck due to picking at ingrown hairs resulting from hirsutism (excess facial hair/hair growth in women).</li>
            <li> Try not leaving it on all night or u can get really dry</li>
            <li> , I was worried because I only had a few days left until I started school.</li>
            <li> I have pale white skin with melasma &amp; age spots mixed with freckles.</li>
            <li> I am going to try this cream in order to fade some dark spots on my neck and back area.</li>
            <li> This product definitely did make me lighter like 2 shades lighter but like all products when it was done I started to darken again and my dark marks did not get lighter just my skin.</li>
            <li> After 2weeks it became dramatic like it lightens overnight, I begsn do notice around my mouth was not lightening as fast as the the rest of my face, I put the cream just in that area 2 days later</li>
            <li> Had to cut down on the use to only 1 time a day because my skin was having a reaction to using it so often</li>
            <li> but I have noticed that when I get little pimples they become really dark as they heal before they clear out again and as they disappear, others are showing up.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way if you only use it for the face!</li>
            <li> my elbows are now extremely dry, scarlet,rough and pink.  </li>
            <li> I had black circle spots about the size of a dime on both sides of my upper cheeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about 1 and a half week</li>
            <li> the breakouts immediately  turn black every month like clock work so the only problem i have is lack of instruction</li>
            <li> but if you want it to work faster mix the cream with other bleaching creams like black and white bleaching cream with 2% hydroquinoe ,la bamakoise,and dermo gel</li>
            <li> but now I have more acne spots than I ever had in my life- not too bad for others</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hella small , and barely works.</li>
            <li> I had a few acne spots on the side of my face and it bleached my entire face.</li>
            <li> but mine came almost empty -_-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I looked for all differnt types of products and feedbacks but see a few but not enough to have me sold.  </li>
            <li> and I have not really seen any results.</li>
            <li> This cream does not really smell but does leave a cloudy film on my skin.</li>
            <li> so i didnt have the dark dry skin on my face for longer than it needed to be.</li>
            <li> I put it only on the spots of my face night and day along with a few dark spots on my leg and it did not do its job.</li>
            <li> I have wasted money on very expensive skin brightening creams that did not deliver any results after many months of use.</li>
            <li> BUT I do use it in other areas &amp;</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not on the shelf with the other $100 products that work.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s only a small amount of cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it on my lips as well to get there rosy pink !</li>
            <li> 4% hydroquinone for $125 dollars and other medications</li>
            <li> Now I have to start all over with some other product and hope that I can lighten the spots.</li>
            <li> It turns the area black because its almost like it makes the skin dry out in a sense and once its dead skin you will start to see it peel like deadskin.</li>
            <li> and it has also gotten rid of the dark shades under my eyes.</li>
            <li> The dark circles around my eyes got two shades lighter &amp; Damn</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll find a way to correct the dark spots..</li>
            <li> All dark spots/hyperpigmentation are gone, with the exception of my eyelids.</li>
            <li> Those dark eyelids are stubborn.</li>
            <li> It only loses one star because it makes me a bit quizzey from the smell</li>
            <li> I got a dark line from my bra strap.</li>
            <li> fade cream 2% hydroquinone and in about a week all my dark marks were gone.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to lighten up my dark circles around the eye area and nose.  </li>
            <li> and my feet were discolred, a dark brown.</li>
            <li> and I no longer have dark circles around my eyes or dark markings that made me look</li>
            <li> i used it for the dark area on my knees ..</li>
            <li> Using it for 11 days and my dark, discolored elbows are beginning to lighten.</li>
            <li> I have dark spots and freckles around my face that I tried hiding with makeups.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally not worth the money that you invest in this product at all.</li>
            <li> now i just have to get the dark spots removed</li>
            <li> Ruins your skin even.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to pack a ton of make up to hide my dark spots</li>
            <li> I now see dark acne spots as if it was living under my brown skin( sounds crazy right)</li>
            <li> : (1) the smell of the product is very mild (2)</li>
            <li> I have to say I was skeptical at first, about this wonder cream, but it completely prived me wrong.</li>
            <li> and my hyperpigmentation mark were getting less noticable .</li>
            <li> it black heads after using the cream</li>
            <li> The dark spots on my face have just about gone away!</li>
            <li> I am very dark skinned and this product works</li>
            <li> didnt do much for my skin, and it stinks....</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY this , waste of time &amp; money</li>
            <li> I started seeing results with this within a few days.  </li>
            <li> Waste</li>
            <li> BUT after you stop using it for a few days your face and the spots do get darker than it was before</li>
            <li> EVERYDAY</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> First, I would like to say that I was very, very, very skeptical about this fade cream.  </li>
            <li> I wasted $18.</li>
            <li> Also, since I have oily acne-prone skin, I wanted to buy something that would lighten the hyper pigmentation along with not breaking me out like the Ambi cream did a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it a few weeks now</li>
            <li> This cream was way to harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> your complexion within a few days of using it.</li>
            <li> I decided to try it after spending too much on Melarase by Kare, expensive, works slowly, if at all.  </li>
            <li> I havent seen any dramatic results its only been three days</li>
            <li> it actually very slightly cleared my skin of acne, but then gave me one rancid under the skin pimple on my nose because i hadnt used it in a while</li>
            <li> but if you stop using it for a couple of days those spots turn extremely dark and are extremely hard to get rid of.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a waste of money, because none of the fade creams that I used in the past worked.</li>
            <li> I have had these dark scarring on my cheeks and nose for over five years which forced me to resort to make-up,</li>
            <li> , she&#x27;s butter, raw coconut butter for over a year now to try to cure themy elbow from the damage of using this product and nothing&#x27;s works.</li>
            <li> but I was literally using very little amount on my face.</li>
            <li> Works really fast, does NOT smell bad at all.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I wasted my money on this scam!</li>
            <li> but then again my scars are pretty badd :(</li>
            <li> To see how dark they were was such a shock and a disappointment to me.</li>
            <li> Just tried a small bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small container</li>
            <li> This miracle has faded my scars and I can hardly see them.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to find products that would work for my complexion.</li>
            <li> ** sucks.</li>
            <li> I used the product for at least 3 Weeks...morning and night with no results...</li>
            <li> A lot of women lay in the sun on a daily basis to get caramel colored skin, are you crazy?</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this cream because I have a few acne scars on my face that I get tired of covering with concealer.</li>
            <li> maybe u dont know what I mean</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact the shallow scars I had are already almost gone.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> At that point I was shocked at how dark the spots were; almost looked black.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed and now my dark spot looks worse than it did before I started to apply this cheap crap.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> Also, the smell is not pleasant at all, but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> it is too expensive for this small container.  </li>
            <li> To my disappointment, the dark spots got darker instead of lightening it.  </li>
            <li> The package came to me sloppy and opened.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my face and neck are extremely darker than my chest and in the summertime it could be a bit annoying.</li>
            <li> My days of spending thousands on expensive creams are over...</li>
            <li> but unfortunately amazon doesn&#x27;t work that way.</li>
            <li> I stumbled onto it randomly.</li>
            <li> #FAIL</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry your product didn&#x27;t meet my expectation, the cream did not work.</li>
            <li> The only thing noticeable was the awful smell.</li>
            <li> but it still smells weird.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything &amp; was desperate</li>
            <li> do I was sad!  </li>
            <li> this product was not so expensive, I would buy by the gallon!</li>
            <li> Self hatred is played out and sad!</li>
            <li> The cream arrived at my home today and jar is very small!!!</li>
            <li> are bad</li>
            <li> Burned bad.</li>
            <li> I have done at home Chemical Peels that were painful and embarrassing.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so damn mad!</li>
            <li> and when it goes away it leave me with horrible scars  </li>
            <li> This cream burned me and my face looks horrible.</li>
            <li> This is terrible.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t suggest it to my worst enemy .</li>
            <li> I am worst than when I started</li>
            <li> Smells terrible.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> What can i say, this is so good and super fast I am on my second 1 oz tub for use on my elbows and knees. only wished I had purchased the 4 oz tub instead.</li>
            <li> Great product makes my face feel amazing also look amazing. And mind you I am very dark skinned and this product works</li>
            <li> ****8/15/16update  my elbows are now extremely dry, scarlet,rough and pink.  I have had to buy eucerine, she&#x27;s butter, raw coconut butter for over a year now to try to cure themy elbow from the damage of using this product and nothing&#x27;s works. Will now have to see a dermatologist. Will not buy again and do not recommend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product did lightn up some problem areas on my knees and elbows, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that its a strong bleaching cream,since the jar is so small I only use it on those areas and  I use coconut lotion for the rest of my body, and I have had the same results.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. All I wanted to do was clear up blemishes, it did just that in just a couple of weeks. I am pleasantly surprised and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> First off let me start by saying the picture is deceiving!! The cream arrived at my home today and jar is very small!!! Plus it looks like it has been used! I can&#x27;t believe I wasted my money on this scam!</li>
            <li> it works really quickly, i used it in the morning and at night and it lightened my skin pretty quick! its pretty greasy feeling but if you rub it in really well and rub an itty bit of water after followed by lightly patting it down, your in good business! it actually very slightly cleared my skin of acne, but then gave me one rancid under the skin pimple on my nose because i hadnt used it in a while but then i used it again... my skin was like &amp;#34;i dont remeber you&amp;#34; and decided to grow a pimple on my nose... if it greases up your face and gives you bad pimples use Noxema classic clean face wash!!! it makes your skin feel sooo fresh, thats also really good to use along with the piona, keeps you fresh and not grimy :D</li>
            <li> This s*** sucks. It&#x27;s hella small , and barely works. DO NOT BUY this , waste of time &amp; money</li>
            <li> This cream really works. Its not a miracle cream and it is too expensive for this small container.  But if you are  consisted you&#x27;ll see results</li>
            <li> didnt do much for my skin, and it stinks.... not recommend for ethnic skin tones .</li>
            <li> Have been using this cream together with a serum for about 5 weeks. OMG! I wish I had found this treasure a long time ago. I have had these dark scarring on my cheeks and nose for over five years which forced me to resort to make-up, I mean I haven&#x27;t been able to leave the house without makeup for all these years until now. This miracle has faded my scars and I can hardly see them. A few more usage, and my skin will be as flawless as it used to be..Am a happy customer. My days of spending thousands on expensive creams are over...i use this twice a day and it has also gotten rid of the dark shades under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Does not work. No seriously... Just go to a doctor and ask for a solution.</li>
            <li> This stuff works well.  I decided to try it after spending too much on Melarase by Kare, expensive, works slowly, if at all.  Don&#x27;t buy it. I started seeing results with this within a few days.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This cream is working for the discoloration on my finger knuckles.</li>
            <li> My arms and face are extremely darker than my original caramel skin color from spending hours in the sun doing sports. I only ordered the 1 ounce to see if it actually worked on my skin and it AMAZINGLY did! I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with the quick results in a matter of 3-4 days. I apply the cream every night before bed and in the mornings, I wash my face and my face is instantly brighter and absolutely clear! I will be ordering another jar ASAP. It is definitely worth the money and the shipping was extremely quick. I got it 3 days after placing my order which was surprising because I ordered it around Christmas time. But overall, I would recommend this product to anyone with harsh tans, extreme or mild discoloration and plain skin brightening. Amazing once again!</li>
            <li> Did not work for me.  I am so disappointed with this product.  I got a better product for way less money at Walmart.</li>
            <li> Great product but it takes awhile to see results!</li>
            <li> I am African American &amp; started using it for my dark spots. I&#x27;ve tried everything &amp; was desperate so I read the reviews on this product &amp; decided to give it a go. I used it on my entire face (not thinking it would really be effective, BOY WAS I WRONG) It works &amp; it works FAST!!!! My face started peeling within TWO WEEKS of using. I used it twice a day after washing my face (morning &amp; night). The dark circles around my eyes got two shades lighter &amp; Damn near matched my skin complexion. I stopped using this product on my face because it worked too well &amp; I becames three shades lighter than what I originally was, BUT I do use it in other areas &amp; it&#x27;s PERFECT for the bikin line, dark knees, dark elbows &amp; any other dark spots you want to make ligter. This product is definitely underrated. I&#x27;m just happy it&#x27;s not on the shelf with the other $100 products that work.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great and really fast had my skin smooth and clear skin was glowing make sure u use it all over or your skin will appear lighter on one side and another shade on the other will buy again</li>
            <li> This product really works . IM a teenager so I have acne and when it goes away it leave me with horrible scars  also I have hyperpigmentation  after using the cream for about 10  days I started to see result . I was amazed my acne scars  were fading and my hyperpigmentation mark were getting less noticable . I would say it&#x27;s best to get the Soap with it so your face wont be light while your body is dark ha . That&#x27;s just my opinion but I would suggest this to anyone trying to lighten/brighten their skin . I guarantee you it will work . IM so amazed by this Product I bought my Second JAR yesterday 🙌🙌🙌 I apply it in the morning and before I go to bed at night</li>
            <li> Arrived and just as pictured.  Thank you! :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely can&#x27;t deny that this bleaching lightens you.. Wishing 2weeks I&#x27;ve watched my face go 2-3 shades lighter.. I&#x27;m brown skin it did not give me results in days like others or even wishing a week, but I was still consistent. After 2weeks it became dramatic like it lightens overnight, I begsn do notice around my mouth was not lightening as fast as the the rest of my face, I put the cream just in that area 2 days later WOW it lightened SOO much that it&#x27;s noticeable and lighter than my entire face, unfortunately I ran out of cream do I can correct it.. YET, I&#x27;ll order more now.. My only cons are that of course I do not agree with the size 1oz lasted me a month like it says but I was literally using very little amount on my face. And last, I totally do not have acne it black heads after using the cream I now see dark acne spots as if it was living under my brown skin( sounds crazy right) so I did achieve my lightening results but now I have more acne spots than I ever had in my life- not too bad for others but my face has been super clear my whole life do I was sad!  But I took it since it did what I wanted it to do lightening wise!! I&#x27;ll find a way to correct the dark spots.. Here is pictures of my process in order- from brown clear skin to light brown acne skin</li>
            <li> Awesome! All dark spots/hyperpigmentation are gone, with the exception of my eyelids. Those dark eyelids are stubborn. No burning or irritation of any kind.</li>
            <li> This cream works good</li>
            <li> Very, very good bleaching cream.  I saw the effect in one week!!  I have wasted money on very expensive skin brightening creams that did not deliver any results after many months of use.</li>
            <li> Amazing cream best bleaching cream ever am a light complexion black girl work wonders to even out my complexion.make you skin super soft face looks amazing even without make up works in just 2weeks</li>
            <li> When I was about to my this product I first read the comment a lot of people dislike it and a lot of people like do I was unsure to buy it .i have be use this cream for like a good week and a half and I&#x27;m tell u this cream really works but if you want it to work faster mix the cream with other bleaching creams like black and white bleaching cream with 2% hydroquinoe ,la bamakoise,and dermo gel plus and you&#x27;ll will see change in a week or 2 depending on ur skin.</li>
            <li> When you order the cream it&#x27;s very small and is like an light orange color</li>
            <li> I would have gave this product a zero but unfortunately amazon doesn&#x27;t work that way. This cream burned me and my face looks horrible. The package came to me sloppy and opened. Also it didn&#x27;t come with instructions or anything just a box with bubble wrap and the cream. This is terrible. Wouldn&#x27;t suggest it to my worst enemy . Also I know people will say &amp;#34;maybe she kept the cream on too long thats how it burned her.&amp;#34; No I kept it on for3 mins morning and night. DoDon&#x27;t buy this, save your money.</li>
            <li> I have some scarring on my neck due to picking at ingrown hairs resulting from hirsutism (excess facial hair/hair growth in women). Ever since I started scarring there it&#x27;s been a sensitive topic for me, but within a week a noticed a slight difference in coloring and within two weeks there was a big difference. I&#x27;m fairly light-skinned and was concerned about lightening my scars too much, but everything evened out pretty well haven&#x27;t had an issue with scarring/discoloration coming back. Added bonus: I would often put on the cream right before heading out the door for work, and it didn&#x27;t discolor my clothes.</li>
            <li> Works great,slight smell overall 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other products before but I will recommend this one for best results.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it say it will do!!! Bleach your skin. I had a few acne spots on the side of my face and it bleached my entire face. Yes the acne spots are lighter but now my entire face is 2 shades lighter. It only took exactly 2 weeks of using it day and night to see results</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference right away but didn&#x27;t seem to lighten much more. If you want high levels of fading/lightening maybe go to the dermatologist. I&#x27;m Caucasian with fair to medium skin and get freckles in the summer.</li>
            <li> 1 star because this is how my product came if I could give it a 1 I would. Everything busted out and barely had any in it. Waste</li>
            <li> Very nice tone evener, and remover or reducer of sun-spots and skin damage, I&#x27;m olive toned skinned and sun-kissed per say and this helped take that sunburn like unevenness from my forehead, nose and seemingly look a tad younger which is better than the opposite imo. I will say safely this product has not turned me alabaster or shades lighter, just evened me out to the lighter tones of my same shading. But that&#x27;s me, and melanin is gonna do what it&#x27;s gonna do.</li>
            <li> Did it work?? Yes it sure did BUT after you stop using it for a few days your face and the spots do get darker than it was before, it&#x27;s like to maintain you would have to use this for the rest of your life EVERYDAY I am worst than when I started</li>
            <li> Actually works. It only loses one star because it makes me a bit quizzey from the smell</li>
            <li> I used this product religously for two weeks and saw no results. I switched to a different bleaching cream and I&#x27;m hoping I&#x27;ll see results from it.</li>
            <li> I have a scar on my back from a dog scratch and I used this stuff for about a month religiously. It BARELY works. My boyfriend noticed it may have lightened up a TINY bit, but considering how often I used it (1-2 times a day), you would think it did a little bit more than that. Also, the smell is not pleasant at all, but that&#x27;s just me. My opinion is, if you have a light scar or just wanna use this to lighten up your skin tone, give it a shot, it&#x27;ll probably work for you. Otherwise, if you need to get rid of a darker scar like me, I would look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!! Works really fast, does NOT smell bad at all. I have tried so many products and I cannot believe I haven&#x27;t even heard about it before... I stumbled onto it randomly. It is actually kind of scary how well it works. These fade creams that are hundreds of dollars do not even come close to the results of this product. It does work fast &amp; you must be precise. I use a Bobby pin &amp; place a tiny bit on the spot I want to fade. I have pickers acne &amp; have done (and still do) damage to my face. This product has helped me with this problem.  I also have darker skin above my lip, the would be mustache area... it has faded it so quickly. I have done at home Chemical Peels that were painful and embarrassing. Piona works faster, is so gentle and is pretty much a worry free product. Honestly one of the best cosmetic purchases I have ever made!</li>
            <li> awesome cream. I like it but mine came almost empty -_-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like there&#x27;s only a small amount of cream.</li>
            <li> It did all that it said and more. I love this stuff! It brightened my skin beautifully. This is some awesome stuff!</li>
            <li> The new container says \\&quot;new look same formula\\&quot;...but Not So....formula is way Way off! Can&#x27;t understand why they screwed up a good product! #FAIL</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews but when I do you best believe its because a products is that damn good ! This product had my acne scars peeling in 2 days now they are remarkable lighter ! I&#x27;m using it on my lips as well to get there rosy pink ! Believe me when I say its strong ! It really starts working the moment you put it on your skin ! Had to cut down on the use to only 1 time a day because my skin was having a reaction to using it so often that&#x27;s how strong it is ! Its definitely worth the price !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry your product didn&#x27;t meet my expectation, the cream did not work. I discontinued using it, the instruction stated if it didn&#x27;t work in seven days  you should stop using it.</li>
            <li> I have hyper-pigmented elbows and thought this would lighten them, Used this product faithfully for more than 3 weeks with no discernible difference. The only thing noticeable was the awful smell. As another reviewer stated, it looks like this was made in someones garage. Waste of time and money. If I could give it no stars, i would.</li>
            <li> I love it. I got a dark line from my bra strap. first time I used it I seen results 2 days later. works good on hands too</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, I will be buying more</li>
            <li> First, I would like to say that I was very, very, very skeptical about this fade cream.  I thought it would be a waste of money, because none of the fade creams that I used in the past worked. I went to several dermatologists  who prescribed &amp;#34; Lystra&amp;#34; 4% hydroquinone for $125 dollars and other medications, I would use the whole tube but my dark marks remained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a man of color my skin complexion is a olive brown, light brown, tan complexion, so when I scar the hyper pigmented skin turns very black like a car tire due to genetics. I had a dark cut/ abrasion across the bridge of my nose, a large very dark acne scaring across the side of my face.  I had black circle spots about the size of a dime on both sides of my upper cheeks. I mixed Piona Strong Bleaching Cream with Ambi fade cream 2% hydroquinone and in about a week all my dark marks were gone. Truly, amazing, I had these dark marks on my face for years, I never thought they would ever leave, in about (1) one week they were all gone. I am very Happy to write this positive review. Thank you, Piona, Thank you Amazon, OH, I won&#x27;t, forget, I also thank the Lord, to whom all good things flow.</li>
            <li> WORKS VERY WELL but you MUST BE CONSISTENT!&lt;br /&gt;....Esthetician...</li>
            <li> Wow!!! I have to say I was skeptical at first, about this wonder cream, but it completely prived me wrong. This is by far an amazing bleaching cream. Within the first application I saw results. My dark spots have faded almost completely in just 4 days!!! Only using it one time during bed time. Just be sure to apply only to the spots you are trying to lighten because, IT WILL LIGHTEN YOUR SKIN. I&#x27;m in love with this cream amazing product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to lighten up my dark circles around the eye area and nose.  I ve had this only for three days and I see results in my skin, and it cleared up acne that I did have and makes my skin sooo soft.  I havent seen any dramatic results its only been three days so im sure it will so what it says with continued use.  I was so so excited I had to post this.  I looked for all differnt types of products and feedbacks but see a few but not enough to have me sold.  So thats why I m taking out time to tell others. Im a 30 yr old dark skinned african american female with fair skin texture, not too many breakouts just wanted to have a blended complexion..  I also heard of Fair and Flawless products who I&#x27;ve already ordered from to lighten dark lips.  Thanks to this vendor as well. will update on full results.</li>
            <li> So Strong!!! Works right away! I am AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN and using this product on my acne scars. Powerful stuff</li>
            <li> it didnt even work i dont see how this product as alot of 5 star reviews ...but its okay i found another product that works for me</li>
            <li> Count on this being yellow. I wanted to use it ont he chest and around clothing areas and did not feel good about the oiliness feel and the color. It might stain I questioned. I woudl nto buy this again.</li>
            <li> Works so fast! Literally in about 2 days I could see a difference...make sure to ONLY put it on the actual spot though because it will lighten the area around it. My regimen when using this (and regularly) is to wash my face with Pure African Black soap, tone with a mixture of water and apple cider vinegar, let that dry and apply coconut oil and fresh aloe plant gel. After the gel dries, I apply the cream.</li>
            <li> Hello everyone, first I would like to say that this cream WORKS. So do not hesitate to buy. Before using this product I was so so so discolred. My face was light brown, as well as my chest, legs and half of my arms. My neck, stomach, hands and back oh and my feet were discolred, a dark brown. Sun damage + eczema is what caused that. Now I am very even. I did my neck first, now I&#x27;m doing my arms and everything else. It works and it works fast. Give it 3 days to a week and you WILL see results. No lie. I wanted this product to be one single color because I honestly had been feeling like a freak of nature with two to three different skin tones. Imagine a light brown face and dark skin hands. My hands are now evening out and I am so thankful. I have the soap, lotion and cream. Altogether they work great. Follow the instructions. Leave the soap on for three minutes(I step outside the shower to let it seep in) and then I wash off and apply the cream. In the morning I apply the lotion because it has a lighter scent. This product works and I encourage anyone who wants to lighten up for whatever reason to use this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks now and by week 2 I seen a significant improvement. The dark spots on my face have just about gone away!</li>
            <li> Smells terrible. It was very lumpy and would not mix even after trying. Did not see any improvement. Try to contact customer service about the texture of the cream and got no help at all. Very unsatisfied</li>
            <li> I am of Irish and English heritage and decided to try this cream to lighten my age spots and skin discoloration on my face caused by my medications. Nothing I&#x27;ve tried has helped (the ones you see advertised on TV - &amp;#34;see results in 4 weeks&amp;#34;...bologna! THIS Piona strong Bleaching cream is WORKING!!! Finally I have a product that is getting rid of the age spots and skin discolorations!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many bleaching creams out there, but this by far is my favorite one. My skin is hyperpigmented, so I have a pretty uneven skin tone. It gives you a nice blast a moisturization but isn&#x27;t greasy which is great for me since I have oily skin. In a couple of difference, I could notice a difference in the discolored areas of my face. With continued use, I believe it has really helped to even out my tone without actually bleaching the areas that shouldn&#x27;t be lightened. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman that has dark skin. My face was always darker than the rest of my body. I tried every fade cream just to even my skin tone or to get close. Well, this cream is the truth. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month and I no longer have dark circles around my eyes or dark markings that made me look I havent slept. i wouldnt say I&#x27;m one color yet but I&#x27;m getting there. I was a shade darker and I always was discolored but now with very little concealer my face is flawless and one toned. My mom and friends are wowed. People think I use foundation....lol...The key is to use a facial scrub then the cream. I hope in another month my face will be close to one color so I do not have to use any concealer</li>
            <li> The best ever seller was awesome this cream is the best in the world</li>
            <li> I gotta see if it work, just got it,,,iight peace out I&#x27;ll be back with that good review are bad review,,nah mean,,,are maybe u dont know what I mean😒</li>
            <li> did not work... i used it for the dark area on my knees .. and it didnt work at all</li>
            <li> This is the second time I purchase this cream it works  wonders and I will purchase it again</li>
            <li> Applied twice daily after showering. Did not observe any change in skin texture or color.</li>
            <li> Using it for 11 days and my dark, discolored elbows are beginning to lighten. And, my face and neck are beginning to match the lighter skin on my chest which doesn&#x27;t get much sun. It works! You have to be consistent and use it twice a day, washing &amp; exfoliating in between, to slough off the old discolored skin cells. And, use sunblock when in the sun for extended periods.</li>
            <li> love it! It works &amp; showed results within days</li>
            <li> Didnt work for me but then again my scars are pretty badd :(</li>
            <li> Very great cream..i love it!!</li>
            <li> Great works as described !!!!</li>
            <li> I had 2 goals this summer, it was to get my skin lighter, and to remove mowt of my acne off my face, so I wanted to start with getting lighter. I bought other skin lightening products and they didnt do to much lightening, so i got this on the 20th of August, I was worried because I only had a few days left until I started school. I tried this and n 2 DAYS my entire face was lighter,(I was a dark skin african american)my brother even called me light skin, and then I continued using this product, and within a couple more days, almost all my acne was off my face I was so thrilled, and the acne still has barely came back. This is the best lightening product for me. Try not leaving it on all night or u can get really dry skin(it happened to me but it was fixed)&lt;br /&gt;5 stars all the way and may buy more of this product.... im RUNNING OUT</li>
            <li> I knew this cream wouldn&#x27;t work when I found out that it doesn&#x27;t contain the main/active ingredient hydronique. I think someone made this in their kitchen or something. I wasted $18. Lesson learned!</li>
            <li> OMG... finally found something that actually works. I have dark spots and freckles around my face that I tried hiding with makeups. Since I started using Piona for two weeks now and I can go a day without makeup. I&#x27;m very satisfied!!</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this cream because I have a few acne scars on my face that I get tired of covering with concealer. I am african american so it&#x27;s hard to find products that would work for my complexion. Also, since I have oily acne-prone skin, I wanted to buy something that would lighten the hyper pigmentation along with not breaking me out like the Ambi cream did a few years ago. I wanted to wait a week or so before I did a review so that I could see if the cream did anything to my skin. On the jar it says give it up to 3 weeks &amp; if you don&#x27;t see results then to discontinue the use. I have been using it for 2 weeks now and I have not really seen any results. I put it only on the spots of my face night and day along with a few dark spots on my leg and it did not do its job. It&#x27;s totally not worth the money that you invest in this product at all. Here&#x27;s some info about it if you&#x27;re hesitant on buying this product: smell- smells like chemicals.. not that over powering but it still smells weird. ingredients- glyceryl stearate, cetearyl alcohol, isopropyl myristate, water, phenol, octyl dimethyl paba, parfum, evening primrose, ascorbic acid, sodium metabisulfite, disodium edta, albutin, methylparaben, allantoin propylparabenm sodium citrate, glycolic acid, p-chloro-m-creso</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it a few weeks now and I don&#x27;t see any change at all.. I apply as directed twice a day and I avoid the sun. My forehead is darker than the rest of my face....still</li>
            <li> What an absolute waste of money! I read other reviews that said when you stop using it it makes your skin darker, well I had to find out for myself and it is very true! In the beginning it did make my skin soft and supple and did lighten the dark spots but if you stop using it for a couple of days those spots turn extremely dark and are extremely hard to get rid of. At that point I was shocked at how dark the spots were; almost looked black. Now I have to start all over with some other product and hope that I can lighten the spots. To see how dark they were was such a shock and a disappointment to me. Warning to all of you interested in purchasing this product...do not buy! Buyer beware!!!</li>
            <li> Its been months I see zero changes</li>
            <li> Delivery was super fast and I Cant wait to see the results.. will update in a week..</li>
            <li> This cream was way to harsh for my skin. My skin turn dark red within a couple minutes &amp; to ok a couple days to heal from what seemed like a chemical burn. I highly recommend to test on a small spot before applying to your whole face. It also did not cone with any sort of instructions.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference. The other jar from another company I bought as much better and stronger. BEWARE THIS JAR IS VERY LITTLE and depending on how many times a day you use it it may not last two -three weeks</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving it. I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about 1 and a half week and it&#x27;s really helped lighten up my acne scars :)</li>
            <li> Amazing cream for the price. I&#x27;ve spent so much money on prescribed creams that didn&#x27;t work as good as this cream. I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 days now putting it on in the morning then agan at night on areas that I have scars and I already notice a difference. As a matter of fact the shallow scars I had are already almost gone. The deep set scars I assume will take longer, but thats fine with me as it has already done so much already!</li>
            <li> Works fast but doesn&#x27;t give lasting results. Results probably last a few weeks before you start resorting back to your old self and on top of that it kind of breaks you out a wee bit.</li>
            <li> It works...it first start to peel the target skin area then it fade the skin to a lighter shade. Also, i did not experience any stinging or pain...i bought it to fade acne scars.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this cream. I have marks that are finally diminishing . I am thrilled that this cream worked in so little time. If I get any acne scars they clear up fast.</li>
            <li> my skin got significantly lighter in just 2-3 weeks...my face is back to its original complexion and im so happy. now i just have to get the dark spots removed</li>
            <li> I  read the very best and the very worst reviews of this product before purchasing.One person has used it a week and complained!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it religiously for more than 2 months and it works!!!! In fact I had to stop using it on some areas because it worked too well. Be sure it&#x27;s only applied where you really need it. I am a dark-skinned woman who has for decades  been trying to lighten keloid scars from both cheeks. This product along with Olay Regenerist Microdermabrasion treat ( 2x a week) has worked miracles for me. I did not think my skin would ever look this good and even toned.My cheeks now match the rest of my face. Also I only buy the 1oz size and it lasts  long time. Patience and consistency goes and long way.</li>
            <li> Just tried a small bottle. Its been a month since I started using it. My skin has cleared up the irregularities in color but I have noticed that when I get little pimples they become really dark as they heal before they clear out again and as they disappear, others are showing up. It&#x27;s like a cycle. But yet again, I am using kojic acid soap so I can not be sure if the darkspots are cuased by peona or the kojic soap.</li>
            <li> I used the product for at least 3 Weeks...morning and night with no results...it thought I would have good results after the reviews..but no!!!</li>
            <li> whooooooaaasaaa!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this product was not so expensive, I would buy by the gallon! Seriously. It kept my acne at bay and my skin complexion improved tremendously. Not to mention my scars diminish in a month. A little goes a long way if you only use it for the face!</li>
            <li> I have had hyper-pigmentation for many years. This is the first product that I can see visible results.  This is my second purchase. I have confidence that with continued use, I will have clear skin again.</li>
            <li> I bought this item after reading the great reviews from Piona 2oz cream which is also being sold here in Amazon.  I used it religiously for over a week and was careful to apply the cream only on the affected area and not on the surrounding skin.  To my disappointment, the dark spots got darker instead of lightening it.  It doesn&#x27;t really work for me.  I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have pale white skin with melasma &amp; age spots mixed with freckles. I&#x27;m on day 4 using morning &amp; night &amp; am starting to see significant fading of the melasma &amp; age spots. I&#x27;m ordering more to use on hands, arms, etc. I doubt it will fade the deeper freckles, but who knows...This cream does not really smell but does leave a cloudy film on my skin. I&#x27;m using this before I start a series of 25% tca peels.</li>
            <li> VERY AWESOME I AM ABOUT 2 shades lighter I was caramel completed now I&#x27;m light skinned :)  I just ordered more! I&#x27;ve used 2oz already ... It&#x27;s fantastic and for those that say that this doesn&#x27;t work .... U must not be using it right or as directed</li>
            <li> I bought this because my face and neck are extremely darker than my chest and in the summertime it could be a bit annoying. Somewhere around the second week I&#x27;ve seen a big difference, not just in my skin color but also with any acne marks. By the time I finish the jar, my face, neck and chest were all one skin tone which is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Not good. Ruins your skin even. Maybe just didn&#x27;t work for me cause it got such great reviews. I don&#x27;t know</li>
            <li> Piona works wonders... I&#x27;ve noticed positive results within 3 days. I have been using it off and on when I was living in Florida... Moved to northern va and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere... So I started ordering it from amazon...</li>
            <li> I just received my product &amp; was shocked &amp; not in a good way! It&#x27;s a small container I thought I was getting a jar of the product for the price I payed! It looks like it would probably last a month or two . I have not tried the product as of yet but will keep you updated..</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!  Great product!</li>
            <li> I used some gelle with piona and it works excellent for me</li>
            <li> I barely had any dark spots before using this. It&#x27;s broke my whole face out and gave me huge dark spots. I was so scared I had to stop using it after 4 days.</li>
            <li> This product it&#x27;s amazing I use it in my privet parts for a month and works really good!!!!! Buy it&#x27;s it&#x27;s totally worth every $</li>
            <li> This burned my skin and did not lighten whatsoever. I am disappointed and now my dark spot looks worse than it did before I started to apply this cheap crap.</li>
            <li> I tried this and it is very strong. But it works i am African American medium skin tone i have blemishes from breakouts on my chin and with my skin being so light the breakouts immediately  turn black every month like clock work so the only problem i have is lack of instruction i was so unclear on if i was doing this properly. I know it seems self explanatory but the effect it had on my skin i wasnt sure if thats what was supposed to happen so i will fill you all in on what happened to me so you know not to worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it twice a day as instructed What i started to notice was the skin on my chin become extremely dry so its important to moisturize it was so dry if i tried to stretch the skin you would see lines in my chin. So next its important to only apply this to the blemish because it will turn the area dark. It turns the area black because its almost like it makes the skin dry out in a sense and once its dead skin you will start to see it peel like deadskin. It is a process but it really does work what i did in order to help the dry skin peel faster was use a skin peeling gel and it sped the process up so i didnt have the dark dry skin on my face for longer than it needed to be. Love this product it really works so mouch that i had to leave a review also this product is so good for surgical scars that are discolored.</li>
            <li> So I waited approximately 2 weeks before reviewing this produce because I wanted to see if it was, in fact, effective. This product really works! I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks and there is a noticible difference in my complexion. At this point, I can actually discontinue the use as I&#x27;ve attained my desired complexion. Great product that actually works. Definitely worth it! Works fast as long as your consistent. I applied morning and night.</li>
            <li> Idk if it works or not I didn&#x27;t use it was open</li>
            <li> @Lonya, why would you lighten your skin with bleaching cream. A lot of women lay in the sun on a daily basis to get caramel colored skin, are you crazy? Self hatred is played out and sad! Anyway.....I am going to try this cream in order to fade some dark spots on my neck and back area. Hope it works.....</li>
            <li> Works as good as any cream in the $10 and under category like ambi or nadinola cream, so I wasn&#x27;t impressed. I left it on all night and woke up with a ton of big bumps on my forehead I&#x27;m actually still trying to get rid of. My fault. Despite the bumps I do notice the four little dark marks have since faded more... But that could be since my forehead is now dry and bumpy lol. Definitely use as directed</li>
            <li> This product really works like Really ! You have to just give it time to see the difference about a week ;)</li>
            <li> Love this product, the cream works so fast you start seeing the difference in evening your complexion within a few days of using it. I will definitely be buying again. And I&#x27;m so impressed with the sellet. I received the cream within 3 days of placing the order. I would recommend this seller to anybody who want the cream to arrive in a short period of time after ordering.</li>
            <li> not only did this cream burn my face it left a darker mark on my cheek and forehead.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for less than a week, and already I have noticed that the dark spots on my face have lightened up considerably! This has got to be the best lightening cream that I have used since Black Opal, ( which isn&#x27;t made any longer). Wow, I wish I would&#x27;ve known about this product years ago. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> This was perfect. Helped with old scars but be careful, it does bleach your skin quickly and can make skin so much lighter than what&#x27;s expected</li>
            <li> This product definitely did make me lighter like 2 shades lighter but like all products when it was done I started to darken again and my dark marks did not get lighter just my skin. My dark marks actually showed more but my skin was getting lighter.</li>
            <li> Hello to everyone, i just want to say Piona really really works. I am a light skinned black lady, and i had a face full of very dark blemishes from an acne outbreak. I have tried every kind of bleaching cream you could by over the counter.My blemishes were completely gone in about 10 days. Now I don&#x27;t have to pack a ton of make up to hide my dark spots</li>
            <li> At first i was skeptical about using Piona,  i suffer from hyperpigmentation caused by a corticosteroids asthma inhaler, it made dark circles around my eyes and mouth , i tried Ambi, Nadinola, none worked, but Piona Bleach Cream is really working fast, i can see my skin tone getting lighter matching the rest of my complexion, now i don&#x27;t have to hide under a ton of foundation.</li>
            <li> Burned bad. I am 22yrs old, medium/light brown skin. Acne scars. Made me darker and then my skin peeled to around what it was before.</li>
            <li> Doesnt work. Used it for 2 months</li>
            <li> Just what I have searched for, Piona products are amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is the fastest working product that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> As we all know...things work differently from person to person; skin sensitivity depends on many factors. I have very sensitive skin plus eczema and I&#x27;m allergic to ALL PERFUME but I can stand most fragrances. I have been using Ambi and Nadinola for 1 year and my acne marks are STILL HERE! I&#x27;m so damn mad! Here has been my experience with Piona thus far: (1) the smell of the product is very mild (2) I didn&#x27;t get any burn or irritation (3) I have been using it on my body NOT ON MY FACE. Results: I started using March 5, twice a day and I still haven&#x27;t seen any results and for those of you who are using it on your face remember this product is not non-comedogenic; there are many lipids and thickening agents that might cause block pores which leads to breakouts. I&#x27;ll be updating if any changes occur.</li>
