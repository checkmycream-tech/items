            <li>This is a very nice leather and feels good.</li>
            <li>I thought this was a good bag.</li>
            <li>When you get it you&#x27;ll probably notice how it&#x27;s already soft-to-the-touch, like good quality worn leather.</li>
            <li>I know he&#x27;ll get some good use out of it.</li>
            <li>He loved it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>did like the zip pouch underneath and thought it would be a good place to pack his electric trimmer for his beard.</li>
            <li>This bag is well made and good looking.  </li>
            <li>Veery good box.</li>
            <li>But good.</li>
            <li>Durable and good equality</li>
            <li>Good replica for looks.</li>
            <li>It is a very nice case, good quality and nice leather.  </li>
            <li>Perfect bag anyone that says the leather doesnt look like good quality are people who complain too much because I have been using mine for 2 years</li>
            <li>Love the chocolate color and suede look!</li>
            <li>Love the bag though!</li>
            <li>This kit, however, he really liked.  </li>
            <li>The moment I opened this out of the package I could smell the leather and honestly thought it was until I read the product description after I received it.</li>
            <li>have a lot of products that I don&#x27;t want to have to throw away when I leave and these travel bottles come in handy.</li>
            <li>Something nice</li>
            <li>but now I wish I&#x27;d either gotten a serviceable cloth bag or waited until I could get a nice leather dopp.</li>
            <li>The bag gets 2 stars for being perfect usable, but it&#x27;s a real eye sore</li>
            <li>Plus, the zippered bottom is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a side pocket inside which is handy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made nice and feels just like leather.</li>
            <li>nice shower bag.</li>
            <li>Nice gift at Christmas..</li>
            <li>Beautiful color and design,  nice material, good size, very masculine</li>
            <li>Perfect for my 15 year old.</li>
            <li>Good quality item, though it doesn&#x27;t feel like genuine leather.</li>
            <li>We weren&#x27;t sure if he would like it when we ordered, because they don&#x27;t give you more info on what&#x27;s there, but when it arrived, he was very pleased.  </li>
            <li>will allow for it to be packed in a suitcase easily!</li>
            <li>This bag is a great first bag for anyone who is travelling a lot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He was very pleased with the way it looked and was excited to start using it.</li>
            <li>I really love the look.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure my husband is going to love it.  </li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m sure he wouldn&#x27;t have &amp;#34;indulged&amp;#34; for himself.</li>
            <li>Much better quality than I was expecting.</li>
            <li>We were pleased with the quality and generous size.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful to be able to open this bag and see everything inside.  </li>
            <li>I travel almost one week per month for my job, this Kit fills the need and more.</li>
            <li>thing that I like the most is how it opens from the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>Stylish, leather, large, wonderful zippered section below the main area, convenience loop to carry and hang it by.</li>
            <li>The most important thing for him is that this has three storage areas.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s spacious and can fit many items.</li>
            <li>I am usually satisfied with inexpensive finds and was excited to find an inexpensive leather dopp bag</li>
            <li>It held everything he needed and packed easily into his suitcase.  </li>
            <li>Great for short trips, can carry the essentials, beware not to try and pack too many bulky items in this one.</li>
            <li>Shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>And it came very quickly in the mail to  Dallas Texas.</li>
            <li>Good value and great function, would recommend large open space and easy to use for travel.  </li>
            <li>It is very roomy and the way it opens is very interesting-</li>
            <li>I enjoy leather products quite a bit</li>
            <li>so I know that it&#x27;ll fit all of his things with no fuss.</li>
            <li>Excellent layout - 3 zippered compartments, several interior pockets to aid organization, very spacious.</li>
            <li>It has plenty of space, extra pockets and the quality is very nice.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, it is rich in appearance.</li>
            <li>As well as the ability to pack this bag full or pack light</li>
            <li>/&gt;His were old and beat up and even though this wasn&#x27;t leather, he said it&#x27;s actually better and will serve him much better with all of the travel he will be doing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great replacement for my old, much travelled cloth kit.</li>
            <li>He even showed it to his dad who liked it more than the case he currently has.  </li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to give it any sort of special treatment.</li>
            <li>Soft, Roomy, nice looking, holds everything with room to spare</li>
            <li>Made very well, lots of room, just outstanding.</li>
            <li>Purchased as a gift for my fiance who is very picky, and he will love this for traveling.  </li>
            <li>As for size, it fits his full size deodorant, cologne, razor, and shaving cream with room to spare.</li>
            <li>unit was shipped quickly and received for me to take on a week&#x27;s vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The actual kit is not bad, the size and functionality is nice.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>the top kind of pops open and allows it to stay open on the counter to easily grab things out of it.</li>
            <li>While on vacation, he had purchased a very nice brown leather overnight bag and has been looking for a brown shaving kit as his is black.  </li>
            <li>The suede and leather is handsome and soft.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my dad for father&#x27;s day kind of last minute.</li>
            <li>However the material doesn&#x27;t look distressed like in the picture, it looks more used and old.  </li>
            <li>I like the bottom zipped pocket for storing rarely used items.</li>
            <li>it has more of a brushed leather look as opposed to smooth leather</li>
            <li>and my son liked it even better than the much more expensive one I had originally ordered.</li>
            <li>Unlike my other bag IT LOOK GOOD AND HAS PLENTY OF ROOM FOR ALL my travel toiletries and then some.</li>
            <li>Very soft and easy to store with plenty of room.  </li>
            <li>Also it was shipped super fast</li>
            <li>The bag was good before a half a bottle of Listerine was spilled on it.</li>
            <li>I recommend that people interested in this bag purchase these as well:</li>
            <li>sshuld be better for big travelers.</li>
            <li>he really loves this bag!</li>
            <li>This is an extremely well made Dopp Kit that should last for many, many years and it is priced right.</li>
            <li>Looks just as good, if not better than the image provided from seller.  </li>
            <li>Men don&#x27;t always by themselves a fresh and new dopp kit and</li>
            <li>Item was way too large for my purposes.....</li>
            <li>After having so much with two other major chains trying to order someting like this I came to good old amazon and right away thoight this</li>
            <li>Mine looks and feels like real leather.</li>
            <li>It appears that it will be very durable.</li>
            <li>More then I expected.  </li>
            <li>Really stout construction &amp; materials.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know if it&#x27;s real leather.</li>
            <li>Looks like real leather, and feels like it too.</li>
            <li>The triple pocket is what I really like.</li>
            <li>He actually lent it to me for a stay in hospital and it came in handy for storing all manner of girly toiletries (the bottom compartment was entirely tampons),</li>
            <li>There is a side pocket on the outside which also is very useful for putting often used items.  </li>
            <li>The leather doesn&#x27;t look worn in a cool way, it looks cheap or damaged, as if the bag is made from leather rejected by a better manufacturer or damaged by a tanning process gone wrong.</li>
            <li>really think of anything I didn&#x27;t like in particular...</li>
            <li>My husband really loves his new dopp kit.  </li>
            <li>Looked decent.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>but for men they are a little extra something nice that saves from using a plastic bag.  </li>
            <li>and it still looks like new</li>
            <li>I was especially surprised at the quality of the zippers - I think this is going to last really well.  </li>
            <li>I wanted something unique and something that would last me for future travelling.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this for any person who has never considered a &amp;#34;man bag.&amp;#34; I had previously used other products and the quality of the product is top notch.</li>
            <li>I got it for my husband for our 3rd anniversary (leather) and he really fancied it.</li>
            <li>This company lacks organization, communication, integrity, and the overall ability to get anything accomplished.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s soft structure</li>
            <li>soft</li>
            <li>I really feel it has enough room for any guy.</li>
            <li>Does the color or outside fabric really matter?  </li>
            <li>Very large center compartment, and spacious bottom section.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a high end product very similar to this</li>
            <li>I will say be aware of leaving it open for too long, because it will lose its shape over time.</li>
            <li>it looks really rustic and classy and has held up really well over the past year.</li>
            <li>It hold two full size hair cutting pouches with room yo spare on top and the lower pocket on the outside bottom holds at-least one.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mark these discrepancies against the overall rating of the bag because they can be easily fixed and hasn&#x27;t necessarily affected the purpose of the bag.</li>
            <li>It holds at least 13 full size hair tonic bottles, and another example would be.</li>
            <li>It is large enough to hold everything one might need on an extended trip down to the shoe polish and buffing rags.</li>
            <li>The outside of the case is now grossly discolored, apparently permanently, as washing doesn&#x27;t remove it.</li>
            <li>Although it is not real leather, it gives the appearance of distressed leather/suede and is very classy looking.  </li>

            <li> Soft, Roomy, nice looking, holds everything with room to spare</li>
            <li> Made very well, lots of room, just outstanding.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my fiance who is very picky, and he will love this for traveling.  </li>
            <li> As for size, it fits his full size deodorant, cologne, razor, and shaving cream with room to spare.</li>
            <li> unit was shipped quickly and received for me to take on a week&#x27;s vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The actual kit is not bad, the size and functionality is nice.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> the top kind of pops open and allows it to stay open on the counter to easily grab things out of it.</li>
            <li> While on vacation, he had purchased a very nice brown leather overnight bag and has been looking for a brown shaving kit as his is black.  </li>
            <li> The suede and leather is handsome and soft.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad for father&#x27;s day kind of last minute.</li>
            <li> However the material doesn&#x27;t look distressed like in the picture, it looks more used and old.  </li>
            <li> I like the bottom zipped pocket for storing rarely used items.</li>
            <li> it has more of a brushed leather look as opposed to smooth leather</li>
            <li> and my son liked it even better than the much more expensive one I had originally ordered.</li>
            <li> Unlike my other bag IT LOOK GOOD AND HAS PLENTY OF ROOM FOR ALL my travel toiletries and then some.</li>
            <li> Very soft and easy to store with plenty of room.  </li>
            <li> Also it was shipped super fast</li>
            <li> The bag was good before a half a bottle of Listerine was spilled on it.</li>
            <li> I recommend that people interested in this bag purchase these as well:</li>
            <li> sshuld be better for big travelers.</li>
            <li> he really loves this bag!</li>
            <li> This is an extremely well made Dopp Kit that should last for many, many years and it is priced right.</li>
            <li> Looks just as good, if not better than the image provided from seller.  </li>
            <li> Men don&#x27;t always by themselves a fresh and new dopp kit and</li>
            <li> Item was way too large for my purposes.....</li>
            <li> After having so much with two other major chains trying to order someting like this I came to good old amazon and right away thoight this</li>
            <li> Mine looks and feels like real leather.</li>
            <li> It appears that it will be very durable.</li>
            <li> More then I expected.  </li>
            <li> Really stout construction &amp; materials.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know if it&#x27;s real leather.</li>
            <li> Looks like real leather, and feels like it too.</li>
            <li> The triple pocket is what I really like.</li>
            <li> He actually lent it to me for a stay in hospital and it came in handy for storing all manner of girly toiletries (the bottom compartment was entirely tampons),</li>
            <li> There is a side pocket on the outside which also is very useful for putting often used items.  </li>
            <li> The leather doesn&#x27;t look worn in a cool way, it looks cheap or damaged, as if the bag is made from leather rejected by a better manufacturer or damaged by a tanning process gone wrong.</li>
            <li> really think of anything I didn&#x27;t like in particular...</li>
            <li> My husband really loves his new dopp kit.  </li>
            <li> Looked decent.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> but for men they are a little extra something nice that saves from using a plastic bag.  </li>
            <li> and it still looks like new</li>
            <li> I was especially surprised at the quality of the zippers - I think this is going to last really well.  </li>
            <li> I wanted something unique and something that would last me for future travelling.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this for any person who has never considered a &amp;#34;man bag.&amp;#34; I had previously used other products and the quality of the product is top notch.</li>
            <li> I got it for my husband for our 3rd anniversary (leather) and he really fancied it.</li>
            <li> This company lacks organization, communication, integrity, and the overall ability to get anything accomplished.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s soft structure</li>
            <li> soft</li>
            <li> I really feel it has enough room for any guy.</li>
            <li> Does the color or outside fabric really matter?  </li>
            <li> Very large center compartment, and spacious bottom section.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a high end product very similar to this</li>
            <li> I will say be aware of leaving it open for too long, because it will lose its shape over time.</li>
            <li> it looks really rustic and classy and has held up really well over the past year.</li>
            <li> It hold two full size hair cutting pouches with room yo spare on top and the lower pocket on the outside bottom holds at-least one.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mark these discrepancies against the overall rating of the bag because they can be easily fixed and hasn&#x27;t necessarily affected the purpose of the bag.</li>
            <li> It holds at least 13 full size hair tonic bottles, and another example would be.</li>
            <li> It is large enough to hold everything one might need on an extended trip down to the shoe polish and buffing rags.</li>
            <li> The outside of the case is now grossly discolored, apparently permanently, as washing doesn&#x27;t remove it.</li>
            <li> Although it is not real leather, it gives the appearance of distressed leather/suede and is very classy looking.  </li>
            <li> It was time for a new one, but he hangs onto things for so long because he is never satisfied with something new.  </li>
            <li> Suede is an odd choice, I think for a bath item, but so far, no problem.</li>
            <li> The top, bottom, and medallion are all the same color/texture, and for another thing, the one color/texture they used makes this bag look like it&#x27;s permanently dirty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it everyday for about 3 months, I&#x27;m currently deployed and needed something other than the normal ACU pattern DOPP bags that we can get.</li>
            <li> has the metal frame so that it opens wide and stays open when so that you can find what you are looking for.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves it and it&#x27;s nice that he can just wipe it down if it ever gets dirty.</li>
            <li> so I wanted something that would be around as long as us and it will!</li>
            <li> It makes the bag harder to close.</li>
            <li> and I only had a few days to find another in time for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> And there&#x27;s an entire compartment on the bottom which I&#x27;m not sure what to do with now</li>
            <li> They are so hard to find that I finally turned to my go to resource - Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I had my last one for at least 20 years</li>
            <li> My only complaint is, I wish it had a compartment on the inside that had a zipper.  </li>
            <li> Also instead of looking to my questions they just use previous know knowledge.  </li>
            <li> I wish it was just a little deeper.</li>
            <li> Has held up to heavy usage and wear for over 6 months now.</li>
            <li> it was well made but had room for sox and some tightly whites too!</li>
            <li> negative aspect about my bag is the wrist handle came detached from the bag, and one of the pockets on the inside became a little unraveled at the seam.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the small pocket yet.</li>
            <li> Basically it small but has lots of room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend and he has been using it for at least a year.  </li>
            <li> and the company failed to deliver, in fact THEY cancelled the order due to glitches in their ordering system.  </li>
            <li> They are unable to follow through with statments on previous emails.  </li>
            <li> The one poor feature is the zipper that extends beyond the case.</li>
            <li> My other bag look so bad my wife threw it out</li>
            <li> , it was ugly and to small, I&#x27;ve had for years.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t find anything wrong with the Item&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The artificial material they used on the one I received does not look anything like the picture in the ad.</li>
            <li> I hate to say it but learn from my mistake and keep looking.</li>
            <li> It also has a terrible texture.</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet. Unlike my other bag IT LOOK GOOD AND HAS PLENTY OF ROOM FOR ALL my travel toiletries and then some. My other bag look so bad my wife threw it out, it was ugly and to small, I&#x27;ve had for years.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Stylish, leather, large, wonderful zippered section below the main area, convenience loop to carry and hang it by.</li>
            <li> My husband really loves his new dopp kit.  He likes the compartments inside the kit and the 3 zippers for places to put stuff on the outside.  We weren&#x27;t sure if he would like it when we ordered, because they don&#x27;t give you more info on what&#x27;s there, but when it arrived, he was very pleased.  We would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a good bag. Roomy, zipped well. Looked decent. I ended up returning it for a more expensive leather bag, but for the price I think it was well put together.</li>
            <li> Husband loved it! He was very pleased with the way it looked and was excited to start using it. Also it was shipped super fast, I was expecting to receive it after Christmas but it got delivered two days before.</li>
            <li> My husband has had the same Dopp kit for the 35 years I&#x27;ve known him.  It was time for a new one, but he hangs onto things for so long because he is never satisfied with something new.  This kit, however, he really liked.  It held everything he needed and packed easily into his suitcase.  The suede and leather is handsome and soft.  The best part is that my husband is finally satisfied with something I bought to replace something ancient!</li>
            <li> Soft, Roomy, nice looking, holds everything with room to spare</li>
            <li> Perfect for my 15 year old. I introduced him to the Dopp kit since on our last vacation, he used a plastic grocery bag for all his toiletries. It has plenty of space, extra pockets and the quality is very nice.  It is actually leather.  Best yet, it didn&#x27;t break the bank!</li>
            <li> I have purchased 2.  I really love the look.  I wish it was just a little deeper.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad for father&#x27;s day kind of last minute. It got here with plenty of time, and he absolutely loved it!</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it!  It is very roomy and the way it opens is very interesting- the top kind of pops open and allows it to stay open on the counter to easily grab things out of it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy leather products quite a bit and this is some sort of \\&quot;stain resistant, leatherette finish\\&quot; bag. The moment I opened this out of the package I could smell the leather and honestly thought it was until I read the product description after I received it. When you get it you&#x27;ll probably notice how it&#x27;s already soft-to-the-touch, like good quality worn leather. This bag is a great first bag for anyone who is travelling a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it everyday for about 3 months, I&#x27;m currently deployed and needed something other than the normal ACU pattern DOPP bags that we can get. I wanted something unique and something that would last me for future travelling. I recommend that people interested in this bag purchase these as well: [[ASIN:B002VS8H3G humangear GoToob Travel Bottle Blue]]&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of products that I don&#x27;t want to have to throw away when I leave and these travel bottles come in handy. They are 3 oz and can be taken through TSA without a problem.&lt;br /&gt;One negative aspect about my bag is the wrist handle came detached from the bag, and one of the pockets on the inside became a little unraveled at the seam. I didn&#x27;t mark these discrepancies against the overall rating of the bag because they can be easily fixed and hasn&#x27;t necessarily affected the purpose of the bag. 5/5 Recommended.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for! After having so much with two other major chains trying to order someting like this I came to good old amazon and right away thoight this would be perfect! The traditional 3 year anniversary gift is leather so I wanted something that would be around as long as us and it will! Its a beautiful leather! Verry very pleased!</li>
            <li> We picked this dopp kit up for my husband for Christmas.  While on vacation, he had purchased a very nice brown leather overnight bag and has been looking for a brown shaving kit as his is black.  They are so hard to find that I finally turned to my go to resource - Amazon.  This is a terrific looking bag and I&#x27;m sure my husband is going to love it.  Although it is not real leather, it gives the appearance of distressed leather/suede and is very classy looking.  And for the price, you cannot beat it.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our son-in-law at his 30th birthday. Hope it will last several years! Beautiful! Something nice - I&#x27;m sure he wouldn&#x27;t have &amp;#34;indulged&amp;#34; for himself.</li>
            <li> I am usually satisfied with inexpensive finds and was excited to find an inexpensive leather dopp bag but now I wish I&#x27;d either gotten a serviceable cloth bag or waited until I could get a nice leather dopp. The bag gets 2 stars for being perfect usable, but it&#x27;s a real eye sore and I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it. The leather doesn&#x27;t look worn in a cool way, it looks cheap or damaged, as if the bag is made from leather rejected by a better manufacturer or damaged by a tanning process gone wrong. It also has a terrible texture. If you want a dopp with the class of leather I hate to say it but learn from my mistake and keep looking.</li>
            <li> Great for short trips, can carry the essentials, beware not to try and pack too many bulky items in this one.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely well made Dopp Kit that should last for many, many years and it is priced right. It is large enough to hold everything one might need on an extended trip down to the shoe polish and buffing rags. Additionally, it is rich in appearance.</li>
            <li> Much better quality than I was expecting. Mine looks and feels like real leather. My only gripe is the metal frame. It makes the bag harder to close.</li>
            <li> Item was way too large for my purposes.....it was well made but had room for sox and some tightly whites too!</li>
            <li> Good quality item, though it doesn&#x27;t feel like genuine leather. I got it for my husband for our 3rd anniversary (leather) and he really fancied it. He travels a lot for his work, so I know he&#x27;ll get some good use out of it. He actually lent it to me for a stay in hospital and it came in handy for storing all manner of girly toiletries (the bottom compartment was entirely tampons), so I know that it&#x27;ll fit all of his things with no fuss.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not leather (though it looks it) so you don&#x27;t have to give it any sort of special treatment. And the sides stand up for maximum visibility of the contents. Plus, the zippered bottom is a nice touch. Great design. My husband loves it and it&#x27;s nice that he can just wipe it down if it ever gets dirty.</li>
            <li> Men don&#x27;t always by themselves a fresh and new dopp kit and so for a B-day present, I got my beau one of these. He loved it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His were old and beat up and even though this wasn&#x27;t leather, he said it&#x27;s actually better and will serve him much better with all of the travel he will be doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He did like the zip pouch underneath and thought it would be a good place to pack his electric trimmer for his beard.</li>
            <li> I write this not about the product but the company that sells it.  This is just my experience but buyer beware.  This company lacks organization, communication, integrity, and the overall ability to get anything accomplished.  The order processing desk doesn&#x27;t talk to the warehouse.  The help desk doesn&#x27;t talk to anyone.  Also instead of looking to my questions they just use previous know knowledge.  My product has been on and off back order for almost 3 weeks.  They are unable to follow through with statments on previous emails.  One person told me they didn&#x27;t know they were out stock.  I could continue on until I am blue in the face, but I will not spend my money in the future with this company</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend and he has been using it for at least a year.  He loves it!</li>
            <li> The actual kit is not bad, the size and functionality is nice.  However the material doesn&#x27;t look distressed like in the picture, it looks more used and old.  I had to send it back.</li>
            <li> This bag is well made and good looking.  We were pleased with the quality and generous size. It appears that it will be very durable.</li>
            <li> Very nice bag. It is wonderful to be able to open this bag and see everything inside.  There&#x27;s a side pocket inside which is handy.  There is a side pocket on the outside which also is very useful for putting often used items.  And there&#x27;s an entire compartment on the bottom which I&#x27;m not sure what to do with now but I&#x27;ll find something to put there. Very nice leathery feel.</li>
            <li> This is a gift for my boyfriends birthday. It is a very nice case, good quality and nice leather.  Shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> Love the chocolate color and suede look! As well as the ability to pack this bag full or pack light and it&#x27;s soft structure will allow for it to be packed in a suitcase easily!</li>
            <li> I like the bottom zipped pocket for storing rarely used items. The one poor feature is the zipper that extends beyond the case. It requires three hands to zip it up. The bag was good before a half a bottle of Listerine was spilled on it.It soaked in for about 12 hours before I realized what had happened. The outside of the case is now grossly discolored, apparently permanently, as washing doesn&#x27;t remove it.</li>
            <li> More then I expected.  Made very well, lots of room, just outstanding. A ++ rating.  I would purchase from mfg again</li>
            <li> I was especially surprised at the quality of the zippers - I think this is going to last really well.  I had my last one for at least 20 years so I&#x27;m hoping I&#x27;ve got one that will last.  Suede is an odd choice, I think for a bath item, but so far, no problem.</li>
            <li> Veery good box. sshuld be better for big travelers. To big in dimention for me. But good. This buil material is may be forever</li>
            <li> Excellent layout - 3 zippered compartments, several interior pockets to aid organization, very spacious. Really stout construction &amp; materials.  Great replacement for my old, much travelled cloth kit.</li>
            <li> I purchased a high end product very similar to this and the company failed to deliver, in fact THEY cancelled the order due to glitches in their ordering system.  This was a Christmas present for my son and I only had a few days to find another in time for Christmas.  Amazon.com came thru for me and it was delivered in time for Christmas and my son liked it even better than the much more expensive one I had originally ordered.</li>
            <li> I travel almost one week per month for my job, this Kit fills the need and more. soft so it fits well in the bag, and has lot&#x27;s of room.</li>
            <li> My strapped ripped on me about a month in but still a very great dopp kitt for the manliest of men.</li>
            <li> unit was shipped quickly and received for me to take on a week&#x27;s vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of room for everything I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really good price and bag is an excellent deal!</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my fiance who is very picky, and he will love this for traveling.  Durable and good equality</li>
            <li> Great for travel and putting everything you need in it. Is leather and it has three places to put stuff</li>
            <li> got this as a last-minute stocking stuffer for my husband last christmas.  he didn&#x27;t have a travel bag for things like toothbrush, etc.  for women they&#x27;re a must-have but for men they are a little extra something nice that saves from using a plastic bag.  he really loves this bag! it looks really rustic and classy and has held up really well over the past year. he doesn&#x27;t even just use it for travel, he keeps all his stuff in there for day-to-day. definitely a great find!</li>
            <li> Strap broke. Not as well constructed as more expensive Dopp Kits. Good replica for looks.</li>
            <li> Very soft and easy to store with plenty of room.  The second compartment allows you to separate the items somewhat.  I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> The artificial material they used on the one I received does not look anything like the picture in the ad. For one thing, it&#x27;s not two-tone. The top, bottom, and medallion are all the same color/texture, and for another thing, the one color/texture they used makes this bag look like it&#x27;s permanently dirty. I&#x27;m sending it back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in a wheelchair and use these bags to carry around my personal things. It&#x27;s made nice and feels just like leather. I don&#x27;t really know if it&#x27;s real leather. My only complaint is, I wish it had a compartment on the inside that had a zipper.  There are three compartments on the inside but they don&#x27;t close.  Love the bag though!</li>
            <li> Great for the price. Looks like real leather, and feels like it too. Has held up to heavy usage and wear for over 6 months now. Still looks great, and my husband loves it! As for size, it fits his full size deodorant, cologne, razor, and shaving cream with room to spare.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Hubby loves it</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day.  The most important thing for him is that this has three storage areas.  I like this because it looks like brown leather.</li>
            <li> Very large center compartment, and spacious bottom section.  Looks just as good, if not better than the image provided from seller.  For the price, it exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a week but it really is great for my use. The triple pocket is what I really like. I have to carry medicine and the bottom pocket is perfect for that. It is so roomy I haven&#x27;t used the small pocket yet. If I hadn&#x27;t already bought it I would now.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color and design,  nice material, good size, very masculine, my husband love it...!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect bag anyone that says the leather doesnt look like good quality are people who complain too much because I have been using mine for 2 years and it still looks like new it has more of a brushed leather look as opposed to smooth leather</li>
            <li> Great case, my fiance loved it!  He even showed it to his dad who liked it more than the case he currently has.  Best part is how it opens...has the metal frame so that it opens wide and stays open when so that you can find what you are looking for.  Also nice to have separate zipper area at bottom!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s spacious and can fit many items. I like the fact that it has two additional pockets.&lt;br /&gt;The thing that I like the most is how it opens from the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t really think of anything I didn&#x27;t like in particular... I would definitely recommend for a friend...</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this for any person who has never considered a &amp;#34;man bag.&amp;#34; I had previously used other products and the quality of the product is top notch. I really feel it has enough room for any guy. I will say be aware of leaving it open for too long, because it will lose its shape over time.</li>
            <li> Great quality and a BUNCH of things can be stuffed in its pockets.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice leather and feels good. If your in a hurry there&#x27;s lots of places to grab on it and run. It holds at least 13 full size hair tonic bottles, and another example would be. It hold two full size hair cutting pouches with room yo spare on top and the lower pocket on the outside bottom holds at-least one. Basically it small but has lots of room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t find anything wrong with the Item&lt;br /&gt;I love it and so does my wife and she hates every thing that I buy.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice shower bag. And it came very quickly in the mail to  Dallas Texas.</li>
            <li> Good value and great function, would recommend large open space and easy to use for travel.  Nice gift at Christmas..</li>
            <li> Plenty of space to carry toiletries and meds,.  The color is OK, but the faux suede looks fake and feels it tacky.  .</li>
            <li> I travel a lot, and my vinyl kit finally gave up the ghost.  Despite the reservations of some reviewers, I purchased this one. It is excellent.  Plenty of room, several pockets, lined, well constructed.  Does the color or outside fabric really matter?  I don&#x27;t think so.  This one is a winner.</li>
