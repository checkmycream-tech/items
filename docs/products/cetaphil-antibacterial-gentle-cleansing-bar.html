            <li>I use it with the \\&quot;Clarisonic\\&quot; cleansing brush and the combination is amazing!</li>
            <li>My search for an effective, yet non-drying, face/neck cleanser is over!</li>
            <li>It cleans and has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>Foams well and washes off good.</li>
            <li>I also figured, hey, if it&#x27;s not removing my eye makeup, how good of a job is it doing in removing my foundation makeup?    </li>
            <li>This was a good deal for two 16 oz bottles.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good product,</li>
            <li>I attended a Health Fair 8 years ago.  </li>
            <li>good price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good price for a quality cleanser.</li>
            <li>the money, this is a good purchase.</li>
            <li>It feels good after use.  </li>
            <li>: WHY did Cetaphil ruin a perfectly good, frag-free cleanser by adding fragrance to it?</li>
            <li>I read some good reviews about Cetaphil, and gave it a shot.  </li>
            <li>It as Good product and a Good quality according WITH the price given in the web.</li>
            <li>Did i think it was a fair price?  </li>
            <li>good.</li>
            <li>Good soap.</li>
            <li>Excellent light soap that I use every morning for my face.  </li>
            <li>It is just the best feeling of clean.</li>
            <li>It dosent work that great at removing makeup though, for make up its better to use a makeup remover separately and then use this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I wish it cleaned off eye makeup better, but great otherwise.</li>
            <li>Recommended by my Dermatologis years ago and still love love this product!!  </li>
            <li>This has been very effective in keep my screen healthy.</li>
            <li>that is for sure!</li>
            <li>I have been using this cleanser for over a year, and it is perfect for my skin, which can get pretty oily in the T area.</li>
            <li>All these problems are compounded by my dermatologist&#x27;s retinoid prescriptions for controlling my acne, I end up with flaky and irritated skin on top of my oil and dryness issues; what a pain!    </li>
            <li>I love this cleanser!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Most of them aren&#x27;t even paid to push it!</li>
            <li>Cetaphil is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>and it works amazingly.  </li>
            <li>This face wash is amazing.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel smooth and look great.</li>
            <li>Now my teenager has to have his own bottle in his bathroom</li>
            <li>I switched to this kind.  </li>
            <li>Perfect gentle face cleanser recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>My own aesthetician recommended it to me in the evenings when I was experiencing redness and acne.  </li>
            <li>It gets a good grade because it does what I what I want it to do with regard to softcly cleaning my face, but I am still in search of the better product that I have had experience with.</li>
            <li>Very gentle and the smell is amazing!!  </li>
            <li>It smells great, removes make up, leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed with no dryness.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty good too!</li>
            <li>The version labeled &#x27;gentle cleanser&#x27; never feels like it does a very good job.</li>
            <li>this item was exactly as pictured and described it was of very good quality, better price.  </li>
            <li>Its non drying and makes my skin  feel really clean  and has a pleasant scent</li>
            <li>Strong frangrance smell!</li>
            <li>Very good product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It is gentle yet effective on oily prone skin types and it smells great.</li>
            <li>The most important thing is that the item isn&#x27;t so good as they said.</li>
            <li>face wash and won&#x27;t be anything special&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s exactly what makes it so great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product; my skin feels wonderfully clean and smooth when I use it.</li>
            <li>Very light feeling not oily.</li>
            <li>I love the texture of this product very smooth.</li>
            <li>and I feel so much better.  </li>
            <li>Just buy it and enjoy!   </li>
            <li>It does not lather, rather you massage it onto your skin for it to work its magic.</li>
            <li>I have had more breakouts since using this product and I will not purchase it again</li>
            <li>and this product cleans better than the peel.</li>
            <li>I love the Cetaphil lotions and cremes but this isn&#x27;t doing it for me.</li>
            <li>love this face wash.</li>
            <li>I have looked for the better part of three decades for a cleanser that wards off break-outs, and doesn&#x27;t cause my face to peel.</li>
            <li>I only wish I had discovered this excellent product 40 years ago.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s perfect for daily use.</li>
            <li>People have mentioned an overwhelming scent.....</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Cetaphil.</li>
            <li>I preciously guard travel-size bottles I got from my dermatologist years ago</li>
            <li>She is quite satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>i love the price</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>The best facial cleanser on the market for all types of skin.</li>
            <li>This is the best facial product on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Now I can use more potent products with out having my skin flake off and burn.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for over 10 years, it is the best over the counter facial wash!  </li>
            <li>It feels good on the face, and after rinsing off my skin feels fresh.</li>
            <li>I like it better than Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser, which is also good.</li>
            <li>but I love the improvements Cetaphil has done on my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 1-2 years now, and have never had better skin.  </li>
            <li>This is the best facial cleanser for combination skin I have used.  </li>
            <li>The package Will be better.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for the next best thing.</li>
            <li>and I love it even more with my Clarisonic Cleanser.</li>
            <li>This washing system along w the cetaphil moisturizer and my face has been so smooth, calm and happy.</li>
            <li>One pump dispenses the perfect amount and the bottle lasts months with daily use.</li>
            <li>This Daily Cleanser is the BEST!  </li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>i tried switching to &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; products and they just irritate my skin even more.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find anything better than this cetaphil cleanser.</li>
            <li>The shipment fee was almost more than the product.</li>
            <li>but I do feel like i get most off with the Cetaphil.  </li>
            <li>I have used this cleanser for 5+ years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give this product to one of my kids, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s gonna work for them</li>
            <li>perfect daily face cleanser - my staple</li>
            <li>Btw, Cerave PM is magic, so is Cerave AM [...]</li>
            <li>I threw away some good money figuring out the right combo for my face</li>
            <li>The scent is very nice as well, very crisp and clean smelling.</li>
            <li>I have been using this wash for years and it has helped great with my acne prone skin and providing that fresh clean feelin.</li>
            <li>It is not expensive and a dermatologist must if you see one they will all tell you how good it is.</li>
            <li>This one is a nice balance between mild and oil removing.</li>
            <li>One of the best facial cleanser available.</li>
            <li>It is ranked in some surveys as one of the best facial cleansers available.</li>
            <li>Super great at removing makeup, yet very gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Best characteristics of this cleanser - awesome price, easy to find, soft soapy scent, gentle on facial skin.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin clean and healthy, can&#x27;t ask for much more than that from soap.</li>
            <li>Read your labels carefully and choose the best moisturizing lotion to add to your skin after cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cleanser is great for those who have sensitive, oily skin.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser does good job in cleaning my oily face, and is gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li>I once purchased this cleanser by mistake intending to purchase Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, which I have used and loved for years.  </li>
            <li>This is probably a good product for someone on the more \\&quot;oily\\&quot; side of \\&quot;normal to oily skin\\&quot; spectrum.</li>
            <li>The pump also makes it really easy to dispense.    </li>
            <li>Easy to rinse off</li>
            <li>I love how the cleanser washes off clean easily after using.</li>
            <li>It is very mild and there is nothing noteworthy about the smell.  </li>
            <li>The cleanser does wash off easily and thoroughly and leaves my skin feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>is in fact so strong that it is nauseating.</li>
            <li>The taste is too strong.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not that strong.  </li>
            <li>I have a good complexion, and would consider my skin to be normal.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning effect is very good, used after the skin is very smooth, does not irritate the skin feel tight.</li>
            <li>Otherwise fine.</li>
            <li>: The Cetaphil gentle cleanser is SO much better than this!</li>
            <li>I love it because its relatively cheap and very consistent.</li>
            <li>and I must say, this is a HUGE improvement.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a huge difference between the two products.</li>
            <li>This is a great facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>Overall a great face soap.</li>
            <li>This product is clear, with a smooth consistency and a clean, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>My face feels great using this twice daily.</li>
            <li>Wish they were available over the counter in Europe.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not too happy with Cetaphil for coming out with a very different product in an almost-identical looking package though).</li>
            <li>I prefer this over the fragrance free version.</li>
            <li>Very mild on my skin and gets it clean.</li>
            <li>This is a gentle yet effective cleanser.</li>
            <li>Have used this for several years and it works great for me.  </li>
            <li>Especially during summer great product for oily skin.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I read a variety of reviews that recommended this as a good product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I like to use very warm water when washing my face to allow my pores to open.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, very fresh and clean, ( I am big on scents).  </li>
            <li>My go to face cleanser, keeps me acne free , feels clean coming off.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil product is produces a fantastic clean without over drying.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to confuse this product on the shelf with the Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser...</li>
            <li>Would not order again, but your experience might differ based on your unique skin.</li>
            <li>It is greaseless, leaving skin squeaky clean, literally.</li>
            <li>Keeps the skin clean.</li>
            <li>I do like the clean feeling it gives after you use it</li>
            <li>It goes on and comes off and leaves my face feeling clean.</li>
            <li>This is the best facial cleanser that I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>you do not add a moisturizer of some type AFTER washing yourself clean.</li>
            <li>this is great to use with prescriptions because it will not over dry.</li>
            <li>I tried that one, and found it to leave a greasy residue without feeling as clean as this one leaves me.</li>
            <li>I sometimes follow with a mud mask for an even deeper clean.</li>
            <li>but you can feel the clean feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s cleaning until you wash off the cleanser and face feels clean.</li>
            <li>I buy Cetaphil through Amazon because it&#x27;s a bit cheaper than in the stores and is a great way to bump up to free shipping on other items.</li>
            <li>This is a large quanity of good cleanser and the dispenser and bottle appear to be high quality.  </li>
            <li>And the price is right!</li>
            <li>so I used this and got a face full of hives.  </li>
            <li>I found this more drying than the gentle cleanser, which I now use on my face.  </li>
            <li>this facial wash is really good.</li>
            <li>Our sensitive skin is appreciative of the gentleness in this cleanser.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many cleansers over the years (channel, lancome, nivea, aveeno, neutrogena (that one dries my skin so much it feels like it&#x27;s going to fall</li>
            <li>I just love Cetaphil gentle cleanser and bought this one by mistake.  </li>
            <li>I really want to like this product, especially because of the excellent reputation of Cetaphil&#x27;s highly recommended line of dermatological products.  </li>
            <li>It also has a fresh and clean feeling after use .</li>
            <li>I bought this cleanser after i read so many great comments about it , but it was not like what i expect , i need to wash my face at least 3 times with it</li>
            <li>me make one rumor go away really quick.</li>
            <li>Cleans quickly and leaves no residue.  </li>
            <li>Simple, cheap and effective.</li>
            <li>My normal skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly NOT unpleasant, and like I said, I can&#x27;t even tell you if it has a scent or not</li>
            <li>this is by a long shot way superior to any of these.</li>
            <li>This is always highly recommended in magazines as a gentle and effective skin cleanser.  </li>
            <li>After reading reviews I purchased it but have not seen amazing results, only more frequent breakouts!!</li>
            <li>Also love the large bottles and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This however has a powerful perfume scent(which is not mentioned) and dries and irritates my skin.</li>
            <li>If you have oily, sensitive skin you will love this product.</li>
            <li>I find all the various reviews amusing.</li>
            <li>An old favorite and works well, as does every Cetaphil product/</li>
            <li>I know that because I went out and bought it ASAP, thrilled that Cetaphil was finally acknowledging customers with oily skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I have been using it for over a year now, and my skin is as clear as can be.</li>
            <li>Amazon has it economically priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m sure this product might work for many of you, I personally prefer the gentle cleanser over this.</li>
            <li>I have never seen my skin so radiant nor felt it so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>Altogether I would highly recommend this product, it is super effective yet still gentle, and is very affordably priced,</li>
            <li>just make sure you get the appropriate formula for your skin type, i.e dry vs oily!!</li>
            <li>And don&#x27;t even think about using it in the shower as it will suck the moisture right out of anything it touches</li>
            <li>I had problems with finding the right one.</li>
            <li>For a deeper clean, follow up with a gentle toner.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised to find the 2 pack bottles for such a low price and best of all I subscribed</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with Cetaphil because it does not dry my skin afterwards.</li>
            <li>However, for folks with acne prone skin, I recommend looking for a cleanser that is mild, gentle, and retains skin moisture.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle it was recommended before by my wife&#x27;s derma for one of my sons when he had a skin problem.</li>
            <li>My acne is very much controlled</li>
            <li>I am use to all other products being fragrence free and safe for all skin types</li>
            <li>Normal soap never seems to quite get my face totally clean.  </li>
            <li>and i have super super sensitive skin (allergic to everything,</li>
            <li>Love this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>Better than the more fancy more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>It did not remove the makeup or dirt on first try.</li>
            <li>I found a two pack on amazon for much cheaper than two bottles would have been at Target, CVS, or the grocery store!  </li>
            <li>I KNOW that when this first came out it had no fragrance.</li>
            <li>so who cares ;)</li>
            <li>I read about cetaphil and most people talk about it like it is the 2nd coming of cleansers.</li>
            <li>The regular cleanser is much better</li>
            <li>first reaction was, &amp;#34;oh</li>
            <li>The order only came in 2- 16 oz size,  but I love this product.</li>
            <li>I maintain a better seal throughout the entire night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using cetaphil facial cleanser for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>While it is economical and likely to last for quite a while, I did find it to be fairly drying.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and this works great at getting rid of the extra oil but does not make it overtly dry.</li>
            <li>After the first full week of using the cleanser, the breakouts were cleared up completely!  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but decided to start out with the daily facial cleanser instead of the sensitive skin cetaphil, and it has worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>Our daughter has used this for many years, but I finally got smart and went to buying it and having it delivered to my front door</li>
            <li>It seems to leave me feeling a lot dryer than the other kind</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and fresh!</li>
            <li>This daily facial cleanser is perfect - gets off any dirt and oil, but doesn&#x27;t leave you dry.</li>
            <li>We have sensitive skin and the cetaphil works well to clean your face with out causing any irration or anything.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this as a good starting point to treating and preventing acne.</li>
            <li>It is mild facial cleanser that does not irritate the skin and keeps my face clean all day.</li>
            <li>When someone recommends Cetaphil, they are most likely talking about the gentle skin cleanser.</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like the gentle skin cleanser.</li>
            <li>First thing in the morning as I shower and wash my face with this cleanser I end up having a migraine within 30 minutes that lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very gentle, effective cleanser for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>Love this cleanser, as it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t over dry causing your skin to produce more oil.  </li>
            <li>It  burns and irritates and  leaves dry eyes even more of a nuisance.</li>
            <li>If the Daily Cleanser (for normal to oily skin) perfectly cleans my skin, which is on the oily side (especially in the T-zone), then I can imagine how this cleanser, that works well for me, might dry out someone else&#x27;s dry/sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it, especially for anyone with an oily complexion.  </li>
            <li>but it is so STRONG smelling that I simply can not use it.  </li>
            <li>I used this Daily Facial Cleanser for over 2 years, I really did give it more than a fair chance, and just this last month switched to Olay Foaming Face Wash for Sensitive Skin as it removes my eye makeup.  </li>
            <li>This face wash was recommended to me because I was looking for one without a certain chemical (I can&#x27;t remember which one anymore</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got dry skin, the Gentle Cleanser is probably better suited for you.</li>
            <li>It is extremely gentle on the skin, but strong enough to remove all of that makeup that I wear every day.  </li>
            <li>The clean fresh soft feeling it gives me after I have washed my face is like no other product can achieve.  </li>
            <li>It completely cleans the days off of my face with a very light fresh scent (which to me kind of smells like Johnson &amp; Johnson baby shampoo, the one that says no more tears, but maybe that&#x27;s just me) yet doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li>It has worked very well in cleansing my face, removing oily dirt without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li>I am very unsatisfied and will stick with gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>, I have even stopped using an astringent/toner, and just go straight to moisturiser.     </li>
            <li>After using Cetaphil for only a few days, most of my breakouts (from my latest Neutrogena cleanser) were clearing up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Nivea face scrub, but it didn&#x27;t do much except give me tons of pimples.  </li>
            <li>(yes, that is this one), so I used the Gentle Cleanser instead.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>Between the two products, I prefer the gentle skin cleanser</li>
            <li>much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It never dries my skin out and always cleans it very well.</li>
            <li>Gentle on skin, virtually no odor, and has a lockable pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I keep one bottle on my bathroom counter and another in the shower.</li>
            <li>Come the apocalypse, I&#x27;ll be ready with my supply of three or four bottles of Cetaphil.</li>
            <li>It is an absolute MYTH</li>
            <li>This leaves my face feeling squeaky clean, but does not dry it out.</li>
            <li>I will stick with Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, as it is far more moisturizing, fragrance-free, and also removes facial oils.</li>
            <li>but Cetaphil cleans gently</li>
            <li>Otherwise the cleanser is a great product, we have been using it for years, non irritating, no lingering odor.</li>
            <li>I also use if for my intimate areas.  </li>
            <li>Inexpensive, gentle and not perfumed.</li>
            <li>very convenient with the pump</li>
            <li>works very well and not over drying.</li>
            <li>This is a really gentle face wash that just cleans my face like it</li>
            <li>If I can&#x27;t rinse it off real well, no problem.</li>
            <li>I really like what this cleanser does for my skin.</li>
            <li>It really works for me</li>
            <li>It is gentle yet gets out the dirt and grime.</li>
            <li>If you use Cetaphil in conjunction with a toner and a nightly retinol, it can really help you fight breakouts.</li>
            <li>I have tried the Gentle Cleanser and didn&#x27;t like that one at all.  </li>
            <li>A fantastic facial cleaner and removes makeup as well.  </li>
            <li>and I tried all kinds of gentle soaps and gentle shampoos with no luck.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try the gentle skin cleaner and see if it works too.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and just as described.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is really gentle and leaves your face feeling clean but not dry.  </li>
            <li>I rarely have breakouts and it&#x27;s a gentle cleanser while still having the foaming action.  </li>
            <li>but in a very gentle way -- which is what my sensitive acne-prone skin needs!</li>
            <li>Great daily facial cleanser, it is gentle enough for normal skin.</li>
            <li>So yes, they do clean your skin, but they also strip away the natural sebum that your skin produces to keep your skin moist, soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Like this one better than the other scent though.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if its due to this or something else but not too many break outs here.</li>
            <li>Then I found the version for normal to oily skin....and what a difference!</li>
            <li>I guess you could say I have combination skin (like most other people in the world).</li>
            <li>I used to use Ivory bar and that made the skin feel extra taut and clean.</li>
            <li>Overall though its super gentle and works really well.</li>
            <li>I do like the way it cleanses though, and it is very gentle for my mildly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Its very gentle on the skin and leaves the skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>The daily facial cleanser is much harsher, more soap-like, and really dries out my skin.</li>
            <li>I actually would have to go upstairs and smell it to even see if they&#x27;re right!</li>
            <li>Please note though that I use an eye makeup remover prior to washing my face, (as I would with any other product) and use only a light application of Mineral (powder) foundation, so I cant guarantee that Cetaphil is effective with heavier applications of makeup.    </li>
            <li>The size is perfect as it&#x27;ll last me at least 4 months of daily use until I need to purchase another.</li>
            <li>Most cleansers that have &amp;#34;surfactants&amp;#34; and certain &amp;#34;emulsifiers&amp;#34; will be harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li>I finally found a good combination using Cetaphil, with a little coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loyal to the Cetaphil brand, but this Daily cleanser just didn&#x27;t suit my needs.  </li>
            <li>:) I have 1 bottle at the sink to cleanse face twice daily and 1 bottle in my shower to use instead for body wash for the gym days to prevent any clogged pores on my back.</li>
            <li>Fully applicable to the use of this cleanser, mild allergy does not appear to wash quite clean taste is Fen, but feel that the cleaning ability is not strong</li>
            <li>What I mostly did not like about this product was the smell and the tight feeling I felt after use.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend Cetaphil and this deal.  </li>
            <li>After seeing this product highly reviewed in a magazine, I thought I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li>i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It is not sudsy like ordinary soap which makes it very easy to rinse.</li>
            <li>I would stick with the brand name version even if it does cost a little more, but I have tried the store-brand version of this and it doesn&#x27;t even compare.</li>
            <li>She suggested spending a little more time rubbing it in and washing it off, which I do.  </li>
            <li>I followed my aesthetician&#x27;s advice and use something with glycolic acid in it for a little more exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>I have tried various facial cleansers over the years (in various price ranges) and I absolutely love this one!</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive dry to normal skin, you might want to try the Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser (for all skin types), which I&#x27;ve heard works very well, or the Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash, which has very positive Amazon reviews.</li>
            <li>After using several types of cleansers from Clean &amp; Clear and Neutrogena, the Cetaphil Daily Cleanser (for normal to oily skin) is the only cleanser that has been able to wash off my makeup (Clinique concealer and mascara), clear my skin from breakouts, and NOT burn my eyes.</li>
            <li>I really like Cetaphil as a cleanser, but am sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really helped to gently clear my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>To those of you out there with sensitive skin, do yourself a favor and get the CETAPHIL GENTLE</li>
            <li>Face feels clean and not overly dry.  </li>
            <li>Nothing worked, and I didn&#x27;t stick to any one product for more than a few months.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recently, I discovered the normal to oily skin version</li>
            <li>It burned and turned beat red while using this and right after using it and made my eyes water.</li>
            <li>warning unlike other cetaphil products this is no fragrence free and thus is not for all skin types.  </li>
            <li>It is in line with other products of this nature and available everywhere.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Clean &amp; Clear cleansers used to dry out my face and burn my eyes.</li>
            <li>Not only does it leave my face feeling clean (but not dry)</li>
            <li>I have given this product a fair amount of time to make a final decision on whether or not I really liked it.</li>
            <li>I have to use Cetaphil because I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years; I have very sensitive acne prone skin</li>
            <li>and I just have a very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>But, the real cleansing is coming from the surfactants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate, and many others, that product little to no</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s skin is unique, so cleansers work differently for different people.  </li>
            <li>Cetaphil works very well, and has a very light scent, and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling tight or dry.  </li>
            <li>I purchased Cetaphil for normal to oily skin on the whim to see if it was any different from their Gentle Skin Cleanser line.</li>
            <li>At first I bought both cleansers, the Gentle Cleanser and the Daily Facial Cleanser.</li>
            <li>In addition, the cleanser has an extremely powerful fragrance that I do not enjoy and really goes against Cetaphil&#x27;s other products, which they advertise as being fragrance free for those with sensitive skin.    </li>
            <li>Skin feels tight fresh and ready to go.</li>
            <li>I had bought a different Cetaphil product in the past which I remember was very strong for my skin, however when this one came out it stated would be &amp;#34;easier on the skin&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Now, my skin stays clear and doesn&#x27;t get oily throughout the day</li>
            <li>I have the most polar combination skin possible, my cheeks generally are extremely dry whereas my forehead becomes very oily.</li>
            <li>the texture is clear gel</li>
            <li>It burns you if you have sensitive skin -</li>
            <li>my skin is sensitive with ton of break outs.</li>
            <li>Ordered the facial cleanser and Amazon sent me the Gentle Skin Cleanser.</li>
            <li>I asked if it made a different which one of these products I use, and she said ABSOLUTELY</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and have been using Cetaphil faithfully for over 10 years.</li>
            <li>Finally, my dermatologist gave me a sample of Cetaphil, which has absolutely changed my life.  </li>
            <li>When I started using Cetaphil, my skin was overly sensitive.</li>
            <li>Even though I used this habitually for nearly two years, I still kept getting acne.  </li>
            <li>I give this cleanser a two star and not a one because I believed it helped de-sensitize my overly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;ve tried every face wash and lotions, with some experimenting with natural remedies like honey, baking soda, and lemon juice.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Plus, my overly sensitive skin doesn&#x27;t have the after-cleansing tightness and is squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I now have dried out red splotches on my face and its been more than a day.</li>
            <li>My complaint at that time was that I did not feel it was effective enough and often had to follow-up with astringent to remove all my make-up.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave face dry; however, I feel like it really just cleans your face like normal soap and provides no protection against breakouts.</li>
            <li>First of all, my skin is extremely dry (yes, even during the non-winter season) to the point that it is peeling skin.  </li>
            <li>Has a nice subtle scent and works well for my oily skin!</li>
            <li>I can definitely see why my dermatologist recommended it, especially since I am using it in combination with some very strong harsh creams (prescription creams).</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean, soft, and not too dried out (but I still use lotion of course).</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s not just a simple, light fragrance; like the bar soap, the fragrance is strong and sweet and cloying enough to make it impossible to use without giving me a headache or making me feel nauseous.</li>
            <li>I am a teenage girl, and I used to have mild acne with bad breakouts fairly often.</li>
            <li>For the price you are playing for this, you might as well get something that will clean without leaving your face feeling like dry, stretched leather.</li>
            <li>My son really likes this cleanser as his general daily wash.</li>
            <li>right to my door whenever I choose, every month, every other month, etc...</li>
            <li>This cleanser really does rinse clean, with no dryness or tight feeling when pat your face dry</li>
            <li>I belong to a particularly sensitive skin, general skin care products do not use.</li>
            <li>it was the original style of cetaphil and was surprised how different and clearly not \\&quot;original style\\&quot; it was when I got it.</li>
            <li>The price is right, more expensive at local pharmacy.  </li>
            <li>However, there was a breaking in period of my skin being really quite uncomfortably dry</li>
            <li>This one works really well for my skin type -- dry except for the T-zone.  </li>
            <li>Received Gentle Skin cleanser instead of Daily Facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>In total, I have been using this cleanser for about two months (if not longer), and I know that my skin hasn&#x27;t been this clear since early adolescence.</li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t confuse the Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser with the Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser.</li>
            <li>I do, however, notice that every now and then my skin does one of several things either it begins to peel, I can&#x27;t moisturize it enough, or my face burns because the cleanser dries it out so much.</li>
            <li>I recommend the daily facial cleanser over the gentle skin cleanser.</li>
            <li>I accidentally bought the Cetaphil daily facial cleanser instead of the Cetaphil gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m saying is I am not sure this is for super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product as a basic facial cleanser</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for nearly three years now, and those are the only problems.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser, for normal to oily skin, 16.0 -Ounce</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t actually use it to clean my face as I don&#x27;t feel like it cleans my face properly, but I have ordered quite a few of these to use as a shaving lotion for me and my husband.</li>
            <li>the one for normal to dry skin...</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s the product or the fact that I&#x27;m currently pregnant</li>
            <li>My face feels clean and pleasantly tight without being overly dry.  </li>
            <li>(of course I have a whole routine and other products in conjunction with this).</li>
            <li>Other products were drying my skin too much.  </li>
            <li>For those who has very dry skin, i would highly recommended this.</li>
            <li>After Cetaphil, not a single one has popped up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Admittedly it is not an overnight miracle, but the only change to my routine including diet, exercise and overall lifestyle has been this product, and I wholly attribue my clear skin to it.     </li>
            <li>My sensitive skin only allows me to use this facial cleanser, and not anyone else&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It is not a pleasant smell either, it&#x27;s just strong.</li>
            <li>It does not dry up my face.  </li>
            <li>I have spent alot of money on cleansers, from the super expensive to the really cheap ones.</li>
            <li>I tried Cetaphil after reading online reviews on [...], and after only 3 months, have seen major improvement (read: not one zit for over 4 wks)</li>
            <li>Since I have been using this cleanser, I have had the occasional small pimple here or there, but those have gone away quickly.</li>
            <li>But, don&#x27;t use another cream or lotion that contains more harsh emulsifiers and emollients that do not add the correct fatty acids or wax esters back to the skin.</li>
            <li>it has totally eliminated the mild to moderate breakouts I&#x27;d been suffering from for the past year.    </li>
            <li>this product does not irritate sensitive skin, does not over dry...</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;d take the extra step of washing my eyes again and still I&#x27;d have to use a Q-Tip to try and gently swipe away at the black smudges afterwards.    </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It smells delicious.  </li>
            <li> One of the best face soaps I have tried.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best cleansers for all skin types.</li>
            <li> The product is perfect but the shipping is not so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Best cleanser there is.</li>
            <li> For maybe 10 years of my life, I used the Clinique 3 step process and my skin was never the greatest.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the best product in the face soap category, men and women alike use it.</li>
            <li> I have never found that perfect product that my skin jives well with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using that product for over 15 years, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it</li>
            <li> Perfect.</li>
            <li> I have used this face soap for years and it works flawlessly.  </li>
            <li> Great price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> its basically the best cleanser you can buy for the price!</li>
            <li> Found these on Amazon.........again for the best price I could find (no surprise to me!).  </li>
            <li> Very happy customer here.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser I have ever used on my face.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this cleanser!!!</li>
            <li> Then apply a very good Organic coconut oil to serve as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It is incredible and I have been using it ever since, which is probably a record for me (about a year).</li>
            <li> Ideally I&#x27;d like this soap without any perfume</li>
            <li> This is my best one,delicate cleans well .I am happy that amazon carries it because I will keep reordering forever ! :)</li>
            <li> Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and it worked great for me.  </li>
            <li> GREAT product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t suds up, so it almost doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything, but works great.</li>
            <li> great for my combination skin</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> but it works great.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product that I will recommend to anyone who asks for a recommendation.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> It was a great deal for two 16oz bottles compared to prices in the store.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my face</li>
            <li> Great value for the size.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  </li>
            <li> Oh yeah, and the price on this is great.  </li>
            <li> it works great for me.</li>
            <li> great product to remove oil from the face</li>
            <li> so it feels great when I apply it to my face.</li>
            <li> I love Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser!!</li>
            <li> Very good product and liked it</li>
            <li> I use it with the \\&quot;Clarisonic\\&quot; cleansing brush and the combination is amazing!</li>
            <li> My search for an effective, yet non-drying, face/neck cleanser is over!</li>
            <li> It cleans and has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> Foams well and washes off good.</li>
            <li> I also figured, hey, if it&#x27;s not removing my eye makeup, how good of a job is it doing in removing my foundation makeup?    </li>
            <li> This was a good deal for two 16 oz bottles.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Good product,</li>
            <li> I attended a Health Fair 8 years ago.  </li>
            <li> good price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good price for a quality cleanser.</li>
            <li> the money, this is a good purchase.</li>
            <li> It feels good after use.  </li>
            <li> : WHY did Cetaphil ruin a perfectly good, frag-free cleanser by adding fragrance to it?</li>
            <li> I read some good reviews about Cetaphil, and gave it a shot.  </li>
            <li> It as Good product and a Good quality according WITH the price given in the web.</li>
            <li> Did i think it was a fair price?  </li>
            <li> good.</li>
            <li> Good soap.</li>
            <li> Excellent light soap that I use every morning for my face.  </li>
            <li> It is just the best feeling of clean.</li>
            <li> It dosent work that great at removing makeup though, for make up its better to use a makeup remover separately and then use this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I wish it cleaned off eye makeup better, but great otherwise.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my Dermatologis years ago and still love love this product!!  </li>
            <li> This has been very effective in keep my screen healthy.</li>
            <li> that is for sure!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser for over a year, and it is perfect for my skin, which can get pretty oily in the T area.</li>
            <li> All these problems are compounded by my dermatologist&#x27;s retinoid prescriptions for controlling my acne, I end up with flaky and irritated skin on top of my oil and dryness issues; what a pain!    </li>
            <li> I love this cleanser!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Most of them aren&#x27;t even paid to push it!</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> and it works amazingly.  </li>
            <li> This face wash is amazing.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel smooth and look great.</li>
            <li> Now my teenager has to have his own bottle in his bathroom</li>
            <li> I switched to this kind.  </li>
            <li> Perfect gentle face cleanser recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> My own aesthetician recommended it to me in the evenings when I was experiencing redness and acne.  </li>
            <li> It gets a good grade because it does what I what I want it to do with regard to softcly cleaning my face, but I am still in search of the better product that I have had experience with.</li>
            <li> Very gentle and the smell is amazing!!  </li>
            <li> It smells great, removes make up, leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed with no dryness.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty good too!</li>
            <li> The version labeled &#x27;gentle cleanser&#x27; never feels like it does a very good job.</li>
            <li> this item was exactly as pictured and described it was of very good quality, better price.  </li>
            <li> Its non drying and makes my skin  feel really clean  and has a pleasant scent</li>
            <li> Strong frangrance smell!</li>
            <li> Very good product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It is gentle yet effective on oily prone skin types and it smells great.</li>
            <li> The most important thing is that the item isn&#x27;t so good as they said.</li>
            <li> face wash and won&#x27;t be anything special&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s exactly what makes it so great.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product; my skin feels wonderfully clean and smooth when I use it.</li>
            <li> Very light feeling not oily.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of this product very smooth.</li>
            <li> and I feel so much better.  </li>
            <li> Just buy it and enjoy!   </li>
            <li> It does not lather, rather you massage it onto your skin for it to work its magic.</li>
            <li> I have had more breakouts since using this product and I will not purchase it again</li>
            <li> and this product cleans better than the peel.</li>
            <li> I love the Cetaphil lotions and cremes but this isn&#x27;t doing it for me.</li>
            <li> love this face wash.</li>
            <li> I have looked for the better part of three decades for a cleanser that wards off break-outs, and doesn&#x27;t cause my face to peel.</li>
            <li> I only wish I had discovered this excellent product 40 years ago.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s perfect for daily use.</li>
            <li> People have mentioned an overwhelming scent.....</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> I preciously guard travel-size bottles I got from my dermatologist years ago</li>
            <li> She is quite satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> i love the price</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> The best facial cleanser on the market for all types of skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial product on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Now I can use more potent products with out having my skin flake off and burn.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for over 10 years, it is the best over the counter facial wash!  </li>
            <li> It feels good on the face, and after rinsing off my skin feels fresh.</li>
            <li> I like it better than Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser, which is also good.</li>
            <li> but I love the improvements Cetaphil has done on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 1-2 years now, and have never had better skin.  </li>
            <li> This is the best facial cleanser for combination skin I have used.  </li>
            <li> The package Will be better.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for the next best thing.</li>
            <li> and I love it even more with my Clarisonic Cleanser.</li>
            <li> This washing system along w the cetaphil moisturizer and my face has been so smooth, calm and happy.</li>
            <li> One pump dispenses the perfect amount and the bottle lasts months with daily use.</li>
            <li> This Daily Cleanser is the BEST!  </li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> i tried switching to &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; products and they just irritate my skin even more.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find anything better than this cetaphil cleanser.</li>
            <li> The shipment fee was almost more than the product.</li>
            <li> but I do feel like i get most off with the Cetaphil.  </li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser for 5+ years and love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give this product to one of my kids, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s gonna work for them</li>
            <li> perfect daily face cleanser - my staple</li>
            <li> Btw, Cerave PM is magic, so is Cerave AM [...]</li>
            <li> I threw away some good money figuring out the right combo for my face</li>
            <li> The scent is very nice as well, very crisp and clean smelling.</li>
            <li> I have been using this wash for years and it has helped great with my acne prone skin and providing that fresh clean feelin.</li>
            <li> It is not expensive and a dermatologist must if you see one they will all tell you how good it is.</li>
            <li> This one is a nice balance between mild and oil removing.</li>
            <li> One of the best facial cleanser available.</li>
            <li> It is ranked in some surveys as one of the best facial cleansers available.</li>
            <li> Super great at removing makeup, yet very gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Best characteristics of this cleanser - awesome price, easy to find, soft soapy scent, gentle on facial skin.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin clean and healthy, can&#x27;t ask for much more than that from soap.</li>
            <li> Read your labels carefully and choose the best moisturizing lotion to add to your skin after cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cleanser is great for those who have sensitive, oily skin.  </li>
            <li> This cleanser does good job in cleaning my oily face, and is gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li> I once purchased this cleanser by mistake intending to purchase Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, which I have used and loved for years.  </li>
            <li> This is probably a good product for someone on the more \\&quot;oily\\&quot; side of \\&quot;normal to oily skin\\&quot; spectrum.</li>
            <li> The pump also makes it really easy to dispense.    </li>
            <li> Easy to rinse off</li>
            <li> I love how the cleanser washes off clean easily after using.</li>
            <li> It is very mild and there is nothing noteworthy about the smell.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser does wash off easily and thoroughly and leaves my skin feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> is in fact so strong that it is nauseating.</li>
            <li> The taste is too strong.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not that strong.  </li>
            <li> I have a good complexion, and would consider my skin to be normal.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning effect is very good, used after the skin is very smooth, does not irritate the skin feel tight.</li>
            <li> Otherwise fine.</li>
            <li> : The Cetaphil gentle cleanser is SO much better than this!</li>
            <li> I love it because its relatively cheap and very consistent.</li>
            <li> and I must say, this is a HUGE improvement.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a huge difference between the two products.</li>
            <li> This is a great facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> Overall a great face soap.</li>
            <li> This product is clear, with a smooth consistency and a clean, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> My face feels great using this twice daily.</li>
            <li> Wish they were available over the counter in Europe.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not too happy with Cetaphil for coming out with a very different product in an almost-identical looking package though).</li>
            <li> I prefer this over the fragrance free version.</li>
            <li> Very mild on my skin and gets it clean.</li>
            <li> This is a gentle yet effective cleanser.</li>
            <li> Have used this for several years and it works great for me.  </li>
            <li> Especially during summer great product for oily skin.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I read a variety of reviews that recommended this as a good product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I like to use very warm water when washing my face to allow my pores to open.  </li>
            <li> Smells great, very fresh and clean, ( I am big on scents).  </li>
            <li> My go to face cleanser, keeps me acne free , feels clean coming off.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil product is produces a fantastic clean without over drying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to confuse this product on the shelf with the Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser...</li>
            <li> Would not order again, but your experience might differ based on your unique skin.</li>
            <li> It is greaseless, leaving skin squeaky clean, literally.</li>
            <li> Keeps the skin clean.</li>
            <li> I do like the clean feeling it gives after you use it</li>
            <li> It goes on and comes off and leaves my face feeling clean.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cleanser that I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> you do not add a moisturizer of some type AFTER washing yourself clean.</li>
            <li> this is great to use with prescriptions because it will not over dry.</li>
            <li> I tried that one, and found it to leave a greasy residue without feeling as clean as this one leaves me.</li>
            <li> I sometimes follow with a mud mask for an even deeper clean.</li>
            <li> but you can feel the clean feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s cleaning until you wash off the cleanser and face feels clean.</li>
            <li> I buy Cetaphil through Amazon because it&#x27;s a bit cheaper than in the stores and is a great way to bump up to free shipping on other items.</li>
            <li> This is a large quanity of good cleanser and the dispenser and bottle appear to be high quality.  </li>
            <li> And the price is right!</li>
            <li> so I used this and got a face full of hives.  </li>
            <li> I found this more drying than the gentle cleanser, which I now use on my face.  </li>
            <li> this facial wash is really good.</li>
            <li> Our sensitive skin is appreciative of the gentleness in this cleanser.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried many cleansers over the years (channel, lancome, nivea, aveeno, neutrogena (that one dries my skin so much it feels like it&#x27;s going to fall</li>
            <li> I just love Cetaphil gentle cleanser and bought this one by mistake.  </li>
            <li> I really want to like this product, especially because of the excellent reputation of Cetaphil&#x27;s highly recommended line of dermatological products.  </li>
            <li> It also has a fresh and clean feeling after use .</li>
            <li> I bought this cleanser after i read so many great comments about it , but it was not like what i expect , i need to wash my face at least 3 times with it</li>
            <li> me make one rumor go away really quick.</li>
            <li> Cleans quickly and leaves no residue.  </li>
            <li> Simple, cheap and effective.</li>
            <li> My normal skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly NOT unpleasant, and like I said, I can&#x27;t even tell you if it has a scent or not</li>
            <li> this is by a long shot way superior to any of these.</li>
            <li> This is always highly recommended in magazines as a gentle and effective skin cleanser.  </li>
            <li> After reading reviews I purchased it but have not seen amazing results, only more frequent breakouts!!</li>
            <li> Also love the large bottles and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This however has a powerful perfume scent(which is not mentioned) and dries and irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> If you have oily, sensitive skin you will love this product.</li>
            <li> I find all the various reviews amusing.</li>
            <li> An old favorite and works well, as does every Cetaphil product/</li>
            <li> I know that because I went out and bought it ASAP, thrilled that Cetaphil was finally acknowledging customers with oily skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have been using it for over a year now, and my skin is as clear as can be.</li>
            <li> Amazon has it economically priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m sure this product might work for many of you, I personally prefer the gentle cleanser over this.</li>
            <li> I have never seen my skin so radiant nor felt it so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> Altogether I would highly recommend this product, it is super effective yet still gentle, and is very affordably priced,</li>
            <li> just make sure you get the appropriate formula for your skin type, i.e dry vs oily!!</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t even think about using it in the shower as it will suck the moisture right out of anything it touches</li>
            <li> I had problems with finding the right one.</li>
            <li> For a deeper clean, follow up with a gentle toner.  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised to find the 2 pack bottles for such a low price and best of all I subscribed</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with Cetaphil because it does not dry my skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> However, for folks with acne prone skin, I recommend looking for a cleanser that is mild, gentle, and retains skin moisture.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle it was recommended before by my wife&#x27;s derma for one of my sons when he had a skin problem.</li>
            <li> My acne is very much controlled</li>
            <li> I am use to all other products being fragrence free and safe for all skin types</li>
            <li> Normal soap never seems to quite get my face totally clean.  </li>
            <li> and i have super super sensitive skin (allergic to everything,</li>
            <li> Love this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> Better than the more fancy more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> It did not remove the makeup or dirt on first try.</li>
            <li> I found a two pack on amazon for much cheaper than two bottles would have been at Target, CVS, or the grocery store!  </li>
            <li> I KNOW that when this first came out it had no fragrance.</li>
            <li> so who cares ;)</li>
            <li> I read about cetaphil and most people talk about it like it is the 2nd coming of cleansers.</li>
            <li> The regular cleanser is much better</li>
            <li> first reaction was, &amp;#34;oh</li>
            <li> The order only came in 2- 16 oz size,  but I love this product.</li>
            <li> I maintain a better seal throughout the entire night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using cetaphil facial cleanser for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> While it is economical and likely to last for quite a while, I did find it to be fairly drying.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this works great at getting rid of the extra oil but does not make it overtly dry.</li>
            <li> After the first full week of using the cleanser, the breakouts were cleared up completely!  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but decided to start out with the daily facial cleanser instead of the sensitive skin cetaphil, and it has worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> Our daughter has used this for many years, but I finally got smart and went to buying it and having it delivered to my front door</li>
            <li> It seems to leave me feeling a lot dryer than the other kind</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft and fresh!</li>
            <li> This daily facial cleanser is perfect - gets off any dirt and oil, but doesn&#x27;t leave you dry.</li>
            <li> We have sensitive skin and the cetaphil works well to clean your face with out causing any irration or anything.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this as a good starting point to treating and preventing acne.</li>
            <li> It is mild facial cleanser that does not irritate the skin and keeps my face clean all day.</li>
            <li> When someone recommends Cetaphil, they are most likely talking about the gentle skin cleanser.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like the gentle skin cleanser.</li>
            <li> First thing in the morning as I shower and wash my face with this cleanser I end up having a migraine within 30 minutes that lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very gentle, effective cleanser for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> Love this cleanser, as it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t over dry causing your skin to produce more oil.  </li>
            <li> It  burns and irritates and  leaves dry eyes even more of a nuisance.</li>
            <li> If the Daily Cleanser (for normal to oily skin) perfectly cleans my skin, which is on the oily side (especially in the T-zone), then I can imagine how this cleanser, that works well for me, might dry out someone else&#x27;s dry/sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it, especially for anyone with an oily complexion.  </li>
            <li> but it is so STRONG smelling that I simply can not use it.  </li>
            <li> I used this Daily Facial Cleanser for over 2 years, I really did give it more than a fair chance, and just this last month switched to Olay Foaming Face Wash for Sensitive Skin as it removes my eye makeup.  </li>
            <li> This face wash was recommended to me because I was looking for one without a certain chemical (I can&#x27;t remember which one anymore</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got dry skin, the Gentle Cleanser is probably better suited for you.</li>
            <li> It is extremely gentle on the skin, but strong enough to remove all of that makeup that I wear every day.  </li>
            <li> The clean fresh soft feeling it gives me after I have washed my face is like no other product can achieve.  </li>
            <li> It completely cleans the days off of my face with a very light fresh scent (which to me kind of smells like Johnson &amp; Johnson baby shampoo, the one that says no more tears, but maybe that&#x27;s just me) yet doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> It has worked very well in cleansing my face, removing oily dirt without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> I am very unsatisfied and will stick with gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> , I have even stopped using an astringent/toner, and just go straight to moisturiser.     </li>
            <li> After using Cetaphil for only a few days, most of my breakouts (from my latest Neutrogena cleanser) were clearing up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Nivea face scrub, but it didn&#x27;t do much except give me tons of pimples.  </li>
            <li> (yes, that is this one), so I used the Gentle Cleanser instead.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> Between the two products, I prefer the gentle skin cleanser</li>
            <li> much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It never dries my skin out and always cleans it very well.</li>
            <li> Gentle on skin, virtually no odor, and has a lockable pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like it so much that I keep one bottle on my bathroom counter and another in the shower.</li>
            <li> Come the apocalypse, I&#x27;ll be ready with my supply of three or four bottles of Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> It is an absolute MYTH</li>
            <li> This leaves my face feeling squeaky clean, but does not dry it out.</li>
            <li> I will stick with Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, as it is far more moisturizing, fragrance-free, and also removes facial oils.</li>
            <li> but Cetaphil cleans gently</li>
            <li> Otherwise the cleanser is a great product, we have been using it for years, non irritating, no lingering odor.</li>
            <li> I also use if for my intimate areas.  </li>
            <li> Inexpensive, gentle and not perfumed.</li>
            <li> very convenient with the pump</li>
            <li> works very well and not over drying.</li>
            <li> This is a really gentle face wash that just cleans my face like it</li>
            <li> If I can&#x27;t rinse it off real well, no problem.</li>
            <li> I really like what this cleanser does for my skin.</li>
            <li> It really works for me</li>
            <li> It is gentle yet gets out the dirt and grime.</li>
            <li> If you use Cetaphil in conjunction with a toner and a nightly retinol, it can really help you fight breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have tried the Gentle Cleanser and didn&#x27;t like that one at all.  </li>
            <li> A fantastic facial cleaner and removes makeup as well.  </li>
            <li> and I tried all kinds of gentle soaps and gentle shampoos with no luck.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try the gentle skin cleaner and see if it works too.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and just as described.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is really gentle and leaves your face feeling clean but not dry.  </li>
            <li> I rarely have breakouts and it&#x27;s a gentle cleanser while still having the foaming action.  </li>
            <li> but in a very gentle way -- which is what my sensitive acne-prone skin needs!</li>
            <li> Great daily facial cleanser, it is gentle enough for normal skin.</li>
            <li> So yes, they do clean your skin, but they also strip away the natural sebum that your skin produces to keep your skin moist, soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Like this one better than the other scent though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its due to this or something else but not too many break outs here.</li>
            <li> Then I found the version for normal to oily skin....and what a difference!</li>
            <li> I guess you could say I have combination skin (like most other people in the world).</li>
            <li> I used to use Ivory bar and that made the skin feel extra taut and clean.</li>
            <li> Overall though its super gentle and works really well.</li>
            <li> I do like the way it cleanses though, and it is very gentle for my mildly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Its very gentle on the skin and leaves the skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> The daily facial cleanser is much harsher, more soap-like, and really dries out my skin.</li>
            <li> I actually would have to go upstairs and smell it to even see if they&#x27;re right!</li>
            <li> Please note though that I use an eye makeup remover prior to washing my face, (as I would with any other product) and use only a light application of Mineral (powder) foundation, so I cant guarantee that Cetaphil is effective with heavier applications of makeup.    </li>
            <li> The size is perfect as it&#x27;ll last me at least 4 months of daily use until I need to purchase another.</li>
            <li> Most cleansers that have &amp;#34;surfactants&amp;#34; and certain &amp;#34;emulsifiers&amp;#34; will be harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> I finally found a good combination using Cetaphil, with a little coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loyal to the Cetaphil brand, but this Daily cleanser just didn&#x27;t suit my needs.  </li>
            <li> :) I have 1 bottle at the sink to cleanse face twice daily and 1 bottle in my shower to use instead for body wash for the gym days to prevent any clogged pores on my back.</li>
            <li> Fully applicable to the use of this cleanser, mild allergy does not appear to wash quite clean taste is Fen, but feel that the cleaning ability is not strong</li>
            <li> What I mostly did not like about this product was the smell and the tight feeling I felt after use.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend Cetaphil and this deal.  </li>
            <li> After seeing this product highly reviewed in a magazine, I thought I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li> i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is not sudsy like ordinary soap which makes it very easy to rinse.</li>
            <li> I would stick with the brand name version even if it does cost a little more, but I have tried the store-brand version of this and it doesn&#x27;t even compare.</li>
            <li> She suggested spending a little more time rubbing it in and washing it off, which I do.  </li>
            <li> I followed my aesthetician&#x27;s advice and use something with glycolic acid in it for a little more exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> I have tried various facial cleansers over the years (in various price ranges) and I absolutely love this one!</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive dry to normal skin, you might want to try the Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser (for all skin types), which I&#x27;ve heard works very well, or the Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash, which has very positive Amazon reviews.</li>
            <li> After using several types of cleansers from Clean &amp; Clear and Neutrogena, the Cetaphil Daily Cleanser (for normal to oily skin) is the only cleanser that has been able to wash off my makeup (Clinique concealer and mascara), clear my skin from breakouts, and NOT burn my eyes.</li>
            <li> I really like Cetaphil as a cleanser, but am sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helped to gently clear my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> To those of you out there with sensitive skin, do yourself a favor and get the CETAPHIL GENTLE</li>
            <li> Face feels clean and not overly dry.  </li>
            <li> Nothing worked, and I didn&#x27;t stick to any one product for more than a few months.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recently, I discovered the normal to oily skin version</li>
            <li> It burned and turned beat red while using this and right after using it and made my eyes water.</li>
            <li> warning unlike other cetaphil products this is no fragrence free and thus is not for all skin types.  </li>
            <li> It is in line with other products of this nature and available everywhere.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Clean &amp; Clear cleansers used to dry out my face and burn my eyes.</li>
            <li> Not only does it leave my face feeling clean (but not dry)</li>
            <li> I have given this product a fair amount of time to make a final decision on whether or not I really liked it.</li>
            <li> I have to use Cetaphil because I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years; I have very sensitive acne prone skin</li>
            <li> and I just have a very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> But, the real cleansing is coming from the surfactants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate, and many others, that product little to no</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin is unique, so cleansers work differently for different people.  </li>
            <li> Cetaphil works very well, and has a very light scent, and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling tight or dry.  </li>
            <li> I purchased Cetaphil for normal to oily skin on the whim to see if it was any different from their Gentle Skin Cleanser line.</li>
            <li> At first I bought both cleansers, the Gentle Cleanser and the Daily Facial Cleanser.</li>
            <li> In addition, the cleanser has an extremely powerful fragrance that I do not enjoy and really goes against Cetaphil&#x27;s other products, which they advertise as being fragrance free for those with sensitive skin.    </li>
            <li> Skin feels tight fresh and ready to go.</li>
            <li> I had bought a different Cetaphil product in the past which I remember was very strong for my skin, however when this one came out it stated would be &amp;#34;easier on the skin&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Now, my skin stays clear and doesn&#x27;t get oily throughout the day</li>
            <li> I have the most polar combination skin possible, my cheeks generally are extremely dry whereas my forehead becomes very oily.</li>
            <li> the texture is clear gel</li>
            <li> It burns you if you have sensitive skin -</li>
            <li> my skin is sensitive with ton of break outs.</li>
            <li> Ordered the facial cleanser and Amazon sent me the Gentle Skin Cleanser.</li>
            <li> I asked if it made a different which one of these products I use, and she said ABSOLUTELY</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and have been using Cetaphil faithfully for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> Finally, my dermatologist gave me a sample of Cetaphil, which has absolutely changed my life.  </li>
            <li> When I started using Cetaphil, my skin was overly sensitive.</li>
            <li> Even though I used this habitually for nearly two years, I still kept getting acne.  </li>
            <li> I give this cleanser a two star and not a one because I believed it helped de-sensitize my overly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve tried every face wash and lotions, with some experimenting with natural remedies like honey, baking soda, and lemon juice.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Plus, my overly sensitive skin doesn&#x27;t have the after-cleansing tightness and is squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I now have dried out red splotches on my face and its been more than a day.</li>
            <li> My complaint at that time was that I did not feel it was effective enough and often had to follow-up with astringent to remove all my make-up.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave face dry; however, I feel like it really just cleans your face like normal soap and provides no protection against breakouts.</li>
            <li> First of all, my skin is extremely dry (yes, even during the non-winter season) to the point that it is peeling skin.  </li>
            <li> Has a nice subtle scent and works well for my oily skin!</li>
            <li> I can definitely see why my dermatologist recommended it, especially since I am using it in combination with some very strong harsh creams (prescription creams).</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling clean, soft, and not too dried out (but I still use lotion of course).</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not just a simple, light fragrance; like the bar soap, the fragrance is strong and sweet and cloying enough to make it impossible to use without giving me a headache or making me feel nauseous.</li>
            <li> I am a teenage girl, and I used to have mild acne with bad breakouts fairly often.</li>
            <li> For the price you are playing for this, you might as well get something that will clean without leaving your face feeling like dry, stretched leather.</li>
            <li> My son really likes this cleanser as his general daily wash.</li>
            <li> right to my door whenever I choose, every month, every other month, etc...</li>
            <li> This cleanser really does rinse clean, with no dryness or tight feeling when pat your face dry</li>
            <li> I belong to a particularly sensitive skin, general skin care products do not use.</li>
            <li> it was the original style of cetaphil and was surprised how different and clearly not \\&quot;original style\\&quot; it was when I got it.</li>
            <li> The price is right, more expensive at local pharmacy.  </li>
            <li> However, there was a breaking in period of my skin being really quite uncomfortably dry</li>
            <li> This one works really well for my skin type -- dry except for the T-zone.  </li>
            <li> Received Gentle Skin cleanser instead of Daily Facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> In total, I have been using this cleanser for about two months (if not longer), and I know that my skin hasn&#x27;t been this clear since early adolescence.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t confuse the Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser with the Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser.</li>
            <li> I do, however, notice that every now and then my skin does one of several things either it begins to peel, I can&#x27;t moisturize it enough, or my face burns because the cleanser dries it out so much.</li>
            <li> I recommend the daily facial cleanser over the gentle skin cleanser.</li>
            <li> I accidentally bought the Cetaphil daily facial cleanser instead of the Cetaphil gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m saying is I am not sure this is for super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product as a basic facial cleanser</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for nearly three years now, and those are the only problems.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser, for normal to oily skin, 16.0 -Ounce</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t actually use it to clean my face as I don&#x27;t feel like it cleans my face properly, but I have ordered quite a few of these to use as a shaving lotion for me and my husband.</li>
            <li> the one for normal to dry skin...</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the product or the fact that I&#x27;m currently pregnant</li>
            <li> My face feels clean and pleasantly tight without being overly dry.  </li>
            <li> (of course I have a whole routine and other products in conjunction with this).</li>
            <li> Other products were drying my skin too much.  </li>
            <li> For those who has very dry skin, i would highly recommended this.</li>
            <li> After Cetaphil, not a single one has popped up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Admittedly it is not an overnight miracle, but the only change to my routine including diet, exercise and overall lifestyle has been this product, and I wholly attribue my clear skin to it.     </li>
            <li> My sensitive skin only allows me to use this facial cleanser, and not anyone else&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It is not a pleasant smell either, it&#x27;s just strong.</li>
            <li> It does not dry up my face.  </li>
            <li> I have spent alot of money on cleansers, from the super expensive to the really cheap ones.</li>
            <li> I tried Cetaphil after reading online reviews on [...], and after only 3 months, have seen major improvement (read: not one zit for over 4 wks)</li>
            <li> Since I have been using this cleanser, I have had the occasional small pimple here or there, but those have gone away quickly.</li>
            <li> But, don&#x27;t use another cream or lotion that contains more harsh emulsifiers and emollients that do not add the correct fatty acids or wax esters back to the skin.</li>
            <li> it has totally eliminated the mild to moderate breakouts I&#x27;d been suffering from for the past year.    </li>
            <li> this product does not irritate sensitive skin, does not over dry...</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;d take the extra step of washing my eyes again and still I&#x27;d have to use a Q-Tip to try and gently swipe away at the black smudges afterwards.    </li>
            <li> I think it does a fine job cleaning, though I haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic difference yet.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and have been using this product without fail for nearly 5 years.</li>
            <li> My skin is finally even toned, only occasional outbreaks, not too oily or too dry.</li>
            <li> The soap has helped cut down on some acne and helps remove oil from the face, while leaving you not dried out.  </li>
            <li> No funny additives, no perfumes, no moisturizers to make my face feel greasy after and no harsh cleaners to dry it out.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, the only other product I would recommend outside of this would be one of CeRave&#x27;s facial cleansers.</li>
            <li> Very upsetting and also confusing to consumer to offer the two facial cleanser that seem identical</li>
            <li> I needed something for my face with all of its various problems -- sometimes dry, sometimes oily,</li>
            <li> I use it 2-3 times a day and it has been one of the only cleansers that doesn&#x27;t irritate or totally dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Not only is it easier on the skin, but after you dry your face off you can tell the difference by how refreshed your skin feels.</li>
            <li> so I used Noxzema- worked well but left my skin dry.</li>
            <li> Well, it left my skin dry after i use it.</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser makes my face feel really dry after use.</li>
            <li> It feels too dry and almost like a mild residue was left behind.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my face and neck and the bottles, though more expensive than other cleansers, do last me a long time.</li>
            <li> I was battling serious acne well into my 30s, I&#x27;m now 38 and have it under control by doing exactly what my dermatologist recommends.</li>
            <li> For years, my face had been varying from overly dry, to overly oily with new acne forming everyday.</li>
            <li> Just a little seems to go far.</li>
            <li> Fining cetaphil for normal to oily skin is hard especially in Costco or BJs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using this for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But overall, my face has been very clear and under control, which is hard to accomplish with combination/oily skin.  </li>
            <li> It has only a faint smell, which is not particularly fragrant or chemically...just clean smelling.</li>
            <li> I use it daily, and won&#x27;t switch to any other product even since.</li>
            <li> That was about 6 years ago and on the two occasions that I ventured out and tried other products, I came back to this one because nothing else works as well for me.</li>
            <li> After you dry with a face towel, you will feel the difference on your skin.</li>
            <li> Oil is gone without you face feeling stretch dry.</li>
            <li> it cleans your oily face without making it dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t rub it into my eyelids because it does dry out my eyelids, otherwise it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face one bit.</li>
            <li> Your skin becomes as dry and brittle as it can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it also felt overly dry sometimes in winter.</li>
            <li> dry--</li>
            <li> basically flaky dry patches around my nose and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Product doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling dry</li>
            <li> The bottle said that it won&#x27;t leave your skin dry.</li>
            <li> Very gentle, non irritating.  </li>
            <li> The red areas, especially in the cracks would burn because the skin was raw.  </li>
            <li> I follow with the toner to get deep down to the blackheads.  </li>
            <li> Deep Down Detox Ultra-Cleansing Mud Mask.  </li>
            <li> I used Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser to wash my face at the end of the day and remove my eye makeup, but it usually didn&#x27;t succeed in removing all of my eye makeup.  </li>
            <li> So in the end, yes.. it will cut through your oil and makup, but so will rubbing alcohol (for a lot less money), and to similar effect.</li>
            <li> It cleared the numerous little bumps on my face that I had had all my post-adolescent life.</li>
            <li> wash will help clear up the excess oil that your face has produced through out the day without it being as hard on your skin as acne washes will.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products before and it would often leave my skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li> It got rid of all my acne (save a few occasional pimples), without drying out my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the daily facial cleanser for a week, and already my skin is looking worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of harsh facial cleansers...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit on the expensive side, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Any face wash that provides a deeper cleanse is likely to be harsh.  </li>
            <li> lifelong user of this product.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena cleansers made my face break out badly and burn my eyes a little (although not as much as Clean &amp; Clear did).</li>
            <li> The Daily Facial Cleanser stung my face pretty badly</li>
            <li> It does strip all the oils off my face, but it leaves my face feeling extremely dry, to the point where my skin feels like saran wrap, tight, plastic-like, and rubbery.</li>
            <li> It cleanses and softens and reduces the incidents of break outs and other skin flare ups.   </li>
            <li> He uses stronger products for acne but keeps up his wash with his other products.</li>
            <li> I have known two other people who have had their acne breakouts stop after this stuff.</li>
            <li> It doesnt leave a residue buildup that can happen from a lot of other soap cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Because they occur about once every four months, if that, I&#x27;d still recommend it for people who find the other stuff doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have been using this daily for the past 9 years</li>
            <li> However, I bought this to treat my excessively oily skin, and this only achieves this for a couple of hours after I use it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other cleanser for my face.</li>
            <li> It doesnt foam as much as other cleansers but cleans my skin thorougly without overdrying</li>
            <li> So I switched to Cetaphil after seeing 2 other women bought it at Target.</li>
            <li> I know it works well as a base facial cleanser for individuals with oily and more resistant skin, that is not as acne prone (I say this because there is very little if any salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide in it)</li>
            <li> I use this everyday, usually twice a day, and after using just about every single salicylic acid and benzoyl  peroxide cleanser on the market (and even a few prescription facial creams)</li>
            <li> It also burns my face which is weird because I&#x27;ve used fragranced products with medication that didn&#x27;t burn as much as this cleanser does.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take too long and my skin seemed to adjust and no more stinging.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too drying but keeps the oil down.</li>
            <li> but regardless, I&#x27;d rinse the cleanser off to reveal that I still had black smudgy makeup under my lower eyelids.  </li>
            <li> and it is SO much less drying than even the gentlest hand soaps.</li>
            <li> black heads a problem for years are going away.</li>
            <li> It also burned slightly.</li>
            <li> I have slightly oily skin along w/seborrheic dermatitis....</li>
            <li> Typically, my face doesn&#x27;t have the dry, skin stretched thin feeling though.</li>
            <li> contact dermatitis to pretty much all common preservatives in even expensive products, eczema whenever one little thing touches my skin the wrong way).</li>
            <li> wash will not stop your face from getting break outs because it isn&#x27;t an acne face wash but because acne face washes have salicylic acid in it, they are not ideal for use multiple times a day due to the burning sensation that can occur due to over use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is NOT true.</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel as tight as with the Ivory.</li>
            <li> Contrary to what it says, it does not \\&quot;removes surface oils, dirt and makeup without leaving skin tight or overly dry.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> However, the product description says: \\&quot;Removes surface oils, dirt and makeup without leaving skin tight or overly dry.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> (had very little other makeup, no eye makeup or lipstick).  </li>
            <li> There is a little perfumey smell</li>
            <li> Its affordable and can be used everyday.</li>
            <li> However, I just can&#x27;t get on board with it for a few reasons.  </li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s been a few years</li>
            <li> I try to use subscribe and save to save a few dollars on the subscription.</li>
            <li> Sodium Lauryl Sulfate and Sodium Laureth Sulfate, among others are harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> Your fatty acids are stripped away, your wax esters are stripped away, the squalene, cholesterols, and ceramides can also be stripped away.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 3 years and will continue to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> but so does plain ole lye soap..</li>
            <li> For one, this has a very odd soapy smell that stays with you after you washed.  </li>
            <li> was actually very painful until I washed it off and the skin was left very red and irritated, especially around my lips.</li>
            <li> I was shocked when I got this instead of the cetaphil gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble lately finding a facewash that works.  </li>
            <li> Foaming does NOTHING for cleaning except maybe a small amount by &amp;#34;lifting&amp;#34; dirt so that it can be rinsed away.</li>
            <li> It was too creamy, left my face with a weird film, and did nothing for my oil or acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use it in the morning.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very slippery to put on your face and hard to lather, and almost impossible to rinse off.</li>
            <li> I have very few breakouts</li>
            <li> Out of all cleansers I&#x27;ve tried, this one has been the absolute worst at leaving my skin dry and tight.</li>
            <li> Previously I used Oil of Olay (Clarfiy and Cleanse Foaming Facewash) and just about every Neutragena product for oily skin, but with Neutragena especially, I saw no improvement in my skin :(</li>
            <li> i know cetaphil facial cleanser has been getting a bad rap lately by bloggers,and i get it.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had with it smelled a little weird, nothing too bad but not great either.  </li>
            <li> I got excema really bad and purchased the dry skin version of this</li>
            <li> kids use to blow bubbles, and it even has that thin consistency too.</li>
            <li> product arrives broken.</li>
            <li> Although I like the brand name, the reduced viscosity of this cleanser does not contain the resistence of some seemingly white products spread into the base that I like with an incresesed resistence to flow.</li>
            <li> I will try the other cleanser before I give up on Cetaphil altogether but for now I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that my ex-boyfriend hated the smell of it, but the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, and hey, he&#x27;s an ex</li>
            <li> I have used expensive cleansers from Saks to Over the counter like Walgreens.  </li>
            <li> So, I switched and dealt with my face stinging terribly each time I washed my face (twice daily, but two times in a row when I was washing off make-up to get all the make-up residue off).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nothing is wrong with this product...</li>
            <li> And not too expensive.</li>
            <li> The effect is so bad that I have to moisturize my hands after using it as well as my face because of how uncomfortable my skin becomes.</li>
            <li> In retrospect those harsh detergents were probably contributing to the problem, causing a vicious cycle amoung my wallet, my face and the pharmacy skin care lane.     </li>
            <li> I remember once when I tried a face wash by Aveeno and it broke me out like crazy......</li>
            <li> Skin care doesn&#x27;t have to be expensive or time consuming!</li>
            <li> , this can be bad,</li>
            <li> I get bad razor burn and my dermatologist recommended this.</li>
            <li> Really bad.</li>
            <li> I put it on my face and now my pimples aren&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> Bad decision.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so bad that I stopped washing my face with it after one try</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product caused my skin to burn and itch and break out very badly.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell and consistency of this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> /&gt;i don&#x27;t hate it</li>
            <li> This product has a very bad smell, it smells like those liquid soap bubbles</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and have had very bad acne in my life</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> I hated it!</li>
            <li> However, the smell is horrible, like a bottle of hair spray was poured into it.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My sensitive skin only allows me to use this facial cleanser, and not anyone else&#x27;s. So when I found a bulk package on here, I was so grateful!</li>
            <li> Best face wash out there.</li>
            <li> Love this facial cleanser. Ive been using it for years. Like this one better than the other scent though. Foams well and washes off good. Better than the more fancy more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> It has worked very well in cleansing my face, removing oily dirt without drying out my skin. It is greaseless, leaving skin squeaky clean, literally.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like the gentle skin cleanser. This however has a powerful perfume scent(which is not mentioned) and dries and irritates my skin. Cetaphil needs have stop using almost identical bottles for very different products!</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that I HAVE to have in my bathroom and use it twice daily and have for YEARS!  I swear by this stuff. The clean fresh soft feeling it gives me after I have washed my face is like no other product can achieve.  If I feel grimey mid day, I crave to go wash my face with Cetaphil and I feel so much better.  It is just the best feeling of clean. Now my teenager has to have his own bottle in his bathroom and my husband is now using it.</li>
            <li> This cleanser does good job in cleaning my oily face, and is gentle to the skin. I use it daily, and won&#x27;t switch to any other product even since.</li>
            <li> I used Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser to wash my face at the end of the day and remove my eye makeup, but it usually didn&#x27;t succeed in removing all of my eye makeup.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my mascara or my eyeliner that&#x27;s being so tenacious but regardless, I&#x27;d rinse the cleanser off to reveal that I still had black smudgy makeup under my lower eyelids.  Like the cleanser just pushed the makeup around rather than removing it.  So I&#x27;d take the extra step of washing my eyes again and still I&#x27;d have to use a Q-Tip to try and gently swipe away at the black smudges afterwards.    I also figured, hey, if it&#x27;s not removing my eye makeup, how good of a job is it doing in removing my foundation makeup?    I used this Daily Facial Cleanser for over 2 years, I really did give it more than a fair chance, and just this last month switched to Olay Foaming Face Wash for Sensitive Skin as it removes my eye makeup.  I&#x27;m loyal to the Cetaphil brand, but this Daily cleanser just didn&#x27;t suit my needs.  If you don&#x27;t wear makeup, Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser might work for you.</li>
            <li> Horrible. It HAS fragrance and the smell of it is in fact so strong that it is nauseating. It burns you if you have sensitive skin - was actually very painful until I washed it off and the skin was left very red and irritated, especially around my lips. It did not remove the makeup or dirt on first try. I had to try 3 times in order to wash off my bb cream. (had very little other makeup, no eye makeup or lipstick).  I am very unsatisfied and will stick with gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is an amazing product. Our family has been using it for the longest time. It is not sudsy like ordinary soap which makes it very easy to rinse. You will not spend a lot of time just to remove that slippery feeling when using soaps. After you dry with a face towel, you will feel the difference on your skin. Oil is gone without you face feeling stretch dry. It is very gentle it was recommended before by my wife&#x27;s derma for one of my sons when he had a skin problem.</li>
            <li> This is a great facial cleanser. I am a teenage girl, and I used to have mild acne with bad breakouts fairly often. I tried everything from proactiv to clinique to neutrogena and even natural/organic brands. Nothing worked, and I didn&#x27;t stick to any one product for more than a few months. Then, about one year ago a friend recommended this product, and although I had doubts, I decided to try it. It got rid of all my acne (save a few occasional pimples), without drying out my skin at all. It is incredible and I have been using it ever since, which is probably a record for me (about a year). I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have to use Cetaphil because I have very sensitive skin. I would go to the drug store, Walmart, etc...trying to find it and when I did find it every once in a while it would cost me $14.99 a bottle. Finally I thought about Amazon.com and checked it out. I was very surprised to find the 2 pack bottles for such a low price and best of all I subscribed so I can get it delivered without charge right to my door whenever I choose, every month, every other month, etc...I love Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Just buy it and enjoy!   I have oily/combination skin and it works perfectly for me. It cleanses and softens and reduces the incidents of break outs and other skin flare ups.   I use it with the \\&quot;Clarisonic\\&quot; cleansing brush and the combination is amazing! I now get compliments for my \\&quot;beautiful skin\\&quot; and I&#x27;m over 50!</li>
            <li> The cleanser is really gentle and leaves your face feeling clean but not dry.  I have combination skin and it worked great for me.  The only problem I had with it smelled a little weird, nothing too bad but not great either.  Overall a great face soap.</li>
            <li> Keeps the skin clean. Very light feeling not oily. Doesn&#x27;t seem to strip it. No obvious odor. I used to use Ivory bar and that made the skin feel extra taut and clean. This just seems to take the extra oil and dirt of the day off. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel as tight as with the Ivory. I don&#x27;t know if its due to this or something else but not too many break outs here. Just a little seems to go far.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!! Not only does it leave my face feeling clean (but not dry) it has totally eliminated the mild to moderate breakouts I&#x27;d been suffering from for the past year.    Previously I used Oil of Olay (Clarfiy and Cleanse Foaming Facewash) and just about every Neutragena product for oily skin, but with Neutragena especially, I saw no improvement in my skin :( In retrospect those harsh detergents were probably contributing to the problem, causing a vicious cycle amoung my wallet, my face and the pharmacy skin care lane.     I tried Cetaphil after reading online reviews on [...], and after only 3 months, have seen major improvement (read: not one zit for over 4 wks) Admittedly it is not an overnight miracle, but the only change to my routine including diet, exercise and overall lifestyle has been this product, and I wholly attribue my clear skin to it.     I use this product 2x per day (a.m and p.m), and for my night ritual I use a disposal exfoliating sponge to help remove my makeup, followed by the Oil of Olay Beta Hydroxy night cream. Please note though that I use an eye makeup remover prior to washing my face, (as I would with any other product) and use only a light application of Mineral (powder) foundation, so I cant guarantee that Cetaphil is effective with heavier applications of makeup.    This product is clear, with a smooth consistency and a clean, pleasant scent. It does not lather, rather you massage it onto your skin for it to work its magic. I leave it on my face and neck for 30-45 seconds, then rinse. This cleanser really does rinse clean, with no dryness or tight feeling when pat your face dry, I have even stopped using an astringent/toner, and just go straight to moisturiser.     Altogether I would highly recommend this product, it is super effective yet still gentle, and is very affordably priced, just make sure you get the appropriate formula for your skin type, i.e dry vs oily!!</li>
            <li> I have given this product a fair amount of time to make a final decision on whether or not I really liked it. After reading reviews I purchased it but have not seen amazing results, only more frequent breakouts!! I have used it now for several months! I do like the clean feeling it gives after you use it but, it is VERY temporary and when I go check my face out in the mirror it is already oily again after only a few hours. Yuck! I have had more breakouts since using this product and I will not purchase it again that is for sure!</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it was the original style of cetaphil and was surprised how different and clearly not \\&quot;original style\\&quot; it was when I got it. However, I am glad I made the mistake - traditional cetaphil leaves my combination skin feeling weirdly overmoisturized sometimes, and this remedied that problem. However, there was a breaking in period of my skin being really quite uncomfortably dry but that stopped after about two weeks.</li>
            <li> Fining cetaphil for normal to oily skin is hard especially in Costco or BJs. Costco carries for regular skin. This was a good deal for two 16 oz bottles.</li>
            <li> I went to get a facial peel and later I tried the Cetaphil cleanser and this product cleans better than the peel. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I love the Cetaphil lotions and cremes but this isn&#x27;t doing it for me. This product has a very bad smell, it smells like those liquid soap bubbles kids use to blow bubbles, and it even has that thin consistency too. It&#x27;s very slippery to put on your face and hard to lather, and almost impossible to rinse off. It also burns my face which is weird because I&#x27;ve used fragranced products with medication that didn&#x27;t burn as much as this cleanser does. I can&#x27;t tell if it cleanses well. I hate the smell and consistency of this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: The Cetaphil gentle cleanser is SO much better than this!</li>
            <li> Our daughter has used this for many years, but I finally got smart and went to buying it and having it delivered to my front door</li>
            <li> warning unlike other cetaphil products this is no fragrence free and thus is not for all skin types.  I was shocked when I got this instead of the cetaphil gentle cleanser.  I am use to all other products being fragrence free and safe for all skin types so I used this and got a face full of hives.  Very upsetting and also confusing to consumer to offer the two facial cleanser that seem identical</li>
            <li> Good product. Doesn&#x27;t leave face dry; however, I feel like it really just cleans your face like normal soap and provides no protection against breakouts.</li>
            <li> Also recommended by my dermatologist and I like to use it with my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I found this more drying than the gentle cleanser, which I now use on my face.  But I use this &amp;#34;facial&amp;#34; cleanser to wash my hands and it is SO much less drying than even the gentlest hand soaps.</li>
            <li> love this face wash. my skin is sensitive with ton of break outs. product works wonders if you use it daily</li>
            <li> My search for an effective, yet non-drying, face/neck cleanser is over! I have looked for the better part of three decades for a cleanser that wards off break-outs, and doesn&#x27;t cause my face to peel. I have been using this cleanser for over a year, and it is perfect for my skin, which can get pretty oily in the T area. It has only a faint smell, which is not particularly fragrant or chemically...just clean smelling.</li>
            <li> I once purchased this cleanser by mistake intending to purchase Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, which I have used and loved for years.  What a mistake!  What I mostly did not like about this product was the smell and the tight feeling I felt after use.  It&#x27;s very easy to confuse this product on the shelf with the Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser...so don&#x27;t be fooled.</li>
            <li> Ordered the facial cleanser and Amazon sent me the Gentle Skin Cleanser. Good product, but I need a face wash.</li>
            <li> If you have oily, sensitive skin you will love this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and as I age, the cleaner still does the job. It works on all skin types. Its affordable and can be used everyday.</li>
            <li> I attended a Health Fair 8 years ago.  A dermatologist handed out samples of Cetaphil cleanser.  I spoke to him and he recommends  Cetaphil to his patients for all skin types.  I only wish I had discovered this excellent product 40 years ago.</li>
            <li> I really like Cetaphil as a cleanser, but am sensitive to smells. First thing in the morning as I shower and wash my face with this cleanser I end up having a migraine within 30 minutes that lasts the whole day. It is not a pleasant smell either, it&#x27;s just strong. If you have any sensitivity to smells try something else. I do like the way it cleanses though, and it is very gentle for my mildly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this cleanser after i read so many great comments about it , but it was not like what i expect , i need to wash my face at least 3 times with it so i can remove the oil and makeup .&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t hate it but i don&#x27;t understand why every one like it !</li>
            <li> Performs as promised ... good price.</li>
            <li> Received Gentle Skin cleanser instead of Daily Facial cleanser. Otherwise fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years; I have very sensitive acne prone skin and this works well without overdrying my skin.  The scent is very nice as well, very crisp and clean smelling.</li>
            <li> After using several types of cleansers from Clean &amp; Clear and Neutrogena, the Cetaphil Daily Cleanser (for normal to oily skin) is the only cleanser that has been able to wash off my makeup (Clinique concealer and mascara), clear my skin from breakouts, and NOT burn my eyes. Clean &amp; Clear cleansers used to dry out my face and burn my eyes. Neutrogena cleansers made my face break out badly and burn my eyes a little (although not as much as Clean &amp; Clear did). After using Cetaphil for only a few days, most of my breakouts (from my latest Neutrogena cleanser) were clearing up. After the first full week of using the cleanser, the breakouts were cleared up completely!  In total, I have been using this cleanser for about two months (if not longer), and I know that my skin hasn&#x27;t been this clear since early adolescence. I definitely recommend this product for people who have combination/oily skin like me. Since I have been using this cleanser, I have had the occasional small pimple here or there, but those have gone away quickly. (A dot of anti-acne cream got rid of those.) But overall, my face has been very clear and under control, which is hard to accomplish with combination/oily skin.  **NOTE: If you have sensitive dry to normal skin, you might want to try the Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser (for all skin types), which I&#x27;ve heard works very well, or the Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash, which has very positive Amazon reviews. Please don&#x27;t confuse the Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser with the Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser. If the Daily Cleanser (for normal to oily skin) perfectly cleans my skin, which is on the oily side (especially in the T-zone), then I can imagine how this cleanser, that works well for me, might dry out someone else&#x27;s dry/sensitive skin.**</li>
            <li> My son really likes this cleanser as his general daily wash. He uses stronger products for acne but keeps up his wash with his other products. It&#x27;s not too drying but keeps the oil down.</li>
            <li> this facial wash is really good. it cleans your oily face without making it dry. that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s perfect for daily use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble lately finding a facewash that works.  I have moderately oily skin, and need something that cleanses deep to keep from getting pimples/blackheads.  I&#x27;ve tried Nivea face scrub, but it didn&#x27;t do much except give me tons of pimples.  Cetaphil works very well, and has a very light scent, and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling tight or dry.  I&#x27;ll be using this for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> First of all, my skin is extremely dry (yes, even during the non-winter season) to the point that it is peeling skin.  I have used expensive cleansers from Saks to Over the counter like Walgreens.  I am extremely pleased with Cetaphil because it does not dry my skin afterwards. Also i like because it does not have any scent and is non colored based. The pump also makes it really easy to dispense.    I used this in the morning and evening. For those who has very dry skin, i would highly recommended this. Then apply a very good Organic coconut oil to serve as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The cleaning effect is very good, used after the skin is very smooth, does not irritate the skin feel tight.The taste is too strong.Hope that the price lower.</li>
            <li> I really want to like this product, especially because of the excellent reputation of Cetaphil&#x27;s highly recommended line of dermatological products.  However, I just can&#x27;t get on board with it for a few reasons.  For one, this has a very odd soapy smell that stays with you after you washed.  Another issue I have with this product is that it has methylparaben in it which while not yet proven to cause cancer is an ingredient I try to avoid.  Finally, I just don&#x27;t like how my skin feels after I use this cleanser.  It feels too dry and almost like a mild residue was left behind.  I will try the other cleanser before I give up on Cetaphil altogether but for now I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> best face wash i&#x27;ve used for oily skin</li>
            <li> Product as described.</li>
            <li> After I had my baby I got excema really bad and purchased the dry skin version of this and it worked miracles.  Now that my skin issues are gone and my oily skin is back I switched to this kind.  It seems to leave me feeling a lot dryer than the other kind so I think I need to switch back.  Overall though its super gentle and works really well.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin is unique, so cleansers work differently for different people.  This one works really well for my skin type -- dry except for the T-zone.  My face feels clean and pleasantly tight without being overly dry.  It&#x27;s a good price for a quality cleanser.</li>
            <li> I find all the various reviews amusing. I think people forget that everyone&#x27;s skin is different and reacts differently to products. I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for years, based on my dermatologist&#x27;s recommendation. I was battling serious acne well into my 30s, I&#x27;m now 38 and have it under control by doing exactly what my dermatologist recommends. At first I bought both cleansers, the Gentle Cleanser and the Daily Facial Cleanser. The Daily Facial Cleanser stung my face pretty badly (yes, that is this one), so I used the Gentle Cleanser instead. When I returned to my dermatologist, I still needed help. I asked if it made a different which one of these products I use, and she said ABSOLUTELY YES, only use the Daily Facial Cleanser if I want to control my acne. So, I switched and dealt with my face stinging terribly each time I washed my face (twice daily, but two times in a row when I was washing off make-up to get all the make-up residue off). It didn&#x27;t take too long and my skin seemed to adjust and no more stinging. I think the problem was my skin, NOT the cleanser. The cleanser actually helped to HEAL that problem. Now it&#x27;s been a few years and it&#x27;s so gentle on my skin. My acne is very much controlled (of course I have a whole routine and other products in conjunction with this). People have mentioned an overwhelming scent.....I actually would have to go upstairs and smell it to even see if they&#x27;re right! It&#x27;s certainly NOT unpleasant, and like I said, I can&#x27;t even tell you if it has a scent or not and I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 years! It definitely doesn&#x27;t linger on your face or hands either. My face feels great using this twice daily. I don&#x27;t rub it into my eyelids because it does dry out my eyelids, otherwise it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face one bit. GREAT product.</li>
            <li> Between the two products, I prefer the gentle skin cleanser much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the two products have the same design and I accidently picked up the regular cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have been using Cetaphil for years at the recommendation of a great dermatologist!  I found a two pack on amazon for much cheaper than two bottles would have been at Target, CVS, or the grocery store!  I highly recommend Cetaphil and this deal.  I rarely have breakouts and it&#x27;s a gentle cleanser while still having the foaming action.  It never dries my skin out and always cleans it very well.</li>
            <li> Had an allergic reaction</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and have been using this product without fail for nearly 5 years. I use it in the shower atleast once a day and moisturize afterwards. My skins likes it. I love it because its relatively cheap and very consistent. Gentle on skin, virtually no odor, and has a lockable pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this if you&#x27;re on the fence.</li>
            <li> An old favorite and works well, as does every Cetaphil product/</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin. It seemed like everything I tried would just make me break out until I tried this product. Now, my skin stays clear and doesn&#x27;t get oily throughout the day</li>
            <li> I needed something for my face with all of its various problems -- sometimes dry, sometimes oily, blah blah, you name it. This is odorless. It goes on and comes off and leaves my face feeling clean. It has a pump. What else could you ask for? I have ordered it over and over.</li>
            <li> Perfect gentle face cleanser recommended by my dermatologist. I use it 2X a day and add on a salicylic acid wash when my acne flairs up.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cleanser that I have tried so far. It also has a fresh and clean feeling after use .</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. The version labeled &#x27;gentle cleanser&#x27; never feels like it does a very good job. This product removes oil from your skin without drying it out too much.&lt;br /&gt;For the money, this is a good purchase.</li>
            <li> It smells delicious.  It does not dry up my face.  It feels good after use.  One of the best face soaps I have tried.</li>
            <li> I started using this face wash after being recommended by roommates and friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wash will not stop your face from getting break outs because it isn&#x27;t an acne face wash but because acne face washes have salicylic acid in it, they are not ideal for use multiple times a day due to the burning sensation that can occur due to over use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wash will help clear up the excess oil that your face has produced through out the day without it being as hard on your skin as acne washes will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this face wash twice a day and also use a scrub wash for a deeper wash that this face wash doesn&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li> I recently had to go to the dermatologist for &amp;#34;adult acne.&amp;#34; He put me on a prescribed cream and antibiotic.  Interestingly enough, he recommended this as a cleanser.  I have known two other people who have had their acne breakouts stop after this stuff. So after using it for a couple days, I can see why. Its very gentle on the skin and leaves the skin feeling soft.  It doesnt leave a residue buildup that can happen from a lot of other soap cleanser.  I can definitely see why my dermatologist recommended it, especially since I am using it in combination with some very strong harsh creams (prescription creams). I definitely recommend this as a good starting point to treating and preventing acne.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser, as it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  I use it 2-3 times a day and it has been one of the only cleansers that doesn&#x27;t irritate or totally dry out my skin. I use it on my face and neck and the bottles, though more expensive than other cleansers, do last me a long time. I try to use subscribe and save to save a few dollars on the subscription.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my teenage daughter to see if it will help with her complexion issues....bumps and such...cross your fingers!!</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is part of my daily facial routine.  It is mild facial cleanser that does not irritate the skin and keeps my face clean all day.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Cetaphil. I have extremely sensitive skin and have been using Cetaphil faithfully for over 10 years. I like it so much that I keep one bottle on my bathroom counter and another in the shower. I preciously guard travel-size bottles I got from my dermatologist years ago so that I can take Cetaphil with me when I travel. I buy Cetaphil through Amazon because it&#x27;s a bit cheaper than in the stores and is a great way to bump up to free shipping on other items. Come the apocalypse, I&#x27;ll be ready with my supply of three or four bottles of Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> I use this for shaving.  and it works amazingly.  I don&#x27;t actually use it to clean my face as I don&#x27;t feel like it cleans my face properly, but I have ordered quite a few of these to use as a shaving lotion for me and my husband.</li>
            <li> Most cleansers that have &amp;#34;surfactants&amp;#34; and certain &amp;#34;emulsifiers&amp;#34; will be harsh on the skin. Sodium Lauryl Sulfate and Sodium Laureth Sulfate, among others are harsh on the skin. Why? Because they work as intended!! They are designed to mix with dirt and oils, attach to those oils, and then use water to help strip the oils away. So yes, they do clean your skin, but they also strip away the natural sebum that your skin produces to keep your skin moist, soft and supple. Your fatty acids are stripped away, your wax esters are stripped away, the squalene, cholesterols, and ceramides can also be stripped away. Your skin becomes as dry and brittle as it can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, this can be bad, IF....you do not add a moisturizer of some type AFTER washing yourself clean. But, don&#x27;t use another cream or lotion that contains more harsh emulsifiers and emollients that do not add the correct fatty acids or wax esters back to the skin. Read your labels carefully and choose the best moisturizing lotion to add to your skin after cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me make one rumor go away really quick. It is an absolute MYTH that &amp;#34;foaming&amp;#34; means &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34;. This is NOT true. Foaming does NOTHING for cleaning except maybe a small amount by &amp;#34;lifting&amp;#34; dirt so that it can be rinsed away. It is the surfactants such as cocamidopropyl betaine that creates foaming. And why do cosmetic chemists do this? Because consumer perception is that &amp;#34;foaming&amp;#34; means cleaning! But, the real cleansing is coming from the surfactants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium laureth sulfate, and many others, that product little to no foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing is wrong with this product... it works as intended. However, for folks with acne prone skin, I recommend looking for a cleanser that is mild, gentle, and retains skin moisture.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best cleansers for all skin types. It is not expensive and a dermatologist must if you see one they will all tell you how good it is. I have combination skin and have had very bad acne in my life this is great to use with prescriptions because it will not over dry.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this all the time and would not be without it.  She is quite satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I like the cleanser. It does work well. I do, however, notice that every now and then my skin does one of several things either it begins to peel, I can&#x27;t moisturize it enough, or my face burns because the cleanser dries it out so much. Typically, my face doesn&#x27;t have the dry, skin stretched thin feeling though. During those instances, I cut back on the daily routine to let my face rest a bit. I&#x27;ve been using this for nearly three years now, and those are the only problems. Because they occur about once every four months, if that, I&#x27;d still recommend it for people who find the other stuff doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> i use it every day and my skin feels well. i love the price and i will recommend it to my friend</li>
            <li> I have the same review for this that I have for the Cetaphil Anti-bac bar cleanser: WHY did Cetaphil ruin a perfectly good, frag-free cleanser by adding fragrance to it? I KNOW that when this first came out it had no fragrance. I know that because I went out and bought it ASAP, thrilled that Cetaphil was finally acknowledging customers with oily skin. And it&#x27;s not just a simple, light fragrance; like the bar soap, the fragrance is strong and sweet and cloying enough to make it impossible to use without giving me a headache or making me feel nauseous. WHY, Cetaphil, WHY?????</li>
            <li> H have difficult-to-control oily skin I hear everyone rave about Cetaphil facial cleansers, so a few years ago I went out an purchased the Gentle Cleanser. I hated it! It was too creamy, left my face with a weird film, and did nothing for my oil or acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I discovered the normal to oily skin version and I must say, this is a HUGE improvement. This leaves my face feeling squeaky clean, but does not dry it out. I&#x27;m currently using a prescription retinoid cream (which can cause some dryness and flaking) but this cleanser still does not irritate those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a great value for the price. I&#x27;ve been using my same 16 ounce bottle for months. Definitely recommended for those with oily and acne-prone skin like me. If you&#x27;ve got dry skin, the Gentle Cleanser is probably better suited for you.</li>
            <li> Hi. I have oily skin and this works without leaving a film. Doesn&#x27;t suds up, so it almost doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything, but works great. Easy to rinse off</li>
            <li> The product is perfect but the shipping is not so good.&lt;br /&gt;My product arrives broken.</li>
            <li> I purchased Cetaphil for normal to oily skin on the whim to see if it was any different from their Gentle Skin Cleanser line. I have the most polar combination skin possible, my cheeks generally are extremely dry whereas my forehead becomes very oily. All these problems are compounded by my dermatologist&#x27;s retinoid prescriptions for controlling my acne, I end up with flaky and irritated skin on top of my oil and dryness issues; what a pain!    If you are cursed with skin like mine, I would not recommend this cleanser. Contrary to what it says, it does not \\&quot;removes surface oils, dirt and makeup without leaving skin tight or overly dry.\\&quot; It does strip all the oils off my face, but it leaves my face feeling extremely dry, to the point where my skin feels like saran wrap, tight, plastic-like, and rubbery. In addition, the cleanser has an extremely powerful fragrance that I do not enjoy and really goes against Cetaphil&#x27;s other products, which they advertise as being fragrance free for those with sensitive skin.    I will stick with Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, as it is far more moisturizing, fragrance-free, and also removes facial oils.</li>
            <li> I give this product two stars instead of one because it does cut through oil, dirt, and grime. However, the product description says: \\&quot;Removes surface oils, dirt and makeup without leaving skin tight or overly dry.\\&quot; And this is a lie. Out of all cleansers I&#x27;ve tried, this one has been the absolute worst at leaving my skin dry and tight. The effect is so bad that I have to moisturize my hands after using it as well as my face because of how uncomfortable my skin becomes. And don&#x27;t even think about using it in the shower as it will suck the moisture right out of anything it touches and you&#x27;ll have to be slathering on lotion all over your body.     So in the end, yes.. it will cut through your oil and makup, but so will rubbing alcohol (for a lot less money), and to similar effect. For the price you are playing for this, you might as well get something that will clean without leaving your face feeling like dry, stretched leather.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have been using it for over a year now, and my skin is as clear as can be. I have oil prone skin, and I have even noticed a difference in that area too. My skin is not as oily, this product is not drying at all, and just works wonders on my skin. I have very few breakouts and I am currently using this product in conjunction with my Clarisonic. I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Best cleanser there is. Period. Wish they were available over the counter in Europe.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this cleanser!!! I have oily skin and this works great at getting rid of the extra oil but does not make it overtly dry. It dosent work that great at removing makeup though, for make up its better to use a makeup remover separately and then use this cleanser.</li>
            <li> The best facial cleanser on the market for all types of skin.</li>
            <li> One of the best facial cleanser available. I have been using this daily for the past 9 years and I maybe got 5 pimples in that time span. I&#x27;ve tried other products before and it would often leave my skin feeling dry. I am a pharmacist and I recommend this to my customers every time they ask for a facial cleanser. The size is perfect as it&#x27;ll last me at least 4 months of daily use until I need to purchase another. I would stick with the brand name version even if it does cost a little more, but I have tried the store-brand version of this and it doesn&#x27;t even compare.</li>
            <li> For maybe 10 years of my life, I used the Clinique 3 step process and my skin was never the greatest.  Finally, my dermatologist gave me a sample of Cetaphil, which has absolutely changed my life.  It is extremely gentle on the skin, but strong enough to remove all of that makeup that I wear every day.  Who needs those fancy designer face washes? The only downside is that my ex-boyfriend hated the smell of it, but the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all, and hey, he&#x27;s an ex so who cares ;)</li>
            <li> This is the best facial product on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using regular hand soap for my face, until a friend told me that regular soap is not designed for your face, shouldn&#x27;t be used as face soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best product in the face soap category, men and women alike use it. Amazon has it economically priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My black heads a problem for years are going away.</li>
            <li> I recommend the daily facial cleanser over the gentle skin cleanser. The latter leaves a bit of soapy residue. This daily facial cleanser is perfect - gets off any dirt and oil, but doesn&#x27;t leave you dry. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and will probably never stop.</li>
            <li> great for my combination skin</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser!  It&#x27;s really helped to gently clear my acne prone skin. Also love the large bottles and fast shipping. Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the product or the fact that I&#x27;m currently pregnant but although I like the product, my skin is drier since I started using it.</li>
            <li> When I started using Cetaphil, my skin was overly sensitive. It burned and turned beat red while using this and right after using it and made my eyes water. I do have oily skin so I knew I needed to keep using this if I wanted my acne to go away. Even though I used this habitually for nearly two years, I still kept getting acne.  After washing my face,my skin still felt oily (especially in summer) it also felt overly dry sometimes in winter. I realize now I should have not been using it in the eye area to remove eye makeup, but I did and my eye lashes flaked out when using this.    I know it works well as a base facial cleanser for individuals with oily and more resistant skin, that is not as acne prone (I say this because there is very little if any salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide in it) but it did not work for me. I give this cleanser a two star and not a one because I believed it helped de-sensitize my overly sensitive skin. Now I can use more potent products with out having my skin flake off and burn.</li>
            <li> I have never found that perfect product that my skin jives well with. I read about cetaphil and most people talk about it like it is the 2nd coming of cleansers. Unfortunately this product caused my skin to burn and itch and break out very badly. After 3 days my nose feels like it has lizard scales and my chin and cheeks are a minefield of pimples. I have no idea how to fix the damage that this has caused. I used my regular product today and my skin still hurts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What i&#x27;m saying is I am not sure this is for super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I accidentally bought the Cetaphil daily facial cleanser instead of the Cetaphil gentle cleanser. There&#x27;s a huge difference between the two products. The daily facial cleanser is much harsher, more soap-like, and really dries out my skin. I&#x27;ve only had the daily facial cleanser for a week, and already my skin is looking worse. When someone recommends Cetaphil, they are most likely talking about the gentle skin cleanser. I&#x27;ve been using that product for over 15 years, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it (I&#x27;m not too happy with Cetaphil for coming out with a very different product in an almost-identical looking package though).</li>
            <li> This is a great product; my skin feels wonderfully clean and smooth when I use it. However, I bought this to treat my excessively oily skin, and this only achieves this for a couple of hours after I use it.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Been using it for years.</li>
            <li> It is gentle yet effective on oily prone skin types and it smells great. I highly recommend this product as a basic facial cleanser</li>
            <li> Our dermatologist recommended this. It cleans and has a pleasant smell.  It took some adjustment for me though, because I am so used to the chemical cleaners that strip your skin. Almost all of my family is using it now. So far so good. Our sensitive skin is appreciative of the gentleness in this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Smells great, very fresh and clean, ( I am big on scents).  Been using this product for over 10 years, it is the best over the counter facial wash!  Love it!</li>
            <li> This face wash is amazing. It feels good on the face, and after rinsing off my skin feels fresh. For years, my face had been varying from overly dry, to overly oily with new acne forming everyday. I also have larger pores around nose, and reddened areas of face. I feel like I&#x27;ve tried every face wash and lotions, with some experimenting with natural remedies like honey, baking soda, and lemon juice. I finally found a good combination using Cetaphil, with a little coconut oil. Perfect. My skin is finally even toned, only occasional outbreaks, not too oily or too dry. I have sensitive skin, but decided to start out with the daily facial cleanser instead of the sensitive skin cetaphil, and it has worked perfectly. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I have used this face soap for years and it works flawlessly.  There is a little perfumey smell but it&#x27;s not that strong.  Ideally I&#x27;d like this soap without any perfume but it works great.  I like it better than Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser, which is also good.</li>
            <li> To those of you out there with sensitive skin, do yourself a favor and get the CETAPHIL GENTLE CLEANSER-FOR ALL SKIN TYPES instead. While I&#x27;m sure this product might work for many of you, I personally prefer the gentle cleanser over this. Not only is it easier on the skin, but after you dry your face off you can tell the difference by how refreshed your skin feels. I would also recommend the Cetaphil Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating lotion as well. I prefer this over the fragrance free version. Anyways, just my two cents. I threw away some good money figuring out the right combo for my face so hopefully this will help you guys/girls out.</li>
            <li> I belong to a particularly sensitive skin, general skin care products do not use.Fully applicable to the use of this cleanser, mild allergy does not appear to wash quite clean taste is Fen, but feel that the cleaning ability is not strong</li>
            <li> Strong frangrance smell! The regular cleanser is much better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of harsh facial cleansers... Stuff with benzoyl peroxide or salicyclic acid... Without any burning or redness. But as soon as I tried this \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; stuff my face felt like it was on fire... I now have dried out red splotches on my face and its been more than a day. Reading online it seems some people are allergic to something in this stuff, and I am probably one of those people. Bottle is in the trash. So if this burns your skin, don&#x27;t even try using it again!</li>
            <li> At the age of 25 I&#x27;m still struggling with moderate acne but I love the improvements Cetaphil has done on my face. I used to use soap based products that would leave my skin overly dry-- encouraging my skin to overproduce oil to compensate but Cetaphil cleans gently</li>
            <li> This cleanser cleans my skin without drying it. I&#x27;ve used this product for almost 10 years. At one point, it was out of stock at Target for about a week. I can&#x27;t live without it. So, I subscribe it to Amazon. :) I have 1 bottle at the sink to cleanse face twice daily and 1 bottle in my shower to use instead for body wash for the gym days to prevent any clogged pores on my back.</li>
            <li> I thought that I would be getting a two pack of the same cleanser, however, it was came packed with one cleanser and one lotion.  Returned to Amazon for credit with no problem except my time. Otherwise the cleanser is a great product, we have been using it for years, non irritating, no lingering odor.</li>
            <li> this has been my must have facial cleanser. it does its &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34; job but in a very gentle way -- which is what my sensitive acne-prone skin needs!</li>
            <li> I was recommended Cetaphil by one of my close colleague. This has been very effective in keep my screen healthy.</li>
            <li> I was never a fan of cetaphil...the one for normal to dry skin...it left my skin feeling sticky and unclean. Then I found the version for normal to oily skin....and what a difference! It smells great, removes make up, leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed with no dryness. I also use if for my intimate areas.  It&#x27;s a bit on the expensive side, but it&#x27;s worth it. I have greasy skin and I&#x27;ve tried many cleansers over the years (channel, lancome, nivea, aveeno, neutrogena (that one dries my skin so much it feels like it&#x27;s going to fall off)...this is by a long shot way superior to any of these.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, gentle and not perfumed. This is a great product that I will recommend to anyone who asks for a recommendation.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Cetaphil is recommended by dermatologists for a reason. Most of them aren&#x27;t even paid to push it! I hope. Anyway, the only other product I would recommend outside of this would be one of CeRave&#x27;s facial cleansers. That&#x27;s another company that seems to know what it&#x27;s doing. Skin care doesn&#x27;t have to be expensive or time consuming!</li>
            <li> I read some good reviews about Cetaphil, and gave it a shot.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 1-2 years now, and have never had better skin.  Before Cetaphil came into my life, I never had an acne problem, but I did have an occasional zit or two (or 3).  After Cetaphil, not a single one has popped up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Real person, Leo, NY</li>
            <li> I have been using this wash for years and it has helped great with my acne prone skin and providing that fresh clean feelin. Not only cleans but removes make-up as well which is a plus. I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Has a nice subtle scent and works well for my oily skin! It was a great deal for two 16oz bottles compared to prices in the store.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my face and I use it every time I hop in the shower.  I play a lot of sports so the oils and sweat build up after I use this I feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> Very mild on my skin and gets it clean. I wish it cleaned off eye makeup better, but great otherwise.</li>
            <li> My go to face cleanser, keeps me acne free , feels clean coming off.</li>
            <li> Folks,&lt;br /&gt;This Cetaphil product is produces a fantastic clean without over drying. Skin feels tight fresh and ready to go. Great price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I had went through multiple cleanser in my life.With my acne sice age 15 I had problems with finding the right one.This is my best one,delicate cleans well .I am happy that amazon carries it because I will keep reordering forever ! :)</li>
            <li> this product does not irritate sensitive skin, does not over dry... its basically the best cleanser you can buy for the price!</li>
            <li> From my experience with the product, it had no impact on cleansing my normal-skinned face and the residue and odor was unacceptable. It also burned slightly. Would not order again, but your experience might differ based on your unique skin.</li>
            <li> very convenient with the pump</li>
            <li> After seeing this product highly reviewed in a magazine, I thought I would give it a try.  I think it does a fine job cleaning, though I haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic difference yet. However, the smell is horrible, like a bottle of hair spray was poured into it.  The ingredients say \\&quot;masking fragrance\\&quot;. What the heck is it masking??  Gross.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this and she uses it in her clinic.  This is a gentle yet effective cleanser. And not too expensive.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cleanser for combination skin I have used.  Cleans quickly and leaves no residue.  I don&#x27;t use any other cleanser for my face.</li>
            <li> It as Good product and a Good quality according WITH the price given in the web. The package Will be better.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin clean and healthy, can&#x27;t ask for much more than that from soap. Very good product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> i swear by this cleanser. I get bad razor burn and my dermatologist recommended this. works very well and not over drying.</li>
            <li> I have a good complexion, and would consider my skin to be normal.  Sometimes I think it&#x27;s oily, but I&#x27;m probably being too critical, so I&#x27;ll accept having &amp;#34;Normal&amp;#34; skin.  This face wash was recommended to me because I was looking for one without a certain chemical (I can&#x27;t remember which one anymore, oh well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first reaction was, &amp;#34;oh this is just a run of the mill face wash and won&#x27;t be anything special&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s exactly what makes it so great.  No funny additives, no perfumes, no moisturizers to make my face feel greasy after and no harsh cleaners to dry it out.  This is a really gentle face wash that just cleans my face like it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s another product in a similar bottle - the &amp;#34;Gentle Face Wash&amp;#34; which is a different product.  I tried that one, and found it to leave a greasy residue without feeling as clean as this one leaves me.</li>
            <li> I use the liquid on my face at night before I go to bed. I have the Cetaphil bars of soap to use in the shower each morning. When I travel I take them both with me. If I can&#x27;t rinse it off real well, no problem.</li>
            <li> I really like what this cleanser does for my skin. I have spent alot of money on cleansers, from the super expensive to the really cheap ones. I am always looking for the next best thing. I never thought this non  scented simple cleanser would keep my skin balanced. It really works for me and I love it even more with my Clarisonic Cleanser.It doesnt foam as much as other cleansers but cleans my skin thorougly without overdrying</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never switch to another face wash brand. Great value for the size. My normal skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I have slightly oily skin along w/seborrheic dermatitis....basically flaky dry patches around my nose and eyebrows. I use a generic version of a sonic facial brush and use this cleanser with that brush. It is gentle yet gets out the dirt and grime. Occasionally I switch back to a soap formulated for those with seborrheic dermatitis, a 2 percent Pyrithione zinc soap. This washing system along w the cetaphil moisturizer and my face has been so smooth, calm and happy.</li>
            <li> Did it get to my house at a promised time?  Yes.  Did i think it was a fair price?  I am on the fense about that one.  Is it working?  I would like to use it longer than a week to decide that.</li>
            <li> I love how the cleanser washes off clean easily after using. Plus, my overly sensitive skin doesn&#x27;t have the after-cleansing tightness and is squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Cetaphil cleanser, followed by Alba Hibiscus toner, and finish with the Cetaphil daily facial moisturizer. I have never seen my skin so radiant nor felt it so soft and smooth! Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The order only came in 2- 16 oz size,  but I love this product. Been using this product for years.</li>
            <li> It cleared the numerous little bumps on my face that I had had all my post-adolescent life. I use it am and pm, along with acne meds Finecea (pm), and clindamycin (am). Simple, cheap and effective.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is great for those who have sensitive, oily skin.  I have both and am prone to severe hormonal breakouts.  It won&#x27;t over dry causing your skin to produce more oil.  It is very mild and there is nothing noteworthy about the smell.  It&#x27;s a very gentle, effective cleanser for everyday use.  It does not foam or get overly sudsy--more like a gel.  I find that I have to use a lot of it.  The only downside is that it is not a deep cleanser.  Any face wash that provides a deeper cleanse is likely to be harsh.  For a deeper clean, follow up with a gentle toner.  I like the Simple brand toner.  I like to use very warm water when washing my face to allow my pores to open.  I follow with the toner to get deep down to the blackheads.  I sometimes follow with a mud mask for an even deeper clean. I like Formula 10.0.6 Deep Down Detox Ultra-Cleansing Mud Mask.  If you use Cetaphil in conjunction with a toner and a nightly retinol, it can really help you fight breakouts.</li>
            <li> Best characteristics of this cleanser - awesome price, easy to find, soft soapy scent, gentle on facial skin. One pump dispenses the perfect amount and the bottle lasts months with daily use. A dermatologist recommended \\&quot;skimping\\&quot; on facial cleanser if I were looking for a cost savings opportunity - a cleanser is in contact with the skin for such a short time she recommended splurging on another product with longer wear time i.e. night cream.</li>
            <li> Found these on Amazon.........again for the best price I could find (no surprise to me!).  Have used this for several years and it works great for me.  Was recommended by my dermotologist so have used it ever since.  Product doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin but you can feel the clean feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> We have sensitive skin and the cetaphil works well to clean your face with out causing any irration or anything. It leaves my skin feeling soft and fresh!</li>
            <li> Recommended by my Dermatologis years ago and still love love this product!!  Super great at removing makeup, yet very gentle on my skin.  I have tried the Gentle Cleanser and didn&#x27;t like that one at all.  This Daily Cleanser is the BEST!  I will never use anything again.  I&#x27;m 36 and have been using this cleanser for 3 years.  Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definately recommend this to EVERYONE!!  Very gentle, non irritating.  I&#x27;m starting my kids on it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great packaging as always.  I am a repeat customer and have ordered this same product from this same company multiple times, and will keep ordering from them.  Very happy customer here.</li>
            <li> My daughter recommended this.  I have an oily complexion and I were glasses.  Normal soap never seems to quite get my face totally clean.  This stuff is great.  I wish I had known about it years ago.  I strongly recommend it, especially for anyone with an oily complexion.  I also were a BiPap mask.  I now get up during the night, wash my face, and change masks.  I maintain a better seal throughout the entire night.</li>
            <li> i know cetaphil facial cleanser has been getting a bad rap lately by bloggers,and i get it. it has a lot of chemical sounding products in it. but it works for me and i have super super sensitive skin (allergic to everything, contact dermatitis to pretty much all common preservatives in even expensive products, eczema whenever one little thing touches my skin the wrong way). i tried switching to &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; products and they just irritate my skin even more. lifelong user of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using cetaphil facial cleanser for more than 10 years.I couldn&#x27;t find anything better than this cetaphil cleanser. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> I guess you could say I have combination skin (like most other people in the world). This is the best cleanser I have ever used on my face. I remember once when I tried a face wash by Aveeno and it broke me out like crazy...... my friend who worked in a dermatologist&#x27;s office recommended this to me and those bumps cleared up within 2 days. That was about 6 years ago and on the two occasions that I ventured out and tried other products, I came back to this one because nothing else works as well for me.</li>
            <li> this item was exactly as pictured and described it was of very good quality, better price.  i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought the big package. The shipment fee was almost more than the product. The most important thing is that the item isn&#x27;t so good as they said.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of this product very smooth. has no lathering effect so you don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s cleaning until you wash off the cleanser and face feels clean. Makeup should be taken off with makeup remover before cleaning.</li>
            <li> Very good product and liked it</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended Cetaphil products to me a number of years ago.  The cleanser does wash off easily and thoroughly and leaves my skin feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> I used to have pimples. Really bad. But then I discovered this revolutionary product. I put it on my face and now my pimples aren&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> Very gentle and the smell is amazing!!  I love this cleanser!!</li>
            <li> This is always highly recommended in magazines as a gentle and effective skin cleanser.  My own aesthetician recommended it to me in the evenings when I was experiencing redness and acne.  My complaint at that time was that I did not feel it was effective enough and often had to follow-up with astringent to remove all my make-up.  She suggested spending a little more time rubbing it in and washing it off, which I do.  I still follow-up with astringent sometimes, but I do feel like i get most off with the Cetaphil.  I don&#x27;t usually use it in the morning.  I followed my aesthetician&#x27;s advice and use something with glycolic acid in it for a little more exfoliation.  However, something I read in a magazine recently makes me wonder if I even need to wash my face at all in the morning...Oh yeah, and the price on this is great.  It is in line with other products of this nature and available everywhere.</li>
            <li> This is a large quanity of good cleanser and the dispenser and bottle appear to be high quality.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser, for normal to oily skin, 16.0 -Ounce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good.Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday, usually twice a day, and after using just about every single salicylic acid and benzoyl  peroxide cleanser on the market (and even a few prescription facial creams) nothing works quite as well as Cetaphil.  It completely cleans the days off of my face with a very light fresh scent (which to me kind of smells like Johnson &amp; Johnson baby shampoo, the one that says no more tears, but maybe that&#x27;s just me) yet doesn&#x27;t dry my skin. I have used this product for 3 years and will continue to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> A fantastic facial cleaner and removes makeup as well.  Its non drying and makes my skin  feel really clean  and has a pleasant scent</li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser for 5+ years and love it.  My dermatologist recommended this cleanser specifically.  I recommend this product to family/friends.</li>
            <li> it works great for me. Especially during summer great product for oily skin. I use it twice daily and in a week, I can notice the difference.</li>
            <li> Great daily facial cleanser, it is gentle enough for normal skin. Makes my face feel smooth and look great. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> One of those products you never change up.</li>
            <li> Although I like the brand name, the reduced viscosity of this cleanser does not contain the resistence of some seemingly white products spread into the base that I like with an incresesed resistence to flow. It gets a good grade because it does what I what I want it to do with regard to softcly cleaning my face, but I am still in search of the better product that I have had experience with.</li>
            <li> My eye lids and skin around my eyes turned very red about two years ago and I tried all kinds of gentle soaps and gentle shampoos with no luck.  The skin would get flaky and peal off.  The red areas, especially in the cracks would burn because the skin was raw.  I saw several dermatologists the last two years and the one I saw last fall suggested that I stop using soap and shampoo on my head and switch to Cedaphil facial cleaner.  She also suggested using cortisone cream on the red areas if it flares up.  I&#x27;ve had this problem for several years and within one week my skin cleared up and the problem went away.  I&#x27;m going to try the gentle skin cleaner and see if it works too.</li>
            <li> Good soap. Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling dry</li>
            <li> I had bought a different Cetaphil product in the past which I remember was very strong for my skin, however when this one came out it stated would be &amp;#34;easier on the skin&amp;#34;. I could only use it once, after which I felt my skin was peeling from dryness. I&#x27;ll give this product to one of my kids, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s gonna work for them and I just have a very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried various facial cleansers over the years (in various price ranges) and I absolutely love this one! It leaves my skin feeling clean, soft, and not too dried out (but I still use lotion of course). And the price is right!</li>
            <li> Excellent light soap that I use every morning for my face.  The soap has helped cut down on some acne and helps remove oil from the face, while leaving you not dried out.  Other products were drying my skin too much.  This one is a nice balance between mild and oil removing.</li>
            <li> perfect daily face cleanser - my staple</li>
            <li> great product to remove oil from the face</li>
            <li> I bought the hype about this cleanser last year. It is ranked in some surveys as one of the best facial cleansers available. I agree if you don&#x27;t need your eyes. It  burns and irritates and  leaves dry eyes even more of a nuisance. yes it cleans but so does plain ole lye soap.. And- no way does it come close to the effectiveness and gentleness of Purity Made Simple, its closest rival in that series of rankings.</li>
            <li> I have occasional acne so I used Noxzema- worked well but left my skin dry. So I switched to Cetaphil after seeing 2 other women bought it at Target. the texture is clear gel so it feels great when I apply it to my face. The smell is pretty good too! The bottle said that it won&#x27;t leave your skin dry. Well, it left my skin dry after i use it. So I often have to use Cerave Facial Moisturizing Lotion Pm afterwards. Btw, Cerave PM is magic, so is Cerave AM [...]</li>
            <li> I read a variety of reviews that recommended this as a good product for sensitive skin. While it is economical and likely to last for quite a while, I did find it to be fairly drying. This is probably a good product for someone on the more \\&quot;oily\\&quot; side of \\&quot;normal to oily skin\\&quot; spectrum.</li>
            <li> Ordered this product on dermatologist&#x27;s orders.  Works well. Face feels clean and not overly dry.  The price is right, more expensive at local pharmacy.  Product received was same as identified by seller.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and just as described.</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser makes my face feel really dry after use. Makes me think it would promote age wrinkles with continued use. Tossed. Bad decision. Granted, it removes oils... perhaps too well.</li>
            <li> I just love Cetaphil gentle cleanser and bought this one by mistake.  It works and that&#x27;s why I gave it 2 stars but it is so STRONG smelling that I simply can not use it.  I do not have a problem with scents or perfume but this is over powering.  It&#x27;s so bad that I stopped washing my face with it after one try and I cant even wash my hands with it as the smell creeps into my mouth and nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you have no sense of smell do not buy this.</li>
    </ol>
