    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>very good!</li>
            <li>and this is what I find works best for those days.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser is perfect for both situations.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with all of the Cetaphil products which I have tried.</li>
            <li>Nothing seem to work for me, but this stuff how ever it is pronounced is the best damn product ever.</li>
            <li>As you can guess, I was incredibly bewildered, as this was supposed to be an excellent face soap.</li>
            <li>I wash my face morning and night, and every time I wash it, I also use toner and face moisturizer to follow (I&#x27;ve been using this technique for months with great results).</li>
            <li>Great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>but I am so happy i didnt pass by it.</li>
            <li>but it does a great job of removing makeup excepting, of course, that pesky waterproof stuff that requires days of scrubbing to remove all remnants.  </li>
            <li>GREAT product.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer is amazing!</li>
            <li>As if to insure we&#x27;d buy it based on the sample being so good....</li>
            <li>However it is a good cleanser</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t remember how I stumbled onto this product, but am very glad I did.  </li>
            <li>The best face wash I have had for years, really does the job!</li>
            <li>Whether I buy it at CVS or online, the screw top does not pop up!  </li>
            <li>It changed the texture of my skin (smoother, more even) and is a good deal easier to use since it doesn&#x27;t lather.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t burn or cause any kind of discomfort.</li>
            <li>The kind I buy is the Normal/Oily skin.  </li>
            <li>but I have to use the Normal/Oily skin kind.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to dispense.</li>
            <li>Sticky and gel-like, with a very, very strong masking fragrance.</li>
            <li>the sample was more potent!</li>
            <li>I have used Cetaphil cleaners for many years and really liked the brand.  </li>
            <li>I decided to find a cheaper, more effective option.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best face wash I have ever used!</li>
            <li>In general, for me, the orignal works the best but once in awhile I need something to cut the grease</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still satisfied.</li>
            <li>Best facial cleanser ever!!</li>
            <li>I love using this face cleanser</li>
            <li>Love it...............</li>
            <li>.. wait about 2 mins then put your favorite moisturizer on your skin, head out</li>
            <li>I would like this even more if it comes with</li>
            <li>Best facial cleanser ever.</li>
            <li>I know there are a lot more people struggling with acne just like me.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>People have mentioned an overwhelming scent.....</li>
            <li>smells great and easy on the face...cleans off all makeup and face feels clean, and smooth.</li>
            <li>They have a Normal/Dry skin that is in a flip top container</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why they can&#x27;t put this Normal/Oily skin in a flip top also.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the aroma.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on my skin and surprisingly cleared up my acne.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling very clean.  </li>
            <li>They need to work more on this cleansing lotion to make it more friendly to humans.</li>
            <li>Very good facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>To me it reminds me of the smell of the handwash that doctors and nurses use in a hospital, it&#x27;s very mild and the smell doesn&#x27;t stay on your skin.</li>
            <li>It is non-irritating, rinses off well, and has a very very mild scent.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended by my GP as an easy, over the counter soap for controlling acne and oily skin.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll probably buy a nice decanter to dump it into ;)</li>
            <li>I was honestly expecting a bit more when I ordered this product, based on all the high reviews.</li>
            <li>lol I would recommend this to anyone with dry,eczema or even want something different please try this</li>
            <li>Overall a great product.</li>
            <li>I think this is a great part of anyone&#x27;s daily routine.</li>
            <li>My face feels great using this twice daily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, and cleans your pores out without drying your skin.</li>
            <li>Really fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Works very well and very easy on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Left wanting more even though its better than most cleansers.</li>
            <li>Now my skin is almost completely clear, no longer oily and nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Makes face feel truly clean without stripping.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and this product makes my face feel clean before I go to bed, or after I wake up.</li>
            <li>Received safely and fast.</li>
            <li>Overall this cleanser does a good job on my combination skin.</li>
            <li>Only good for those without allergic reactions to fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it takes more than a cleanser to cure that particular problem.  </li>
            <li>and I tried it the very first day I got it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly NOT unpleasant, and like I said, I can&#x27;t even tell you if it has a scent or not</li>
            <li>I find all the various reviews amusing.</li>
            <li>Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser is gentle to my oily skin, has no lanolin and has a very pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle and removes all of my makeup as well.</li>
            <li>My acne is very much controlled</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil for years now and like the product very much</li>
            <li>/&gt;The $5 face soap I had bought from Walmart worked better than this, I think because it contained 2% salicylic acid, which shrunk my blackheads and left my skin feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>However, the first time I used this product, it made my eyes burn.  </li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>it cleans skin wounderful, if u boil hot water on the stove.&lt;br /&gt;steam</li>
            <li>but I only gave this three stars because I keep having problems with the screw top.  </li>
            <li>I only use this normal to oily formula in summer when my skin is at its most oily and even then I dont use it every day, only on my sweatiest most oily days.  </li>
            <li>it actually felt clean!</li>
            <li>It is not as gentle as the original but still better than other products formulated for normal to oily skin on the market.</li>
            <li>I love this product I have dry skin in some areas on my face</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t clear up my blackheads as quickly</li>
            <li>I have to say, my skin is really oily around my nose &amp; my forehead and in a matter of 2 hours</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin at T-zone and forehead and do not have senstive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is very acne prone.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>This skin product didn&#x27;t really improve my acne, but it didn&#x27;t worsen it either.</li>
            <li>but I just wanted a gentle face wash.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had any breakouts or anything, works really well.</li>
            <li>(yes, that is this one), so I used the Gentle Cleanser instead.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Mistakenly bought this instead of the Gentle Skin Cleanser, which is Fragrance-free.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using my bottle of &amp;quot;Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser&amp;quot; for months now and though the big clunky bottle isn&#x27;t pretty, I can easily stuff it in my closet away from all but the most nosiest guests.  </li>
            <li>I actually would have to go upstairs and smell it to even see if they&#x27;re right!</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Cetaphil is pretty decent so far.  </li>
            <li>I already bought a new one at the store that really is Cetaphil.  </li>
            <li>But overall, my favorite non-organic facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and this cleanser is able to clear my face without leaving it feeling dry.</li>
            <li>It leaves it feeling clean and soft at the same time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear, liquid soap-like formulation that doesn&#x27;t foam or even bubble up all that much</li>
            <li>fragrance but Cetaphil products normally donÂ´t come with fragrance.</li>
            <li>it, take a hot washcloth and let it soak for about 1 min, cool the cloth down it</li>
            <li>Being tremendously allergic to lanolin (a common additive in most skin care products), I had a hard time finding something that would be kind to my skin, not cause it to turn red and scaley, as well as not cause my eyes to swell shut.  </li>
            <li>Having chronically oily skin since my teen years (I&#x27;m 40 now and there is no end in site), finding something that would clean my skin and not dry it out was a challenge.  </li>
            <li>I stopped using it immediately and went back on my old face wash, and my skin cleared right up.</li>
            <li>plus its all natural!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the texture of the product, as it didn&#x27;t lather, but I was willing to overlook it because of all the good things I&#x27;ve heard.</li>
            <li>At first I bought both cleansers, the Gentle Cleanser and the Daily Facial Cleanser.</li>
            <li>I was using Paulas Choice CLEAR face wash for about 2 years.</li>
            <li>My face just felt greasy and nowhere near clean/refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, although the label says &amp;#34;Normal to Oily Skin&amp;#34;, if you have oily skin, I would stay away from this product and purchase something that has salicylic acid, because this really just wasn&#x27;t doing it for me as a part of my skin care routine.</li>
            <li>but now as a young adult, I&#x27;ve decided to give it another try.</li>
            <li>I asked if it made a different which one of these products I use, and she said ABSOLUTELY</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t dry my face like it did the first time,  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve collected so much acne product in search of something that works for my skin type - combination skin, I&#x27;m oily around my nose, forehead, and chin, but dry everywhere else.</li>
            <li>The packaging is incredibly similar, 2 words on the package are changed and the font is in a slightly different color, very misleading and unclear marketing.</li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight after washing only exceptionally clean.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and the first few days</li>
            <li>Before I had always used things like proactive, clearasil and other medicated washes to clear it up, but they were very damaging to my skin</li>
            <li>But it is hard to clean.</li>
            <li>(of course I have a whole routine and other products in conjunction with this).</li>
            <li>Skin broke out all over time with small pustules, probably due to the strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>Not sure who this is marketed towards, because people with normal skin would not usually consider Cetaphil.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my bottle of &amp;quot;Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser&amp;quot; for months now and though the big clunky bottle isn&#x27;t pretty, I can easily stuff it in my closet away from all but the most nosiest guests.  </li>
            <li> I actually would have to go upstairs and smell it to even see if they&#x27;re right!</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is pretty decent so far.  </li>
            <li> I already bought a new one at the store that really is Cetaphil.  </li>
            <li> But overall, my favorite non-organic facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and this cleanser is able to clear my face without leaving it feeling dry.</li>
            <li> It leaves it feeling clean and soft at the same time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clear, liquid soap-like formulation that doesn&#x27;t foam or even bubble up all that much</li>
            <li> fragrance but Cetaphil products normally donÂ´t come with fragrance.</li>
            <li> it, take a hot washcloth and let it soak for about 1 min, cool the cloth down it</li>
            <li> Being tremendously allergic to lanolin (a common additive in most skin care products), I had a hard time finding something that would be kind to my skin, not cause it to turn red and scaley, as well as not cause my eyes to swell shut.  </li>
            <li> Having chronically oily skin since my teen years (I&#x27;m 40 now and there is no end in site), finding something that would clean my skin and not dry it out was a challenge.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using it immediately and went back on my old face wash, and my skin cleared right up.</li>
            <li> plus its all natural!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the texture of the product, as it didn&#x27;t lather, but I was willing to overlook it because of all the good things I&#x27;ve heard.</li>
            <li> At first I bought both cleansers, the Gentle Cleanser and the Daily Facial Cleanser.</li>
            <li> I was using Paulas Choice CLEAR face wash for about 2 years.</li>
            <li> My face just felt greasy and nowhere near clean/refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, although the label says &amp;#34;Normal to Oily Skin&amp;#34;, if you have oily skin, I would stay away from this product and purchase something that has salicylic acid, because this really just wasn&#x27;t doing it for me as a part of my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> but now as a young adult, I&#x27;ve decided to give it another try.</li>
            <li> I asked if it made a different which one of these products I use, and she said ABSOLUTELY</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry my face like it did the first time,  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve collected so much acne product in search of something that works for my skin type - combination skin, I&#x27;m oily around my nose, forehead, and chin, but dry everywhere else.</li>
            <li> The packaging is incredibly similar, 2 words on the package are changed and the font is in a slightly different color, very misleading and unclear marketing.</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight after washing only exceptionally clean.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and the first few days</li>
            <li> Before I had always used things like proactive, clearasil and other medicated washes to clear it up, but they were very damaging to my skin</li>
            <li> But it is hard to clean.</li>
            <li> (of course I have a whole routine and other products in conjunction with this).</li>
            <li> Skin broke out all over time with small pustules, probably due to the strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> Not sure who this is marketed towards, because people with normal skin would not usually consider Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and tend to get very oily on my chin, forehead, and (especially) my nose; I usually don&#x27;t get pimples.</li>
            <li> I was battling serious acne well into my 30s, I&#x27;m now 38 and have it under control by doing exactly what my dermatologist recommends.</li>
            <li> are used on using products that would make our skin dry to dry out pimples and such..</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I will buy this as long as the company continues to make it</li>
            <li> Strange.  </li>
            <li> On the other days of the week I use my regular cetaphil.  </li>
            <li> I have been struggling with acne for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Your face does not feel dry after washing it.</li>
            <li> My face is oily but it can gets really dry during the winter.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t rub it into my eyelids because it does dry out my eyelids, otherwise it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face one bit.</li>
            <li> this answered all my questions and you only need  little</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few weeks of using it, however, hoping that my skin just had to adjust, I began to get tiny red pimples, on random places on my face, places were I have never broken out before -</li>
            <li> I still get a pimple every now and then but that was expected, I no longer see breakouts.</li>
            <li> As soon as I washed my face with it, however, I noticed my skin felt very dry in some places and slightly oily to the touch on my forehead and chin, which never happened with any other face soaps I&#x27;ve used in the past (and yes, I did rinse my face completely).</li>
            <li> The Daily Facial Cleanser stung my face pretty badly</li>
            <li> Not sure why my face had broken out in the first place, whether it was from me being stressed out or the effects of the cleanser, but it was a strange occurrence.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also do not get that overpowering coolness on my face afterward like I did with other cleansers.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take too long and my skin seemed to adjust and no more stinging.</li>
            <li> I mean my entire face has cleared up even the scars.</li>
            <li> They filled the container with some disgusting clear smelly soap or body wash.  </li>
            <li> I personally am not really familiar with this product.</li>
            <li> and I see the difference everyday</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s been a few years</li>
            <li> , it cleans makeup without having to rub it too hard on your face like other soups.</li>
            <li> My nose has been spoiled by the fruity stuff I&#x27;ve tried in the past and this cleanser is a bit stinky, a little chemically, but this stuff does the job!  </li>
            <li> This product does not i repeat does NOT use very harsh chemical like others do.</li>
            <li> Sick of wasting money on hoity-toity lines that only managed to make my oily skin oiler or worse yet scaly (!)</li>
            <li> Not a good buy, leaves skin very tight- and dry-feeling.</li>
            <li> a lil bit of facial cleanser and rub it on your face, then rinse of with cold water...</li>
            <li> i mean i was sceptical to about it</li>
            <li> The second time I used it, I closed my eyes, but got a horrible taste in my mouth from getting some on my lips.  </li>
            <li> So, I switched and dealt with my face stinging terribly each time I washed my face (twice daily, but two times in a row when I was washing off make-up to get all the make-up residue off).</li>
            <li> I was sick of having to buy it online</li>
            <li> The results were terrible!</li>
            <li> This is the worst face cleanser I&#x27;ve every tried!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. But it is hard to clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from Walmart 2 months ago to try and reduce acne and I tried it the very first day I got it. The results were terrible! The skin around my eyebrows, T-zone, and mouth were burning and flaking, I immediately put it in my medicine cabinet and went out and bought another cleanser. Today though, I decided to give it another shot. It didn&#x27;t dry my face like it did the first time,  it actually felt clean! I have to say, my skin is really oily around my nose &amp; my forehead and in a matter of 2 hours my face was oily again.&lt;br /&gt;I will now try this product daily &amp; update this review as i go.&lt;br /&gt;BTW : I have very oily skin at T-zone and forehead and do not have senstive skin. My skin is very acne prone.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t remember how I stumbled onto this product, but am very glad I did.  It works really well and I like that it removes my makeup well too.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and this cleanser is able to clear my face without leaving it feeling dry.</li>
            <li> I was honestly expecting a bit more when I ordered this product, based on all the high reviews. I have oily skin and tend to get very oily on my chin, forehead, and (especially) my nose; I usually don&#x27;t get pimples. I wash my face morning and night, and every time I wash it, I also use toner and face moisturizer to follow (I&#x27;ve been using this technique for months with great results). I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the texture of the product, as it didn&#x27;t lather, but I was willing to overlook it because of all the good things I&#x27;ve heard. As soon as I washed my face with it, however, I noticed my skin felt very dry in some places and slightly oily to the touch on my forehead and chin, which never happened with any other face soaps I&#x27;ve used in the past (and yes, I did rinse my face completely). My face just felt greasy and nowhere near clean/refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks of using it, however, hoping that my skin just had to adjust, I began to get tiny red pimples, on random places on my face, places were I have never broken out before - under my eyes, my cheeks, forehead, etc. As you can guess, I was incredibly bewildered, as this was supposed to be an excellent face soap. I stopped using it immediately and went back on my old face wash, and my skin cleared right up. Not sure why my face had broken out in the first place, whether it was from me being stressed out or the effects of the cleanser, but it was a strange occurrence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The $5 face soap I had bought from Walmart worked better than this, I think because it contained 2% salicylic acid, which shrunk my blackheads and left my skin feeling refreshed. Overall, although the label says &amp;#34;Normal to Oily Skin&amp;#34;, if you have oily skin, I would stay away from this product and purchase something that has salicylic acid, because this really just wasn&#x27;t doing it for me as a part of my skin care routine. Definitely unimpressed.</li>
            <li> This is the worst face cleanser I&#x27;ve every tried!  I have used Cetaphil cleaners for many years and really liked the brand.  However, the first time I used this product, it made my eyes burn.  The second time I used it, I closed my eyes, but got a horrible taste in my mouth from getting some on my lips.  They need to work more on this cleansing lotion to make it more friendly to humans.</li>
            <li> Cleared my skin up within 3 days of using</li>
            <li> Yes yes yes,,,. I love this product I have dry skin in some areas on my face I use this product twice a day and I see the difference everyday lol I would recommend this to anyone with dry,eczema or even want something different please try this this answered all my questions and you only need  little</li>
            <li> Great. product.  Received safely and fast. Thank you</li>
            <li> When I was a teenager I used this wash and it did nothing for my skin, but that was probably because I had no clue how to take care of my skin anyways.I never used a moisturizer and i never washed off my makeup at night. but now as a young adult, I&#x27;ve decided to give it another try. It&#x27;s great. I love the smell of it. To me it reminds me of the smell of the handwash that doctors and nurses use in a hospital, it&#x27;s very mild and the smell doesn&#x27;t stay on your skin. I didn&#x27;t order from amazon, but before I bought this at CVS I read the reviews to make sure that I was the one doing something wrong as a teenager and it wasn&#x27;t the product. My acne is controlled. I still get a pimple every now and then but that was expected, I no longer see breakouts. It didn&#x27;t clear up my blackheads as quickly but I&#x27;m still satisfied. Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> very good! but i don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> Having chronically oily skin since my teen years (I&#x27;m 40 now and there is no end in site), finding something that would clean my skin and not dry it out was a challenge.  Being tremendously allergic to lanolin (a common additive in most skin care products), I had a hard time finding something that would be kind to my skin, not cause it to turn red and scaley, as well as not cause my eyes to swell shut.  Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser is gentle to my oily skin, has no lanolin and has a very pleasant smell.  I will never use anything else!</li>
            <li> I only use this normal to oily formula in summer when my skin is at its most oily and even then I dont use it every day, only on my sweatiest most oily days.  On the other days of the week I use my regular cetaphil.  In general, for me, the orignal works the best but once in awhile I need something to cut the grease and this is what I find works best for those days.  It is not as gentle as the original but still better than other products formulated for normal to oily skin on the market.</li>
            <li> Overall this cleanser does a good job on my combination skin. It leaves it feeling clean and soft at the same time. I also like the fact that it comes in a pump. Very easy to dispense.</li>
            <li> This was not Cetaphil.  They filled the container with some disgusting clear smelly soap or body wash.  I have used Cetaphil for years and that&#x27;s not what I got.  This is fraud!!!!!!!!!  I will never order from Amazon again.  It went in the trash!  I already bought a new one at the store that really is Cetaphil.  Shame on you.</li>
            <li> Best facial cleanser ever!! will orderer again</li>
            <li> She loves it since she&#x27;s been using this for a while. I personally am not really familiar with this product.</li>
            <li> the sample was more potent! As if to insure we&#x27;d buy it based on the sample being so good....Left wanting more even though its better than most cleansers.</li>
            <li> I love using this face cleanser</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve collected so much acne product in search of something that works for my skin type - combination skin, I&#x27;m oily around my nose, forehead, and chin, but dry everywhere else. This skin product didn&#x27;t really improve my acne, but it didn&#x27;t worsen it either. It may work for some people, but not for me.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff and I&#x27;ve used it for a long time. I don&#x27;t have severe acne but I just wanted a gentle face wash. I have pretty sensitive skin and this don&#x27;t irritate it or anything. I really like it!</li>
            <li> I was using Paulas Choice CLEAR face wash for about 2 years. I was sick of having to buy it online so I did some research and came across this face wash. I bought it at Walmart (its cheaper there) Haven&#x27;t had any breakouts or anything, works really well. Your face does not feel dry after washing it. Lost one star because it smells like scented tampons. GROSS!!!!!! Wish they made an unscented one!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love it............... it cleans skin wounderful, if u boil hot water on the stove.&lt;br /&gt;steam it, take a hot washcloth and let it soak for about 1 min, cool the cloth down it a lil&lt;br /&gt;cold water.. put the cloth on your face let it sit there for about 1 min to open your pores.&lt;br /&gt;take a lil bit of facial cleanser and rub it on your face, then rinse of with cold water... skin comes out&lt;br /&gt;looking like milk.. wait about 2 mins then put your favorite moisturizer on your skin, head out the door.&lt;br /&gt;and start your day.. trus me.</li>
            <li> My face is oily but it can gets really dry during the winter. This cleanser is perfect for both situations. I would like this even more if it comes with fragrance but Cetaphil products normally donÂ´t come with fragrance.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on my skin and surprisingly cleared up my acne. Before I had always used things like proactive, clearasil and other medicated washes to clear it up, but they were very damaging to my skin and it wasn&#x27;t clearing it up. Now my skin is almost completely clear, no longer oily and nice and smooth. Very gentle and removes all of my makeup as well.</li>
            <li> You might not like this product if you have oily skin, since we \\&quot;people with oily skin\\&quot; are used on using products that would make our skin dry to dry out pimples and such.. this product leaves a satin finish on your skin, and i found that my nose gets oily after couple of hours, i did not like that.  However it is a good cleanser, it cleans makeup without having to rub it too hard on your face like other soups. it also smells like Johnson&amp;Johnson baby shampoo.</li>
            <li> Best facial cleanser ever. Makes face feel truly clean without stripping.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with all of the Cetaphil products which I have tried. I have oily skin and this product makes my face feel clean before I go to bed, or after I wake up. It is non-irritating, rinses off well, and has a very very mild scent. I think this is a great part of anyone&#x27;s daily routine.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my GP as an easy, over the counter soap for controlling acne and oily skin. I&#x27;m not big on skincare not do I regularly use anything besides bar soap, but this stuff works! It changed the texture of my skin (smoother, more even) and is a good deal easier to use since it doesn&#x27;t lather.</li>
            <li> I have never left a comment for anything that i order off amazon, but for this product I had to becauseI I know there are a lot more people struggling with acne just like me. I absolutely love this product. I have been struggling with acne for a very long time. Nothing seem to work for me, but this stuff how ever it is pronounced is the best damn product ever. I mean my entire face has cleared up even the scars. This product does not i repeat does NOT use very harsh chemical like others do. Please give this product a shot i mean i was sceptical to about it but I am so happy i didnt pass by it.</li>
            <li> Sick of wasting money on hoity-toity lines that only managed to make my oily skin oiler or worse yet scaly (!) I decided to find a cheaper, more effective option.  I&#x27;ve been using my bottle of &amp;quot;Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser&amp;quot; for months now and though the big clunky bottle isn&#x27;t pretty, I can easily stuff it in my closet away from all but the most nosiest guests.  My nose has been spoiled by the fruity stuff I&#x27;ve tried in the past and this cleanser is a bit stinky, a little chemically, but this stuff does the job!  It&#x27;s a clear, liquid soap-like formulation that doesn&#x27;t foam or even bubble up all that much but it does a great job of removing makeup excepting, of course, that pesky waterproof stuff that requires days of scrubbing to remove all remnants.  My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight after washing only exceptionally clean.  My oiliness is about the same as it&#x27;s always been but it takes more than a cleanser to cure that particular problem.  I will buy this as long as the company continues to make it but I&#x27;ll probably buy a nice decanter to dump it into ;)</li>
            <li> The best face wash I have had for years, really does the job!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It leaves your skin feeling very clean.  My dermatologist recommended it to me.</li>
            <li> I find all the various reviews amusing. I think people forget that everyone&#x27;s skin is different and reacts differently to products. I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for years, based on my dermatologist&#x27;s recommendation. I was battling serious acne well into my 30s, I&#x27;m now 38 and have it under control by doing exactly what my dermatologist recommends. At first I bought both cleansers, the Gentle Cleanser and the Daily Facial Cleanser. The Daily Facial Cleanser stung my face pretty badly (yes, that is this one), so I used the Gentle Cleanser instead. When I returned to my dermatologist, I still needed help. I asked if it made a different which one of these products I use, and she said ABSOLUTELY YES, only use the Daily Facial Cleanser if I want to control my acne. So, I switched and dealt with my face stinging terribly each time I washed my face (twice daily, but two times in a row when I was washing off make-up to get all the make-up residue off). It didn&#x27;t take too long and my skin seemed to adjust and no more stinging. I think the problem was my skin, NOT the cleanser. The cleanser actually helped to HEAL that problem. Now it&#x27;s been a few years and it&#x27;s so gentle on my skin. My acne is very much controlled (of course I have a whole routine and other products in conjunction with this). People have mentioned an overwhelming scent.....I actually would have to go upstairs and smell it to even see if they&#x27;re right! It&#x27;s certainly NOT unpleasant, and like I said, I can&#x27;t even tell you if it has a scent or not and I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 years! It definitely doesn&#x27;t linger on your face or hands either. My face feels great using this twice daily. I don&#x27;t rub it into my eyelids because it does dry out my eyelids, otherwise it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face one bit. GREAT product.</li>
            <li> smells great and easy on the face...cleans off all makeup and face feels clean, and smooth. plus its all natural!</li>
            <li> Cetaphil is pretty decent so far.  I have very sensitive skin and the first few days it was irritated but it seems to have tapered off now.  I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Very good facial cleanser. I never had an issue with this one. My dermatologist recommended this facial cleanser for my oily acne prone skin. I feel like it did the job well but I ended up going with an organic brand. But overall, my favorite non-organic facial cleanser. The moisturizer is amazing!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist introduced me to this brand. Good stuff. From the soap to the various creams. Doesn&#x27;t burn or cause any kind of discomfort.</li>
            <li> Bought at the store, but not from this seller. Sticky and gel-like, with a very, very strong masking fragrance. Not sure who this is marketed towards, because people with normal skin would not usually consider Cetaphil. Skin broke out all over time with small pustules, probably due to the strong fragrance. Not a good buy, leaves skin very tight- and dry-feeling. Only good for those without allergic reactions to fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mistakenly bought this instead of the Gentle Skin Cleanser, which is Fragrance-free. The packaging is incredibly similar, 2 words on the package are changed and the font is in a slightly different color, very misleading and unclear marketing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cetaphil for years now and like the product very much but I only gave this three stars because I keep having problems with the screw top.  Whether I buy it at CVS or online, the screw top does not pop up!  It&#x27;s a manufacturing flaw and they need to fix it.  The kind I buy is the Normal/Oily skin.  They have a Normal/Dry skin that is in a flip top container but I have to use the Normal/Oily skin kind.  I don&#x27;t understand why they can&#x27;t put this Normal/Oily skin in a flip top also.  Strange.  Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best face wash I have ever used! It&#x27;s light, and cleans your pores out without drying your skin. I also do not get that overpowering coolness on my face afterward like I did with other cleansers. This is the only product I use on my face now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  Really fantastic.  Works very well and very easy on the skin.  I absolutely love the aroma.</li>
