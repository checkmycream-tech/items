            <li>It works great the teeth are perfectly spaced giving your hair that sharp look when you comb it, and it&#x27;s designed with product users in mind.</li>
            <li>Great comb for what it&#x27;s worth...</li>
            <li>And I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li>Does a great job getting a nice straight part.</li>
            <li>It was a great comb, but the plastic mold is not made flex very much.  </li>
            <li>Was great when I used for the first month , then the all of the teeth started falling out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cheaply made though.</li>
            <li>For comb over it&#x27;s great cause of the the large comb teeth (</li>
            <li>Kent combs are much better</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but way over priced.</li>
            <li>I expect much more from a $10 comb.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s more of a matte.</li>
            <li>Love the look I get with it&#x27;s tooth spacing and smoothness</li>
            <li>I expect much more out of a $10 comb.</li>
            <li>and you like to use a comb, you will love this comb.</li>
            <li>but wouldn&#x27;t pay more than 10.</li>
            <li>Works very well and looks great too.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this comb to any dude that takes more than 5min to do their hair.</li>
            <li>And it has a sexy lady on it.</li>
            <li>Best comb I have had in a very long time.</li>
            <li>Better than the cheap pocket combs I have been using.</li>
            <li>Very well made and good quality.</li>
            <li>Unlike Layrite Pomade which is great, this comb would be better off for decoration than actual use.</li>
            <li>Comb breaks easily.</li>
            <li>Liked it so much I bought 3 more</li>
            <li>At first, this comb looks really nice.</li>
            <li>Fine while it lasted, but in under a year the teeth started falling out.</li>
            <li>He liked it so much I went and bought one for myself.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve sat on combs before and snapped tines, fortunately that hasn&#x27;t happened with this one)</li>
            <li>but I did like the handle which made it easy to pull out of my pocket for a quick fix up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the cool factor for sure.</li>
            <li>Not an original layrite comb.</li>
            <li>It was a nice comb but will not be buying a new one.</li>
            <li>yes, it&#x27;s cool</li>
            <li>Good solid comb.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think much about it being any better than a cheapy comb you&#x27;d find at wal mart for a couple bucks.</li>
            <li>It really sucks, &#x27;cause the comb was awesome while it lasted.  </li>
            <li>The tines don&#x27;t break or collect much, very smooth, classic look.</li>
            <li>I find using a classic comb you can get for a couple dollars works much better.</li>
            <li>you dont want to keep this comb in your pocket all the time because the bristles bend n snap off quick...</li>
            <li>This did not just happen to my original comb, but also the replacement comb I got after I called about the defect in the first comb.</li>
            <li>The teeth broke off in my hair when combing in the very product it is meant to be used with; LAYRITE SUPER HOLD!  </li>
            <li>Ok, so yeah, it was a year old.  </li>
            <li>I liked this comb until the teeth started breaking off after a year of ownership and pretty much just normal usage.</li>
            <li>Worth 5 bucks</li>
            <li>For the price, not quite as good as expected.</li>
            <li>This comb is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>stay right wit layright</li>
            <li>I have got better results from a cheap 99 cent comb cause of the smaller teeth instead of the large ones that this one has.</li>
            <li>After using those cheap little flimsy run of the mill plastic combs forever, this thing is a nice change of pace.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can tell right away it&#x27;s better made and will last a lot longer!</li>
            <li>A little pricey but good to have.</li>
            <li>Love the old-school style of this comb, it definitely looks like something you might find in my home-town barbershop.  </li>
            <li>Sure it doesn&#x27;t make sense to buy a regular comb for this much</li>
            <li>Pretty much, I figured I was paying for the graphics on the side of it.</li>
            <li>Comb looked decent but the first time i dropped it</li>
            <li>its feel of a pretty high quality</li>
            <li>I sort of expected more.  </li>
            <li>, I simply expected a comb that would survive for more than a year.  </li>
            <li>Combs, not so much.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t believe the comb was under much stress.</li>
            <li>I expected more, given the price tag.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look like much in the picture but is very well structured and</li>
            <li>I lost the first and even broke the teeth on the second but still bought a third because it such a damn good comb.</li>
            <li>It is actually thicker than you would imagine as well and the cool graphics are a plus.</li>
            <li>Nice and tough, seems like it would be kind of hard to snap it, keep it in my pocket for when I need a quick hair fix</li>
            <li>Decent.</li>
            <li>But, when I received the comb I was surprised to find that it was in fact a very well constructed very well designed comb.</li>
            <li>I really like that it has a clearly defined handle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good not great.</li>
            <li>Need a new one but will probably not go through these guys again.</li>
            <li>I bought one for my father for Father&#x27;s Day and he enjoys the heavy duty handle and our conclusion was that, if he ever developed arthritis, he would still be able to grip this comb.  </li>
            <li>It feels solid in your hands, is smooth, grabs a big chunk of hair and lays it all out evenly.</li>
            <li>First thing you&#x27;ll notice is how solid feeling and sturdy it feels.</li>
            <li>I now have a large gap in the middle of the comb.</li>
            <li>Pick up one of those cheap little unbreakables for that, that way you don&#x27;t get have to be worried about it getting messed up.  </li>
            <li>But after a few weeks of use, you notice a huge problem: THE TEETH FALL OUT.</li>
            <li>This comb is sturdy and has a nice solid, thick handle.  </li>
            <li>This morning, a 2 inch section of teeth, right out of the center of the comb, fell out with one pass through my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have been disappointed by many combs, this works amazing with DAX and my current product IMPERIAL</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the comb a lot the first few days I had it, but after putting it in my pocket a few times to carry around (probably not suggested storage from the manufacturer) and the teeth came off the comb, almost in patches of 5 - 8 at a time.  </li>
            <li>Once the first tooth broke off the others began to get loose.</li>
            <li>the build quality is really sturdy, hold up well with thick men&#x27;s hair and fine enough to use with product well.</li>
            <li>Got my new one and had the same thing happen within a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>I had several teeth break off my comb with normal use, so I sent it back for a replacement.</li>
            <li>Too expensive but nice</li>
            <li>Also: the teeth of the comb aren&#x27;t flimsy like other pocket combs, so it really helps with getting my hair in a desired style.</li>
            <li>The teeth fall out after only a few weeks, to a few months at MOST.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty firm comb</li>
            <li>A little strange writing a review for a comb but as someone who buys everything online, reviews are helpful and useful</li>
            <li>Cost a little more than the usual comb though.</li>
            <li>I have had combs that cost less and lasted much longer then a month.  </li>
            <li>Cheap and weak material</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s good not great.</li>
            <li> Need a new one but will probably not go through these guys again.</li>
            <li> I bought one for my father for Father&#x27;s Day and he enjoys the heavy duty handle and our conclusion was that, if he ever developed arthritis, he would still be able to grip this comb.  </li>
            <li> It feels solid in your hands, is smooth, grabs a big chunk of hair and lays it all out evenly.</li>
            <li> First thing you&#x27;ll notice is how solid feeling and sturdy it feels.</li>
            <li> I now have a large gap in the middle of the comb.</li>
            <li> Pick up one of those cheap little unbreakables for that, that way you don&#x27;t get have to be worried about it getting messed up.  </li>
            <li> But after a few weeks of use, you notice a huge problem: THE TEETH FALL OUT.</li>
            <li> This comb is sturdy and has a nice solid, thick handle.  </li>
            <li> This morning, a 2 inch section of teeth, right out of the center of the comb, fell out with one pass through my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have been disappointed by many combs, this works amazing with DAX and my current product IMPERIAL</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the comb a lot the first few days I had it, but after putting it in my pocket a few times to carry around (probably not suggested storage from the manufacturer) and the teeth came off the comb, almost in patches of 5 - 8 at a time.  </li>
            <li> Once the first tooth broke off the others began to get loose.</li>
            <li> the build quality is really sturdy, hold up well with thick men&#x27;s hair and fine enough to use with product well.</li>
            <li> Got my new one and had the same thing happen within a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I had several teeth break off my comb with normal use, so I sent it back for a replacement.</li>
            <li> Too expensive but nice</li>
            <li> Also: the teeth of the comb aren&#x27;t flimsy like other pocket combs, so it really helps with getting my hair in a desired style.</li>
            <li> The teeth fall out after only a few weeks, to a few months at MOST.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty firm comb</li>
            <li> A little strange writing a review for a comb but as someone who buys everything online, reviews are helpful and useful</li>
            <li> Cost a little more than the usual comb though.</li>
            <li> I have had combs that cost less and lasted much longer then a month.  </li>
            <li> Cheap and weak material</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how much I&#x27;ll use this comb.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ll probably last as long, if not longer, and will cost 1/8 the price.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last long before the comb started to fall apart.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty ridiculous that a $10 comb does that when you can get one at the dollar store that will last you years.</li>
            <li> Could not be more unhappy with this product.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how long it took for this comb to start losing teeth at a rapid rate.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected</li>
            <li> Bought it for my bf so far he enjoys it  and uses it everyday .</li>
            <li> and I dug the style, not sure if it&#x27;s worth the cash though :/.  </li>
            <li> I took a flight the first week I owned it and one of the teeth had broken off inside my toiletry bag.</li>
            <li> You can see the results of carrying it in my back pocket for less than 2 months.</li>
            <li> This is a huge disappointment considering the price.</li>
            <li> Teeth break at an alarming rate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend spending a few extra bucks and getting this beauty from Baxter of California.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not really usable for him and his crazy straight stubborn asian hair</li>
            <li> But three times since then, 3- more teeth have broken off rendering the comb useless.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> So, not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Alright comb, I bought it for my boyfriend to use with his Layrite product but the teeth are too wide, its got a narrow width</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it had anything to do with the fact that I never really washed the comb thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> I have thick loose curl hair.</li>
            <li> Knew I shouldn&#x27;t have wasted my money on this.</li>
            <li> The bristles are really stiff</li>
            <li> Had a little hard time doing a side part to my hair as well with this.</li>
            <li> The quality sucks.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see myself having to buy another comb for years or at least until I lose this one.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not flimsy nor is it thick but well made.</li>
            <li> Seriously avoid this comb.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> If you have thin to medium hair</li>
            <li> Not sure what else there is to say about a comb, it looks sick too?</li>
            <li> I wrongly assumed that the comb would be well made since it carries the Layrite name.</li>
            <li> not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> Terrible comb!  </li>
            <li> Worst comb ever.</li>
            <li> Probably the worst thing that could happen to a HAIR COMB.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Terrible comb!  After only a month the teeth begin falling out.  I have had combs that cost less and lasted much longer then a month.  I would request a refund, but would think twice before ordering another product.</li>
            <li> Decent. Kent combs are much better but I did like the handle which made it easy to pull out of my pocket for a quick fix up.</li>
            <li> What can I say, its a comb. It&#x27;s ok, but way over priced. they should just sell these as a bonus to their pomades.  I prefer my 2.50 comb from CVS over this. Save your money and just go buy a comb at walmart or your corner drug store.</li>
            <li> Worst comb ever. Teeth break at an alarming rate.</li>
            <li> Best comb!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Good comb! Very strong. Good handle</li>
            <li> Great comb. Very well made and good quality.</li>
            <li> Yesterday, I would have given this 5 stars.  This morning, a 2 inch section of teeth, right out of the center of the comb, fell out with one pass through my hair.  Ok, so yeah, it was a year old.  However, for a comb that lived on the bathroom counter I sort of expected more.  I&#x27;ve got ACE combs that have been hanging around like a laid off in-law for 7-8 years that cost me a buck, that still have all their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I simply expected a comb that would survive for more than a year.  10 bucks will buy a ton of inexpensive combs that frankly do the same job and will last a heck of a lot longer.  Granted, those combs don&#x27;t have a half-naked lady on the side, but I don&#x27;t buy combs for their racy content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - Layrite makes great pomade.  Combs, not so much.</li>
            <li> A section of the comb broke off. It was a nice comb but will not be buying a new one. The quality sucks.</li>
            <li> Fine while it lasted, but in under a year the teeth started falling out. I now have a large gap in the middle of the comb. Not worth the price. I expect much more from a $10 comb. I&#x27;d recommend spending a few extra bucks and getting this beauty from Baxter of California. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0079K5ZPY?redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can tell right away it&#x27;s better made and will last a lot longer!</li>
            <li> It was a great looking and working comb. After 2 weeks the teeth on the comb started breaking off.</li>
            <li> This comb is sturdy, well-made and fits in the hand just right.  Feels like it&#x27;s going to last a while.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and styles well</li>
            <li> Unlike Layrite Pomade which is great, this comb would be better off for decoration than actual use. I find using a classic comb you can get for a couple dollars works much better.</li>
            <li> The teeth fall out after only a few weeks, to a few months at MOST. Seriously avoid this comb.</li>
            <li> Alright comb, I bought it for my boyfriend to use with his Layrite product but the teeth are too wide, its got a narrow width but the teeth follow the length of the comb and it&#x27;s not really usable for him and his crazy straight stubborn asian hair</li>
            <li> I really like that it has a clearly defined handle. Also: the teeth of the comb aren&#x27;t flimsy like other pocket combs, so it really helps with getting my hair in a desired style. If layrite made a sheath for this thing so I could wear it on my belt that s*** would be so cash.</li>
            <li> Was great when I used for the first month , then the all of the teeth started falling out. I have thin hair and I don&#x27;t believe the comb was under much stress. Need a new one but will probably not go through these guys again. Stick to making good pomade. Your combs suck.</li>
            <li> The teeth started to break off after about 3 months.  I&#x27;m not sure if it had anything to do with the fact that I never really washed the comb thoroughly.  I only used this comb with Layrite superhold as well.  I think the combination of the hair product and water over time caused the plastic to become brittle.</li>
            <li> Good quality.&lt;br /&gt;Firm handle.&lt;br /&gt;Strong teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Cool logo.</li>
            <li> Not an original layrite comb. It was a knock off. Silver Layrite label that came off. Thicker teeth in comb. Returning!</li>
            <li> This comb is sturdy and has a nice solid, thick handle.  I bought one for my father for Father&#x27;s Day and he enjoys the heavy duty handle and our conclusion was that, if he ever developed arthritis, he would still be able to grip this comb.  He liked it so much I went and bought one for myself.</li>
            <li> Too expensive but nice</li>
            <li> Teeth broke off of this comb very easily. Basically garbage now soon after I bought it</li>
            <li> perfect comb for anybody with the retro looking hair!! its feel of a pretty high quality i would deff recommend it to everybody</li>
            <li> After using those cheap little flimsy run of the mill plastic combs forever, this thing is a nice change of pace. It feels solid in your hands, is smooth, grabs a big chunk of hair and lays it all out evenly. Not sure what else there is to say about a comb, it looks sick too? If you&#x27;ve got spare money, grab one.</li>
            <li> I have been disappointed by many combs, this works amazing with DAX and my current product IMPERIAL that&#x27;s more of a matte. The tines don&#x27;t break or collect much, very smooth, classic look. Easy, 5-10 min in the morning and looks great the rest of the day. A++</li>
            <li> If you use the layrite product, you&#x27;ll know this comb is perfect for that perfect, slick greaser style. you dont want to keep this comb in your pocket all the time because the bristles bend n snap off quick...</li>
            <li> Best comb I have had in a very long time. Love the look I get with it&#x27;s tooth spacing and smoothness</li>
            <li> I also had a problem with the teeth popping off after about a month.  I expect much more out of a $10 comb.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair so I&#x27;m not sure how much I&#x27;ll use this comb. If you have thin to medium hair and you like to use a comb, you will love this comb. I just use it in the shower after I put conditioner on my hair. It&#x27;s not flimsy nor is it thick but well made.</li>
            <li> I am a repeat purchaser of this comb. I lost the first and even broke the teeth on the second but still bought a third because it such a damn good comb.</li>
            <li> I liked this comb until the teeth started breaking off after a year of ownership and pretty much just normal usage. I expected more, given the price tag.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best comb I ever used in my life! Feels great! Nice and tough, seems like it would be kind of hard to snap it, keep it in my pocket for when I need a quick hair fix</li>
            <li> IMHO the perfect comb. A little pricey but good to have.</li>
            <li> Great comb for what it&#x27;s worth... Not a pocket comb for me because it does feel breakable..</li>
            <li> At first, this comb looks really nice. But after a few weeks of use, you notice a huge problem: THE TEETH FALL OUT. Probably the worst thing that could happen to a HAIR COMB. This did not just happen to my original comb, but also the replacement comb I got after I called about the defect in the first comb. It&#x27;s pretty ridiculous that a $10 comb does that when you can get one at the dollar store that will last you years. Could not be more unhappy with this product.</li>
            <li> Knew I shouldn&#x27;t have wasted my money on this. For 15 dollars a comb should last longer than a month. That&#x27;s how long it took for this comb to start losing teeth at a rapid rate. And I have very fine hair. Do not buy this comb, it&#x27;s a shame layrite puts their name on this piece of garbage.</li>
            <li> So, this is a great comb. A little strange writing a review for a comb but as someone who buys everything online, reviews are helpful and useful so here it goes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Classic Layrite Logo, Oldschool Cool&lt;br /&gt;-Lightweight but rigid&lt;br /&gt;-Perfect spacing between teeth of comb&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-Lightweight, I put this here because I could see how some people might want a heavier feeling comb.&lt;br /&gt;-Can be noisy when pulling out of pocket&lt;br /&gt;-Logo starting to wear after 3 months of daily use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see the cons are negligible,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the question is, should you buy a 10$ comb?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply yes, it&#x27;s cool and I don&#x27;t see myself having to buy another comb for years or at least until I lose this one.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm...</li>
            <li> stay right wit layright</li>
            <li> I was expecting a reliable comb, but was it? NAH.  The teeth broke off in my hair when combing in the very product it is meant to be used with; LAYRITE SUPER HOLD!  Save your money and buy a 12-pack of combs from the dollar store.  They&#x27;ll probably last as long, if not longer, and will cost 1/8 the price.</li>
            <li> It does a good job as a comb. It&#x27;s very cheaply made though. Dropped it one time, after only having it for a couple days, and the teeth all broke.</li>
            <li> Great comb!  Feels durable too.</li>
            <li> This is a really great comb. First thing you&#x27;ll notice is how solid feeling and sturdy it feels. It has a good weight to it, not like its Walmart counterparts. Should last years if not abused. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good not great. I was happy and excited to try this. For comb over it&#x27;s great cause of the the large comb teeth (if that&#x27;s what they are called) Now for the flip in front  I have got better results from a cheap 99 cent comb cause of the smaller teeth instead of the large ones that this one has. Had a little hard time doing a side part to my hair as well with this. I do say it&#x27;s sturdy. Worth 5 bucks but wouldn&#x27;t pay more than 10.</li>
            <li> Cheap and weak material</li>
            <li> Works very well and looks great too.</li>
            <li> Everything is great happy holidays!</li>
            <li> Style your hair perfectly with this comb!  Best one I have had yet. Cost a little more than the usual comb though.</li>
            <li> Love the old-school style of this comb, it definitely looks like something you might find in my home-town barbershop.  For the price you can&#x27;t beat it; there&#x27;s an obvious difference in quality between this and one of those pocket combs from Wal-mart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I recommend this for a house-comb.. It&#x27;s definitely not a back-pocket comb.  Pick up one of those cheap little unbreakables for that, that way you don&#x27;t get have to be worried about it getting messed up.  (I&#x27;ve sat on combs before and snapped tines, fortunately that hasn&#x27;t happened with this one)</li>
            <li> Good solid comb. I just don&#x27;t feel like I get enough control with it. I have thick loose curl hair.</li>
            <li> A good comb does a good job also looks great, would recommend to anybody lookin for a good comb !!!!!</li>
            <li> Garbage. Teeth broke within a week.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected</li>
            <li> Great comb except it started loosing teeth after a month.  So, not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Does a great job getting a nice straight part. Have used it almost every day for several month and haven&#x27;t had the teeth fall out.</li>
            <li> Coming across this comb on here I figured it was just a promotional/novelty comb. I didn&#x27;t think much about it being any better than a cheapy comb you&#x27;d find at wal mart for a couple bucks. Pretty much, I figured I was paying for the graphics on the side of it. But, when I received the comb I was surprised to find that it was in fact a very well constructed very well designed comb. It works great the teeth are perfectly spaced giving your hair that sharp look when you comb it, and it&#x27;s designed with product users in mind. I would recommend this comb to any dude that takes more than 5min to do their hair.</li>
            <li> The Comb was good although the tip of the comb broke when I accidentally dropped it onto my bedroom floor.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my bf so far he enjoys it  and uses it everyday . so yes id recommened this product.</li>
            <li> Comb breaks easily. I took a flight the first week I owned it and one of the teeth had broken off inside my toiletry bag. I blamed myself... But three times since then, 3- more teeth have broken off rendering the comb useless. I&#x27;d probably have similar results with a dollar store comb, except I&#x27;d still have $9.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re basically paying for the layrite logo. Nothing to see here, move on.</li>
            <li> For the price, not quite as good as expected.</li>
            <li> This comb is well worth the money. ..It doesn&#x27;t look like much in the picture but is very well structured and the teeth are evenly spread apart ro create the look you want....5 stars all the way. ..</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the comb a lot the first few days I had it, but after putting it in my pocket a few times to carry around (probably not suggested storage from the manufacturer) and the teeth came off the comb, almost in patches of 5 - 8 at a time.  It really sucks, &#x27;cause the comb was awesome while it lasted.  I guess if you don&#x27;t plan on putting it in your pocket it&#x27;ll last you a lot longer than it did me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty firm comb and I dug the style, not sure if it&#x27;s worth the cash though :/.  The bristles are really stiff so it may not be for all users.</li>
            <li> The spacing on the teeth is perfect for what I do with my hair. Better than the cheap pocket combs I have been using. It is actually thicker than you would imagine as well and the cool graphics are a plus.</li>
            <li> I wrongly assumed that the comb would be well made since it carries the Layrite name. The comb is advertised as a pocket comb. You can see the results of carrying it in my back pocket for less than 2 months. Once the first tooth broke off the others began to get loose. I no longer carry it. This is a huge disappointment considering the price.</li>
            <li> A pricey comb but the build quality is really sturdy, hold up well with thick men&#x27;s hair and fine enough to use with product well.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last long before the comb started to fall apart.  It was a great comb, but the plastic mold is not made flex very much.  For a $10 comb it should last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> Sure it doesn&#x27;t make sense to buy a regular comb for this much but it DOES really do a great job.  I personally like having the logo and don&#x27;t mind giving money to that company. It&#x27;s worth the cool factor for sure.</li>
            <li> This comb works great to style my pompadour, but it broke around after a year of use, and I didn&#x27;t travel with it.  All of the teeth fell out, but before it broke, it was sooooo good.</li>
            <li> Nice comb for on the go. Solid in quality. Perfect fit everywhere gym, car, back pocket etc. Nice feel. Good price for comb.</li>
            <li> Liked it so much I bought 3 more so I could have one whenever I need it.  And it has a sexy lady on it. And it has a good feel to it. And it combs hair!</li>
            <li> Soild comb with nicely spaced teeth for a Pomp,Gentlemen&#x27;s cut, Razor part or what have you. The chick on the handle could have bigger juggs so i&#x27;m pulling a star off for that.</li>
            <li> I had several teeth break off my comb with normal use, so I sent it back for a replacement. I figured it was just a lemmon. Got my new one and had the same thing happen within a couple of weeks. These combs are very fragile. The only reason I gave it two stars is I like the design.</li>
            <li> Comb looked decent but the first time i dropped it the end broke off... not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> This is the good shiz</li>
