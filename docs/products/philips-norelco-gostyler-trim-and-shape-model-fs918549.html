            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is the perfect size and weight and is VERY easy to work with.</li>
            <li>The trimmer itself is OUTSTANDING!!</li>
            <li>Good trimmer, replaced a rechargeable Norelco trimmer that I had.</li>
            <li>A good trimmer, but</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve always been reliable with good warranties and long-lasting quality products.</li>
            <li>I am going to order another one just as a spare, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li>Good item</li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>Feels good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s battery powered which means you can use it in the shower, a good feature.</li>
            <li>Because of its handy size, it&#x27;s great for travel, too.</li>
            <li>The foil shaver is a nice addition, and not something that my Norelco had.</li>
            <li>While I know that this is intended as a beard trimmer, I&#x27;ve been using it for some nice neat trim work when I cut the fella&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>It does not come with any kind of travel case.</li>
            <li>The size, shape and angle of the head are perfect for keeping edges straight and neat.</li>
            <li>some kind of reusable carrying case.</li>
            <li>The unit itself looks sturdy -- not the best material (plastic, of course), but easy-to-clean and very portable (for travel, etc.).</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, intuitive and worked like a charm, according to the men in my household.</li>
            <li>This norelco has a great grip, it&#x27;s easy to manuver, cordless which is awesome and only takes one battery.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I love it honestly for that</li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion, I&#x27;m very impressed thus far</li>
            <li>I love how handy this cordless trimmer/styler is.</li>
            <li>It has 2 attachments and both are for very fine detail work on beards and sideburns.</li>
            <li>Low priced and great lines, this is a great trimmer for guys on the go.</li>
            <li>Finer tines would be more effective for this application, but the  GoStyler did a pretty good job</li>
            <li>Even without using the different combs it was perfect for his needs.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;d paid closer attention to the description, I&#x27;d have known better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery life is OK, I got about 3 or 4 uses before the alkaline battery needed replacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do notice that it&#x27;s much more &amp;#34;underpowered&amp;#34; than my rechargeable one.</li>
            <li>you have one more if you don&#x27;t want any of these measures.</li>
            <li>This is my face:) I still healing.</li>
            <li>Forgot one more thing, now i use Face Bake anti aging self tanning lotion for face, to cover imperfection.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t get better as I did both cheeks and around my goatee.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used many over the decades,</li>
            <li>I would like an adjustable slider or something more than just 3 choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>Really love this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Much better model then</li>
            <li>It seems to work okay.</li>
            <li>Which still would have been okay.</li>
            <li>but I wish it was a bit wider and had more options for trim length.</li>
            <li>razor head effective for light touchup here</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it&#x27;s waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would have given the GoStyler four stars if I&#x27;d been able to get this screen off by hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>/pull at hair like many trimmers do.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great product!</li>
            <li>I have more of a 5 o clock shadow</li>
            <li>It would have been better if it had been rechargeable.</li>
            <li>Even right out of the box, it just kind of seems to be dying, almost like my Norelco does when it needs to be charged.</li>
            <li>I find it easy to maneuver even in tricky areas.</li>
            <li>It cleans easily as well.</li>
            <li>It is easy to change out the attachments and the longer handle makes it easier to hold.</li>
            <li>The guards go on and come off easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to trim close.  </li>
            <li>It is very good as long as you use it for the job it was intended to do.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty handy trimmer with some</li>
            <li>than that, it&#x27;s pretty nice.  </li>
            <li>but these are fine for 95% of men.</li>
            <li>Cuts great, quiet, easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, this is a cheaply made, disposable item.</li>
            <li>star off for not even including a cheap pouch to store everything in.</li>
            <li>But overall this is a great shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m kind of wondering how fast this will go through the batteries.</li>
            <li>it were great although I only used one of them.</li>
            <li>A smooth finish.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, solid feel to it, with a rubberized grip that&#x27;s a nice touch.</li>
            <li>The three combs that come with the trimmer are too close in size to be very useful or versatile.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy and quick to change the heads, so that&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try out this model which has a longer reach.</li>
            <li>Pro&#x27;s - super light.</li>
            <li>It says a lot that most of the positive reviews say &amp;#34;for the money&amp;#34; in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shaver attachment shaves pretty close and is easy to get accurate with your beard or whatever.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My boyfriend has a full beard</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good trimmer.</li>
            <li>This is not for a full face shave .</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a good trimmer</li>
            <li>I really like and would love to buy another to carry it during my travel.</li>
            <li>The foil shaver is my least favorite part, but it&#x27;s still a great feature.</li>
            <li>overall, this is a great value, and works really well.  </li>
            <li>It did not have a stand, bag, or cover for the trimmer head so either you store it in the reddish plastic packaging that it came in, let things potentially roll around freely in the drawer, or provide your own bag.ad size).</li>
            <li>It did not have a stand, bag, or cover for the trimmer head so either you store it in the reddish plastic packaging that it came in, let things potentially roll around freely in the drawer, or provide your own bag.</li>
            <li>They liked that it cut cleanly at their selected length (using the spacers) without tugging or pulling on facial hair.</li>
            <li>Did I say it&#x27;s really small and light - again, great for travel.</li>
            <li>So far, I have only used one and have been very pleased with it, as my beard has look so much better</li>
            <li>it has a surprisingly powerful motor.</li>
            <li>The set comes with three precision combs that help you find the distinct look you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li>This is a daily styler for keeping everything nice and groomed.  </li>
            <li>That said it took about a minute to get it right.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a detail shaver attachment should you need one and a AA battery to get you trimming right away.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s always consistent.</li>
            <li>briefly tried the foil shaver attachment and it worked OK</li>
            <li>No, but only because I find my standard Wahl to be more versatile, (read, more than just a beard trimmer.)</li>
            <li>Very convenient and powerful.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was this hurt, quite a lot.</li>
            <li>So I did the 3mm and it seemed ok -- it wasn&#x27;t too short.</li>
            <li>Great for small beard like mine; trims very well.</li>
            <li>THE Norelco works fine for touch up trim work  but requires too much time for a complete beard trim.</li>
            <li>So far so good, so I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a new styler to try out that won&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it uses real batteries instead of needing charged and then the internal battery eventually dies.  </li>
            <li>One is for detailed shaving and the other is a clippers for fine edge work.</li>
            <li>after trying this, instead of a close beard, he had more of a long 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li>The GoStyler feels solid, much more so than my last trimmer (a cheap Remington).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>honestly it smacks as average.</li>
            <li>The two heads swap out easily with a twist of the unit, similar to how the battery</li>
            <li>It seemed to miss fine hairs even after several passes.</li>
            <li>But I took the battery out, put it back together, and it&#x27;s worked fine since.</li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco GoStyler is a fine facial trimmer.</li>
            <li>But overall fits my need just fine.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing little clipper.</li>
            <li>The different beard combs came in handy when I wanted to try out a different lengths, and in general it stayed clean and did not need much upkeep in-between clippings.</li>
            <li>The unit runs off batteries and is very portable.</li>
            <li>In 2015 I would say I expected more.</li>
            <li>So very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>But, for travel and basic clean up, this is easy and fast and at a fantastically low price.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t got to fast.</li>
            <li>He had to shave the whole thing off</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>machine is small and easy to fit in shaving kit.  </li>
            <li>Charging is easy, and charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>The key word here great for SMALL beards.  </li>
            <li>motor is strong and the default, detail blade is sharp and precise; I get the overall feel that although quite affordable it&#x27;s still a well made product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since it is smaller than the hair trimmer I use for the bulk of the haircut, it is much easier to handle and actually does much more precision</li>
            <li>and there it is obviously not meant for a full shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have a small beard or a 5 oclock shadow and looking for something cheap to keep your lines clean, give this a look.  </li>
            <li>If grow little facial hair or looking for something to edge you up and clean up the lines on your beard, compare to most, this may meet your needs.  </li>
            <li>The different clips provide many options for trimming facial hair, and the &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34; does not irritate the skin</li>
            <li>This is made of high quality.</li>
            <li>The packaging itself isn&#x27;t a suitable case for regular use, so you end up finding a pouch or case of your own--or leaving the parts loose.</li>
            <li>Blades are sharp and trim easily, and I have yet to get &amp;#34;bitten&amp;#34; in any way.  </li>
            <li>I do wish they had a few more length settings.</li>
            <li>After reading the instructions (more pictures than words) and doing some experimenting, I concluded that even for touch-ups on &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; length hair, you&#x27;re supposed to use the &amp;#34;precision trimmer head&amp;#34; to get the hair nearly at skin level and then use the &amp;#34;detail shaving head&amp;#34; to remove the remaining hair down to the &amp;#34;baby smooth&amp;#34; feel.</li>
            <li>The tricky part was getting it back up and lined up correctly to turn it to the right to close it.</li>
            <li>bare trimmer tines are medium fineness meaning they aren&#x27;t super close together, or very coarsely spaced, either.</li>
            <li>The head is compact enough that shaping my beard is pretty effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it did work pretty well to shave close to the outline of my facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I keep a consistent five o&#x27;clock shadow, so I always rely on stylers and trimmers to keep my stubble looking solid.</li>
            <li>None of the men in this house have a beard, but they are always constantly using this cheap little touch up trimmer my husband keeps around to clean up the back of his neck and his sideburns.</li>
            <li>For 15 dollars or so this is a very useful little beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>I have the unit together properly, as far as I could tell.</li>
            <li>It looked like I went and had it done by a professional.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it for heavy shaving but it does the detailed work well.</li>
            <li>The beard trimming attachments really don&#x27;t give you an option that keeps your beard or goatee cropped very short.</li>
            <li>The guys all agree this is a big improvement for just a few dollars more.</li>
            <li>It never pulled skin, or pinched, it was plently powerful enough on only 2 batteries, and can be ran under water.</li>
            <li>The head is a little small for everyday use, but I would mostly use this as a travel item because it is more convenient than taking my large trimmer and another one I use for edges.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thin, it&#x27;s light and it has three adjustable attachments to pick the right of amount of Leonid</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic little tool!</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and quiet, and the motor is surprisingly powerful, given the fact that the unit runs on a single &amp;#34;AA&amp;#34; battery.</li>
            <li>Recommended for guys with scruff; the combs are a little too short to accurately trim a beard.</li>
            <li>For the selling price there isn&#x27;t much more that could be expected out of this little grooming tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Having the different length attachments really helps with getting the back, around the ears, and the ever-important sides, all neat and looking good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While it still runs on battery (which I hate), it has more features and runs better.</li>
            <li>They snap on easily and hold on without wiggling, but I don&#x27;t know how they&#x27;d react if &amp;#34;combed&amp;#34; through a thick beard.</li>
            <li>No other trimmer</li>
            <li>It is extremely easy to use and the end result is a well styled stubble that I had a harder time achieving with previous stylers.</li>
            <li>I especially like the small head that allows me to precisely groom my beard and shape it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using just the bare trimmer head</li>
            <li>and I got nearly the same result.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I used it, it would stop working each time that I  turned it upside down.</li>
            <li>This is a very inexpensive trimmer and works well enough for us as a family, but if you have a beard and are going to be using something every single day I might look somewhere else.</li>
            <li>other head option that should really have been included would have been and</li>
            <li>However, it did take several passes from different directions to get an area completely &amp;#34;baby smooth&amp;#34; with the detail shaving head.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few of these small trimmers/detailers, and this one is my favorite.</li>

            <li> The size, shape and angle of the head are perfect for keeping edges straight and neat.</li>
            <li> some kind of reusable carrying case.</li>
            <li> The unit itself looks sturdy -- not the best material (plastic, of course), but easy-to-clean and very portable (for travel, etc.).</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, intuitive and worked like a charm, according to the men in my household.</li>
            <li> This norelco has a great grip, it&#x27;s easy to manuver, cordless which is awesome and only takes one battery.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I love it honestly for that</li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion, I&#x27;m very impressed thus far</li>
            <li> I love how handy this cordless trimmer/styler is.</li>
            <li> It has 2 attachments and both are for very fine detail work on beards and sideburns.</li>
            <li> Low priced and great lines, this is a great trimmer for guys on the go.</li>
            <li> Finer tines would be more effective for this application, but the  GoStyler did a pretty good job</li>
            <li> Even without using the different combs it was perfect for his needs.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;d paid closer attention to the description, I&#x27;d have known better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life is OK, I got about 3 or 4 uses before the alkaline battery needed replacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do notice that it&#x27;s much more &amp;#34;underpowered&amp;#34; than my rechargeable one.</li>
            <li> you have one more if you don&#x27;t want any of these measures.</li>
            <li> This is my face:) I still healing.</li>
            <li> Forgot one more thing, now i use Face Bake anti aging self tanning lotion for face, to cover imperfection.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get better as I did both cheeks and around my goatee.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used many over the decades,</li>
            <li> I would like an adjustable slider or something more than just 3 choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> Really love this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Much better model then</li>
            <li> It seems to work okay.</li>
            <li> Which still would have been okay.</li>
            <li> but I wish it was a bit wider and had more options for trim length.</li>
            <li> razor head effective for light touchup here</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that it&#x27;s waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would have given the GoStyler four stars if I&#x27;d been able to get this screen off by hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> /pull at hair like many trimmers do.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great product!</li>
            <li> I have more of a 5 o clock shadow</li>
            <li> It would have been better if it had been rechargeable.</li>
            <li> Even right out of the box, it just kind of seems to be dying, almost like my Norelco does when it needs to be charged.</li>
            <li> I find it easy to maneuver even in tricky areas.</li>
            <li> It cleans easily as well.</li>
            <li> It is easy to change out the attachments and the longer handle makes it easier to hold.</li>
            <li> The guards go on and come off easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to trim close.  </li>
            <li> It is very good as long as you use it for the job it was intended to do.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty handy trimmer with some</li>
            <li> than that, it&#x27;s pretty nice.  </li>
            <li> but these are fine for 95% of men.</li>
            <li> Cuts great, quiet, easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, this is a cheaply made, disposable item.</li>
            <li> star off for not even including a cheap pouch to store everything in.</li>
            <li> But overall this is a great shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m kind of wondering how fast this will go through the batteries.</li>
            <li> it were great although I only used one of them.</li>
            <li> A smooth finish.</li>
            <li> It has a nice, solid feel to it, with a rubberized grip that&#x27;s a nice touch.</li>
            <li> The three combs that come with the trimmer are too close in size to be very useful or versatile.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy and quick to change the heads, so that&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to try out this model which has a longer reach.</li>
            <li> Pro&#x27;s - super light.</li>
            <li> It says a lot that most of the positive reviews say &amp;#34;for the money&amp;#34; in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shaver attachment shaves pretty close and is easy to get accurate with your beard or whatever.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has a full beard</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is not for a full face shave .</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a good trimmer</li>
            <li> I really like and would love to buy another to carry it during my travel.</li>
            <li> The foil shaver is my least favorite part, but it&#x27;s still a great feature.</li>
            <li> overall, this is a great value, and works really well.  </li>
            <li> It did not have a stand, bag, or cover for the trimmer head so either you store it in the reddish plastic packaging that it came in, let things potentially roll around freely in the drawer, or provide your own bag.ad size).</li>
            <li> It did not have a stand, bag, or cover for the trimmer head so either you store it in the reddish plastic packaging that it came in, let things potentially roll around freely in the drawer, or provide your own bag.</li>
            <li> They liked that it cut cleanly at their selected length (using the spacers) without tugging or pulling on facial hair.</li>
            <li> Did I say it&#x27;s really small and light - again, great for travel.</li>
            <li> So far, I have only used one and have been very pleased with it, as my beard has look so much better</li>
            <li> it has a surprisingly powerful motor.</li>
            <li> The set comes with three precision combs that help you find the distinct look you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> This is a daily styler for keeping everything nice and groomed.  </li>
            <li> That said it took about a minute to get it right.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a detail shaver attachment should you need one and a AA battery to get you trimming right away.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s always consistent.</li>
            <li> briefly tried the foil shaver attachment and it worked OK</li>
            <li> No, but only because I find my standard Wahl to be more versatile, (read, more than just a beard trimmer.)</li>
            <li> Very convenient and powerful.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was this hurt, quite a lot.</li>
            <li> So I did the 3mm and it seemed ok -- it wasn&#x27;t too short.</li>
            <li> Great for small beard like mine; trims very well.</li>
            <li> THE Norelco works fine for touch up trim work  but requires too much time for a complete beard trim.</li>
            <li> So far so good, so I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a new styler to try out that won&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it uses real batteries instead of needing charged and then the internal battery eventually dies.  </li>
            <li> One is for detailed shaving and the other is a clippers for fine edge work.</li>
            <li> after trying this, instead of a close beard, he had more of a long 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li> The GoStyler feels solid, much more so than my last trimmer (a cheap Remington).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> honestly it smacks as average.</li>
            <li> The two heads swap out easily with a twist of the unit, similar to how the battery</li>
            <li> It seemed to miss fine hairs even after several passes.</li>
            <li> But I took the battery out, put it back together, and it&#x27;s worked fine since.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco GoStyler is a fine facial trimmer.</li>
            <li> But overall fits my need just fine.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing little clipper.</li>
            <li> The different beard combs came in handy when I wanted to try out a different lengths, and in general it stayed clean and did not need much upkeep in-between clippings.</li>
            <li> The unit runs off batteries and is very portable.</li>
            <li> In 2015 I would say I expected more.</li>
            <li> So very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> But, for travel and basic clean up, this is easy and fast and at a fantastically low price.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t got to fast.</li>
            <li> He had to shave the whole thing off</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> machine is small and easy to fit in shaving kit.  </li>
            <li> Charging is easy, and charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The key word here great for SMALL beards.  </li>
            <li> motor is strong and the default, detail blade is sharp and precise; I get the overall feel that although quite affordable it&#x27;s still a well made product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since it is smaller than the hair trimmer I use for the bulk of the haircut, it is much easier to handle and actually does much more precision</li>
            <li> and there it is obviously not meant for a full shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have a small beard or a 5 oclock shadow and looking for something cheap to keep your lines clean, give this a look.  </li>
            <li> If grow little facial hair or looking for something to edge you up and clean up the lines on your beard, compare to most, this may meet your needs.  </li>
            <li> The different clips provide many options for trimming facial hair, and the &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34; does not irritate the skin</li>
            <li> This is made of high quality.</li>
            <li> The packaging itself isn&#x27;t a suitable case for regular use, so you end up finding a pouch or case of your own--or leaving the parts loose.</li>
            <li> Blades are sharp and trim easily, and I have yet to get &amp;#34;bitten&amp;#34; in any way.  </li>
            <li> I do wish they had a few more length settings.</li>
            <li> After reading the instructions (more pictures than words) and doing some experimenting, I concluded that even for touch-ups on &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; length hair, you&#x27;re supposed to use the &amp;#34;precision trimmer head&amp;#34; to get the hair nearly at skin level and then use the &amp;#34;detail shaving head&amp;#34; to remove the remaining hair down to the &amp;#34;baby smooth&amp;#34; feel.</li>
            <li> The tricky part was getting it back up and lined up correctly to turn it to the right to close it.</li>
            <li> bare trimmer tines are medium fineness meaning they aren&#x27;t super close together, or very coarsely spaced, either.</li>
            <li> The head is compact enough that shaping my beard is pretty effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it did work pretty well to shave close to the outline of my facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I keep a consistent five o&#x27;clock shadow, so I always rely on stylers and trimmers to keep my stubble looking solid.</li>
            <li> None of the men in this house have a beard, but they are always constantly using this cheap little touch up trimmer my husband keeps around to clean up the back of his neck and his sideburns.</li>
            <li> For 15 dollars or so this is a very useful little beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have the unit together properly, as far as I could tell.</li>
            <li> It looked like I went and had it done by a professional.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it for heavy shaving but it does the detailed work well.</li>
            <li> The beard trimming attachments really don&#x27;t give you an option that keeps your beard or goatee cropped very short.</li>
            <li> The guys all agree this is a big improvement for just a few dollars more.</li>
            <li> It never pulled skin, or pinched, it was plently powerful enough on only 2 batteries, and can be ran under water.</li>
            <li> The head is a little small for everyday use, but I would mostly use this as a travel item because it is more convenient than taking my large trimmer and another one I use for edges.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin, it&#x27;s light and it has three adjustable attachments to pick the right of amount of Leonid</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic little tool!</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and quiet, and the motor is surprisingly powerful, given the fact that the unit runs on a single &amp;#34;AA&amp;#34; battery.</li>
            <li> Recommended for guys with scruff; the combs are a little too short to accurately trim a beard.</li>
            <li> For the selling price there isn&#x27;t much more that could be expected out of this little grooming tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having the different length attachments really helps with getting the back, around the ears, and the ever-important sides, all neat and looking good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While it still runs on battery (which I hate), it has more features and runs better.</li>
            <li> They snap on easily and hold on without wiggling, but I don&#x27;t know how they&#x27;d react if &amp;#34;combed&amp;#34; through a thick beard.</li>
            <li> No other trimmer</li>
            <li> It is extremely easy to use and the end result is a well styled stubble that I had a harder time achieving with previous stylers.</li>
            <li> I especially like the small head that allows me to precisely groom my beard and shape it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using just the bare trimmer head</li>
            <li> and I got nearly the same result.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I used it, it would stop working each time that I  turned it upside down.</li>
            <li> This is a very inexpensive trimmer and works well enough for us as a family, but if you have a beard and are going to be using something every single day I might look somewhere else.</li>
            <li> other head option that should really have been included would have been and</li>
            <li> However, it did take several passes from different directions to get an area completely &amp;#34;baby smooth&amp;#34; with the detail shaving head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few of these small trimmers/detailers, and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Trimmers are small enough to fit in and get all the angles right, and the shaver is small enough to get into those small areas around the mouth.  </li>
            <li> I think the motor will have a short life but 30 days isn&#x27;t really long enough to tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me it was either too long or too short, I gave my eyebrows a crew cut.....</li>
            <li> We put it back in the original package, but that&#x27;s not ideal.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it uses a battery, which on the plus side means no cord, but I really would rather have a rechargeable one instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Considering the razor only runs on a single AA battery</li>
            <li> last trimmer used a single AAA but this one uses a AA.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works on sideburns and other facial hair, but doesn&#x27;t provide quite the same effect as a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got mine for free, and I&#x27;m sorry that I did.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about it because it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have much trouble trimming my beard from nearly a month of growth (about 3/4\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> Wish I had one of these a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Charge lasts a long time; flexibility: trimmer, 3 beard combs, mini foil shaver.</li>
            <li> motor seems a little weak compared to other trimmers I have used, (Mangroomer wins so far)</li>
            <li> My old trimmer--which is smaller than this one!--is getting dull after years of periodic use.</li>
            <li> it does a reasonable job cutting in and making the edges straight and even.</li>
            <li> It finally popped right off when I twisted a flat-head screw driver in the resisting part--screw driver not included.</li>
            <li> down to about 1/4\\&quot; length using the middle size comb.</li>
            <li> Those Communist eyebrows watched ratcheted up and down like window shades  in the presence of any American movie star, convinced those of us baby boomers that when we began to reach our dotage, we would have close-cropped brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading up on some helpful Amazon reviews to get the batteries installed (you have to twist the bottom of the trimmer to the left then pull the bottom of the trimmer down), I was set to give this styler a try.</li>
            <li> Of course it took a number of passes to get all the whiskers a uniform length, but that&#x27;s typical for every trimmer made - especially when you start out</li>
            <li> It was a little tricky installing the AA battery because you have to twist the bottom of the trimmer to the left</li>
            <li> simple little unit</li>
            <li> I usually use the bare trimmer head to shave around the rest of my face because I like a bit of a \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; look.</li>
            <li> has ever been this rough on my face.</li>
            <li> Not a problem and didn&#x27;t take long, but I could do it faster and with fewer steps with my previous trimmer</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not always the result with other trimmers.</li>
            <li> The only thing this micro clippers needs is a small bag to store it all in.</li>
            <li> I have a small trimmer with a similar sized head</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a female, but I was looking for a &amp;#34;personal trimmer&amp;#34; to do touch-ups on small areas.</li>
            <li> Two other people (including a man) tried to remove it and couldn&#x27;t get one side to release.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the foil shaver that differentiates this device over other trimmers.</li>
            <li> Our Remington kit does a solid job overall, but it&#x27;s really tough trimming around the ears.</li>
            <li> could be average.</li>
            <li> Other than making a bit of mess at the bathroom sink (but my beard is to blame for that, not the trimmer)</li>
            <li> If I have any problems down the road I will update this review.</li>
            <li> then pull the bottom of the trimmer down.</li>
            <li> my previous Norelco.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, not good for the facial hair, but I am keeping it for myself for hair... not on my face.</li>
            <li> For it being battery operated it has a little power.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this little beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> He even used it to do a little trimming of his sideburns after he cut his hair with his hair clippers.</li>
            <li> A few length attachments are included for length adjustment.</li>
            <li> We have quite a few Philips Norelco products already (like the nose trimmer), so picking this brand was a no-brainer  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin, quiet, and portable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that means until the battery is dead or until the battery is ineffective for &amp;#34;high power&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> principal use seems to be to mow down eyebrows bent on imitating the those of the late Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev.</li>
            <li> : I usually trim my goatee at 3.5 mm.</li>
            <li> I guess at least there&#x27;s no danger of the screen falling off while you use it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The two heads are &amp;#34;flat heads&amp;#34; where they touch the skin and have about a 3/4&amp;#34; wide cutting surface (or 21mm or 13/16&amp;#34; head size).</li>
            <li> For fifth-teen dollars you cannot go wrong with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The foil head that comes with this kit does a mediocre job.</li>
            <li> Sadly, though, the longest setting is still too close of a shave for my guy to use to keep his beard neat.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to say this is bad thing.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how painful this was to use.</li>
            <li> You will be disappointed if thats what you thinking</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>

            <li> This is by far the best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used. I find it easy to maneuver even in tricky areas. My beard is left even, close and it&#x27;s always consistent. That&#x27;s not always the result with other trimmers. The foil shaver is my least favorite part, but it&#x27;s still a great feature.</li>
            <li> This styler is just what we needed. My boyfriend has a full beard but he was always trimming each side of his face in an nonsymmetrical way because he couldn&#x27;t get into the grooves properly with his regular beard tripper.  This norelco has a great grip, it&#x27;s easy to manuver, cordless which is awesome and only takes one battery. Will be great for travel. Even without using the different combs it was perfect for his needs. It&#x27;s definitely going to become part of his regular beard maintenance! The only thing we didn&#x27;t like was there was no storage bag or holder. We put it back in the original package, but that&#x27;s not ideal.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, intuitive and worked like a charm, according to the men in my household. No problems whatsoever. They liked that it cut cleanly at their selected length (using the spacers) without tugging or pulling on facial hair. It cleans easily as well.</li>
            <li> It says a lot that most of the positive reviews say &amp;#34;for the money&amp;#34; in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this is a cheaply made, disposable item. If you can&#x27;t afford a clipper that will last, you can&#x27;t afford one that won&#x27;t. I got mine for free, and I&#x27;m sorry that I did. If I&#x27;d paid closer attention to the description, I&#x27;d have known better.</li>
            <li> Around my house, we cut the boys&#x27; hair ourselves. Our Remington kit does a solid job overall, but it&#x27;s really tough trimming around the ears. This battery-powered Norelco is perfect for the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works on sideburns and other facial hair, but doesn&#x27;t provide quite the same effect as a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, depending on your application, could be awesome...could be average.</li>
            <li> For 15 dollars or so this is a very useful little beard trimmer. It only comes with 3 length adjustment combs so you don&#x27;t get a ton of beard length options but these are fine for 95% of men. Considering the razor only runs on a single AA battery it has a surprisingly powerful motor. I didn&#x27;t have much trouble trimming my beard from nearly a month of growth (about 3/4\\&quot;) down to about 1/4\\&quot; length using the middle size comb. Of course it took a number of passes to get all the whiskers a uniform length, but that&#x27;s typical for every trimmer made - especially when you start out so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using just the bare trimmer head it does a reasonable job cutting in and making the edges straight and even. The head is compact enough that shaping my beard is pretty effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bare trimmer tines are medium fineness meaning they aren&#x27;t super close together, or very coarsely spaced, either. I usually use the bare trimmer head to shave around the rest of my face because I like a bit of a \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; look. Finer tines would be more effective for this application, but the  GoStyler did a pretty good job anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I briefly tried the foil shaver attachment and it worked OK, I guess. I&#x27;m not a big fan of these on any razor as they take forever to get a close shave and you end up with irritation from repeated passes over your face. But it did work pretty well to shave close to the outline of my facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is OK, I got about 3 or 4 uses before the alkaline battery needed replacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star off for not even including a cheap pouch to store everything in. It&#x27;s inevitable pieces will be lost without a pouch. I ended up putting everything in a small Ziploc, but that&#x27;s pretty inelegant. But overall this is a great shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** RECOMMENDED! - 4 STAR ****</li>
            <li> Great product.  I love the fact that it uses real batteries instead of needing charged and then the internal battery eventually dies.  For fifth-teen dollars you cannot go wrong with this trimmer.  It is a great value.</li>
            <li> None of the men in this house have a beard, but they are always constantly using this cheap little touch up trimmer my husband keeps around to clean up the back of his neck and his sideburns. The guys all agree this is a big improvement for just a few dollars more. It is easy to change out the attachments and the longer handle makes it easier to hold. I have even used the foil razor attachment and while it does work it is not the best. It seemed to miss fine hairs even after several passes. This is a very inexpensive trimmer and works well enough for us as a family, but if you have a beard and are going to be using something every single day I might look somewhere else.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing little clipper. It has 2 attachments and both are for very fine detail work on beards and sideburns. One is for detailed shaving and the other is a clippers for fine edge work. The unit runs off batteries and is very portable. A few length attachments are included for length adjustment. The only thing this micro clippers needs is a small bag to store it all in. Aside form that it&#x27;s a home run. Perfect for travel too!</li>
            <li> Good trimmer, replaced a rechargeable Norelco trimmer that I had. I do notice that it&#x27;s much more &amp;#34;underpowered&amp;#34; than my rechargeable one. Even right out of the box, it just kind of seems to be dying, almost like my Norelco does when it needs to be charged. So I&#x27;m kind of wondering how fast this will go through the batteries. The two heads swap out easily with a twist of the unit, similar to how the battery changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, it would stop working each time that I  turned it upside down. I have the unit together properly, as far as I could tell. But I took the battery out, put it back together, and it&#x27;s worked fine since. The foil shaver is a nice addition, and not something that my Norelco had. The guards go on and come off easily. Overall, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good trimmer. I&#x27;ll update review if the battery life isn&#x27;t satisfactory.</li>
            <li> A good trimmer, but honestly it smacks as average. In 2015 I would say I expected more.</li>
            <li> While I know that this is intended as a beard trimmer, I&#x27;ve been using it for some nice neat trim work when I cut the fella&#x27;s hair.  Having the different length attachments really helps with getting the back, around the ears, and the ever-important sides, all neat and looking good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it is smaller than the hair trimmer I use for the bulk of the haircut, it is much easier to handle and actually does much more precision work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint is that it uses a battery, which on the plus side means no cord, but I really would rather have a rechargeable one instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall, this is a great value, and works really well.  We have quite a few Philips Norelco products already (like the nose trimmer), so picking this brand was a no-brainer  They&#x27;ve always been reliable with good warranties and long-lasting quality products.</li>
            <li> This PHILIPS NORELCO GoStyler is an excellent product. I just received it today so I can&#x27;t speak for the longevity of this trimmer. If I have any problems down the road I will update this review. It was a little tricky installing the AA battery because you have to twist the bottom of the trimmer to the left then pull the bottom of the trimmer down. The tricky part was getting it back up and lined up correctly to turn it to the right to close it. That said it took about a minute to get it right. The trimmer itself is OUTSTANDING!! It has great power and cuts flawlessly. I trimmed my mustache/goatee and sideburns with perfection. It looked like I went and had it done by a professional. The 3 precision combs that came with it were great although I only used one of them. It also comes with a detail shaver attachment should you need one and a AA battery to get you trimming right away. This trimmer is the perfect size and weight and is VERY easy to work with. I would pay DOUBLE the price for this trimmer, it is $19.58 here on amazon today. If you need a trimmer don&#x27;t let this great price fool you, BUY IT. I am going to order another one just as a spare, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> Works great as timmer for established beard trimming. This is not for a full face shave . You will be disappointed if thats what you thinking</li>
            <li> Good item although I should say that it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of choices only  S, M, L + you have one more if you don&#x27;t want any of these measures. I love it honestly for that i am giving it 5 stars</li>
            <li> Update. I don&#x27;t want to say this is bad thing. But since i have so fragile skin, it is not for me.I just like experiment. My fault. Not anymore. This is my face:) I still healing. My dermatologist prescribed me Desonide ointment and i am using it on daily basis. Still need some time to heal. Forgot one more thing, now i use Face Bake anti aging self tanning lotion for face, to cover imperfection.Works good. Feels good.  Marina</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about it because it was so cheap. For it being battery operated it has a little power. I don&#x27;t use it for heavy shaving but it does the detailed work well.</li>
            <li> Low priced and great lines, this is a great trimmer for guys on the go. It&#x27;s thin, quiet, and portable. It never pulled skin, or pinched, it was plently powerful enough on only 2 batteries, and can be ran under water. So very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;Will it replace my plug in standard trimmer? No, but only because I find my standard Wahl to be more versatile, (read, more than just a beard trimmer.) But, for travel and basic clean up, this is easy and fast and at a fantastically low price.</li>
            <li> Wish I had one of these a long time ago. Very convenient and powerful. Don&#x27;t got to fast. I cut my lip trimming my mustache.</li>
            <li> Ouch! I have a small trimmer with a similar sized head so I was excited to try out this model which has a longer reach. I don&#x27;t shave, I go for the close scruff look done with no attachments on the trimmer. The first thing I noticed was this hurt, quite a lot. It didn&#x27;t get better as I did both cheeks and around my goatee. I couldn&#x27;t believe how painful this was to use. No other trimmer and I&#x27;ve used many over the decades, has ever been this rough on my face. The three combs that come with the trimmer are too close in size to be very useful or versatile. The foil head that comes with this kit does a mediocre job. After going over my face with the trimmer the foil head seemed to take off next to nothing and left my face looking like a clipper cut.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s excellent.....A smooth finish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not all that.  When you read the product description you think that this devise may be the end all to a number of men&#x27;s grooming challenges.  The main until works well, the four attachments less so.  The razor is woefully underpowered and unless you attacking peach fuzz you can forget about it.  The beard trimming attachments really don&#x27;t give you an option that keeps your beard or goatee cropped very short.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty handy trimmer with some caveats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s powered by an AA battery.  I would prefer rechargeable.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with 3 trimmer guards for 3 different lengths of trim.  I would like an adjustable slider or something more than just 3 choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s pretty nice.  It&#x27;s easy to trim close.  The shaver attachment shaves pretty close and is easy to get accurate with your beard or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;The machine is small and easy to fit in shaving kit.  It does not come with any kind of travel case.</li>
            <li> There are lots of these gizmos around. This is one of the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The principal use seems to be to mow down eyebrows bent on imitating the those of the late Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev. Those Communist eyebrows watched ratcheted up and down like window shades  in the presence of any American movie star, convinced those of us baby boomers that when we began to reach our dotage, we would have close-cropped brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this is the device to use. It&#x27;s thin, it&#x27;s light and it has three adjustable attachments to pick the right of amount of Leonid you want to present. (My vote is no Brezhnev, and unlike the citizens of the former Soviet Union, my no vote is actually counted).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s battery powered which means you can use it in the shower, a good feature.</li>
            <li> Really love this trimmer. Much better model then my previous Norelco. While it still runs on battery (which I hate), it has more features and runs better. It isn&#x27;t a shaver per say but it is recommended to use to ease shaving. Basically, use this to help your shave go smoother.</li>
            <li> It seems to work okay. The head is narrower than I had thought it would be. Which still would have been okay. Sadly, though, the longest setting is still too close of a shave for my guy to use to keep his beard neat. after trying this, instead of a close beard, he had more of a long 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. He had to shave the whole thing off after.&lt;br /&gt;So, not good for the facial hair, but I am keeping it for myself for hair... not on my face.</li>
            <li> THE Norelco works fine for touch up trim work  but requires too much time for a complete beard trim. It is very good as long as you use it for the job it was intended to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few of these small trimmers/detailers, and this one is my favorite. It has a nice, solid feel to it, with a rubberized grip that&#x27;s a nice touch. The size, shape and angle of the head are perfect for keeping edges straight and neat. It&#x27;s a great set for the price. The only thing missing--and the only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5--is some kind of reusable carrying case. The packaging itself isn&#x27;t a suitable case for regular use, so you end up finding a pouch or case of your own--or leaving the parts loose. Add a case, and it&#x27;d be perfect.</li>
            <li> Worked to trim my goatee just like  was hoping when I bought it.</li>
            <li> Awesome groomer well made</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco GoStyler is a fine facial trimmer. The different beard combs came in handy when I wanted to try out a different lengths, and in general it stayed clean and did not need much upkeep in-between clippings. Recommended for guys with scruff; the combs are a little too short to accurately trim a beard.</li>
            <li> I have been using for a while and it&#x27;s really handy and works perfect.</li>
            <li> This review is based on feedback from my husband, who used this to maintain his goatee:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It includes a battery, which is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Instructions indicate there is a 45 day money back guarantee if not satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* There are 3 trimming lengths: 1mm, 3mm, 5mm&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comments: I usually trim my goatee at 3.5 mm. So I did the 3mm and it seemed ok -- it wasn&#x27;t too short. The unit is lightweight. The head is a little small for everyday use, but I would mostly use this as a travel item because it is more convenient than taking my large trimmer and another one I use for edges. I do wish they had a few more length settings. Overall, it is a good trimmer but I wish it was a bit wider and had more options for trim length.</li>
            <li> For the selling price there isn&#x27;t much more that could be expected out of this little grooming tool.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;Washable heads&lt;br /&gt;Single battery&lt;br /&gt;Small razor head effective for light touchup here and there it is obviously not meant for a full shave.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Loud&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer blade heads could use a couple,of,different options for hair length. For me it was either too long or too short, I gave my eyebrows a crew cut.....&lt;br /&gt;One other head option that should really have been included would have been and ear/nose hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;The motor seems a little weak compared to other trimmers I have used, (Mangroomer wins so far) I think the motor will have a short life but 30 days isn&#x27;t really long enough to tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the price level for this item the addition of the different hair length trimmer heads and the ear/nose head would have pushed it into 5 star territory.&lt;br /&gt;A simple little unit but it is not a stand alone product.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this little beard trimmer. It is lightweight and quiet, and the motor is surprisingly powerful, given the fact that the unit runs on a single &amp;#34;AA&amp;#34; battery. He felt it did a very good job. He even used it to do a little trimming of his sideburns after he cut his hair with his hair clippers. The price cannot be beat. Try it. I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The GoStyler feels solid, much more so than my last trimmer (a cheap Remington).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last trimmer used a single AAA but this one uses a AA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor is strong and the default, detail blade is sharp and precise; I get the overall feel that although quite affordable it&#x27;s still a well made product. I also love the fact that it&#x27;s waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I&#x27;m very impressed thus far and I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Have tried several brands. This is made of high quality. I really like and would love to buy another to carry it during my travel. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Works great, takes care of all my beard and mustache needs.  Trimmers are small enough to fit in and get all the angles right, and the shaver is small enough to get into those small areas around the mouth.  Blades are sharp and trim easily, and I have yet to get &amp;#34;bitten&amp;#34; in any way.  I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Cuts great, quiet, easy to travel with.  Bring batteries!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a female, but I was looking for a &amp;#34;personal trimmer&amp;#34; to do touch-ups on small areas. My old trimmer--which is smaller than this one!--is getting dull after years of periodic use. After reading the instructions (more pictures than words) and doing some experimenting, I concluded that even for touch-ups on &amp;#34;stubble&amp;#34; length hair, you&#x27;re supposed to use the &amp;#34;precision trimmer head&amp;#34; to get the hair nearly at skin level and then use the &amp;#34;detail shaving head&amp;#34; to remove the remaining hair down to the &amp;#34;baby smooth&amp;#34; feel. It&#x27;s easy and quick to change the heads, so that&#x27;s not a problem. However, it did take several passes from different directions to get an area completely &amp;#34;baby smooth&amp;#34; with the detail shaving head. Not a problem and didn&#x27;t take long, but I could do it faster and with fewer steps with my previous trimmer and I got nearly the same result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also couldn&#x27;t get the screen part of the shaving head off to dump the shavings, which you&#x27;re supposed to do after each use. Two other people (including a man) tried to remove it and couldn&#x27;t get one side to release. It finally popped right off when I twisted a flat-head screw driver in the resisting part--screw driver not included. I guess at least there&#x27;s no danger of the screen falling off while you use it.  I would have given the GoStyler four stars if I&#x27;d been able to get this screen off by hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not being a man and not having a male with facial hair nearby, I can&#x27;t test the beard attachments. They snap on easily and hold on without wiggling, but I don&#x27;t know how they&#x27;d react if &amp;#34;combed&amp;#34; through a thick beard. The motor is driven by a AA battery (included) and they estimate that it&#x27;ll give 2 hours of use. I don&#x27;t know if that means until the battery is dead or until the battery is ineffective for &amp;#34;high power&amp;#34; jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two heads are &amp;#34;flat heads&amp;#34; where they touch the skin and have about a 3/4&amp;#34; wide cutting surface (or 21mm or 13/16&amp;#34; head size). In the package, you also get the battery, cleaning brush, 3/16&amp;#34; comb, 1/8&amp;#34; comb, and 3/64&amp;#34; comb attachments and the shaver body. It did not have a stand, bag, or cover for the trimmer head so either you store it in the reddish plastic packaging that it came in, let things potentially roll around freely in the drawer, or provide your own bag.ad size). In the package, you also get the battery, cleaning brush, 3/16&amp;#34; comb, 1/8&amp;#34; comb, and 3/64&amp;#34; comb attachments and the shaver body.

            <li> This is a fantastic little tool! The different clips provide many options for trimming facial hair, and the &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34; does not irritate the skin/pull at hair like many trimmers do. The unit itself looks sturdy -- not the best material (plastic, of course), but easy-to-clean and very portable (for travel, etc.). Charging is easy, and charge lasts a long time. Overall, a great product!</li>
            <li> I keep a consistent five o&#x27;clock shadow, so I always rely on stylers and trimmers to keep my stubble looking solid. After reading up on some helpful Amazon reviews to get the batteries installed (you have to twist the bottom of the trimmer to the left then pull the bottom of the trimmer down), I was set to give this styler a try. The set comes with three precision combs that help you find the distinct look you&#x27;re looking for. So far, I have only used one and have been very pleased with it, as my beard has look so much better kept up since I started using this styler. It is extremely easy to use and the end result is a well styled stubble that I had a harder time achieving with previous stylers. So far so good, so I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a new styler to try out that won&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> Great for small beard like mine; trims very well. The key word here great for SMALL beards.  I have more of a 5 o clock shadow so this is perfect for me.  If grow little facial hair or looking for something to edge you up and clean up the lines on your beard, compare to most, this may meet your needs.  This is a daily styler for keeping everything nice and groomed.  If you go a couple of days without shaving and grow a lot of facial hair, look elsewhere.  If you have a small beard or a 5 oclock shadow and looking for something cheap to keep your lines clean, give this a look.  It would have been better if it had been rechargeable. But overall fits my need just fine.</li>
            <li> Pro&#x27;s - super light. Charge lasts a long time; flexibility: trimmer, 3 beard combs, mini foil shaver. It&#x27;s the foil shaver that differentiates this device over other trimmers. This trims and shaves. Saves me carrying two devices when I travel. Did I say it&#x27;s really small and light - again, great for travel.</li>
            <li> I love how handy this cordless trimmer/styler is. Other than making a bit of mess at the bathroom sink (but my beard is to blame for that, not the trimmer), it&#x27;s perfect. I especially like the small head that allows me to precisely groom my beard and shape it. Because of its handy size, it&#x27;s great for travel, too.</li>
