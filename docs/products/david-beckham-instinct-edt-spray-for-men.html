            <li>I love the way he smells!  </li>
            <li>If you were to buy this in store it would cost you a bunch more!</li>
            <li>Nice cologne for going out etc</li>
            <li>this Cologne is really nice , it smells really nice.</li>
            <li>Made a great gift for my love. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>But quite honestly I didn&#x27;t like it one bit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clean, attractive scent.  </li>
            <li>it came quickly and is a great price.    </li>
            <li>This is by far the best one for him.</li>
            <li>It arrived right on time, and was a great buy.</li>
            <li>This cologne is wonderful, just prepare your self to be thrusted into a social situation in which you must act!</li>
            <li>but I love Becks and trusted his taste.</li>
            <li>and I am glad that Amazon sells this in a discount price.</li>
            <li>I just love it when my husband uses this.</li>
            <li>, I just can say is an ok product.</li>
            <li>I love the way he smells with it on.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent of this perfume.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of it.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend thought it was okay</li>
            <li>I bought this because one of my friends is in love with this perfume.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, great presentation, Arrived early, Not as good as the Pure Instinct.</li>
            <li>Good size with a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>I thought smell was pretty good.</li>
            <li>I do love the smell, but he&#x27;s going through it quickly since he has to continue spraying!</li>
            <li>so this is a very nice and amazing cologne, I used to be a fan of Drift from Hollister and while that has been discontinued I was trying to find a scent that I loved as much as that, and I was tempted to get this since I had sampled it a while back...</li>
            <li>This cologne has a fantastic smell that lasts through the day and into the night and most of all my wife loves it.</li>
            <li>To be able to get it here for $16 (down from $55 supposedly) is awesome.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and clean sort of like laundry just out of the dryer, if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very nice scent unlike most overly sweet or perfumey fragrances decidedly male and fresh good for day or evening luvit</li>
            <li>I bought this as a Christmas present for my nephew and he loved it!</li>
            <li>It has a magnetic cap that is easy to take off-but it ain&#x27;t no wuss.</li>
            <li>I am 27 and have a strong sense of smell, so</li>
            <li>This cap is strong and will stay on even if you hold it by the cap and shake it, the cap will stay on.</li>
            <li>The smell is no where near as good and it does not stick for more than 5 mins.</li>
            <li>this product was better priced than online competitors and it arrived just a couple days after I ordered it right before christmas!</li>
            <li>Arrived quick and recommend to all!</li>
            <li>Very good product quality, this is all I expected to get.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I got this for my husband and when he initially sprays it it smells great, but within 30 minutes I can no longer smell it.</li>
            <li>I enjoy purchasing through AMAZON.</li>
            <li>I purchased 2 while the deal&#x27;s still available.</li>
            <li>Overall I would recommend this cologne to any guy looking for a good sent that gets him attention and love from the ladies.</li>
            <li>I originally got this as a present, but bought another one because I got many compliments from girls that I smelled good.</li>
            <li>If you want something more strong and noticeable, try Intimately Beckham.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so unique that people always ask me what perfume am I</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my favorite of the Beckham line because some colognes have an alcohol-like scent when you first put it on.</li>
            <li>Has lost its original fragrance.</li>
            <li>Real chick magnet :)</li>
            <li>Good scent that last all day</li>
            <li>This and Davidoff Cool Water are my favorites.</li>
            <li>still, it&#x27;s one of my favorite scents, and I spray it on twice a day (which means I run out twice as fast...</li>
            <li>Cool bottle design like the magnet cap</li>
            <li>cool feature</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful and subtle.</li>
            <li>DVB has great colognes and isn&#x27;t as well known (let alone used by many, here in the states at least).</li>
            <li>Great fragrance for a man, subtle yet distinctive, lasts 8 or more hours.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth buying this.</li>
            <li>David Beckham is one of my favorite colognes; however, it is not always available at the local stores</li>
            <li>This cologne has a \\&quot;fresh, clean\\&quot; scent is always a hit when I wear it.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell of this - not overpowering, and not one of those heavily musky ones either - just a nice fresh scent that lasts well.</li>
            <li>Clean, crisp, very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>But a couple of spritzes of Instinct after a shower seems just right for me and my chemistry.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my man he loves this smell and the price is so right i bought two of them.</li>
            <li>Shipped on time got it right before christmas.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is a very classic fragrance with fresh, citrus and a hint of spicy notes in it.</li>
            <li>Bottle has the first magnetic cap I&#x27;ve seen on a cologne, which is a cool little feature, and a nice touch.</li>
            <li>Product is great, but customer service sucks.</li>
            <li>More like D&amp;G Teen.</li>
            <li>and it does not last more than an hour.  </li>
            <li>YOUR MARRIED..</li>
            <li>I have tried 3 different colognes in his line and love them all.</li>
            <li>He said this is not quite the same, it is just okay.</li>
            <li>but I will move on to something better next time.</li>
            <li>When this first came out, I purchased some at Rite Aid in a promotional pack that included body wash, and it was $35.</li>
            <li>Cant give this purchase  a higher mark</li>
            <li>I have gone through 2 bottles of this stuff, and it does smell great, but it just doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>Like others have said, for the price, you can&#x27;t really expect a super high quality fragrance though.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a fresh long lasting scent with a hint of musk for a cheap price, this would be an appropriate choice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everything said above is still true, although the scent seems to fade rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>Smells good but does not last long though.</li>
            <li>My husband doesn&#x27;t like anything overpowering, and this is definitely not too strong.  </li>
            <li>Was trying to replace David Beckham Pure Instinct which my husband loves.</li>
            <li>I went back last week for more and found that just the spray alone is now $37 on sale, and that&#x27;s at Rite Aid!</li>
            <li>I have been experimenting with different amounts of squirts, but it seems like no matter how much I put on, the smell goes away quickly unless you stick your nose right where you sprayed it.</li>
            <li>Took only a few days for it to get here and it was packet great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because, as great as the scent is, it only lasts a few hours.</li>
            <li>and he really wanted another bottle.</li>
            <li>I actually really like the smell of it quite a bit.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>thanks again</li>
            <li>I enjoy it and this is my second bottle.</li>
            <li>Shlpping is fast too.</li>
            <li>The reasonable price made my decision easier.</li>
            <li>its really affordable.</li>
            <li>Still pleasant and subtle, I have moved on to a bolder cologne, and have reduced my rating on Instinct from 5 to 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like a cologne scent to last a full 8-hour working day.</li>
            <li>I used a very similarly appraised product which is in similar price range and was satisfied with that.</li>
            <li>A SMOOTH MELLOW SCENT,AND IS NOT LOUD!!</li>
            <li>IF YOUR SINGLE,I HIGHLY RECOMEND</li>
            <li>i highly recommend it .</li>
            <li>The price was great, the shipping was extremely fast, and there was plenty of bubble wrap and protective packaging (No one wants to open a broken Christmas gift!)</li>
            <li>I have over 20 different colongnes and this is by far my favorite because it has a fierce sent like no other (but not fierce enough to scare people away).</li>
            <li>and I will definitely refer back to order more in the future.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seems to be less potent than the one given me as a gift a year earlier.</li>
            <li>I bout this about a month ago just based on reviews because no stores near me had any to sample.</li>
            <li>this because someone said it smelled like D&amp;G masculine.</li>
            <li>The bottle looks classy.  </li>
            <li>This is nearly non-existent by lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Oh wow...</li>
            <li>I have over 100 colognes from expensive to cheap, this one is cheap and it might not be bad, but is not that great either, it does have a soft smell after 30 minutes, but then it loss the aroma</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this cologne especially at this price.  </li>
            <li>The scent stays for a very long time I spray it in the morning and lasts a whole day.</li>
            <li>In stores, a smaller bottle goes for at least $8 dollars more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very universal and professional!</li>
            <li>No regrets buying this product</li>
            <li>I have a little of the original that i bought awhile back and compared it to this, This cologne smells water down.</li>

            <li> Arrived quick and recommend to all!</li>
            <li> Very good product quality, this is all I expected to get.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and when he initially sprays it it smells great, but within 30 minutes I can no longer smell it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy purchasing through AMAZON.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 while the deal&#x27;s still available.</li>
            <li> Overall I would recommend this cologne to any guy looking for a good sent that gets him attention and love from the ladies.</li>
            <li> I originally got this as a present, but bought another one because I got many compliments from girls that I smelled good.</li>
            <li> If you want something more strong and noticeable, try Intimately Beckham.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so unique that people always ask me what perfume am I</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my favorite of the Beckham line because some colognes have an alcohol-like scent when you first put it on.</li>
            <li> Has lost its original fragrance.</li>
            <li> Real chick magnet :)</li>
            <li> Good scent that last all day</li>
            <li> This and Davidoff Cool Water are my favorites.</li>
            <li> still, it&#x27;s one of my favorite scents, and I spray it on twice a day (which means I run out twice as fast...</li>
            <li> Cool bottle design like the magnet cap</li>
            <li> cool feature</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful and subtle.</li>
            <li> DVB has great colognes and isn&#x27;t as well known (let alone used by many, here in the states at least).</li>
            <li> Great fragrance for a man, subtle yet distinctive, lasts 8 or more hours.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth buying this.</li>
            <li> David Beckham is one of my favorite colognes; however, it is not always available at the local stores</li>
            <li> This cologne has a \\&quot;fresh, clean\\&quot; scent is always a hit when I wear it.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell of this - not overpowering, and not one of those heavily musky ones either - just a nice fresh scent that lasts well.</li>
            <li> Clean, crisp, very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> But a couple of spritzes of Instinct after a shower seems just right for me and my chemistry.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my man he loves this smell and the price is so right i bought two of them.</li>
            <li> Shipped on time got it right before christmas.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is a very classic fragrance with fresh, citrus and a hint of spicy notes in it.</li>
            <li> Bottle has the first magnetic cap I&#x27;ve seen on a cologne, which is a cool little feature, and a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Product is great, but customer service sucks.</li>
            <li> More like D&amp;G Teen.</li>
            <li> and it does not last more than an hour.  </li>
            <li> YOUR MARRIED..</li>
            <li> I have tried 3 different colognes in his line and love them all.</li>
            <li> He said this is not quite the same, it is just okay.</li>
            <li> but I will move on to something better next time.</li>
            <li> When this first came out, I purchased some at Rite Aid in a promotional pack that included body wash, and it was $35.</li>
            <li> Cant give this purchase  a higher mark</li>
            <li> I have gone through 2 bottles of this stuff, and it does smell great, but it just doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, for the price, you can&#x27;t really expect a super high quality fragrance though.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a fresh long lasting scent with a hint of musk for a cheap price, this would be an appropriate choice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everything said above is still true, although the scent seems to fade rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> Smells good but does not last long though.</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t like anything overpowering, and this is definitely not too strong.  </li>
            <li> Was trying to replace David Beckham Pure Instinct which my husband loves.</li>
            <li> I went back last week for more and found that just the spray alone is now $37 on sale, and that&#x27;s at Rite Aid!</li>
            <li> I have been experimenting with different amounts of squirts, but it seems like no matter how much I put on, the smell goes away quickly unless you stick your nose right where you sprayed it.</li>
            <li> Took only a few days for it to get here and it was packet great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because, as great as the scent is, it only lasts a few hours.</li>
            <li> and he really wanted another bottle.</li>
            <li> I actually really like the smell of it quite a bit.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> thanks again</li>
            <li> I enjoy it and this is my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Shlpping is fast too.</li>
            <li> The reasonable price made my decision easier.</li>
            <li> its really affordable.</li>
            <li> Still pleasant and subtle, I have moved on to a bolder cologne, and have reduced my rating on Instinct from 5 to 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like a cologne scent to last a full 8-hour working day.</li>
            <li> I used a very similarly appraised product which is in similar price range and was satisfied with that.</li>
            <li> A SMOOTH MELLOW SCENT,AND IS NOT LOUD!!</li>
            <li> IF YOUR SINGLE,I HIGHLY RECOMEND</li>
            <li> i highly recommend it .</li>
            <li> The price was great, the shipping was extremely fast, and there was plenty of bubble wrap and protective packaging (No one wants to open a broken Christmas gift!)</li>
            <li> I have over 20 different colongnes and this is by far my favorite because it has a fierce sent like no other (but not fierce enough to scare people away).</li>
            <li> and I will definitely refer back to order more in the future.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seems to be less potent than the one given me as a gift a year earlier.</li>
            <li> I bout this about a month ago just based on reviews because no stores near me had any to sample.</li>
            <li> this because someone said it smelled like D&amp;G masculine.</li>
            <li> The bottle looks classy.  </li>
            <li> This is nearly non-existent by lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oh wow...</li>
            <li> I have over 100 colognes from expensive to cheap, this one is cheap and it might not be bad, but is not that great either, it does have a soft smell after 30 minutes, but then it loss the aroma</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this cologne especially at this price.  </li>
            <li> The scent stays for a very long time I spray it in the morning and lasts a whole day.</li>
            <li> In stores, a smaller bottle goes for at least $8 dollars more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very universal and professional!</li>
            <li> No regrets buying this product</li>
            <li> I have a little of the original that i bought awhile back and compared it to this, This cologne smells water down.</li>
            <li> Has a hint of a more expensive cologne that&#x27;s in a tall and flat tapered bottle that sounds similar to &#x27;Mr Miyagi&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Hard to find at reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Smells like it has been sitting to long on the shelf.  </li>
            <li> no staind it dont last long as other cologns</li>
            <li> Not thrilled, doesn&#x27;t smell like the real thing or is really aged and fragrance has evaporated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a subtle but really distinct scent, and it&#x27;s something he can wear everyday.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding colognes that suit my husband&#x27;s natural body scent.</li>
            <li> This is a very soft, subtle scent.</li>
            <li> It is a rather subtle scent that blends with rather than overpowers one&#x27;s natural chemistry.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s odd to me that I can&#x27;t smell this for very long!</li>
            <li> No metrosexual me, and heavy use of colognes or perfumes by either sex triggers an instinctual avoidance response (and a minor asthma attack) on my part.  </li>
            <li> recommend to other buyers those are thinking to buy that.</li>
            <li> It is Good, the worst part is having to tell you that in 19 words.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of Dunhil Edition (old school now discontinued,, i was heart broken)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not great at explaining scents (as far as the notes in there), however I can say that cologne is on the citrus side.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I had previously gotten one for my dad from JCPenny, but for some reason they&#x27;re not carrying it anymore</li>
            <li> It only takes a little bit, so don&#x27;t bathe in it!!!</li>
            <li> I.E. watered down!</li>
            <li> I got this for my fiance&#x27; who wears it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I have had it for a week now and noticed that like others it wears off in a few hours.</li>
            <li> but I was not a huge fan.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in the store, so this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> To me the fragrance is common like and doesn&#x27;t smell too tasty.</li>
            <li> Ordered three bottles of the David Beckham cologne and one of the bottles was broken when I opened the box.</li>
            <li> It is subtle and inviting and makes me want to snuggle his neck (or where ever he puts it!)  </li>
            <li> Oh well, at least it wasn&#x27;t too expensive!</li>
            <li> But not awesome, either.&lt;br /&gt;Bought</li>
            <li> At the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> It was actually a blind buy</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s quite difficult to find in the US</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this selection!</li>
            <li> It is 100% crap</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great cologne for the price. Real chick magnet :)</li>
            <li> love this cologn, is the 4th time i buy it!!!! recomended... no staind it dont last long as other cologns but it does last</li>
            <li> Ordered three bottles of the David Beckham cologne and one of the bottles was broken when I opened the box. Sent two emails to AAA perfume and they have never issued  a response. Had to go through my credit card company to try and get things resolved. Product is great, but customer service sucks.</li>
            <li> In stores, a smaller bottle goes for at least $8 dollars more. It arrived right on time, and was a great buy.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I had previously gotten one for my dad from JCPenny, but for some reason they&#x27;re not carrying it anymore and he really wanted another bottle. Took only a few days for it to get here and it was packet great. Would def. buy again.</li>
            <li> bought this for my boyfriend whom I already knew loved the scent (as do i!)    it came quickly and is a great price.    definietly reccomend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Beckham&#x27;s Instinct for Men for about 3 years.  No metrosexual me, and heavy use of colognes or perfumes by either sex triggers an instinctual avoidance response (and a minor asthma attack) on my part.  But a couple of spritzes of Instinct after a shower seems just right for me and my chemistry.  It is a rather subtle scent that blends with rather than overpowers one&#x27;s natural chemistry.My wife hates colognes and likes this on me.  Enough said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several years later......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything said above is still true, although the scent seems to fade rather quickly.  Still pleasant and subtle, I have moved on to a bolder cologne, and have reduced my rating on Instinct from 5 to 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JM Tepper</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend as a Christmas present. It&#x27;s a subtle but really distinct scent, and it&#x27;s something he can wear everyday. The price was great, the shipping was extremely fast, and there was plenty of bubble wrap and protective packaging (No one wants to open a broken Christmas gift!) I&#x27;m throughly happy with this purchase and I will definitely refer back to order more in the future.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and when he initially sprays it it smells great, but within 30 minutes I can no longer smell it. Even if he leaves for awhile and comes back home I still do not smell it. I do love the smell, but he&#x27;s going through it quickly since he has to continue spraying! I am 27 and have a strong sense of smell, so it&#x27;s odd to me that I can&#x27;t smell this for very long!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my man he loves this smell and the price is so right i bought two of them. I saved one for his birthday and going to surprise him.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance for a man, subtle yet distinctive, lasts 8 or more hours.  You will be noticed.</li>
            <li> Nice cologne for going out etc</li>
            <li> GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD . It is Good, the worst part is having to tell you that in 19 words. Geezz it was good, sheww[...]</li>
            <li> Very nice scent. Everyone loves it!!</li>
            <li> I bout this about a month ago just based on reviews because no stores near me had any to sample. I actually really like the smell of it quite a bit. The only problem is that it lasts only about an hour, and then no one notices it. I have been experimenting with different amounts of squirts, but it seems like no matter how much I put on, the smell goes away quickly unless you stick your nose right where you sprayed it. Oh well, at least it wasn&#x27;t too expensive!</li>
            <li> This product is the bes quality.It arrived on time and the price is correct. I enjoy purchasing through AMAZON.</li>
            <li> But not awesome, either.&lt;br /&gt;Bought this because someone said it smelled like D&amp;G masculine. More like D&amp;G Teen.</li>
            <li> I originally got this as a present, but bought another one because I got many compliments from girls that I smelled good.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne!!!  Reminds me of Dunhil Edition (old school now discontinued,, i was heart broken)  with that touch of clove.  Clean, crisp, very reasonably priced.  I get alot of compliments on how i smell.  Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> DVB has great colognes and isn&#x27;t as well known (let alone used by many, here in the states at least). After using the &#x27;signature&#x27; cologne for some time (and still do), decided to try something else in the line-up. I got the product very quickly and the packaging was excellent. Bottle has the first magnetic cap I&#x27;ve seen on a cologne, which is a cool little feature, and a nice touch. The bottle looks classy.  I&#x27;m not great at explaining scents (as far as the notes in there), however I can say that cologne is on the citrus side. Has a hint of a more expensive cologne that&#x27;s in a tall and flat tapered bottle that sounds similar to &#x27;Mr Miyagi&#x27;. But not as in your face with the citrus. At the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Great price and delivery</li>
            <li> Product arrived as described and on time.</li>
            <li> This cologne is a manly sent for guys who want to smell manly. Listen here bro, get the 2.5 and you will not need to buy another cologne in your life! I have over 20 different colongnes and this is by far my favorite because it has a fierce sent like no other (but not fierce enough to scare people away). It has a magnetic cap that is easy to take off-but it ain&#x27;t no wuss. This cap is strong and will stay on even if you hold it by the cap and shake it, the cap will stay on. Overall I would recommend this cologne to any guy looking for a good sent that gets him attention and love from the ladies. Every girl I meet loves this cologne.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled, doesn&#x27;t smell like the real thing or is really aged and fragrance has evaporated.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Big Lots.  It is 100% crap and it does not last more than an hour.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> I have gone through 2 bottles of this stuff, and it does smell great, but it just doesn&#x27;t last very long. I spray it on in the morning and it is gone within 4 hours. Like others have said, for the price, you can&#x27;t really expect a super high quality fragrance though.</li>
            <li> Rating system too complicated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be less potent than the one given me as a gift a year earlier. I.E. watered down!</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding colognes that suit my husband&#x27;s natural body scent. This is by far the best one for him. I hope that it does not get discontinued. It only takes a little bit, so don&#x27;t bathe in it!!!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband. It smells absolutely awesome!  I would highly recommend this cologne especially at this price.  Great Buy!</li>
            <li> Very nice scent unlike most overly sweet or perfumey fragrances decidedly male and fresh good for day or evening luvit</li>
            <li> this is really good stuff !-----Jerry T.</li>
            <li> I got some good feedback after using this. Smells good but does not last long though. It&#x27;s worth buying this.</li>
            <li> The scent of this David Beckham men&#x27;s cologne is AMAZING! It is subtle and inviting and makes me want to snuggle his neck (or where ever he puts it!)  Mmmmmmmmmmmm...... yesssssssssssss!    Brings out the animal in me!</li>
            <li> HEY GUYS IF YOUR SINGLE,I HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT! A SMOOTH MELLOW SCENT,AND IS NOT LOUD!! IF YOUR MARRIED...JUST REMEMBER ,,,..YOUR MARRIED..</li>
            <li> I discovered this when I was in London shopping in Boots. It was actually a blind buy but I love Becks and trusted his taste. Wow! It&#x27;s so unique that people always ask me what perfume am I wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quite difficult to find in the US and I am glad that Amazon sells this in a discount price. I love it!</li>
            <li> Hard to find at reasonable price. Ordering on line was great and price was acceptable. I just love it when my husband uses this. Smells great on him.</li>
            <li> Great cologne for it&#x27;s price. Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> this product was better priced than online competitors and it arrived just a couple days after I ordered it right before christmas! thanks</li>
            <li> This is a very soft, subtle scent. Very smooth and clean sort of like laundry just out of the dryer, if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite of the Beckham line because some colognes have an alcohol-like scent when you first put it on. Doesn&#x27;t happen with Instinct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my daily cologne. If you want something more strong and noticeable, try Intimately Beckham.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the Beckham colognes smell like high-end cologne but it&#x27;s at a value price. I have tried 3 different colognes in his line and love them all.</li>
            <li> David Beckham is one of my favorite colognes; however, it is not always available at the local stores so when I found it online with Amazon I was very pleased!  This cologne has a \\&quot;fresh, clean\\&quot; scent is always a hit when I wear it.  I always receive compliments when I wear it and my wife loves it as well...and that is always a plus!  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this selection!</li>
            <li> Good item!fast shiping!I like it!amazing！High quality！</li>
            <li> My husband loved this cologne that I ordered for him for our 1st anniversary and of course I absolutely loved mine too...great price on both...thanks again</li>
            <li> I have over 100 colognes from expensive to cheap, this one is cheap and it might not be bad, but is not that great either, it does have a soft smell after 30 minutes, but then it loss the aroma, I just can say is an ok product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this cologne repeatedly since the smell is good and the price is great!  Wife doesn&#x27;t seem to mind that I keep using it. g-</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t like anything overpowering, and this is definitely not too strong.  It&#x27;s a clean, attractive scent.  I love the way he smells with it on.  If you&#x27;re worried about getting something that would be offensive to some people, stick with this.  It&#x27;s very universal and professional!</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this perfume. I used a very similarly appraised product which is in similar price range and was satisfied with that. Thought i would try something different and bought this. The scent stays for a very long time I spray it in the morning and lasts a whole day. Love the smell of it. I have gotten compliments wearing this perfume. So not only do I like it, others who can smell the scent like it too. Great product, dont hesitate to buy it.</li>
            <li> Good scent that last all day</li>
            <li> This is a great cologne for the price.  I enjoy it and this is my second bottle. Shlpping is fast too.</li>
            <li> Very good product quality, this is all I expected to get.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to other buyers those are thinking to buy that.</li>
            <li> Was trying to replace David Beckham Pure Instinct which my husband loves. Decided to try this one a for the price difference.  He said this is not quite the same, it is just okay.</li>
            <li> I got this for my fiance&#x27; who wears it everyday.  I love the way he smells!  I would reccomend this fragrance for all you men, or all you women who want your men to smell nice!</li>
            <li> Got this for my step dad for christmas. He loved it. It was a great price. Shipped on time got it right before christmas.</li>
            <li> I worried about this being a knock off, but even if it is, it smells great. I bought this for my fiancee for Christmas last year or his birthday in March? Either way he went from the store-bought version to this and I noticed no difference. It&#x27;s hard to find in the store, so this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> This was an awesome buy! If you were to buy this in store it would cost you a bunch more! Arrived quick and recommend to all!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my nephew and he loved it! Good size with a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> The online price makes this cologne a great buy. I never purchase a cologne without trying but I got very good reviews from friends  and decided to buy. The reasonable price made my decision easier. The fragrance is a very classic fragrance with fresh, citrus and a hint of spicy notes in it. It&#x27;s good for day use. I have had it for a week now and noticed that like others it wears off in a few hours. I guess you get what you paid for and that is why knocked a star off. Works for me on weekdays when I am at office all day. No regrets buying this product but I will move on to something better next time. No repeating this one again.</li>
            <li> this Cologne is really nice , it smells really nice. i highly recommend it . its really affordable. great product.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to be a man to wear this. I received this as a gift even though I am a woman, to hell with gender designated fragrances this stuff smells awesome.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend thought it was okay as well but I was not a huge fan. I bought it for him based on all the reviews I found but it was a mistake. Great service from seller :)</li>
            <li> At $16 for 2.5oz, this is an incredible deal. When this first came out, I purchased some at Rite Aid in a promotional pack that included body wash, and it was $35. I went back last week for more and found that just the spray alone is now $37 on sale, and that&#x27;s at Rite Aid! To be able to get it here for $16 (down from $55 supposedly) is awesome. I purchased 2 while the deal&#x27;s still available. Love the smell of this - not overpowering, and not one of those heavily musky ones either - just a nice fresh scent that lasts well. This and Davidoff Cool Water are my favorites.</li>
            <li> so this is a very nice and amazing cologne, I used to be a fan of Drift from Hollister and while that has been discontinued I was trying to find a scent that I loved as much as that, and I was tempted to get this since I had sampled it a while back... to my surprise it was probably the best choice I made... and I got it before an entire week went by!</li>
            <li> This cologne is wonderful, just prepare your self to be thrusted into a social situation in which you must act!</li>
            <li> I have bought this cologne for 5 years now, this is not the same cologne. The smell is no where near as good and it does not stick for more than 5 mins. I have a little of the original that i bought awhile back and compared it to this, This cologne smells water down.</li>
            <li> This cologne is one of my go-to&#x27;s. I use it off and on, and cycle with either this or Tommy Hilfiger for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if I use it so often and recommend it, why the 3 stars?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because, as great as the scent is, it only lasts a few hours. I like a cologne scent to last a full 8-hour working day. This is nearly non-existent by lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But still, it&#x27;s one of my favorite scents, and I spray it on twice a day (which means I run out twice as fast...Oh wow...maybe that&#x27;s the marketing ploy all along.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re into a great, but not overbearing scent, give the dVb a try. It&#x27;s wonderful and subtle. Just be prepared for it to wear off fairly shortly.</li>
            <li> I gave this item as a Christmas gift and the recipient adores it!!&lt;br /&gt;the value was incredible and I will always return to look for it here!</li>
            <li> Makes your man smell delicious! Loved it. Smells amazing and looks great. Made a great gift for my love. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Cant give this purchase  a higher mark or I would because the value exceeded my expectations.  Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Cool bottle design like the magnet cap cool feature I thought smell was pretty good. I would buy again plus under $20 great deal.</li>
            <li> I bought this because one of my friends is in love with this perfume. But quite honestly I didn&#x27;t like it one bit. To me the fragrance is common like and doesn&#x27;t smell too tasty. Maybe it&#x27;s just me,  but I gave mine away to a friend after one use.</li>
            <li> This cologne has a fantastic smell that lasts through the day and into the night and most of all my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Smells like it has been sitting to long on the shelf.  Has lost its original fragrance.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, great presentation, Arrived early, Not as good as the Pure Instinct. If you are looking for a fresh long lasting scent with a hint of musk for a cheap price, this would be an appropriate choice.</li>
