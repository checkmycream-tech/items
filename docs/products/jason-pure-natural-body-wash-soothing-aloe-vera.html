            <li>I love Jason Fragrance Free Satin Shower Body Wash!  </li>
            <li>LOVE this bodywash...</li>
            <li>I have used Jason products for many years as I&#x27;m allergic to most soaps.  </li>
            <li>Love it, except one of the bottles opened and spilled in the packaging.</li>
            <li>Had been wanting to try this, but haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t use it more than twice before I had problems.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unscented and leaves you feeling clean but not as moisturizing as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, but nothing special.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would be great for someone with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I just feel so clean when I use this!</li>
            <li>The old bottle with the pump was great.</li>
            <li>This Jason product is superb, particularly for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>For anyone who has very sensitive skin this is a really good body wash.  </li>
            <li>That goes for the Jason Fragrance Free Shampoo as well.</li>
            <li>Really nice body wash, non irritating, and the best part there is almost no scent to it.</li>
            <li>Leaves you clean and fragrance free.</li>
            <li>When the market stopped carrying it I was really excited to see it on amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several hypoallergenic and fragrance-free body wash products over the years and like the Jason version the best by far.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s fragrance free, as I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It feels wonderful and does not dry or irritate in the least.</li>
            <li>I really like this body wash because I can&#x27;t use washes with fragrance, and I don&#x27;t like mixing shower scents with my perfume.</li>
            <li>Gentle, cleans well, and unscented.  </li>
            <li>The pump is very convenient for showers.</li>
            <li>I think that I prefer at least lightly scented vs. fragrance free, but since I purchased 2 bottles, I will use it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thick and rich fragrance free body wash which is a plus for super sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>this makes your skin sooo soft!</li>
            <li>Not only is it fragrance free, it is also moisturizing, a must for Colorado&#x27;s dry climate.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and cannot use fragranced products.  </li>
            <li>I have allergies and sensitive skin -</li>
            <li>With this, my skin is smooth and free of the tiny red bumps that usually form as a reaction to other washes.</li>
            <li>The plastic bag had more of the shower gel in it than the bottle did, and the other items in the box were a mess.</li>
            <li>As for the product itself, it does the job without irritating my skin, but it somehow has a strong odor I can only describe as sage?</li>
            <li>I was looking for a gentle product for sensitive skin, and I have not experienced any skin irritation so far whatsoever.</li>

            <li> The body wash is great, but the new bottle it comes in is TERRIBLE!</li>
            <li> Took forever for it to ship, but they had told me it would take a long time.</li>
            <li> I live in a small town</li>
            <li> It has a much better lather than other products I&#x27;ve tried and it does not have any unpleasant odors like some products do.</li>
            <li> The bottle had been placed in a plastic pouch inside the box, but it hadn&#x27;t stayed closed through shipping.</li>
            <li> No more dry skin after the shower!</li>
            <li> Not such a bad thing that there is so little left, but disappointed that this purchase was such a complete and messy waste of money.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no problem here, for a person with really serious chemical sensitivity problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Jason products in the past</li>
            <li> This lathers well in our extremely hard water, has very little scent to it, and does not bother my allergies.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never been unhappy with anything that I&#x27;ve ever purchased by them.</li>
            <li> When the package arrived, the bottle had leaked so badly that it had oozed throught the cardboard box - a lot.</li>

            <li> For anyone who has very sensitive skin this is a really good body wash.  I live in a small town so I only had one choice for body washes and decided to try this product and I am glad I did.  Now I have choices &amp; will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> The body wash is great, but the new bottle it comes in is TERRIBLE! It leaks everywhere, and the lid will not stay shut. The old bottle with the pump was great. Please bring back the pump!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for years. When the market stopped carrying it I was really excited to see it on amazon.

            <li> i&#x27;ve used this for years, and then switched, and had to switch back. this makes your skin sooo soft! Nothing compares, and the scented ones are great too!!</li>
            <li> Just started using this. I was looking for a gentle product for sensitive skin, and I have not experienced any skin irritation so far whatsoever. I also like the fact that this company does not engage in animal testing. The pump is very convenient for showers.</li>
            <li> Leaves you clean and fragrance free. Absolutely no problem here, for a person with really serious chemical sensitivity problems. Couldn&#x27;t live without it. That goes for the Jason Fragrance Free Shampoo as well.</li>

            <li> Works well.  I have used Jason products for many years as I&#x27;m allergic to most soaps.  I think that I prefer at least lightly scented vs. fragrance free, but since I purchased 2 bottles, I will use it.  It have medical issues &amp; it does cleanse &amp; remove body odors well.</li>
            <li> Love it, except one of the bottles opened and spilled in the packaging.</li>
            <li> Really nice body wash, non irritating, and the best part there is almost no scent to it. Great for shaving.</li>
            <li> Had been wanting to try this, but haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores - I can&#x27;t use skin products with fragrance, and I&#x27;d heard good things about this.

The bottle had been placed in a plastic pouch inside the box, but it hadn&#x27;t stayed closed through shipping. The plastic bag had more of the shower gel in it than the bottle did, and the other items in the box were a mess. As for the product itself, it does the job without irritating my skin, but it somehow has a strong odor I can only describe as sage? Though it doesn&#x27;t contain sage, the smell has prevented me from using it - I smell like bread stuffing on Thanksgiving when I do. Not such a bad thing that there is so little left, but disappointed that this purchase was such a complete and messy waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not only is it fragrance free, it is also moisturizing, a must for Colorado&#x27;s dry climate.  Can not find it in any of the local stores.</li>
            <li> Great wash if you or someone you know has any skin allergies.</li>
            <li> I have allergies and sensitive skin - but I think I&#x27;m allergic to this. I couldn&#x27;t use it more than twice before I had problems.</li>
