    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Very good for my skin which is prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with my clarisonic pro!</li>
            <li>My skin feels great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d imagine they&#x27;d be great for getting skin even for self-tanners, though.</li>
            <li>and I did successfully register it on their website.  </li>
            <li>I love my PRO sonic!  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use; the manual tells you how to change the duration of the timer (if you want to use the timer function) and the speed.</li>
            <li>Amazing - much more vigorous cleaning (admittedly takes getting used to</li>
            <li>While we each had to make our personalized adjustments to the standard regimen, we can say that we are very happy with the cumulative outcome of adding this device to our skincare</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m anticipating better results.</li>
            <li>IS BETTER</li>
            <li>This rep was much more helpful.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>this is a present for my best friend.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>Makeup now looks more even and my skin isn&#x27;t dull-looking.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>Too soon to tell if my skin texture will improve, though it feels really clean after using it, and it does make my moisturizer absorb faster!</li>
            <li>my skin has never felt so clean!</li>
            <li>I have been using this since November, and although my skin isn&#x27;t crystal clear by any means, it has improved GREATLY....</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I struggle with blackheads and clogged pores, along with fine lines and oily skin.</li>
            <li>I think it helps to clean residual product and oil so that I don&#x27;t have so many clogged pores and helps your skin be more open to absorb good products after cleansing.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say if this product is genuine, though it seems fine</li>
            <li>and I can already tell a huge improvement.</li>
            <li>This make my skin feel silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>wife is happy with her results: Pores in her &#x27;problem areas&#x27; (nose and cheeks) are smaller.</li>
            <li>The cleanser for the body contains exfoliating crystals that are very useful at cleaning the skin and removing those darkened ares under arms, knees, and elbows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>great thing about this is that not only does it get you cleaner than you thought you could be, it really does help products soak into your skin better.</li>
            <li>If I buy another one, I&#x27;ll get a cheaper version from a brick-and-mortar store that honors the return if you keep the original box and what came with it.</li>
            <li>but I think it was just because I was excited to get it.</li>
            <li>clean the brush head and device EVERY time I use it.</li>
            <li>Love this clarisonic better than my old one it replaced.</li>
            <li>Body brush deep cleans and does a good job of making skin tone even,</li>
            <li>She then sent the extension handle and a full size bottle of the refining skin polish, \\&quot;for my trouble\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>After the first use, my pores starting looking smaller and my skin looked better, and moisturizer sank perfectly onto my skin.</li>
            <li>My face feels so much softer and my make up looks better after using this product.</li>
            <li>The real magic will be seen come winter, when my skin always gets super dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried or bought any other clarisonic, but this one is great.  </li>
            <li>I know this tool will help tremendously with that</li>
            <li>Quick one minute face cleaning and three minutes for body.</li>
            <li>Love the extra speed and love the  holder to help in the shower.  </li>
            <li>(did a better job on the nose where I can develop small blackheads) and the texture and firmness of skin was notably better than what I had experienced with the prior Clarisonic I was using.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved the first one, but it died right after the warranty expired, so I hesitated to invest in a second.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a miracle worker by any means, you have to be devoted to a regular routine and good products to make the most of it, but it has made such a difference in my skin that my mother, cousin and hairdresser have all bought one since I got mine.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first to use such a product mostly because I&#x27;m a manly man however, a good female friend of mine convinced me to try it out.</li>
            <li>Make sure to use an antibac soap to clean the brush heads regularly.</li>
            <li>Helps clean my face really well, and my skin looks brighter.  </li>
            <li>I used the Olay cleansing brush first, and liked it well enough, I thought I would upgrade.</li>
            <li>you will find it to be a very useful device, particularly after gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I went with this one because I liked the grey color; I like having the body brush and holder but haven&#x27;t needed them yet.</li>
            <li>Not yet able to stay in the devices time frame, I use more time then allotted, usually six (6) minutes on body, but learning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keep in mind the brush head may not dry completely between use, so make sure to CLEAN the brush after EVERY use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve said above, I really love it.  </li>
            <li>#34;We card hard&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>However, men this will be good for personal grooming, better then the shower tool we usually use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using a smaller, cheaper model that is nowhere near as effective as this is.</li>
            <li>Clean thoroughly without causing too much damage to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Overall, strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>so I replaced it with the smart profile brushhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LQ6KLZA/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1.</li>
            <li>so I replaced it with the smart profile brushhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LQ6KLZA/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1.</li>
            <li>I was ALMOST ready to go back to the dermatologist (an easy $200, just to be seen) because my skin was getting out of control again.</li>
            <li>Since I bought this in summer and don&#x27;t use a tanner, I can&#x27;t tell much difference.</li>
            <li>so far I like it a lot, haven&#x27;t noticed too much of a difference but haven&#x27;t been using it daily either, once I get on a better routine</li>
            <li>The Mia is a much cheaper version and will probably work just as well, I just wanted one I could use on my body in the shower</li>
            <li>The tone is more even and clear, the tiny bumps are almost gone and blackheads are shrinking in number.</li>
            <li>But I feel that i need to use more liquid soap to generate foam compared to other products i&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>I also like that this model has 4 speeds, which is more than the other models.</li>
            <li>I know it wasn&#x27;t diet related because I eat a clean diet.  </li>
            <li>The first few times I used this on my face, it felt kinda rough, like a fine grit sandpaper; not uncomfortable, but a different sensation for sure.</li>
            <li>Adult acne, super sensitive skin, mixed with the first signs of aging.....makes for a nightmare to find a skin care routine.</li>
            <li>The adjustments were made based on the sensitivity of her skin to the to &#x27;normal&#x27; brush type and the frequency of exfoliation.</li>
            <li>have no complaint about the product.  </li>
            <li>Attach the brush head back onto the device pat onto your towel to remove water then remove brush head from the device so both dry better.</li>
            <li>The new brush made just for men</li>
            <li>For years, I also thought that washing my face with my hands, water and a decent facial cleanser was enough to get it clean.</li>
            <li>knees, underarms, neck, back and light exfoliation on feet especially heels.</li>
            <li>I was using the CERAVE line because of my sensitive skin, but think it was leading to more clogged pores, because a few weeks ago I switched to Purity face wash and Hope in a Jar moisturizer</li>
            <li>so I could buy it at a higher price from them or a local authorized</li>
            <li>it shines now, and is so soft!</li>
            <li>Within two weeks, no breakouts and skin is continuously clear.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, adjust the regimen.</li>
            <li>Be gentle with you skin and don&#x27;t forget to moisturize, especially during the winter.</li>
            <li>Way too much money to have only gotten about 300 uses from it.  </li>
            <li>, I have sensitive skin and did so.</li>
            <li>After about six months months, the battery started to lose a charge after only a few uses (used to get more)</li>
            <li>Less bumps in general, smaller pores and a more even skin</li>
            <li>Pro works so well to reduce the size of my pores, exfoliating&lt;br /&gt;the dry skin, and makes a noticeable difference the first time</li>
            <li>you are serious about your skin and are dedicated to preventing break-out related inflammation and inflammation-induced hyper-pigmentation on a daily basis, this will be a good investment for you.</li>
            <li>We were familiar with these issues because we used to apply facial scrubs with sharp particles...we have tossed THOSE out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I switched back to twice a day, morning and before bed and found that I&#x27;d had the darned thing on the highest setting by mistake, set it to the normal setting and that&#x27;s where it now stays (except for nose</li>
            <li>After first use my face was noticeably cleaner as if years of trapped dirt was pulled from my pores leaving my skin brighter and even, particularly in the areas I shave.</li>
            <li>The Clarisonic arrived quickly and I have used it everyday since.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 32 and much of what I do is preventative, but my acne is clearing up, no new breakouts, my nose is getting clearer, and</li>
            <li>and I think a sensitive brush (?); you can always get different ones separately.</li>
            <li>I just recently plopped down $75 for a serum that I probably would never have bought before because nothing seemed to make much difference before using the Clarisonic.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love my PRO sonic!  This make my skin feel silky smooth.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first to use such a product mostly because I&#x27;m a manly man however, a good female friend of mine convinced me to try it out. I have seen noticeable results on my already youthful skin only after 1 month of using this daily. Note: I do not use the Clarisonic brand facial wash and instead stuck with my Aveeno daily.</li>
            <li> This is the same item that my physician uses for my unruly skin.&lt;br /&gt;The Pro works so well to reduce the size of my pores, exfoliating&lt;br /&gt;the dry skin, and makes a noticeable difference the first time&lt;br /&gt;you use it.  I use twice a day, and have visible improvements</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve struggled with acne and weird combination skin.. oily, dry, sensitive, normal, the works. For years, I also thought that washing my face with my hands, water and a decent facial cleanser was enough to get it clean. I was wrong! The first few times I used this on my face, it felt kinda rough, like a fine grit sandpaper; not uncomfortable, but a different sensation for sure. After about a week of twice daily use, I cut down to once a day during my morning routine. Nuh uh. So I switched back to twice a day, morning and before bed and found that I&#x27;d had the darned thing on the highest setting by mistake, set it to the normal setting and that&#x27;s where it now stays (except for nose, I take the outer ring of the brush off and just use the inner smaller circle on &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; since my nose needs to be beaten into submission and taught who&#x27;s boss.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body brush is okay, and the handle is a little awkward but gets the job done. Since I bought this in summer and don&#x27;t use a tanner, I can&#x27;t tell much difference. The real magic will be seen come winter, when my skin always gets super dry and flaky. I know this tool will help tremendously with that phase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One great thing about this is that not only does it get you cleaner than you thought you could be, it really does help products soak into your skin better. I just recently plopped down $75 for a serum that I probably would never have bought before because nothing seemed to make much difference before using the Clarisonic. I&#x27;m 32 and much of what I do is preventative, but my acne is clearing up, no new breakouts, my nose is getting clearer, and my cheeks&#x27; pores have shrunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;ve had problems with your skin in the past, get this gem. Use it every day. You should start to see results within a week and a half to two weeks.</li>
            <li> My wife and I received this Clarisonic a month ago and have been using it regularly. While we each had to make our personalized adjustments to the standard regimen, we can say that we are very happy with the cumulative outcome of adding this device to our skincare routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my back with the body brush, and she uses it for her facial cleansing routine. The adjustments were made based on the sensitivity of her skin to the to &#x27;normal&#x27; brush type and the frequency of exfoliation. My wife invested in some &#x27;sensitive&#x27; facial brushes she ordered at Sephora and avoids brushing areas that are not in need of daily exfoliation and that are too sensitive, as to avoid broken capillaries and breakouts related to irritation. We were familiar with these issues because we used to apply facial scrubs with sharp particles...we have tossed THOSE out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife is happy with her results: Pores in her &#x27;problem areas&#x27; (nose and cheeks) are smaller. They are not invisible or anything, but they are definitely smaller, and my wife finds that the visual effect is multiplied once she has applied primer and foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conjunction with the Clarisonic, we have also been using a 2% Salicylic acid toner, applied after cleansing.This supports pore health and size by chemically loosening sebum and build-up within the pores, where the brush cannot reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our results in summary: Less bumps in general, smaller pores and a more even skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;If you are serious about your skin and are dedicated to preventing break-out related inflammation and inflammation-induced hyper-pigmentation on a daily basis, this will be a good investment for you. If you have sensitive skin, adjust the regimen. Be gentle with you skin and don&#x27;t forget to moisturize, especially during the winter.</li>
            <li> I think this thing is way overpriced for what it does.  Yes the brush vibrates, yes it cleans well.  But i think a much less expensive brush will do the same thing.  It&#x27;s overpriced for what it does.  You&#x27;re basically paying for brand name and for profit margins, not for effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Very good for my skin which is prone to breakouts. Clean thoroughly without causing too much damage to my sensitive skin. But I feel that i need to use more liquid soap to generate foam compared to other products i&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell if my skin texture will improve, though it feels really clean after using it, and it does make my moisturizer absorb faster!</li>
            <li> Devices such as this are marketed to women. However, men this will be good for personal grooming, better then the shower tool we usually use. I purchased a Gray Pro model for myself [[ASIN:B008ZHP9W4 Clarisonic Pro Sonic Skin Cleansing for Face and Body, Gray]]. Deep cleans my skin well and evens skin tone. Helps with pre-shave skin cleansing, help prevent ingrown hairs and lifting hairs to be cut. Body brush deep cleans and does a good job of making skin tone even, knees, underarms, neck, back and light exfoliation on feet especially heels. I have the extension tool it came with the Pro model. Quick one minute face cleaning and three minutes for body. Not yet able to stay in the devices time frame, I use more time then allotted, usually six (6) minutes on body, but learning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the cleanser supplied for my face and for my body. The face cleanser foams a little and combined with the deep pore brush deep cleans well. After first use my face was noticeably cleaner as if years of trapped dirt was pulled from my pores leaving my skin brighter and even, particularly in the areas I shave. The cleanser for the body contains exfoliating crystals that are very useful at cleaning the skin and removing those darkened ares under arms, knees, and elbows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I clean the brush head and device EVERY time I use it. It only takes another minute. A little shampoo, hand soap, or shower gel on the brush head massage into the bristle and a rinse. Remove the head and rinse the inside of the brush head and device. Attach the brush head back onto the device pat onto your towel to remove water then remove brush head from the device so both dry better. Keep in mind the brush head may not dry completely between use, so make sure to CLEAN the brush after EVERY use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men try this you will find it to be a very useful device, particularly after gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I know this brush is discontinued but I wanted to share my brush is dead... well it has stopped functioning as it should.

I like the handle and the gain from this brush cannot be compromised. I went without a brush for about two months and it was noticeable.</li>
            <li> Purchased the PRO version one year ago (almost to the day) from Amazon.  After about six months months, the battery started to lose a charge after only a few uses (used to get more) now it&#x27;s just dead.  Way too much money to have only gotten about 300 uses from it.  I like the product alot.  If I buy another one, I&#x27;ll get a cheaper version from a brick-and-mortar store that honors the return if you keep the original box and what came with it.</li>
            <li> so far I like it a lot, haven&#x27;t noticed too much of a difference but haven&#x27;t been using it daily either, once I get on a better routine I&#x27;m anticipating better results.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S FAKE......DOES NOT WORK SO WELL WITH LOW QUALITY, SO DO NOT BUY THIS ONE GO TO STORE AND GET ONE IS BETTER</li>
            <li> Factory sealed package arrived missing the body brush extension handle.  Clarisonic says Amazon and MyBetterSkinCare are not authorized retailers and this product is likely fraudulent.  If anything goes wrong with it, the 3 year warranty will not be honored.  Returning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An update:&lt;br /&gt;I got an email reply from another Clarisonic rep before I had a chance to make the return.  This rep was much more helpful.  She asked for pictures of the box I received and also asked where I bought it.  I replied with photos of the box from all sides, and just didn&#x27;t answer the question about where I bought it.  She then sent the extension handle and a full size bottle of the refining skin polish, \\&quot;for my trouble\\&quot;.  So, I&#x27;ve decided to keep this after all, though still with reservations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some history:&lt;br /&gt;This is my second Clarisonic Pro.  I absolutely loved the first one, but it died right after the warranty expired, so I hesitated to invest in a second.  After doing without for over a year, I decided to give Clarisonic another chance and purchased this one.  That was when it arrived missing the handle and I ran headlong into a Clarisonic rep that tried to scare me into returning it here so I could buy it at a higher price from them or a local authorized rep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaint about the product.  As I&#x27;ve said above, I really love it.  But I am appalled by the Clarisonic corporation&#x27;s attitude towards free enterprise and their scandalous attempts to keep the price of this product artificially high.  I have no idea if they will truly not honor the warranty if it&#x27;s needed.  I can&#x27;t say if this product is genuine, though it seems fine and I did successfully register it on their website.  In the end, I&#x27;m taking the risk.</li>
            <li> Love this clarisonic better than my old one it replaced. Love the extra speed and love the  holder to help in the shower.  My skin feels terrific.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried or bought any other clarisonic, but this one is great.  Helps clean my face really well, and my skin looks brighter.  I&#x27;ve used the &amp;#34;body&amp;#34; brush and that works well too.</li>
            <li> Adult acne, super sensitive skin, mixed with the first signs of aging.....makes for a nightmare to find a skin care routine. I used the Olay cleansing brush first, and liked it well enough, I thought I would upgrade. I was ALMOST ready to go back to the dermatologist (an easy $200, just to be seen) because my skin was getting out of control again. I struggle with blackheads and clogged pores, along with fine lines and oily skin. Weird combination skin that doesn&#x27;t seem to like any products I use, but needs products to help with all my issues. I have been using this since November, and although my skin isn&#x27;t crystal clear by any means, it has improved GREATLY....The tone is more even and clear, the tiny bumps are almost gone and blackheads are shrinking in number. I think it helps to clean residual product and oil so that I don&#x27;t have so many clogged pores and helps your skin be more open to absorb good products after cleansing. I was using the CERAVE line because of my sensitive skin, but think it was leading to more clogged pores, because a few weeks ago I switched to Purity face wash and Hope in a Jar moisturizer and I can already tell a huge improvement. The Clarisonic also helps with bumps on the backs of my arms and legs when I use it in the shower. This isn&#x27;t a miracle worker by any means, you have to be devoted to a regular routine and good products to make the most of it, but it has made such a difference in my skin that my mother, cousin and hairdresser have all bought one since I got mine. The Mia is a much cheaper version and will probably work just as well, I just wanted one I could use on my body in the shower so I got the bigger one. Hope this helps someone!</li>
            <li> I already had the Mia Clarisonic, but when I learned I could get the Clarisonic Pro at a price I could afford I jumped on it.  The Clarisonic arrived quickly and I have used it everyday since.  Love it and I would purchase from this vender again.  I have never had any problems ordering from Amazon.</li>
            <li> my skin has never felt so clean! it shines now, and is so soft! I&#x27;m very pleased with my clarisonic pro!</li>
            <li> this is a present for my best friend.&lt;br /&gt;but when she got it,it doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;there are some proble with it&lt;br /&gt;the brush doesn&#x27;t rotate&lt;br /&gt;it is unhappy to me and my friend.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I went without one of these for so long. My skin feels great and I look visibly younger. Shipping seemed a little long but I think it was just because I was excited to get it. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have taken care of my skin for a very long time. I am 50 next month and was last carded at 42 (weird, I know, and it *was* in Chicago where their slogan is &amp;#34;We card hard&amp;#34;). I was using the 1st or 2nd gen Clarisonic for over a year and wanted to upgrade. Favorable reviews led me to the pro. Amazing - much more vigorous cleaning (admittedly takes getting used to but no damage to skin): face looked cleaner (did a better job on the nose where I can develop small blackheads) and the texture and firmness of skin was notably better than what I had experienced with the prior Clarisonic I was using. Haven&#x27;t yet used the body attachments. Make sure to use an antibac soap to clean the brush heads regularly. Overall, strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> In my 40&#x27;s and was struggling with breakouts.  I know it wasn&#x27;t diet related because I eat a clean diet.  Within two weeks, no breakouts and skin is continuously clear.</li>
            <li> I have been eyeing these cleansing systems for ages and finally decided to bite the bullet. I am so glad I did! I&#x27;d been using a smaller, cheaper model that is nowhere near as effective as this is. After the first use, my pores starting looking smaller and my skin looked better, and moisturizer sank perfectly onto my skin. Makeup now looks more even and my skin isn&#x27;t dull-looking. I went with this one because I liked the grey color; I like having the body brush and holder but haven&#x27;t needed them yet. I&#x27;d imagine they&#x27;d be great for getting skin even for self-tanners, though. I also like that this model has 4 speeds, which is more than the other models. It&#x27;s very easy to use; the manual tells you how to change the duration of the timer (if you want to use the timer function) and the speed. The box it came in had the seal broken, but nothing was damaged. It comes with a body brush and I think a sensitive brush (?); you can always get different ones separately.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. My face feels so much softer and my make up looks better after using this product. The appearance of my skin looks refreshed also.  My sister has one and I have also recommended it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I wavered over buying a Clarisonic for a year. When I decided to just buy it already I chose this one: is has a variety of speeds and comes with 2 brush-heads and the handle. (which, as it turns out I don&#x27;t use.) I have used it almost everyday, 2x a day. A word of caution: skin test the cleansers that come with it, I have sensitive skin and did so. I had an itchy red spot for a day and a half.</li>
