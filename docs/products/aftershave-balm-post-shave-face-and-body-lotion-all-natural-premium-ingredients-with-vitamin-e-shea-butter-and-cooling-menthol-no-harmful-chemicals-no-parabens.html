            <li>Good moisturizer</li>

            <li>Do your own advertising and stop spamming me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another good thing about this product is that it leaves your face feeling healthy and nourished, but it&#x27;s not greasy or oily.  </li>
            <li>Nice after shave product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this item an additional start because it&#x27;s actually nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>Nice and frosted with a kick ass</li>
            <li>think for the price I can get better or just as good lotion  </li>
            <li>It absorbs well into your face, moisturizes, and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, pleasant.</li>
            <li>Non-greasy, light, smells fantastic and feels incredible on my skin.</li>
            <li>I was impressed visually with the product and thought the frosted glass bottle was a nice touch.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d be willing to bet it would work great for you as well.</li>
            <li>The description on website was very accurate.  </li>
            <li>Albeit very smooth feeling unscented lotion, there is no scent whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Bottle is glass, like that better than plastic.</li>
            <li>love this.</li>
            <li>and if you want to use your favorite cologne it will enhance it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many products.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this balm by Barberry Coast.</li>
            <li>Love this balm.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing and great fragrance.</li>
            <li>Simply, the best aftershave balm on the market.</li>
            <li>My wife and daughter love the smell.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>, otherwise it works ok</li>
            <li>The bottle is a frosty white glass with a very attractive label.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>It pairs well with many of the shave soaps I use as well.&lt;br /&gt;Such</li>
            <li>Love this scent, top quality product.  </li>
            <li>It is now my favorite after shave lotion to use.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and great scent.</li>
            <li>To my nose it is a mix of leather and citrus with the top note of tobacco and maybe a smidgen of vanilla thrown in.</li>
            <li>This is now one of my top 5 aftershaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would love some type of flow regulator.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell of this stuff is amazing; this rich, manly vanilla smell with a bit of ...cigar? -</li>
            <li>The packaging was great, the bottle very well protected in bubble wrap that was easy to get into.</li>
            <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t linger for a long time which is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a safety razor shaver and this is one of the most important products you must have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And by the way, smells great and leaves his face ultra soft.</li>
            <li>As expected, ordering and shipping via Prime and Amazon was flawless.</li>
            <li>The smell also fades very quickly.</li>
            <li>It has a very mild scent.</li>
            <li>The balm has the density of semi runny yogurt, but absorbs VERY quickly into your skin.</li>
            <li>It feels decent on the skin, but not as good as Skin Food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first, when I told him what it costs, he said it&#x27;s really nice</li>
            <li>/&gt;This would be fine for $10-15 but at over $30 you should look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but nothing extraordinary.</li>
            <li>I was deliberately a little bit rougher with my DEs and straights throughout the week while testing this, and this balm was EXCELLENT at reducing redness and irritation.</li>
            <li>In fact, it passed the all important &amp;#34;mmm, you smell nice&amp;#34; test from my wife.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>This stuff goes on smooth as silk.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously, this is far superior than ANYTHING I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly as advertised!!</li>
            <li>The scent is unique and fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>From the first use I fell in love with this product.</li>
            <li>Just clean</li>
            <li>would recommend this for anyone that wants a great smelling, old school, no BS aftershave - and no irritation.</li>
            <li>I can tell that it&#x27;s going to be a bit of a challenge to extract it from the rigid (though handsome) frosted glass bottle once I&#x27;ve used more than 2/3rds of it... which won&#x27;t take long seeing as a love the scent.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Havana is the real deal and I am getting more.</li>
            <li>I have a shave den full of products (probably well over 100).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The product is a thick balm that provides excellent soothing and skin conditioning.</li>
            <li>it absorbs nicely and leaves the face soft and moisturized.....</li>
            <li>like I do, the cool feeling when you apply it</li>
            <li>It is very soothing and performs as you expect a top end AS balm to.</li>
            <li>I am requesting a full refund.</li>
            <li>But the main point I need to make is Havana does what it says and more.</li>
            <li>Thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick and the packaging was bullet proof.</li>
            <li>There is an initial vanilla sweetness when I put it on but that gives way to a rich tobacco scent (unburned) with a hint of cocoa that is amazing.</li>
            <li>Not to strong but bold enough to keep me and my wife enjoying it hours after I put it on.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stand when my inbox gets filled by sellers who want you to leave positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Goes on very smooth and dries leaving my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>Price is a little steep for the size of the bottle, but it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>worth the money.</li>
            <li>A nice frosted white glass bottle I can use for something else.  </li>
            <li>Seems more natural than the name brand lotions.</li>
            <li>Your face is worth it.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth $35 and now a 11% price increase.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It comes in a super cool real glass bottle too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very noticeable and unique.</li>
            <li>I knew it was the right</li>
            <li>The reviews were right.</li>
            <li>Right off the bat</li>
            <li>Really nothing special I don&#x27;t often use it.</li>
            <li>The scent IS pure Havana!</li>
            <li>This easily mowed down the competitors that I&#x27;ve paid more for.</li>
            <li>one actually makes me look MORE forward to shaving.</li>
            <li>reach for Havana first each time I shave</li>
            <li>I have always been more of a splash fan, especially during the warmer months, but Havana has won me over.  </li>
            <li>I bought it about a month ago and knew it would be a winner the first time I tried</li>
            <li>Sure I wish it was cheaper, but if this bottle lasts me two months (on the short side)</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It is light, non-greasy, absorbs quickly, but at the same time also moisturizes well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now bought all their other products and love them all but this Havana Balm is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>balm has a nice thick consistency that a balm should have and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>There are many others that will give you lotion and a better or at least some scent.  </li>
            <li>But, masculine scent, non greasy feel, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It is pure cacao butter.  </li>
            <li>Because it doesn&#x27;t contain all the chemicals and additives that you find in similar products, it&#x27;s perfect for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, while it isn&#x27;t overpowering, the scent does last a long time.</li>
            <li>SMELLS NICE, A LITTLE LIGHTER SCENT</li>
            <li>I also notice the puffiness under my eyes are really diminished after application.</li>
            <li>The real awesomeness is in the product itself.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice much of a scent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not looking for much, but the scent does not stick with me at all.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a real delight on the olfactory system.</li>
            <li>-feel I&#x27;m looking for with high-quality ingredients and a pleasant, subtle scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this product for guys like me, with sensitive dry skin after a nice shave.</li>
            <li>Subtle scent, feels good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for more than 45 years and have tried a few different aftershaves and Havana is as good as anything I have used.</li>
            <li>Very little fragrance of any kind</li>
            <li>Havana after shave balm comes in  handy glass bottle that you unscrew and put a small pencil eraser size dollop in the palm of your hand and apply to you face.  </li>
            <li>after using the lotion just a few times, you will notice a change in your skin, &amp;#34;so soft&amp;#34;, with a nice soft scent.</li>
            <li>I have tried all of the high end stuff.</li>
            <li>Some have commented on the price being too high, but I disagree.  </li>
            <li>All natural skin food that really soothes my skin after shaving.  </li>
            <li>Mostly it is thanks to sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The menthol gives you an initial cooling effect which is always welcomed right after shaving.</li>
            <li>Man, when I saw that Barberry Coast had a new product out, I knew I had to pick it up -</li>
            <li>It leaves his face very soft, and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Incredibly masculine!</li>
            <li>Get this balm, your face, significant other and olfactory receptors will all thank you....</li>
            <li>Eventually you are left with a sweet vanilla scent that is similar to opening a cup of vanilla pudding and getting a whiff of it from some distance.</li>
            <li>and I say this because after a month now this stuff has given me a soft less chapped smooth face.</li>
            <li>I have oily, sensitive skin and this balm does not cause rashes or acne.  </li>
            <li>But my wife (28 years old) does not.</li>
            <li>As far as the price... you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I got a lotion from another vender with much the same ingredients, expect they were organic for $14.</li>
            <li>The scent is a sweet smoking tobacco with some hints of vanilla and slight hints of cocoa.</li>
            <li>Even though it is has a denser consistency my skin absorbed it quickly and left little residue shortly after I have put it on.</li>
            <li>NOT GREASY.&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to get this after using the Bay Rum for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>It is a little on the pricey side, but worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just enough to tell that something is going on, but nowhere near the burn or sting of alcohol-based aftershaves.  </li>
            <li>will admit, I was a little bit nervous shelling out the money for this new, untested AS balm, but let me tell you, it was money VERY well</li>
            <li>kinda pissed right now after receiving my little bottle of this stuff(and</li>
            <li>The tobacco and vanilla compliment each other very well.</li>
            <li>When I say gentle, I mean gentle.  </li>
            <li>The scent, at least my bottle, is very subtle and almost non existent except for a touch of tobacco and what is great about this is it complements any aftershave or cologne that you can apply after Havana absorbs into your skin.</li>
            <li>It is quickly absorbed and a little goes a hell of a long way.</li>
            <li>You need so little of this stuff each time that it really does take a while to run out.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t give reviews unless the product is really good or really bad, IMO.</li>

            <li> but I&#x27;d be willing to bet it would work great for you as well.</li>
            <li> The description on website was very accurate.  </li>
            <li> Albeit very smooth feeling unscented lotion, there is no scent whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Bottle is glass, like that better than plastic.</li>
            <li> love this.</li>
            <li> and if you want to use your favorite cologne it will enhance it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many products.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this balm by Barberry Coast.</li>
            <li> Love this balm.  </li>
            <li> Very soothing and great fragrance.</li>
            <li> Simply, the best aftershave balm on the market.</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter love the smell.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> , otherwise it works ok</li>
            <li> The bottle is a frosty white glass with a very attractive label.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> It pairs well with many of the shave soaps I use as well.&lt;br /&gt;Such</li>
            <li> Love this scent, top quality product.  </li>
            <li> It is now my favorite after shave lotion to use.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and great scent.</li>
            <li> To my nose it is a mix of leather and citrus with the top note of tobacco and maybe a smidgen of vanilla thrown in.</li>
            <li> This is now one of my top 5 aftershaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would love some type of flow regulator.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell of this stuff is amazing; this rich, manly vanilla smell with a bit of ...cigar? -</li>
            <li> The packaging was great, the bottle very well protected in bubble wrap that was easy to get into.</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t linger for a long time which is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a safety razor shaver and this is one of the most important products you must have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And by the way, smells great and leaves his face ultra soft.</li>
            <li> As expected, ordering and shipping via Prime and Amazon was flawless.</li>
            <li> The smell also fades very quickly.</li>
            <li> It has a very mild scent.</li>
            <li> The balm has the density of semi runny yogurt, but absorbs VERY quickly into your skin.</li>
            <li> It feels decent on the skin, but not as good as Skin Food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first, when I told him what it costs, he said it&#x27;s really nice</li>
            <li> /&gt;This would be fine for $10-15 but at over $30 you should look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but nothing extraordinary.</li>
            <li> I was deliberately a little bit rougher with my DEs and straights throughout the week while testing this, and this balm was EXCELLENT at reducing redness and irritation.</li>
            <li> In fact, it passed the all important &amp;#34;mmm, you smell nice&amp;#34; test from my wife.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> This stuff goes on smooth as silk.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously, this is far superior than ANYTHING I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as advertised!!</li>
            <li> The scent is unique and fabulous.  </li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> From the first use I fell in love with this product.</li>
            <li> Just clean</li>
            <li> would recommend this for anyone that wants a great smelling, old school, no BS aftershave - and no irritation.</li>
            <li> I can tell that it&#x27;s going to be a bit of a challenge to extract it from the rigid (though handsome) frosted glass bottle once I&#x27;ve used more than 2/3rds of it... which won&#x27;t take long seeing as a love the scent.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Havana is the real deal and I am getting more.</li>
            <li> I have a shave den full of products (probably well over 100).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The product is a thick balm that provides excellent soothing and skin conditioning.</li>
            <li> it absorbs nicely and leaves the face soft and moisturized.....</li>
            <li> like I do, the cool feeling when you apply it</li>
            <li> It is very soothing and performs as you expect a top end AS balm to.</li>
            <li> I am requesting a full refund.</li>
            <li> But the main point I need to make is Havana does what it says and more.</li>
            <li> Thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick and the packaging was bullet proof.</li>
            <li> There is an initial vanilla sweetness when I put it on but that gives way to a rich tobacco scent (unburned) with a hint of cocoa that is amazing.</li>
            <li> Not to strong but bold enough to keep me and my wife enjoying it hours after I put it on.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand when my inbox gets filled by sellers who want you to leave positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Goes on very smooth and dries leaving my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Price is a little steep for the size of the bottle, but it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> worth the money.</li>
            <li> A nice frosted white glass bottle I can use for something else.  </li>
            <li> Seems more natural than the name brand lotions.</li>
            <li> Your face is worth it.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t worth $35 and now a 11% price increase.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> It comes in a super cool real glass bottle too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very noticeable and unique.</li>
            <li> I knew it was the right</li>
            <li> The reviews were right.</li>
            <li> Right off the bat</li>
            <li> Really nothing special I don&#x27;t often use it.</li>
            <li> The scent IS pure Havana!</li>
            <li> This easily mowed down the competitors that I&#x27;ve paid more for.</li>
            <li> one actually makes me look MORE forward to shaving.</li>
            <li> reach for Havana first each time I shave</li>
            <li> I have always been more of a splash fan, especially during the warmer months, but Havana has won me over.  </li>
            <li> I bought it about a month ago and knew it would be a winner the first time I tried</li>
            <li> Sure I wish it was cheaper, but if this bottle lasts me two months (on the short side)</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It is light, non-greasy, absorbs quickly, but at the same time also moisturizes well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now bought all their other products and love them all but this Havana Balm is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> balm has a nice thick consistency that a balm should have and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> There are many others that will give you lotion and a better or at least some scent.  </li>
            <li> But, masculine scent, non greasy feel, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> It is pure cacao butter.  </li>
            <li> Because it doesn&#x27;t contain all the chemicals and additives that you find in similar products, it&#x27;s perfect for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, while it isn&#x27;t overpowering, the scent does last a long time.</li>
            <li> SMELLS NICE, A LITTLE LIGHTER SCENT</li>
            <li> I also notice the puffiness under my eyes are really diminished after application.</li>
            <li> The real awesomeness is in the product itself.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much of a scent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not looking for much, but the scent does not stick with me at all.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a real delight on the olfactory system.</li>
            <li> -feel I&#x27;m looking for with high-quality ingredients and a pleasant, subtle scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this product for guys like me, with sensitive dry skin after a nice shave.</li>
            <li> Subtle scent, feels good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for more than 45 years and have tried a few different aftershaves and Havana is as good as anything I have used.</li>
            <li> Very little fragrance of any kind</li>
            <li> Havana after shave balm comes in  handy glass bottle that you unscrew and put a small pencil eraser size dollop in the palm of your hand and apply to you face.  </li>
            <li> after using the lotion just a few times, you will notice a change in your skin, &amp;#34;so soft&amp;#34;, with a nice soft scent.</li>
            <li> I have tried all of the high end stuff.</li>
            <li> Some have commented on the price being too high, but I disagree.  </li>
            <li> All natural skin food that really soothes my skin after shaving.  </li>
            <li> Mostly it is thanks to sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The menthol gives you an initial cooling effect which is always welcomed right after shaving.</li>
            <li> Man, when I saw that Barberry Coast had a new product out, I knew I had to pick it up -</li>
            <li> It leaves his face very soft, and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Incredibly masculine!</li>
            <li> Get this balm, your face, significant other and olfactory receptors will all thank you....</li>
            <li> Eventually you are left with a sweet vanilla scent that is similar to opening a cup of vanilla pudding and getting a whiff of it from some distance.</li>
            <li> and I say this because after a month now this stuff has given me a soft less chapped smooth face.</li>
            <li> I have oily, sensitive skin and this balm does not cause rashes or acne.  </li>
            <li> But my wife (28 years old) does not.</li>
            <li> As far as the price... you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I got a lotion from another vender with much the same ingredients, expect they were organic for $14.</li>
            <li> The scent is a sweet smoking tobacco with some hints of vanilla and slight hints of cocoa.</li>
            <li> Even though it is has a denser consistency my skin absorbed it quickly and left little residue shortly after I have put it on.</li>
            <li> NOT GREASY.&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to get this after using the Bay Rum for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It is a little on the pricey side, but worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just enough to tell that something is going on, but nowhere near the burn or sting of alcohol-based aftershaves.  </li>
            <li> will admit, I was a little bit nervous shelling out the money for this new, untested AS balm, but let me tell you, it was money VERY well</li>
            <li> kinda pissed right now after receiving my little bottle of this stuff(and</li>
            <li> The tobacco and vanilla compliment each other very well.</li>
            <li> When I say gentle, I mean gentle.  </li>
            <li> The scent, at least my bottle, is very subtle and almost non existent except for a touch of tobacco and what is great about this is it complements any aftershave or cologne that you can apply after Havana absorbs into your skin.</li>
            <li> It is quickly absorbed and a little goes a hell of a long way.</li>
            <li> You need so little of this stuff each time that it really does take a while to run out.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t give reviews unless the product is really good or really bad, IMO.</li>
            <li> I do get a predominant vanilla scent (reminiscent of the dry down from Skin Bracer) and there is a gentle tingle after applying.  </li>
            <li> hard to place exactly.  </li>
            <li> really question the negative reviews here.</li>
            <li> You can definitely smell vanilla but not really any tobacco.</li>
            <li> This will leave your face moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;ve already waited too long...</li>
            <li> It moisturizes all day long.</li>
            <li> BTW, it&#x27;s really not on sale, their sales price is the regular prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:</li>
            <li> lite fragrance for my taste with fair moisturizing cream base</li>
            <li> I am in and out of an office during the day and when I go outside on these 90+ degree days and start to get a little heated I inevitably will sweat, but when this happens the scent seems to revive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product is hard to get out of bottle and for the price I think is kind of expensive  </li>
            <li> Face still dry after use.</li>
            <li> Did not like it for price and the scent did last as long as some other shaven lotion for half the price.</li>
            <li> smells like it says, really is not greasy, which I like.</li>
            <li> This lotion is expensive, but it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> For $35 I expected stronger scent, nothing that $5 cream does not give.</li>
            <li> those of you that wet shave</li>
            <li> Just a dab does the trick, unlike aftershave splashes where you pour out 1/4 of the bottle, half of it runs down the sink, another part on the floor, and whatever is left on your hands gets slapped on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s the other thing...</li>
            <li> With some other aftershave balms, if you start to sweat, it feels like the lotion is running down your face.  </li>
            <li> This is an open mouth bottle and if you don&#x27;t pay attention, you can go a little overboard when dispensing this into your hand to apply...</li>
            <li> It really does have a faint scent of an unburned cigar.  </li>
            <li> this product is not worth it.  </li>
            <li> This beats them all, hands down.</li>
            <li> can get a skin moisturizer for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> Ran out of Jack Black</li>
            <li> Wish it could come down in price, $30.00 plus, is a little steep.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a dedicated wet shaver for the past few years.</li>
            <li> but has little scent.</li>
            <li> This is little to no scent.  </li>
            <li> Not very pleased about how it was delivered.</li>
            <li> Before getting my bottle my face was unknowingly dried up</li>
            <li> Also this stuff has very little smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> THE BOTTLE IS REALLY SMALL FOR THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> I do mean little)  </li>
            <li> Hard to get out of bottle and way overpriced.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent of &amp;#34;Havana&amp;#34; is hard for me to describe.  </li>
            <li> I have always had a hard time with shaving products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a die hard AOS guy and decided to try something else.</li>
            <li> Even after shaking the bottle the aftershave has a thick consistency and is hard to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whatever smell it does have is weak</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every aftershave balm out there and have always been disappointed and went back to AOS.</li>
            <li> Way too expensive, too hard to extract from the glass bottle.  </li>
            <li> But it is very difficult to get the thick lotion out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda expensive</li>
            <li> Way too expensive for what you get.  </li>
            <li> of these reviews must be fake</li>
            <li> I would recommend the product, however very expensive.</li>
            <li> If you are on the fence with this product, buy it you will not be sorry!!!</li>
            <li> Still no scent that remains and is still horribly overpriced.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> smells like it says, really is not greasy, which I like. Bottle is glass, like that better than plastic.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as advertised!! Enough said, I ordered this along with their Bay Rum aftershave, I will be definitely ordering their shave soap next pay day!!!  I can&#x27;t wait for my fiance to be back in town to feel the results of this product!!! If you are on the fence with this product, buy it you will not be sorry!!!</li>
            <li> Wow!  What a great after shave balm!  This product has a nice, unusual, awesome scent unlike anything I have used before.  I have oily, sensitive skin and this balm does not cause rashes or acne.  Havana after shave balm comes in  handy glass bottle that you unscrew and put a small pencil eraser size dollop in the palm of your hand and apply to you face.  I started using this product about a moth ago and I definitely will reorder.</li>
            <li> love this. Wish they had some kind of pump in the bottle. But, masculine scent, non greasy feel, and dries quickly. Awesome effort.</li>
            <li> I have tried all of the high end stuff. This beats them all, hands down. The balm is creamy and it spreads very nicely. You only need a tiny dab. It comes in a super cool real glass bottle too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> Eh, pass on this. No problems with shipping or packaging but the product itself does not warrant the premium price. I would describe the smell as somewhere between sun tan lotion and chapstick. You can definitely smell vanilla but not really any tobacco. The smell also fades very quickly. Even after shaking the bottle the aftershave has a thick consistency and is hard to get out of the bottle. It feels decent on the skin, but not as good as Skin Food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last gripe is the seller. I can&#x27;t stand when my inbox gets filled by sellers who want you to leave positive reviews. Do your own advertising and stop spamming me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be fine for $10-15 but at over $30 you should look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product is amazing.  It absorbs well into your face, moisturizes, and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, pleasant. I&#x27;d highly recommend this product for guys like me, with sensitive dry skin after a nice shave.</li>
            <li> Wish I could give six stars. I&#x27;ve been wet shaving for more than 45 years and have tried a few different aftershaves and Havana is as good as anything I have used. The scent, at least my bottle, is very subtle and almost non existent except for a touch of tobacco and what is great about this is it complements any aftershave or cologne that you can apply after Havana absorbs into your skin. But the main point I need to make is Havana does what it says and more. Before getting my bottle my face was unknowingly dried up and I say this because after a month now this stuff has given me a soft less chapped smooth face. So, you get one of the best skin conditioners around and if you want to use your favorite cologne it will enhance it. It&#x27;s kinda expensive but after a month of using it I am sold on it.  I don&#x27;t run rampant with reviews on Amazon and I don&#x27;t give reviews unless the product is really good or really bad, IMO. Havana is the real deal and I am getting more.</li>
            <li> The essence of the Caribbean in a bottle. The tobacco and vanilla compliment each other very well. Goes on very smooth and dries leaving my skin so soft. My wife loves the smell of this aftershave balm and so do I. I wish it came in a bigger bottle like an 8 oz. Maybe they will make an aftershave to compliment there balm!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a dedicated wet shaver for the past few years. I&#x27;ve tried many, many products.&lt;br /&gt;This one actually makes me look MORE forward to shaving. I have a shave den full of products (probably well over 100).&lt;br /&gt;I reach for Havana first each time I shave and the smell is really, really good - My wife just loves it!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Smells great when used with the bay rum aftershave. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My guy loves this. It leaves his face very soft, and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this balm by Barberry Coast. It lives up to all the claims. Non-greasy, light, smells fantastic and feels incredible on my skin. I also use it as an all around lotion for my face, hands, elbows and knees. I also notice the puffiness under my eyes are really diminished after application. I will definitely purchase again. Thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer but has little scent. Hard to get out of bottle and way overpriced. Not very pleased about how it was delivered. I found it partly frozen outside of my house on the ground.</li>
            <li> It has a very mild scent. It is soothing after my DE shave using my Bond Street Sandlewood shave cream. It is very nice just not $35 nice. I also like my Nivea after shave balm for around $6.</li>
            <li> This stuff is excellent for your face.  The ingredient list is superb and the post-shave face feel is awesome.  Some have commented on the price being too high, but I disagree.  You need so little of this stuff each time that it really does take a while to run out.  Just a dab does the trick, unlike aftershave splashes where you pour out 1/4 of the bottle, half of it runs down the sink, another part on the floor, and whatever is left on your hands gets slapped on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of &amp;#34;Havana&amp;#34; is hard for me to describe.  It&#x27;s a good scent, but I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on it.  It reminds me of something from my childhood, but I just can&#x27;t place what it is quite yet.  I do get a predominant vanilla scent (reminiscent of the dry down from Skin Bracer) and there is a gentle tingle after applying.  When I say gentle, I mean gentle.  It&#x27;s just enough to tell that something is going on, but nowhere near the burn or sting of alcohol-based aftershaves.  Another thing I have realized is that this is actually a great aftershave for summer.  I am in and out of an office during the day and when I go outside on these 90+ degree days and start to get a little heated I inevitably will sweat, but when this happens the scent seems to revive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another good thing about this product is that it leaves your face feeling healthy and nourished, but it&#x27;s not greasy or oily.  With some other aftershave balms, if you start to sweat, it feels like the lotion is running down your face.  Not the case with Havana.  The scent may get a &amp;#34;kick&amp;#34; from your body temperature going up, but it doesn&#x27;t sweat off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy that I have this aftershave in my rotation.  I have always been more of a splash fan, especially during the warmer months, but Havana has won me over.  Now I can get the face-feel I&#x27;m looking for with high-quality ingredients and a pleasant, subtle scent.</li>
            <li> Great product.  It really does have a faint scent of an unburned cigar.  The only way you could improve it is to package in a container that is squeezable or give it a pump dispenser.  I can tell that it&#x27;s going to be a bit of a challenge to extract it from the rigid (though handsome) frosted glass bottle once I&#x27;ve used more than 2/3rds of it... which won&#x27;t take long seeing as a love the scent.</li>
            <li> Smells of humidor and vanilla bean, great scent with a nice burn to wake you up in the morning. This is a balm, not a splash, if you&#x27;re looking for a thinner liquid buy the splash. The balm has the density of semi runny yogurt, but absorbs VERY quickly into your skin.</li>
            <li> Way too expensive, too hard to extract from the glass bottle.  It does smell and feel wonderful, tho.</li>
            <li> Love this balm.  It smells amazing and works well.</li>
            <li> Great item. Very soothing and great fragrance.</li>
            <li> 1. Scent: Chose this because I was looking for a tobacco leaf scent, but I don&#x27;t get anything like this.  It is pure cacao butter.  My wife says it smells like baby oil.  Disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;2. Packaging: A nice frosted white glass bottle I can use for something else.  But it is very difficult to get the thick lotion out.  I expect the last ounce of half-ounce will remain in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;You can get a skin moisturizer for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> Price is a little steep for the size of the bottle, but it&#x27;s a great product. I will likely reorder unless I decide to try something else.</li>
            <li> SMELLS NICE, A LITTLE LIGHTER SCENT THEN I HAD ANTICIPATED. THE BOTTLE IS REALLY SMALL FOR THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> Simply, the best aftershave balm on the market. All natural skin food that really soothes my skin after shaving.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 months now on a daily basis. Post shave redness and irritation are gone. My skin looks younger and is no longer prone to razor bumps. I not only apply it to the beard areas but to my entire face. It&#x27;s that good.  The smell of Havana is soooo good. There is an initial vanilla sweetness when I put it on but that gives way to a rich tobacco scent (unburned) with a hint of cocoa that is amazing. My wife and daughter love the smell. The scent doesn&#x27;t linger for a long time which is perfect for me. It is a lotion afterall. I just picked up the splash version for those times I&#x27;d like to use it as a cologne.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s good:&lt;br /&gt;Fast absorbing&lt;br /&gt;No alcohol&lt;br /&gt;Non greasy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What needs improvement:&lt;br /&gt;Smells like a box of vanilla cookies&lt;br /&gt;Whatever smell it does have is weak</li>
            <li> This lotion is expensive, but it is worth the price. Smells great, and leaves face very smooth after shaving. I love it.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this, but it is the best after shave lotion. I have ever gotten. Good smell, makes my skin feel good. Seems more natural than the name brand lotions. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> For $35 I expected stronger scent, nothing that $5 cream does not give. Face still dry after use.</li>
            <li> Very little fragrance of any kind, otherwise it works ok</li>
            <li> I personally like this smell.  But my wife (28 years old) does not. Nuff said.</li>
            <li> This is the best aftershave balm I have ever used. So comforting after a shave... No initial &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34;, not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is amazing! Not to strong but bold enough to keep me and my wife enjoying it hours after I put it on. I&#x27;ve always been an &amp;#34;aquatic&amp;#34; scent fan... This is more of an &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; scent, so I&#x27;m now having to look for a cologne to pair with this wonderful aroma.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using AOS for 5+ years but a friend recommend I give this aftershave lotion a try. I bought it about a month ago and knew it would be a winner the first time I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this is far superior than ANYTHING I&#x27;ve tried before. YMMV but I&#x27;d be willing to bet it would work great for you as well. I&#x27;ve now bought all their other products and love them all but this Havana Balm is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick and the packaging was bullet proof. The bottle is a frosty white glass with a very attractive label. The product is a thick balm that provides excellent soothing and skin conditioning. Even though it is has a denser consistency my skin absorbed it quickly and left little residue shortly after I have put it on. The scent is vanilla and menthol on application. The menthol gives you an initial cooling effect which is always welcomed right after shaving. Eventually you are left with a sweet vanilla scent that is similar to opening a cup of vanilla pudding and getting a whiff of it from some distance.</li>
            <li> after using the lotion just a few times, you will notice a change in your skin, &amp;#34;so soft&amp;#34;, with a nice soft scent. I would recommend the product, however very expensive. Wish it could come down in price, $30.00 plus, is a little steep.</li>
            <li> Man, when I saw that Barberry Coast had a new product out, I knew I had to pick it up - I tried the Ascent shave soap a while back, and I was blown away.  As soon as I got it I knew it was the right decision!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this stuff is amazing; this rich, manly vanilla smell with a bit of ...cigar? - hard to place exactly.  The real awesomeness is in the product itself.  I have always had a hard time with shaving products.  Mostly it is thanks to sensitive skin.  I think it has a lot to do with it not being a bunch of synthetic junk.  It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and it didn&#x27;t leave a residue.  Just clean awesomeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for anyone that wants a great smelling, old school, no BS aftershave - and no irritation.</li>
            <li> Delivered on as scheduled.  The description on website was very accurate.  AND it is great stuff!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a die hard AOS guy and decided to try something else. I have tried just about every aftershave balm out there and have always been disappointed and went back to AOS. Not anymore!&lt;br /&gt;This balm has a nice thick consistency that a balm should have and smells fantastic. Has a tobacco/vanilla scent that will blow your mind.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the other thing... This will leave your face moisturized all day long. Something AOS cannot do.  I&#x27;m a safety razor shaver and this is one of the most important products you must have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ve already waited too long... Try this out and you will not regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really question the negative reviews here. The fragrance is very noticeable and unique. It moisturizes all day long. And I don&#x27;t think it needs a pump bottle.  I take pride in my DE shaving and it looks like it belongs out on the counter. As far as the price... you get what you pay for. Sure I wish it was cheaper, but if this bottle lasts me two months (on the short side) that&#x27;s like 55 cents a day.  Your face is worth it. Isn&#x27;t it?  This easily mowed down the competitors that I&#x27;ve paid more for.</li>
            <li> Subtle scent, feels good.  Well packages and promptly shipped.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Moisturizes well.  Didn&#x27;t notice much of a scent.  I&#x27;m not looking for much, but the scent does not stick with me at all.</li>
            <li> The reviews were right. Great smell!! It is a little on the pricey side, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Nice after shave product. Ran out of Jack Black so I gave it a try. Has a real great mens woodsy, outdoor scent, that feels good on your face after shaving. I will probably try another scent from them.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  It is light, non-greasy, absorbs quickly, but at the same time also moisturizes well.  My experience has been that an after shave lotion will often meet one of these qualities, but not both.  The scent is unique and fabulous.  Not overpowering, but yet exquisite.  In my book, a &amp;#34;must try&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> lite fragrance for my taste with fair moisturizing cream base</li>
            <li> Did not like it for price and the scent did last as long as some other shaven lotion for half the price.</li>
            <li> Bought for my boyfriend for Christmas. He LOVES it! At first, when I told him what it costs, he said it&#x27;s really nice but he wouldn&#x27;t be buying for himself. After 3 weeks, he&#x27;s now talking about where to get it! HA!! And by the way, smells great and leaves his face ultra soft.</li>
            <li> Way too expensive for what you get.  This is little to no scent.  Save your money this product is not worth it.  There are many others that will give you lotion and a better or at least some scent.  Update: I&#x27;m giving this item an additional start because it&#x27;s actually nice on the skin. Still no scent that remains and is still horribly overpriced.  At 10-12 dollars i might be a customer. Still not a customer at $35. BTW, it&#x27;s really not on sale, their sales price is the regular prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Really nothing special I don&#x27;t often use it. Now I noticed it went up to $39. They just don&#x27;t get it. It wasn&#x27;t worth $35 and now a 11% price increase. I got a lotion from another vender with much the same ingredients, expect they were organic for $14.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. The scent is a sweet smoking tobacco with some hints of vanilla and slight hints of cocoa. it absorbs nicely and leaves the face soft and moisturized.....NOT GREASY.&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to get this after using the Bay Rum for a few weeks. I was not disappointed. Id recommend buying both. You will end up getting them anyways after you try one of them. My go to Balm from now on.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift a while back. Right off the bat I was impressed visually with the product and thought the frosted glass bottle was a nice touch. From the first use I fell in love with this product. For me it has the perfect balance of warmth and spice without being overly oily and fragerent....it&#x27;s a real delight on the olfactory system. In fact, it passed the all important &amp;#34;mmm, you smell nice&amp;#34; test from my wife.&lt;br /&gt;For those of you that wet shave like I do, the cool feeling when you apply it is very refreshing. Because it doesn&#x27;t contain all the chemicals and additives that you find in similar products, it&#x27;s perfect for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, while it isn&#x27;t overpowering, the scent does last a long time. I put it on in the morning and it lasts all day. It pairs well with many of the shave soaps I use as well.&lt;br /&gt;Such a great product I just order some more! I would recommend it for any man out there looking for that &amp;#34;art of manliness&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> Love this scent, top quality product.  It is now my favorite after shave lotion to use.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Definitely worth the money.  Very soothing and great scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but nothing extraordinary.</li>
            <li> I have been anxiously awaiting this balm since I first saw it on Instagram. As expected, ordering and shipping via Prime and Amazon was flawless. The packaging was great, the bottle very well protected in bubble wrap that was easy to get into. The bottle is AWESOME! Nice and frosted with a kick ass label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit, I was a little bit nervous shelling out the money for this new, untested AS balm, but let me tell you, it was money VERY well spent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The name is perfect. The scent IS pure Havana! To my nose it is a mix of leather and citrus with the top note of tobacco and maybe a smidgen of vanilla thrown in. Incredibly masculine! It is PERFECT!!!!! And the scent lingers throughout the day. My girlfriend can&#x27;t stop sniffing me. She LOVES it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to performance. This stuff goes on smooth as silk. It is a balm / lotion NOT a splash, FYI. It is quickly absorbed and a little goes a hell of a long way. It is very soothing and performs as you expect a top end AS balm to. I was deliberately a little bit rougher with my DEs and straights throughout the week while testing this, and this balm was EXCELLENT at reducing redness and irritation. This is now one of my top 5 aftershaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One suggestion for improvement. I would love some type of flow regulator. This is an open mouth bottle and if you don&#x27;t pay attention, you can go a little overboard when dispensing this into your hand to apply...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short story? Get this balm, your face, significant other and olfactory receptors will all thank you....</li>
            <li> kinda pissed right now after receiving my little bottle of this stuff(and I do mean little)  product is hard to get out of bottle and for the price I think is kind of expensive  Also this stuff has very little smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think for the price I can get better or just as good lotion  I should have researched a lil more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alot of these reviews must be fake</li>
            <li> I am requesting a full refund. Packaged very nicely.  This is just an unscented lotion. Albeit very smooth feeling unscented lotion, there is no scent whatsoever.</li>
            <li> great cream, no smell. although they said it had a scent</li>
