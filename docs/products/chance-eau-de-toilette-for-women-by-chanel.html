            <li>Turns out it is the real thing, it came perfectly sealed in the box.</li>
            <li>The scent is spicy with a nice musk undertone.  </li>
            <li>just love my purchase, i always end up as a happy customer, of course i mostly but from sellers fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
            <li>but I can still smell it on me after a day of work which is what I would expect from a nice perfume.  </li>
            <li>And I currently own around 15 perfumes, and have smelled hundreds of perfumes because my grandmother had a perfume store.</li>
            <li>It could be the perfect match if you are 30 years old.</li>
            <li>This by far the best perfume I have EVER owned!</li>
            <li>I was very happy till I open the product package.</li>
            <li>I still love it.get lots of compliments as well.</li>
            <li>I just like this scent better.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;This is MY FAVORITE perfume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect scent, smells so fresh, classic</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic, it&#x27;s Chanel</li>
            <li>I placed an order with the company Fabulous Fragrances and the shipment arrived damaged.</li>
            <li>Great perfume, long lasting, nice smell.  </li>
            <li>and it did :) Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Like ALL CHANEL products, it&#x27;s really sophisticated, and leans towards a mature</li>
            <li>The lady loves it so much she ended up with two bottles for xmas!</li>
            <li>Usually Chanel is suitable for older grown up women but this particular kind fits better for the younger crowd.</li>
            <li>The quality of this perfume is very high.</li>
            <li>I am commenting on the real item that I did not buy off Amazon.  </li>
            <li>much easier than driving 50 miles to pick up.  </li>
            <li>it has a very arousing effect.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I love it to the core, the smell is just wow, like every other chanel, the smell is just different and you can tell by the smell that its chanel, :) The Smell is long lasting, thats the first thing i care about perfumes , is that the smell should last good couple of hours..</li>
            <li>Everyone around me male and female smell the Eau De Toilette and wonder who, what&#x27;s more &amp;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely for older women or a sophisticated young lady, I can&#x27;t picture someone younger than 23 wearing it.</li>
            <li>Wow !</li>
            <li>I still had some in my old bottle to compare.  </li>
            <li>After rating them on your website, they replaced my order completely and immediately.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Channel for nearly half my lifespan and this is the first time something like this has ever happened.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;It LASTS ALL DAY LONG!</li>
            <li> My wife was using this perfume last few years</li>
            <li> EXPENSIVE but may be worth the investment if you need some spark.</li>
            <li> but once arrive the box was all wet</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as a gift for a friend,  but when it arrived at her job the entire department could smell it - apparently the bottle was broken upon delivery.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t understand why people say it is watered down.</li>
            <li> I mean you could still put them back and spray</li>
            <li> I returned it and promptly received credit by seller but was a waste of time.  </li>
            <li> did after a few years.  </li>
            <li> BUT when I got the product it was green</li>
            <li> The strange part was the perfume&#x27;s sprayer caps for both bottles were broken.  </li>
            <li> For the people who are saying that it&#x27;s fake because it doesn&#x27;t last: it&#x27;s an eau de toilette not eau de parfum.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 Chance by Chanel for Women, Eau De Toilette Spray, 3.4 Ounce from Mandy and not totally satisfied with them.  </li>
            <li> (I mean grass green) and did NOT smell like Chance.  </li>
            <li> Why one would ship an item of this nature without a box (at least) is beyond me.</li>
            <li> and it did not go bad or smell alcoholic like my Estee Lauder Pleasure</li>
            <li> I was scared of the reviews saying that the product from this seller was fake, but I bought it anyway.</li>
            <li> There are four Chanel Chance fragrances and I erroneously purchased a scent that did not appeal to me.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this experience has made me cease dealing with Amazon since I am now stuck with a rather expensive bottle of the eau de parfume that I have no use for...Diane</li>
            <li> so can you really go wrong?  </li>
            <li> Needless to say that is what I had to</li>
            <li> It was very disappointing as I bought it as a valentine day gift.</li>

            <li> I bought this perfume for my mom and just received it today. I was scared of the reviews saying that the product from this seller was fake, but I bought it anyway. Turns out it is the real thing, it came perfectly sealed in the box. For the people who are saying that it&#x27;s fake because it doesn&#x27;t last: it&#x27;s an eau de toilette not eau de parfum. It&#x27;s a great fragrance, one of the best out there. I strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 Chance by Chanel for Women, Eau De Toilette Spray, 3.4 Ounce from Mandy and not totally satisfied with them.  The strange part was the perfume&#x27;s sprayer caps for both bottles were broken.  I mean you could still put them back and spray but every time you pull the cap from the bottle, it brings the sprayer cap with it.  I&#x27;ve been using Channel for nearly half my lifespan and this is the first time something like this has ever happened.  As for the product quality , I don&#x27;t recommend this seller. I&#x27;d go to the perfume shop next time.  Not Amazon.</li>
            <li> There is no question this item is a counterfeit.  Also, I found it cheaper at a department store.  I returned it and promptly received credit by seller but was a waste of time.  Another attempt at deceiving internet customers.</li>
            <li> I was very happy till I open the product package. The product was duplicate. I will never recomend any body to buy perfumes from this seller. It was very disappointing as I bought it as a valentine day gift.</li>
            <li> My wife was using this perfume last few years and she absolutely loved it. Usually Chanel is suitable for older grown up women but this particular kind fits better for the younger crowd. It could be the perfect match if you are 30 years old.</li>
            <li> There are four Chanel Chance fragrances and I erroneously purchased a scent that did not appeal to me.  The exchange process took numerous e-mails to be explained and was delayed due to the holidays.  Although the item was sprayed once the item was never accepted for exchange because by the time the return procedure was clarified time had exceeded the seven day limit. Unfortunately, this experience has made me cease dealing with Amazon since I am now stuck with a rather expensive bottle of the eau de parfume that I have no use for...Diane</li>
            <li> I am commenting on the real item that I did not buy off Amazon.  The scent is spicy with a nice musk undertone.  I&#x27;ve had it for almost 6 years now and it did not go bad or smell alcoholic like my Estee Lauder Pleasure did after a few years.  I would buy it again and recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Well I have been wearing Chance by Chanel for over 2 years.  So when I had a gift card and saw the price on Amazon it was a no brainer.  BUT when I got the product it was green (I mean grass green) and did NOT smell like Chance.  I still had some in my old bottle to compare.  I will never ever purchase a product like this again!!!</li>
            <li> This is the second year I have been wearing Chanel Chance. Everyone around me male and female smell the Eau De Toilette and wonder who, what&#x27;s more &amp; Wow ! The best ever ! Please Enjoi. -Bry</li>
            <li> This came to my front door......much easier than driving 50 miles to pick up.  This has been my signature cologne for quite some time.....I still love it.get lots of compliments as well.</li>
            <li> I am hoping that there is a mistake in the pricing for this product as you can get 3.4 oz. of Chance at Ulta for about $60.00, not $475....  Please say it is a mistake.  I personally only wear Chance.</li>
            <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;I just love my purchase, i always end up as a happy customer, of course i mostly but from sellers fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
            <li> Excellent choice for the price. Don&#x27;t understand why people say it is watered down. It is not.  It last the day.&lt;br /&gt;I still smell it on my clothes when I take them off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this purchase!!!  I could smell the perfume before the box was opened and just a touch from the bottle on my wrist could be smelled the nex morning!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A GREAT BUY!!!!</li>
            <li> I love it to the core, the smell is just wow, like every other chanel, the smell is just different and you can tell by the smell that its chanel, :) The Smell is long lasting, thats the first thing i care about perfumes , is that the smell should last good couple of hours.. and it did :) Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Great perfume, long lasting, nice smell.  Most perfumes even the expensive ones wear off throughout a day but I can still smell it on me after a day of work which is what I would expect from a nice perfume.  All the Chanel perfumes are this quality I just like this scent better.  It&#x27;s younger.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic, it&#x27;s Chanel so can you really go wrong?  The lady loves it so much she ended up with two bottles for xmas!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and in all honesty... it has a very arousing effect. EXPENSIVE but may be worth the investment if you need some spark.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as a gift for a friend,  but when it arrived at her job the entire department could smell it - apparently the bottle was broken upon delivery. When she brought it to me to return I saw that there was no box. Why one would ship an item of this nature without a box (at least) is beyond me. My friend  also told me that I could purchase it cheaper at the store for the size I ordered. Needless to say that is what I had to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent a comment previous.y and it was removed - hopefully this one will stick ...DON&#x27;T BUIY FROM THIS MERCHANT!!</li>
            <li> I bought this and I love the smell but once arrive the box was all wet the perfume was all over the box, but I didn&#x27;t have time to exchange it since it was a present for my mom.</li>
            <li> I placed an order with the company Fabulous Fragrances and the shipment arrived damaged. After rating them on your website, they replaced my order completely and immediately. I was very impressed and pleased.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume. I wear this stuff almost every day and always get told how great I smell. Will be reordering for life!</li>
            <li> DO YOU LIKE GETTING CONSTANT COMPLIMENTS ON YOUR PERFUME? Well this is definitely for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is MY FAVORITE perfume. And I currently own around 15 perfumes, and have smelled hundreds of perfumes because my grandmother had a perfume store. This by far the best perfume I have EVER owned! It&#x27;s the perfect scent, smells so fresh, classic, it&#x27;s great for all occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It LASTS ALL DAY LONG! Every time I wear it everyone in the office compliments me on the perfume.  The quality of this perfume is very high. It&#x27;s definitely for older women or a sophisticated young lady, I can&#x27;t picture someone younger than 23 wearing it. Like ALL CHANEL products, it&#x27;s really sophisticated, and leans towards a mature scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it!</li>
