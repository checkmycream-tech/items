            <li>Just love it</li>
            <li>Even with generous amount of top coat, thickness cannot be covered.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend loved these things, they are exactly as you&#x27;d expect them to be.</li>
            <li>Super cute nice small size great for adding to nail art lots of colors make great variety to add to your naills</li>
            <li>perfect colorful arrived super fast would order again</li>
            <li>Colors are as shown, easy to apply</li>
            <li>but its still super cute</li>
            <li>I love these little stars their so cute &amp; came packaged so nicely all in their own compartments</li>
            <li>i enjoy putting them in for gifting.</li>
            <li>They are beautiful though and it was here fastest than expected.</li>
            <li>Everything was exactly as pictured. &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>Overall I am pretty happy with them.</li>
            <li>too cool.</li>
            <li>These stars where cool</li>
            <li>Sticks to regular nail polish and recommend a top coat for more staying power.</li>
            <li>and I just love them.there easy to put on,they were shipped to me fast and handled very nicely.and</li>
            <li>little amount,,,,,,,but still great......</li>
            <li>a lot of them werent separated properly, and they dont lay over nails nicely, the edges pop up</li>
            <li>She stated that you need to make sure that the clear coat is applied to the corners of the stars, otherwise they will catch on things and pop off.</li>
            <li>They came two weeks early Witch is a plus :)</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really do anything with them because the color rubs off so fast!!</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty, but still, this is not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I paid for.</li>
            <li>picture shows what you get exactly</li>
            <li>this was a 2nd order, love using these on my nails</li>
            <li>You dont receive every much for how much you pay.</li>
            <li>While the price is not much you would be better off going to the dollar store and buying these.</li>
            <li>but you really need to lock them in under coats of polish</li>
            <li>This was a stocking stuffer for a 12 year old and she started using them right away.  </li>
            <li>Little stars are adorable.</li>
            <li>I love the colors the only thing is the light pink stars do not match the other ones they are circle and not pointed but not a big deal!</li>
            <li>, it wasn&#x27;t as full as I thought, but I gave it a 4 stars because the other item I bought from this buyer was packed.  </li>
            <li>but in natural nails is a disaster.</li>
            <li>some of them are a little thick and uneven but for the most part there nice.</li>
            <li>Although there is only 10 different color stars, and then two different colored squares, it is still worth the money.</li>
            <li>Came as shown, true to color in a small wheel container.  </li>
            <li>they were solid, not hollow as described.</li>

            <li> I had originally purchased these for my finger nails and seen that they may be a little too thick, but if you&#x27;re using this with acrylic</li>
            <li> They did take a little long to get here, but look how far its coming from.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Came much earlier than I had expected.</li>
            <li> I was not sure what to expect with this purchase as I had never before ordered nail decoration tips, but I was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointed with this product, seeing at when I got it, two of the boxes were empty, and there were stars spilled out everywhere.</li>
            <li> suggest getting the little wax-tip pencil made for picking up tiny things like this.</li>
            <li> Shipment was faster than expected.  </li>
            <li> Each compartment had about a quarter to half spoon.</li>
            <li> They are not full all the way</li>
            <li> , it has very few of each.</li>
            <li> very few stars.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hard plastic that doesnt vend.</li>
            <li> I could see these being too thick for nails, but thats not what i bought them for.</li>
            <li> , these are too thick.  </li>
            <li> These are terrible!</li>

            <li> they were solid, not hollow as described. a lot of them werent separated properly, and they dont lay over nails nicely, the edges pop up so i kept losing them and having to reapply them.</li>

            <li> perfect colorful arrived super fast would order again</li>

            <li> I do my own manicures.  This is what it is ... 12 different colored STARS to add to my nails.</li>
            <li> Super cute nice small size great for adding to nail art lots of colors make great variety to add to your naills</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointed with this product, seeing at when I got it, two of the boxes were empty, and there were stars spilled out everywhere.</li>

            <li> Shipment was faster than expected.  I like the variety of colors, it wasn&#x27;t as full as I thought, but I gave it a 4 stars because the other item I bought from this buyer was packed.  I love it.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loved these things, they are exactly as you&#x27;d expect them to be.</li>
            <li> I could see these being too thick for nails, but thats not what i bought them for. i am really pleased, they are mostly all really cute. HOWEVER, they arent all stars. four of the compartments are stars, three are squares, two are flowers and one is circles. but its still super cute</li>
            <li> I got these for my daughter and she loves them. She stated that you need to make sure that the clear coat is applied to the corners of the stars, otherwise they will catch on things and pop off.</li>
            <li> Nice colors, nice figures , but in natural nails is a disaster. I cant glue it.  It&#x27;s a hard plastic that doesnt vend.</li>
            <li> Took a while to get here, but nice.</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty, but still, this is not what I was expecting. some of the stars have a hold in the middle...&lt;br /&gt;Also, it has very few of each. I won&#x27;t be able to use any of the colors for all of my fingernails because of the quantity per color!! as I said...very few stars.&lt;br /&gt; I do not recommend buy this. Dollar store has better ones.</li>
            <li> If you love stars these are for you</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased these for my finger nails and seen that they may be a little too thick, but if you&#x27;re using this with acrylic it&#x27;s perfect, otherwise you have to use a lot of top coat to seal off the edges. I used these on my big toes and they are great, it adds a bit of sparkle!</li>
            <li> I love the colors the only thing is the light pink stars do not match the other ones they are circle and not pointed but not a big deal!</li>
            <li> Came as shown, true to color in a small wheel container.  This was a stocking stuffer for a 12 year old and she started using them right away.  Sticks to regular nail polish and recommend a top coat for more staying power.</li>
            <li> They are not full all the way</li>
            <li> Love them!  Came much earlier than I had expected. Colors are as shown, easy to apply but you really need to lock them in under coats of polish so they dont fall off.&lt;br /&gt;overall very happy.  Excellent price.</li>
            <li> While the picture shows quite a bit in each container, that&#x27;s not what I received. Each compartment had about a quarter to half spoon. The stars are very pretty and bright, but quantity was lacking. I got exactly what I paid for.</li>
            <li> These are awesome!!!! I put them in the nail acrylic and they look lovley. They came two weeks early Witch is a plus :)</li>
            <li> Arrived timely. Came in a container that separated each color for use.</li>
            <li> These are great some of them are a little thick and uneven but for the most part there nice.</li>
            <li> my husband bought these for me and I just love them.there easy to put on,they were shipped to me fast and handled very nicely.and they were a great price.all my friends want them now and so I told them all where they can bye them.thanks</li>
            <li> I finally got them there pretty very small so a lot you can do with them......little amount,,,,,,,but still great......</li>
            <li> Great love them but they give u enough for one set of nails for each color....i will purchase again</li>
            <li> Very pleasant company, responded right away when there was a problem. Little stars are adorable. Would use again!!!!!!</li>
            <li> These are nice quality, very pretty and a great price. They did take a little long to get here, but look how far its coming from.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest getting the little wax-tip pencil made for picking up tiny things like this. It works great and leaves no residue or sticky spots on the teeny stars and stuff.</li>
            <li> I love these little stars their so cute &amp; came packaged so nicely all in their own compartments try them you&#x27;ll love em.</li>
            <li> my daughter loves to do her nails and glue these on! picture shows what you get exactly</li>
            <li> Adorable but alot of the gold stars escaped into the package.  Glad I don&#x27;t like gold :)</li>
            <li> Great love this , excited to use it !</li>
            <li> Everything was exactly as pictured. &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> Although there is only 10 different color stars, and then two different colored squares, it is still worth the money. There are tons of each color and they stay on well. Overall I am pretty happy with them.</li>
            <li> this was a 2nd order, love using these on my nails</li>
            <li> These stars are great!  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Very cute and plenty of stars for the price...</li>
            <li> Lots of tiny iridescent stars, I use them when I do my gels/acrylics and just lay them inside the product. Haven&#x27;t tried them with polish.</li>
            <li> Beatiful colors, exelent quality, pefec size, the container prevents colors fom mixing each others. Just love it</li>
            <li> too cool. these are so great even for me.  they work for nifty card designs, too.  i enjoy putting them in for gifting.</li>
            <li> I was not sure what to expect with this purchase as I had never before ordered nail decoration tips, but I was very pleasantly surprised. The colors were bright and beautiful and a lot of fun to work with. They also come in a well constructed case keeping the tips separate. This was a great purchase. The only setback is the three weeks to a month it takes to reach you.</li>
            <li> Thease are very cute.  I like color variation and size but to use for nail, these are too thick.  Even with generous amount of top coat, thickness cannot be covered.</li>
            <li> These stars where cool but they are so bulky I never use them.</li>
