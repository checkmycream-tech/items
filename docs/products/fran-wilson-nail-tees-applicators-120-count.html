            <li>Much narrower than qtips, these are great for neatening up polish mistakes and overdone brows.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I love these q-tips for cleaning up nail polish on my skin as well as smeared eyeliner or mascara.</li>
            <li>Many uses beyond nails for these.</li>
            <li>I love these for cleaning up cuticles after a manicure.  </li>
            <li>tend to use them more to correct mistakes with my eye makeup or even to smudge my eye liner.</li>
            <li>I use them for touching up nail polish after painting my nails by dipping them in remover and rubbing excess polish off.</li>
            <li>Great.. pointy and soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but these are perfectly shaped for detail corrections.</li>
            <li>EASY TO USE AND CLEAN.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Would like to see it in sturdier handle so it does not bend too easily.  </li>
            <li>The point is strong and doesn&#x27;t bend or fall apart too easily.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re the perfect shape for removing nail polish that didn&#x27;t end up in the right place - much better than your average q-tip.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for something that would make it really easy for me to clean up any stray nail polish on/around my cuticles when I give myself a manicure.  </li>
            <li>These applicators are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>For nails, are almost as precise as old-school cotton over orange wood stick.</li>
            <li>Fuzz free precision.</li>
            <li>I will say they are far superior to the q-tip brand precision applicators though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been stopped several times by people asking me who does my nails because my manicures look like they&#x27;re professionally done since I&#x27;m able to clean them up perfectly.</li>
            <li>They are much better than the first brand I tried of this type.</li>
            <li>i bought this to clean up the edges of my nails when painting.</li>
            <li>I use it to clean my jewelry.....</li>
            <li>I will buy more and they sent them fast.</li>
            <li>Even once dipped in acetone they stay firm and keep their great, pointed tip, allowing for easy clean-up.  </li>
            <li>Good but not soft.  </li>
            <li>I use these specially precion tip cotton swabs in my work as an artist and they are difficult to find, I found them on Amazon for an unbelievably great price will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re more firm than q-tips, which is great because they keep their shape a bit better and don&#x27;t leave little pieces of cotton all over the place.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad these were invented, definitely saves time!</li>
            <li>love the double sided point swab, never encountered these anywhere.</li>
            <li>i was so glad to discover these since my last brand discontinued (studio basics).  </li>
            <li>LOL I&#x27;m serious.</li>
            <li>I do wish the fine tip were a little ‘stronger’ because they squish up sort of easily</li>
            <li>Q-tips are generally too large and fuzzy to get right along the cuticle (without touching the actual nail).  </li>
            <li>Very helpful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used q-tips to touch up my nails, but these make life SO much easier.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;point&#x27; of the Q-tip  is very rigid.  </li>
            <li>Great for cleaning out dusty crevices from wood and plastic collectibles</li>
            <li>These work really well.</li>
            <li>These precision qtips work very well for nails.</li>
            <li>These applicators work very well.</li>
            <li>They work very well for that, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
            <li>I use them to clean up my manicure and when you get to the second hand, the tip begins to lose it&#x27;s shape.  </li>
            <li>I use these for getting into very tiny places to clean.  </li>
            <li>Mainly for cleaning off any mistakes i make applying the mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Beats plain q tips easily!</li>
            <li>Better than the round tip q-tips.</li>
            <li>I just dip the tip in acetone and rub around the outside of my freshly painted nails.</li>
            <li>I was sad to see that my local Sallys store stopped selling these I am so happy I found them online for the same price and also free shipping</li>
            <li>I’ve been using these for 3 years now, and I don’t think I could live without them again.</li>
            <li>Originally bought this for makeup/polish removal but found other uses.  </li>
            <li>The cotton ? is tight and has a nice point, no fibers smearing into the wet nail polish.  </li>
            <li>Rate it 4 because the handle is a bit too soft.  </li>
            <li>Nice sharp tips that are quite firm.  </li>
            <li>Many other uses other than rogue polish remover.</li>
            <li>I use them to clean small crevices like my computer keyboard.</li>
            <li>I also use them for touching up my makeup because the cotton on the end is tightly spun, so it doesn&#x27;t unravel and I can get enough pressure behind it to actually remove eyeliner cleanly.</li>
            <li>They are very firm and can be almost sharp but work so much better</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed for my doll customization, gets into the little corners for detail work.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not super absorbent which means that you wont use too much polish remover.</li>
            <li>I find they&#x27;re very helpful for cleaning up the little spots of spillover that happen when you&#x27;re doing your nails.  </li>

            <li> The box is a bit smaller than I imagined, but lasts a surprisingly long time.</li>
            <li> They have a much harder tip than standard cue tips and don&#x27;t fall apart when dipped in gun cleaning fluid.</li>
            <li> These are pointed on both ends, I&#x27;m not thrilled with them but will make them work and see if i can find what I really want when it is time to reorder.</li>

            <li> Before purchasing this product I was using the manicure sticks and wrapping cotton balls around the edge (super tedious work)</li>
            <li> Pointed cotton holds up well when wet with nail polish remover.  </li>
            <li> I expected them to be firmer but they got the job done.</li>
            <li> They are sufficiently stiff and the cotton swab part is tight enough to get the job done</li>
            <li> I thought I reordered nail tees that I bought before which are round on one end and pointed on the other end.  </li>
            <li> allowed me to get in in tight spaces - even handles of my fridge.  </li>
            <li> For mani cleanups and eye makeup, they&#x27;re wound tight and get in corners.</li>
            <li> These are firm, pointy cotton Q-tips.</li>
            <li> I use them when working on small model building.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my father-in-law to clea some equipment he has as there are some hard to reach nooks and crannies and</li>

            <li> I wish I had known about these years ago!  They&#x27;re the perfect shape for removing nail polish that didn&#x27;t end up in the right place - much better than your average q-tip.  They&#x27;re more firm than q-tips, which is great because they keep their shape a bit better and don&#x27;t leave little pieces of cotton all over the place.</li>
            <li> Beats plain q tips easily!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. EASY TO USE AND CLEAN.&lt;br /&gt;I WILL TELL OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT THAT.ENJOY IT IN DAILY LIFE. THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> I use these for getting into very tiny places to clean.  They are excellent for cleaning my coffee maker, for instance.  Love them.</li>
            <li> I expected them to be firmer but they got the job done.</li>
            <li> Great for cleaning out dusty crevices from wood and plastic collectibles</li>
            <li> i like the tiny heads.  allowed me to get in in tight spaces - even handles of my fridge.  Originally bought this for makeup/polish removal but found other uses.  Rate it 4 because the handle is a bit too soft.  Would like to see it in sturdier handle so it does not bend too easily.  Maybe and additional product in the future so we can have one with softer handle for makeup and sturdier handle for housed/office use?</li>
            <li> These come in so handy when correcting nail polish or makeup mistakes. I do wish the fine tip were a little ‘stronger’ because they squish up sort of easily, however I don’t think it’s physically possible for them to be as it’s the nature of the material. I will say they are far superior to the q-tip brand precision applicators though. I’ve been using these for 3 years now, and I don’t think I could live without them again.</li>
            <li> Easy clean up and very handy. Before purchasing this product I was using the manicure sticks and wrapping cotton balls around the edge (super tedious work) and when I was done I would dip in the polish remover, this process would be repeated over and over until all nails were cleaned up.  I&#x27;m glad these were invented, definitely saves time!</li>
            <li> These Precision q-tips work great on so many things.  I use them to clean small crevices like my computer keyboard.</li>
            <li> These work really well. I use them all the time. Cleans up everything. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Good product and price</li>
            <li> These are great for manicures. I will buy more and they sent them fast.</li>
            <li> I love these q-tips for cleaning up nail polish on my skin as well as smeared eyeliner or mascara. These are also great for precision applying eyeshadow to your crease.</li>
            <li> These precision qtips work very well for nails. They hold their shape and don&#x27;t collapse when you use them. Nor do cotton fibers come off when you use them. Many uses beyond nails for these.</li>
            <li> I love these for cleaning up cuticles after a manicure.  The cotton ? is tight and has a nice point, no fibers smearing into the wet nail polish.  I am so glad I found these!</li>
            <li> i bought this to clean up the edges of my nails when painting. works great. it&#x27;s not super absorbent which means that you wont use too much polish remover.</li>
            <li> Product is excellent - I have used them before.  I got them to help in artist details for oil paintings.</li>
            <li> very happy with product, will order again  love the double sided point swab, never encountered these anywhere. I will order again</li>
            <li> Fuzz free precision. I luv luv luv these. For mani cleanups and eye makeup, they&#x27;re wound tight and get in corners. Absorbent without oversaturating. I needed these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My local drugstore has a tapered swab, but they&#x27;re nothing close to these in quality or application.</li>
            <li> Best fine tipped swabs I have found for my hobby and craft work.  The tip seems to last a long time before softening out of shape.  One box lasts for months/years......</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my father-in-law to clea some equipment he has as there are some hard to reach nooks and crannies and this definitely gets the job done.  My mother-in-law also uses it for make-up application.  I use it to clean my jewelry.....It&#x27;s perfectly shaped for all three uses!!  Would defintley recommend it.  The item arrived on time, as decribed and packaged well.</li>
            <li> These are great but if you are a klutz watch out. You could stab yourself in the eye. LOL I&#x27;m serious. It works great though. Better than the round tip q-tips.</li>
            <li> These applicators work very well. They are sufficiently stiff and the cotton swab part is tight enough to get the job done cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to use them more to correct mistakes with my eye makeup or even to smudge my eye liner. They work very well for that, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for cleaning up around the nails after you polish them. I just dip the tip in acetone and rub around the outside of my freshly painted nails. The point is strong and doesn&#x27;t bend or fall apart too easily. The box is a bit smaller than I imagined, but lasts a surprisingly long time.</li>
            <li> These are firm, pointy cotton Q-tips. I use them for touching up nail polish after painting my nails by dipping them in remover and rubbing excess polish off. I also use them for touching up my makeup because the cotton on the end is tightly spun, so it doesn&#x27;t unravel and I can get enough pressure behind it to actually remove eyeliner cleanly. I don&#x27;t know why they call these applicators. They aren&#x27;t sponges, and I wouldn&#x27;t use them to apply makeup.</li>
            <li> The pointed cotton covered swabs are genius.  Many other uses other than rogue polish remover.</li>
            <li> i was so glad to discover these since my last brand discontinued (studio basics).  they appear to be firm and very pointy, unlike the qtip brand precision swabs.  i use these for eyeliner corrections.  they work great!!</li>
            <li> I thought I reordered nail tees that I bought before which are round on one end and pointed on the other end.  These are pointed on both ends, I&#x27;m not thrilled with them but will make them work and see if i can find what I really want when it is time to reorder.</li>
            <li> these are the best for spot corrections while painting nails. I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but these are perfectly shaped for detail corrections.</li>
            <li> I could not do my eye makeup without this product. Mainly for cleaning off any mistakes i make applying the mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I buy this on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Well made applicators. I use them when working on small model building.</li>
