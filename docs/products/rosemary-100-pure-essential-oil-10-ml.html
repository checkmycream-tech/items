            <li>BUT WITHOUT A HEALTHY SALP</li>
            <li>HAVE HEALTHY HAIR:</li>
            <li>I love plantlife products.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I use this for so many things.</li>
            <li>I am pleased.</li>
            <li>Helps my son sleep better too.</li>
            <li>This is a ncie product that I love the smell.</li>
            <li>This item arrived as scheduled and was appropriately packed.</li>
            <li>Included was a booklet explaining the uses of the product as well as appropriate precautions.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;it is a favorite</li>
            <li>Rosemary has many uses and lives up to all of them.</li>
            <li>but I love the way the dropper works.</li>
            <li>If not, this may be too potent.</li>
            <li>would get more when what I have runs out.  </li>
            <li>I would give this 5 stars if the dropper worked better.</li>
            <li>I love all of the aroma oils and these are not exeption.</li>
            <li>Thanks Plantlife!!!!  </li>
            <li>Very quick shipping on this and the diffuser.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Received quickly too!</li>
            <li>im happy with my purchase of rosmary oil, i applied it to my conditioners and deep conditioners and also my hair moisturizing lotions.</li>
            <li>Overall great product.</li>
            <li>The oil comes out freely so you don&#x27;t have to try and force it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not paying attention though, it could flow too freely.</li>
            <li>and so I figured it was worth a try!  </li>
            <li>Had powerful properties and is good for natural hair uses.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased my mom a full line.</li>
            <li>the smell is not bad,.</li>
            <li>The oil comes out way too quick.  </li>
            <li>THe bottle is a bit small and the scent is not as strong as I have experienced with others brands</li>
            <li>Recommended as a natural and safe product to repel fleas and ticks on pets.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this to put on my boyfriend&#x27;s feet who is a diabetic, and helps him right before bedtime.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not subtle but maybe this is how strong pure rosemary is.</li>
            <li>This was ok, but after purchasing from another company, I realized that this one was not as strong as the other.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I was delighted with a little gift from this seller.</li>
            <li>I love this essential oil.  </li>
            <li>but I guess it would be okay if you mixed it with water and used it as a room freshener.</li>
            <li>It is just as described, seems potent enough and works as described.</li>
            <li>I gave it four stars because am not big on strong smells but its worth it.</li>
            <li>B0018195G0 Patchouli 100% Pure Essential Oil - 30 ml]] for sexual desire and romancing women</li>
            <li>As a natural, it is an essential oil I keep handy</li>
            <li>The oil is great, I use it for my natural hair (I&#x27;m African American)</li>
            <li>It might be too strong for people who aren&#x27;t used to essential oils, though.</li>
            <li>Seems pure.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a pure product thats what you&#x27;ll get.</li>
            <li>This is great for me as I have very dry scalp that gets red and flaky and this natural oil once a week helps reduce that.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It arrived fast and smells heavenly.  </li>
            <li>This oil really helped to moisturize my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>There very therapeutic and calming.</li>
            <li>Very fragrant.</li>
            <li>but the smell is sometimes too much to bear.</li>
            <li>Thanks for selling this.  </li>
            <li>Why better quality than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for the price, but I&#x27;ll go with the other.</li>
            <li>If you dilute with other oils I think the strong smell will be diluted.</li>
            <li>but it goes a long way and pays for itself when you substitute it for drugstore items (&amp; it&#x27;s my favorite essential oil).</li>
            <li>A friend told me that rosemary oil was good for thin hair</li>
            <li>very professional company, highly recommended.    </li>
            <li>I am using this product as a mix with other essential oils for my hair and the first thing I noticed is how strong the smell is.</li>
            <li>*other oils of their i recommend are (some come w/ free shipping):    </li>
            <li>And when I&#x27;ve bought from plantlife they will often send a free sample of one of their other products.  </li>
            <li>I sometimes use it on the length of my hair and it leaves it very soft.</li>
            <li>This bottle was really small but it was so potent that it lasted quite a while.  </li>
            <li>B00014DGCO Lavender 100% Pure Essential Oil -10ml]]</li>

            <li>it make my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li>CANNOT BE USED DIRECTLY B/C OF THEIR POTENCY.</li>
            <li>I am natural and I use this with my shampoo and conditioner mix.  </li>
            <li>use it for my natural hair</li>
            <li>The aroma is quite strong so I can use a drop or two less which will make the oil last longer.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it is extremely potent, even though it comes in a small bottle it will last a longtime</li>
            <li>The smell is solid and decent.  </li>
            <li>I will always come back to reorder it, for me any my whole family and my relative too...</li>
            <li>this one product was almost half the price you&#x27;d pay at a health store, came w/ free shipping, and the company added a free little hotel-sized bar of lavender soap, along w/ a mini-brochure showing web site info, other products etc.     </li>
            <li>It is very concentrated, so a little bit is enough.</li>

            <li> It is very concentrated, so a little bit is enough.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item along with other essential oils for my natural hair care.  </li>
            <li> received in just a few days cross country (CA to MA) from PlantLife Natural Care.</li>
            <li> I mixed this along with other oils like Tea Tree and Peppermint along with megatek and M-T-G and it soothes the scalp!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the size of the bottle, it will last a long time even with heavy use.</li>
            <li> combine with my other hair produts</li>
            <li> and I use it for my eye lash and black Jamaican castor mixture</li>
            <li> and it smells a little like the rosemary oil</li>
            <li> I put a few drops on my neck before going to sleep.  </li>
            <li> The bottle though is a little too small for me</li>
            <li> I usually use it in my hair treatments which in a way doubles as aromatherapy-like treatment.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a small product</li>
            <li> Use in small doses to avoid headaches from the smell.</li>
            <li> I RANK THIS ON THE SAME LEVEL AS TEA TREE OIL, ITS POTENT,AND DELIVERS.     </li>
            <li> It helped cut down the bad smell from the Henna.</li>
            <li> IT is nearly impossible to count the drops</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Recommended as a natural and safe product to repel fleas and ticks on pets.  Just a dab once a week on the collar.  And it works!!!  No chemicals on my dogs.  Customer service fantastic!  Received quickly too!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item along with other essential oils for my natural hair care.  I mixed this along with other oils like Tea Tree and Peppermint along with megatek and M-T-G and it soothes the scalp! Great buy!</li>
            <li> I love this essential oil.  It is multipurpose.  I usually use it in my hair treatments which in a way doubles as aromatherapy-like treatment.  Love this product and I like Plantlife as well.  Wish they had an actual store where I am but aw well.</li>
            <li> I was delighted with a little gift from this seller. Received the oil fast and the service was very good.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This bottle was really small but it was so potent that it lasted quite a while.  Rosemary is so minty and stimulates the scalp quite well.  I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> It arrived fast and smells heavenly.  It might be too strong for people who aren&#x27;t used to essential oils, though.</li>
            <li> received in just a few days cross country (CA to MA) from PlantLife Natural Care. it&#x27;s a small product but it goes a long way and pays for itself when you substitute it for drugstore items (&amp; it&#x27;s my favorite essential oil). i use it after shampooing &amp; conditioning my hair (it&#x27;s supposed to delay balding and graying), put it on my temples for headaches, and use it for helping wake up in the morning. they also say it prevents fleas on cats, but i haven&#x27;t tried that yet.     this one product was almost half the price you&#x27;d pay at a health store, came w/ free shipping, and the company added a free little hotel-sized bar of lavender soap, along w/ a mini-brochure showing web site info, other products etc.     PlantLife: very professional company, highly recommended.    *other oils of their i recommend are (some come w/ free shipping):    [[ASIN:B00014DGCO Lavender 100% Pure Essential Oil -10ml]] for calming and sleeping  [[ASIN:B000W3ZCE4 Rosemary 100% Pure Essential Oil - 10 ml]] good for hair and for waking up  [[ASIN:B000W3XG1K Tea Tree 100% Pure Essential Oil - 10 ml]] for fungus infections, ingrown hairs, cut/scrapes and it smells a little like the rosemary oil [[ASIN:B0018195G0 Patchouli 100% Pure Essential Oil - 30 ml]] for sexual desire and romancing women</li>
            <li> The bottle was smaller than I thought. But it is a great product. It is very concentrated, so a little bit is enough. I use it on my hair to massage my scalp every night. It feels really good, and it smells great also. I sometimes use it on the length of my hair and it leaves it very soft.</li>
            <li> This oil really helped to moisturize my hair and scalp. Also helped with growth. Very fast shipping. I would order from this company again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this pleasant-smelling oil and noticed after a couple of weeks that I sleep an hour longer (don&#x27;t wake up at 4am)when I put a few drops on my neck before going to sleep.  The only reason I noticed was because I didn&#x27;t put it on a couple of nights and was back to waking up a 4am.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, the quality compared to more expensive brands is drastic. It is like water and the scent doesn&#x27;t last. Not therapeutic quality, but I guess it would be okay if you mixed it with water and used it as a room freshener.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it is extremely potent, even though it comes in a small bottle it will last a longtime</li>
            <li> Items is as described.</li>
            <li> I love the oils. There very therapeutic and calming. I use these as homeopathic cures in many instances. I&#x27;ve purchased my mom a full line. She swears peppermint oil keeps spiders at bay.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  The smell is solid and decent.  I did not know what rosemary smell like before I ordered this product.  Now I can tell you it is lovely.</li>
            <li> im happy with my purchase of rosmary oil, i applied it to my conditioners and deep conditioners and also my hair moisturizing lotions. the smell is not bad,. combine with my other hair produts it make my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product around two months ago, and it&#x27;s great! I mix a couple drops of it in with my coconut oil, and I have seen awesome hair growth.</li>
            <li> I like the smell but this does nothing for me. I am breaking out off and on still.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS FOR ABOUT A MONTH. IT IS GREAT. MAKES MY SCALP TINGLE LIKE NOBODY&#x27;S BUSINESS. IT OPENS MY PORES ALLOWING MY SCALP TO HAVE GOOD CIRCULATION. I RANK THIS ON THE SAME LEVEL AS TEA TREE OIL, ITS POTENT,AND DELIVERS.     I THINK ITS GREAT TO USE TO AS A SCALP MESSAGE. ALOT OF PEOPLE NEGLECT THEIR SCALP BUT WITHOUT A HEALTHY SALP YOU WON&#x27;T HAVE HEALTHY HAIR: \\&quot;POINT BLANK\\&quot;! I JUST RAN OUT BUT ONLY BECAUSE I USED IT IN MOP WATER, LAUNDRY AND ON MY HAIR. LIKE ANOTHER REVIEWER I ALSO USED IT AS A HEADACHE REMEDY.........IT WORKED WITHIN 15MINS, AND I SUFFER FROM MIGRAINES.    PLEASE DILUTE ESSENTIAL OILS CANNOT BE USED DIRECTLY B/C OF THEIR POTENCY. SO WATCH OUT FOR THAT.</li>
            <li> I love plantlife products.  And when I&#x27;ve bought from plantlife they will often send a free sample of one of their other products.  It&#x27;s great!  I&#x27;ve always liked everything I have gotten from them.  Thanks Plantlife!!!!  :)</li>
            <li> I am natural and I use this with my shampoo and conditioner mix.  Also use this with my shower gel and bath water.</li>
            <li> Had powerful properties and is good for natural hair uses. I use this to add to a conditioner I use and it helps nourish my scalp and has a nice tingling feeling as well. The overall product is inexpensive and functional!</li>
            <li> I use this for so many things. Great quality. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the size of the bottle, it will last a long time even with heavy use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand &amp; essential oil B4. I put this N my hair oil mixture that I make. Gives it a great smell &amp; a great antioxidant for hair &amp; scalp.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to put on my boyfriend&#x27;s feet who is a diabetic, and helps him right before bedtime. I also bought it for my hair it penetrates the scalpes, and promotes the hair follicle in regrowth.</li>
            <li> Great quality, great company, they even sent me a handwritten note. And a lemongrass bar of soap. Thank you! Would buy again. Why better quality than other brands I have tried. Used this for homemade shampoo.</li>
            <li> Excellent oil for many uses!</li>
            <li> The oil is great, I use it for my natural hair (I&#x27;m African American) the sent is very strong even when diluted with water but I don&#x27;t mind.will purchase again</li>
            <li> This is a very good rosemary oil. Seems pure. I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Very quick shipping on this and the diffuser.  Works as promised and smells wonderful!  Helps my son sleep better too.</li>
            <li> This is a ncie product that I love the smell. I bought it because it is supposed to open the blood vessels to the brain and thus reducing Dementia. It works for a day or two but then caused anxiety in my loved one.</li>
            <li> This was ok, but after purchasing from another company, I realized that this one was not as strong as the other. It&#x27;s ok for the price, but I&#x27;ll go with the other.</li>
            <li> This is great for me as I have very dry scalp that gets red and flaky and this natural oil once a week helps reduce that. Wonderful</li>
            <li> N o directions for use came with it.</li>
            <li> My title says it all. If you&#x27;re looking for a pure product thats what you&#x27;ll get. I gave it four stars because am not big on strong smells but its worth it. I use it on my scalp and have seen a difference in my hair. If you dilute with other oils I think the strong smell will be diluted. Overall great product.</li>
            <li> This item arrived as scheduled and was appropriately packed. Included was a booklet explaining the uses of the product as well as appropriate precautions. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> This product comes in a great brown glass bottle with a drop dispention top. The aroma is quite strong so I can use a drop or two less which will make the oil last longer.</li>
            <li> So wonderful. Very fragrant.</li>
            <li> I love this product, the fragance is excellent. I used this with the Jamila Henna. It helped cut down the bad smell from the Henna. In addtion, it is wonderful for the hair as well.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a superb purchase&lt;br /&gt;it is a favorite and I Would purchase over&lt;br /&gt;and over again, a must buy!!!!</li>
            <li> Rosemary has many uses and lives up to all of them. As a natural, it is an essential oil I keep handy but the smell is sometimes too much to bear. Use in small doses to avoid headaches from the smell.</li>
            <li> I am using this product as a mix with other essential oils for my hair and the first thing I noticed is how strong the smell is. It&#x27;s not subtle but maybe this is how strong pure rosemary is. The bottle though is a little too small for me but I love the way the dropper works. The oil comes out freely so you don&#x27;t have to try and force it. If you&#x27;re not paying attention though, it could flow too freely. Get this if you&#x27;re looking for a scent with a kick. If not, this may be too potent.</li>
            <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my natural hair</li>
            <li> I will always come back to reorder it, for me any my whole family and my relative too... Thank you</li>
            <li> This product helps with sleeping.  would get more when what I have runs out.  Thanks for selling this.  Price was fair.</li>
            <li> A friend told me that rosemary oil was good for thin hair and so I figured it was worth a try!  I have been using it for about two weeks now and it does thicken up the hair - Massage into your scalp the night before shampooing....doesnt get any easier than that</li>
            <li> THe bottle is a bit small and the scent is not as strong as I have experienced with others brands</li>
            <li> I would give this 5 stars if the dropper worked better. I have bought several oils form this company and the droppers are all the same.  The oil comes out way too quick.  IT is nearly impossible to count the drops and I go through it faster than I like.</li>
            <li> bought to use in a recipe for homemade shampoo.  I was amazed to find out the benefits I did not expect.</li>
            <li> Excatly what I wanted</li>
            <li> i use it in the spa and sower/steam room. I love all of the aroma oils and these are not exeption.</li>
            <li> It is just as described, seems potent enough and works as described. It is easy to purchase from Amazon. Buy</li>
