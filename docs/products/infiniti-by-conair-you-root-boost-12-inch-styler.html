            <li>It adds great lift to my hair without using all of the products.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>If I wanted a crimped hair style, it would be great, but as a volumizer, it&#x27;s lacking.</li>
            <li>What a wonderful product!  :-)</li>
            <li>This is wonderful and actually is a very quick process.</li>
            <li>Very good, my wife love it.</li>
            <li>I chose this crimper over others because of the ceramic plates, the floating plate technology, and the good price.</li>
            <li>texture but in a good way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing for making fine hair feel thicker, and great for braiding &amp; up-dos!</li>
            <li>Would be better if the cord swiveled, but great otherwise.</li>
            <li>I very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>discovered this and am very glad I did.</li>
            <li>The concept works and it&#x27;s a nice adjustable iron that leaves a good crimp</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this!  </li>
            <li>but I think a bunch of tangles are much more unsightly!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Glad I did!</li>
            <li>This volumizes my roots through crimping alone, but if I want even more volume it makes my hair hold the tease all day!</li>
            <li>Amazing volume that lasts for days without the wear and tear of teasing or backcombing.</li>
            <li>This is amazing.  </li>
            <li>and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing</li>
            <li>But even on the lowest heat setting, the iron effectively crimps the hair in five seconds.</li>
            <li>Its kind of like teasing, but easier, and longer-lasting.</li>
            <li>and this adds an incredible boost to the roots, and that is exactly where it is needed.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use</li>
            <li>Also nice that cord is longer than most store bought tools.</li>
            <li>It is incredibly easy to use!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very fine and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of body.</li>
            <li>It is a very fine crimp.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this thing!</li>
            <li>I had a haircut this week and wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the way she cut it because I like more lift on top.  </li>
            <li>What an awesome tool, truly adds incredible volume at the roots of my usually fine limp hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a quick, easy way to create great volume.</li>
            <li>(I want body at the top of my head, not by my ears).</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>For some reason, my hair lays better if I do it this way.</li>
            <li>I crimp underneath the surface hair and it builds more volume.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t crimp the top layer</li>
            <li>fullness at the root looks sexy and youthful.  </li>
            <li>Glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love this Conair Root Boost.  </li>
            <li>Pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t use it at your part so you don&#x27;t see the crimps.  </li>
            <li>I am VERY picky and think this is absolutely great.  </li>
            <li>You crimp the underneath layers of your hair at the root and then cover with your top layer of hair.</li>
            <li>I was able to use my Amazon card pts to get this</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>You just need to remember to section off the top part of your hair so you can cover up all the crimped sections.  </li>
            <li>I love using this machine</li>
            <li>this is a god-send :)</li>
            <li>Also, you have to make sure you place the crimps everywhere</li>
            <li>Love the color</li>
            <li>Maybe could do more volume</li>
            <li>She loves hers too. :)</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it helps add 20% more.</li>
            <li>It also makes my ponies look cuter -- like Pinterest cute.</li>
            <li>/&gt;just make sure to do the partings the way it says to do them..</li>
            <li>Gives my hair way more body.</li>
            <li>All I have to do is crimp my roots, and my baby fine hair is so full of body!!  </li>
            <li>In doing my research, I thankfully came across the Infiniti micro crimper, and at such a good price ($20)!  </li>
            <li>I get compliments on the full lift I get from this iron!</li>
            <li>I found that it is most effective if you comb each section of hair straight up before crimping, and put in three rows of side-by-side crimps close to the scalp.</li>
            <li>It had excellent reviews and for the price I couldn&#x27;t go wrong, so I sprung for it; I&#x27;m so glad I did!!  </li>
            <li>This thing is pure magic!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and have tried every volumizing product out there</li>
            <li>The krimper is ultra fine and makes your hair look like pubes.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>(just mentioning in case you have fine hair and are wondering about it with your type).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This little tool is incredible!!</li>
            <li>This iron is perfect for giving a little lift on the underside of my hair.</li>
            <li>This crimper is great in giving your hair an extra boost of volume.</li>
            <li>then it is very useful.</li>
            <li>I have very fine straight hair</li>
            <li>It is very light weight and easy to use, it heats up fast and gets VERY hot.</li>
            <li>However, the Sam Villa, after various discounts still ran $110 and I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to spend that kind of money.  </li>
            <li>So far the best thing out there to give your hair lasting volume!</li>
            <li>Full head of hair.  </li>
            <li>and this helps give it that added boost to make my hair look full of body.</li>
            <li>The heat settings on the iron are really cool.  </li>
            <li>It would have cost loads to get one, and then I would&#x27;ve had to use some sort of converter/adapter with it, which I am always super sketchy about when it comes to heated hair styling tools.</li>
            <li>Searching this product on Amazon.com, I quickly ordered one to try at home.  </li>
            <li>Works great, low price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I have straight and fine Asian fair .</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need that kind of daily volume, and I doubt if it&#x27;s healthy for your hair--but for a little extra for special days, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>Follow how they tell ya, and its really that easy to get the volume.</li>
            <li>This styler is so easy to use and it really volumizes hair from your roots, as it promises to do.</li>
            <li>I finally fell in love with this!</li>
            <li>it really gives my hair allot of volume and I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>Great styling tool to add root volume, especially for short fine hair.</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair turns out every time I use this, whenever I used to tease my hair it was really hit or miss if the volume wanted to be gorgeous on uneven -___-&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Make sure to avoid crimping hair near your face.  </li>
            <li>I probably crimp about 4 inches around my head under the crown section of my hair, making sure to avoid crimping the hair near my face.  </li>
            <li>Teasing doesn&#x27;t work cuz my strands are so smooth and slippery the tangles work themselves out in about an hour, and adding hairspray to the rats nests only buys me a couple more hours.</li>
            <li>This is far better than any shampoo or styling product I have tried to add volume.</li>
            <li>hair is so fine, silky (not the good kind) and flat that the crimp is gone in a few hours,</li>
            <li>My previously droopy hair looks much more bouncy now (not just on top-- all over) and I&#x27;m happy at long last.  : )</li>
            <li>Nice flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it and the price is right.</li>
            <li>You want to hide anything you use this on underneath normally styled hair, but it&#x27;s well worth it, because the volume is HUGE without teasing, without product, anything.</li>
            <li>Best thing I have spent my money on , in a long time.</li>
            <li>I want more body but either the crimps show or to be able to hide them, you have to start it halfway down your head</li>
            <li>I will even ad more crimps down the hairshaft to add more volumn.  </li>
            <li>This unit heats up instantly and is light weight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>That would take forever to achieve, and I feel like would be suitable only costume parties and...editorial stuff</li>
            <li>and I have full hair that is much easier to manage.</li>
            <li>I slept on my full straight hair and it&#x27;s still voluptuous without doing anything to it.  </li>
            <li>(Being outside and a little humid)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve not figured out the best places to crimp</li>
            <li>You can pretty much make your hair as full and volumptuous as you can dream.  </li>
            <li>Not enough that I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li>, it is way too hot for anyone&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>This does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>Try styling first and then volumizing.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite beauty gurus reviewed a Sam Villa Textur Iron, which does something very similar to the Infiniti, in that they are both micro crimpers intended for the root to create fullness.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that could make it better is if it were cordless.</li>
            <li>I do use the spray \\&quot;Thicker Fuller Hair\\&quot; on the roots first.</li>
            <li>(Gets too hot being</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>It works EXACTLY like it says...</li>
            <li>I decided that with a lob, more volume was necessary</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time today</li>
            <li>I just tried it today for the first time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely is a mus have for anyone that wants easily added volume to their hair!</li>
            <li>You will be happy you got one if you have fine, thin hair and want volume!</li>
            <li>Great product, using for extra volume for the lazy days and free from teasing your hair.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s always flat on top.</li>
            <li>It heats up very fast and goes to pretty much any temp you could want.</li>
            <li>I also use it to give my hair texture when I&#x27;m trying to do an updo because my hair is so soft and fine that normally it just falls out!</li>
            <li>The item came very fast, but we thought that this crimper would crimp very well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and the results last until washing again.  </li>
            <li>I pretty much can&#x27;t live without it now!  </li>
            <li>It gives amazing lift to fine, thin hair like mine.</li>
            <li>I watched several different YouTube videos demonstrating how to use this wonderful little gadget, then put it to the test.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It really does work to boost the root area.  </li>
            <li>to do the whole head.</li>
            <li>It really help me boost up my hair.  </li>
            <li>I like this iron really well.  </li>
            <li>really bd idea....</li>
            <li>because you want it straight</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this with the straight look as well as curly look.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this for a while but didn&#x27;t want to spend too much on something that I might not like.  </li>
            <li>She said she wants to purchase it too.  </li>
            <li>I really like this thing.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fast and if you follow the directions you get a lot of volume.  </li>
            <li>For this styler to work, you really have to style your hair and leave it that way.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s also such a smooth texture that it doesn&#x27;t hold when I tease</li>
            <li>I have straight hair, shoulder length.  </li>
            <li>I think it would be easy to burn your hair if you left it on for more than a few seconds at the higher settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is one of the coolest things for fine flat hair.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair; however, it is baby fine, which makes it lay flat to my scalp.</li>
            <li>I have flat fine hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not having ever used the actual Babyliss one from the UK, I can&#x27;t be sure it&#x27;s the exact same one in a US version, but it works like a charm.</li>
            <li>if the other crimper iron works better.  </li>
            <li>and my hair handles really high heat really well).</li>
            <li>I use it on the second to lowest heat setting, and after you get used to using it, after you figure out how to strategize its use over a full head of hair, it works beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>old women who has had to deal with stick straight hair all her life!</li>
            <li>Depending on how many horizontal layers I do, I can amp up or down the volume.  </li>
            <li>This, in conjunction with dry shampoo, helps keep my hair voluminous and avoid the need to shampoo excessively (Shampoo-I still shower my body daily :D )</li>
            <li>Sure it kinda does make the crimped part slightly resemble pubes</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s mainly my hair and not the iron</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly, with different temperature options.</li>
            <li>I have always had flat, limp hair and use a fair amount of product to give it lift and hold.  </li>
            <li>This may work well for people with thin hair, but I didn&#x27;t get any more volume using this than I do when using a root volumizer before blow drying (I use Big Sexy Hair&#x27;s Root Pump Plus Mousse).  </li>
            <li>that normal people have nothing to do with.</li>
            <li>Maybe it works for other hair types, but for those with fine hair like mine, it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>My hair is super long</li>
            <li>on barrel, directions were wrinkled and plug did not look new.  </li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t live without it, have to bring it with me travel oversea.  </li>
            <li>When my new hair stylist used this on me in a salon, I was intrigued.  </li>
            <li>So enter my new friend, Crimpy, to the rescue.  </li>
            <li>Does grip the short hair really well, but don&#x27;t see as much shine after usage.</li>
            <li>I love this little thing!</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping and is the same as it describe.</li>
            <li>But it heats up very fast and is very hot, so just use it a few seconds on each divided strand.  </li>
            <li>Oh it&#x27;s way better than ratting or teasing because it&#x27;s not snarling or damaging the hair as much and gives me a natural uniform volume that&#x27;s hard to achieve with teasing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use and takes little time to get hot, it has numerous heat settings as well!</li>
            <li>Let the hair cool completely, bend over so that your head is upside down, and gently brush to separate the crimps.</li>
            <li>It only takes a couple of quick minutes, and it totally works!  </li>
            <li>It takes about 10 minutes to do my roots and smooth out my ends with a flat iron and I have long hair.</li>
            <li>and  I made a little drawstrinng that I can put it in and Ican easily fit it in an emergency bag ( a change of clothes) that I keep in my car.</li>
            <li>The iron is a little warm, so you want to be careful not to burn yourself.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t take much to just crimp an extra section making the crimped part of the hair wider then cover with the noon crimped hair.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be surprised at what you can create....</li>
            <li>I have no trouble hiding it anyways.  </li>
            <li>This product really surprised me.</li>
            <li>But the picture does not display the plates completely.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not quite as big of a deal if a piece peaks through than it would be if I had straight hair or lighter</li>
            <li>Volume like I used to have naturally.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s perfect for what I use it for: adding volume at the base of my hair.  </li>
            <li>Easy to get close to roots since it&#x27;s small.</li>
            <li>Anyways, since my hair is so heavy, the top of my hair always looks really flat.  </li>
            <li>Really recommend for any one who need to boost up their flat hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is past my shoulder blades</li>
            <li>The 2nd degree choice on the iron, is hot enough with out burning my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Wow!</li>
            <li>It only burned horrid miniature, Borrowers-sized crimps into my hair (actually burned, got way too hot</li>
            <li>I was a little bummed that it didn&#x27;t work on my growing-out platinum pixie, but I didn&#x27;t really expect to be able to hide the little crimps.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and only takes a few minutes to add into my routine each morning.</li>
            <li>Need to take a long time to finish whole root boost.</li>
            <li>You really have to hold the crimper in your hair for a long time to make any type of crimp.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair, and have tried everything for volume..</li>
            <li>I have long, straight blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>I use the regular curling iron also, after crimping, to direct my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far because I just got it.  </li>
            <li>I have super thick, heavy, straight Asian hair that rests right above my butt, and teasing my hair is a pain in the butt!  </li>
            <li>I have fine flat long brown hair that I can&#x27;t usually wear straight because it sticks flat to myhead  </li>
            <li>Gives extra body at the roots to my fine flat hair and only takes a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>Volumizing mousse and other root sprays never did much for my hair</li>
            <li>The only semi-complaint is that the heat settings seem unusually HOT, but that is likely due to that the iron is meant to butt up against the scalp.  </li>
            <li>It seems that if you use this right after it&#x27;s washed it should last until the next shampoo because it really adds a serious crimp.  </li>
            <li>This little gadget gives me way more volume that won&#x27;t fall flat even when I decide to tie my hair up half way through the night</li>
            <li>I have medium thick hair that is somewhat coarse, and this really didn&#x27;t make that much of a difference for me.  </li>
            <li>You just have to be careful where you place the crimps, because you don&#x27;t want them to show through, but that&#x27;s not hard to do.</li>
            <li>but my super hard too curl</li>
            <li>Since my hair is super thick</li>
            <li>Maybe they have super thick strands</li>
            <li>I have thick but very fine hair that likes to go limp.</li>
            <li>I did, however, try it on my sister last night and it was AMAZING for her long, thin hair!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not great at doing my own hair, and I&#x27;ve always had a hard time getting volume (especially during the humid summers where I live).  </li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair</li>
            <li>Saddest part is that I apparently can&#x27;t read because I thought I was buying a narrow hair straightener and was super bummed when this mess arrived.</li>

            <li> Works great, does the job it&#x27;s suppose to.</li>
            <li> It adds great lift to my hair without using all of the products.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Great price.</li>
            <li> If I wanted a crimped hair style, it would be great, but as a volumizer, it&#x27;s lacking.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful product!  :-)</li>
            <li> This is wonderful and actually is a very quick process.</li>
            <li> Very good, my wife love it.</li>
            <li> I chose this crimper over others because of the ceramic plates, the floating plate technology, and the good price.</li>
            <li> texture but in a good way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing for making fine hair feel thicker, and great for braiding &amp; up-dos!</li>
            <li> Would be better if the cord swiveled, but great otherwise.</li>
            <li> I very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> discovered this and am very glad I did.</li>
            <li> The concept works and it&#x27;s a nice adjustable iron that leaves a good crimp</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this!  </li>
            <li> but I think a bunch of tangles are much more unsightly!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Glad I did!</li>
            <li> This volumizes my roots through crimping alone, but if I want even more volume it makes my hair hold the tease all day!</li>
            <li> Amazing volume that lasts for days without the wear and tear of teasing or backcombing.</li>
            <li> This is amazing.  </li>
            <li> and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing</li>
            <li> But even on the lowest heat setting, the iron effectively crimps the hair in five seconds.</li>
            <li> Its kind of like teasing, but easier, and longer-lasting.</li>
            <li> and this adds an incredible boost to the roots, and that is exactly where it is needed.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use</li>
            <li> Also nice that cord is longer than most store bought tools.</li>
            <li> It is incredibly easy to use!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very fine and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of body.</li>
            <li> It is a very fine crimp.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this thing!</li>
            <li> I had a haircut this week and wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the way she cut it because I like more lift on top.  </li>
            <li> What an awesome tool, truly adds incredible volume at the roots of my usually fine limp hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a quick, easy way to create great volume.</li>
            <li> (I want body at the top of my head, not by my ears).</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> For some reason, my hair lays better if I do it this way.</li>
            <li> I crimp underneath the surface hair and it builds more volume.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t crimp the top layer</li>
            <li> fullness at the root looks sexy and youthful.  </li>
            <li> Glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love this Conair Root Boost.  </li>
            <li> Pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Make sure you don&#x27;t use it at your part so you don&#x27;t see the crimps.  </li>
            <li> I am VERY picky and think this is absolutely great.  </li>
            <li> You crimp the underneath layers of your hair at the root and then cover with your top layer of hair.</li>
            <li> I was able to use my Amazon card pts to get this</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> You just need to remember to section off the top part of your hair so you can cover up all the crimped sections.  </li>
            <li> I love using this machine</li>
            <li> this is a god-send :)</li>
            <li> Also, you have to make sure you place the crimps everywhere</li>
            <li> Love the color</li>
            <li> Maybe could do more volume</li>
            <li> She loves hers too. :)</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it helps add 20% more.</li>
            <li> It also makes my ponies look cuter -- like Pinterest cute.</li>
            <li> /&gt;just make sure to do the partings the way it says to do them..</li>
            <li> Gives my hair way more body.</li>
            <li> All I have to do is crimp my roots, and my baby fine hair is so full of body!!  </li>
            <li> In doing my research, I thankfully came across the Infiniti micro crimper, and at such a good price ($20)!  </li>
            <li> I get compliments on the full lift I get from this iron!</li>
            <li> I found that it is most effective if you comb each section of hair straight up before crimping, and put in three rows of side-by-side crimps close to the scalp.</li>
            <li> It had excellent reviews and for the price I couldn&#x27;t go wrong, so I sprung for it; I&#x27;m so glad I did!!  </li>
            <li> This thing is pure magic!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and have tried every volumizing product out there</li>
            <li> The krimper is ultra fine and makes your hair look like pubes.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> (just mentioning in case you have fine hair and are wondering about it with your type).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This little tool is incredible!!</li>
            <li> This iron is perfect for giving a little lift on the underside of my hair.</li>
            <li> This crimper is great in giving your hair an extra boost of volume.</li>
            <li> then it is very useful.</li>
            <li> I have very fine straight hair</li>
            <li> It is very light weight and easy to use, it heats up fast and gets VERY hot.</li>
            <li> However, the Sam Villa, after various discounts still ran $110 and I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to spend that kind of money.  </li>
            <li> So far the best thing out there to give your hair lasting volume!</li>
            <li> Full head of hair.  </li>
            <li> and this helps give it that added boost to make my hair look full of body.</li>
            <li> The heat settings on the iron are really cool.  </li>
            <li> It would have cost loads to get one, and then I would&#x27;ve had to use some sort of converter/adapter with it, which I am always super sketchy about when it comes to heated hair styling tools.</li>
            <li> Searching this product on Amazon.com, I quickly ordered one to try at home.  </li>
            <li> Works great, low price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I have straight and fine Asian fair .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need that kind of daily volume, and I doubt if it&#x27;s healthy for your hair--but for a little extra for special days, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Follow how they tell ya, and its really that easy to get the volume.</li>
            <li> This styler is so easy to use and it really volumizes hair from your roots, as it promises to do.</li>
            <li> I finally fell in love with this!</li>
            <li> it really gives my hair allot of volume and I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> Great styling tool to add root volume, especially for short fine hair.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair turns out every time I use this, whenever I used to tease my hair it was really hit or miss if the volume wanted to be gorgeous on uneven -___-&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Make sure to avoid crimping hair near your face.  </li>
            <li> I probably crimp about 4 inches around my head under the crown section of my hair, making sure to avoid crimping the hair near my face.  </li>
            <li> Teasing doesn&#x27;t work cuz my strands are so smooth and slippery the tangles work themselves out in about an hour, and adding hairspray to the rats nests only buys me a couple more hours.</li>
            <li> This is far better than any shampoo or styling product I have tried to add volume.</li>
            <li> hair is so fine, silky (not the good kind) and flat that the crimp is gone in a few hours,</li>
            <li> My previously droopy hair looks much more bouncy now (not just on top-- all over) and I&#x27;m happy at long last.  : )</li>
            <li> Nice flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it and the price is right.</li>
            <li> You want to hide anything you use this on underneath normally styled hair, but it&#x27;s well worth it, because the volume is HUGE without teasing, without product, anything.</li>
            <li> Best thing I have spent my money on , in a long time.</li>
            <li> I want more body but either the crimps show or to be able to hide them, you have to start it halfway down your head</li>
            <li> I will even ad more crimps down the hairshaft to add more volumn.  </li>
            <li> This unit heats up instantly and is light weight and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> That would take forever to achieve, and I feel like would be suitable only costume parties and...editorial stuff</li>
            <li> and I have full hair that is much easier to manage.</li>
            <li> I slept on my full straight hair and it&#x27;s still voluptuous without doing anything to it.  </li>
            <li> (Being outside and a little humid)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve not figured out the best places to crimp</li>
            <li> You can pretty much make your hair as full and volumptuous as you can dream.  </li>
            <li> Not enough that I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li> , it is way too hot for anyone&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> Try styling first and then volumizing.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite beauty gurus reviewed a Sam Villa Textur Iron, which does something very similar to the Infiniti, in that they are both micro crimpers intended for the root to create fullness.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that could make it better is if it were cordless.</li>
            <li> I do use the spray \\&quot;Thicker Fuller Hair\\&quot; on the roots first.</li>
            <li> (Gets too hot being</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> It works EXACTLY like it says...</li>
            <li> I decided that with a lob, more volume was necessary</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time today</li>
            <li> I just tried it today for the first time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely is a mus have for anyone that wants easily added volume to their hair!</li>
            <li> You will be happy you got one if you have fine, thin hair and want volume!</li>
            <li> Great product, using for extra volume for the lazy days and free from teasing your hair.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s always flat on top.</li>
            <li> It heats up very fast and goes to pretty much any temp you could want.</li>
            <li> I also use it to give my hair texture when I&#x27;m trying to do an updo because my hair is so soft and fine that normally it just falls out!</li>
            <li> The item came very fast, but we thought that this crimper would crimp very well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and the results last until washing again.  </li>
            <li> I pretty much can&#x27;t live without it now!  </li>
            <li> It gives amazing lift to fine, thin hair like mine.</li>
            <li> I watched several different YouTube videos demonstrating how to use this wonderful little gadget, then put it to the test.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It really does work to boost the root area.  </li>
            <li> to do the whole head.</li>
            <li> It really help me boost up my hair.  </li>
            <li> I like this iron really well.  </li>
            <li> really bd idea....</li>
            <li> because you want it straight</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this with the straight look as well as curly look.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this for a while but didn&#x27;t want to spend too much on something that I might not like.  </li>
            <li> She said she wants to purchase it too.  </li>
            <li> I really like this thing.  </li>
            <li> It heats up fast and if you follow the directions you get a lot of volume.  </li>
            <li> For this styler to work, you really have to style your hair and leave it that way.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s also such a smooth texture that it doesn&#x27;t hold when I tease</li>
            <li> I have straight hair, shoulder length.  </li>
            <li> I think it would be easy to burn your hair if you left it on for more than a few seconds at the higher settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is one of the coolest things for fine flat hair.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair; however, it is baby fine, which makes it lay flat to my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have flat fine hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not having ever used the actual Babyliss one from the UK, I can&#x27;t be sure it&#x27;s the exact same one in a US version, but it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> if the other crimper iron works better.  </li>
            <li> and my hair handles really high heat really well).</li>
            <li> I use it on the second to lowest heat setting, and after you get used to using it, after you figure out how to strategize its use over a full head of hair, it works beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> old women who has had to deal with stick straight hair all her life!</li>
            <li> Depending on how many horizontal layers I do, I can amp up or down the volume.  </li>
            <li> This, in conjunction with dry shampoo, helps keep my hair voluminous and avoid the need to shampoo excessively (Shampoo-I still shower my body daily :D )</li>
            <li> Sure it kinda does make the crimped part slightly resemble pubes</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s mainly my hair and not the iron</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, with different temperature options.</li>
            <li> I have always had flat, limp hair and use a fair amount of product to give it lift and hold.  </li>
            <li> This may work well for people with thin hair, but I didn&#x27;t get any more volume using this than I do when using a root volumizer before blow drying (I use Big Sexy Hair&#x27;s Root Pump Plus Mousse).  </li>
            <li> that normal people have nothing to do with.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works for other hair types, but for those with fine hair like mine, it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> My hair is super long</li>
            <li> on barrel, directions were wrinkled and plug did not look new.  </li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t live without it, have to bring it with me travel oversea.  </li>
            <li> When my new hair stylist used this on me in a salon, I was intrigued.  </li>
            <li> So enter my new friend, Crimpy, to the rescue.  </li>
            <li> Does grip the short hair really well, but don&#x27;t see as much shine after usage.</li>
            <li> I love this little thing!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and is the same as it describe.</li>
            <li> But it heats up very fast and is very hot, so just use it a few seconds on each divided strand.  </li>
            <li> Oh it&#x27;s way better than ratting or teasing because it&#x27;s not snarling or damaging the hair as much and gives me a natural uniform volume that&#x27;s hard to achieve with teasing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use and takes little time to get hot, it has numerous heat settings as well!</li>
            <li> Let the hair cool completely, bend over so that your head is upside down, and gently brush to separate the crimps.</li>
            <li> It only takes a couple of quick minutes, and it totally works!  </li>
            <li> It takes about 10 minutes to do my roots and smooth out my ends with a flat iron and I have long hair.</li>
            <li> and  I made a little drawstrinng that I can put it in and Ican easily fit it in an emergency bag ( a change of clothes) that I keep in my car.</li>
            <li> The iron is a little warm, so you want to be careful not to burn yourself.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t take much to just crimp an extra section making the crimped part of the hair wider then cover with the noon crimped hair.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be surprised at what you can create....</li>
            <li> I have no trouble hiding it anyways.  </li>
            <li> This product really surprised me.</li>
            <li> But the picture does not display the plates completely.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not quite as big of a deal if a piece peaks through than it would be if I had straight hair or lighter</li>
            <li> Volume like I used to have naturally.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s perfect for what I use it for: adding volume at the base of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Easy to get close to roots since it&#x27;s small.</li>
            <li> Anyways, since my hair is so heavy, the top of my hair always looks really flat.  </li>
            <li> Really recommend for any one who need to boost up their flat hair.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is past my shoulder blades</li>
            <li> The 2nd degree choice on the iron, is hot enough with out burning my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Wow!</li>
            <li> It only burned horrid miniature, Borrowers-sized crimps into my hair (actually burned, got way too hot</li>
            <li> I was a little bummed that it didn&#x27;t work on my growing-out platinum pixie, but I didn&#x27;t really expect to be able to hide the little crimps.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and only takes a few minutes to add into my routine each morning.</li>
            <li> Need to take a long time to finish whole root boost.</li>
            <li> You really have to hold the crimper in your hair for a long time to make any type of crimp.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair, and have tried everything for volume..</li>
            <li> I have long, straight blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> I use the regular curling iron also, after crimping, to direct my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far because I just got it.  </li>
            <li> I have super thick, heavy, straight Asian hair that rests right above my butt, and teasing my hair is a pain in the butt!  </li>
            <li> I have fine flat long brown hair that I can&#x27;t usually wear straight because it sticks flat to myhead  </li>
            <li> Gives extra body at the roots to my fine flat hair and only takes a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Volumizing mousse and other root sprays never did much for my hair</li>
            <li> The only semi-complaint is that the heat settings seem unusually HOT, but that is likely due to that the iron is meant to butt up against the scalp.  </li>
            <li> It seems that if you use this right after it&#x27;s washed it should last until the next shampoo because it really adds a serious crimp.  </li>
            <li> This little gadget gives me way more volume that won&#x27;t fall flat even when I decide to tie my hair up half way through the night</li>
            <li> I have medium thick hair that is somewhat coarse, and this really didn&#x27;t make that much of a difference for me.  </li>
            <li> You just have to be careful where you place the crimps, because you don&#x27;t want them to show through, but that&#x27;s not hard to do.</li>
            <li> but my super hard too curl</li>
            <li> Since my hair is super thick</li>
            <li> Maybe they have super thick strands</li>
            <li> I have thick but very fine hair that likes to go limp.</li>
            <li> I did, however, try it on my sister last night and it was AMAZING for her long, thin hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not great at doing my own hair, and I&#x27;ve always had a hard time getting volume (especially during the humid summers where I live).  </li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair</li>
            <li> Saddest part is that I apparently can&#x27;t read because I thought I was buying a narrow hair straightener and was super bummed when this mess arrived.</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount of practice, so if your good with a curling iron or any other styling tools, you&#x27;ll be a pro at this..EASY!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend for anyone with straight, limp, hair looking for that VAVAVOOM look without teasing!</li>
            <li> Finally a simple solution to flat hair!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with flat, lifeless hair.</li>
            <li> I have no longer flat hair.  </li>
            <li> with straightening hair you can use this and not have to worry about your hair being flat on top&lt;br /&gt;just</li>
            <li> My hair will lay flat on my head</li>
            <li> It looked like the model in that video had pretty thick hair from what I could see so that might be the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was quick and easy to use and made her hair look at least twice as thick as usual!</li>
            <li> I make three rows of crimps on both sides and in back, and my hair stays &amp;#34;poufy&amp;#34; all day long!</li>
            <li> I have really thick, straight Asian hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long with the shaft being medium in terms of courseness.  </li>
            <li> I have spent years investing in various salon quality hairsprays and teasing combs to achieve the desired fullness, but to no avail.  </li>
            <li> that is about an 1/2 long on the side of my head.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to burn your scalp or leave it on longer than a second or two.  </li>
            <li> I use the Root Booster micro-crimper at the base of my hair (avoiding the top layer which will cover the mini crimps), and curl the rest of the hair like normal.</li>
            <li> It certainly creates a tight little crimp in the roots of my hair...but whether or not it helps with adding volume?</li>
            <li> and I barely clamped the thing down</li>
            <li> My hair stays volumized until my next wash (wash my hair every other day).</li>
            <li> Other than that it does help with adding volume but not enough to risk losing my hair over again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen tons of youtube videos and reviews on the Babyliss Root Boost tool, but Babyliss, at least as far as I know, is a UK only company.</li>
            <li> Hair can get a bit bumpy if you crimp too high up or too thick a piece.</li>
            <li> It gives me that extra little lift so that I don&#x27;t have flat hair.</li>
            <li> I only wish I would have purchase a 1 inch style rather than the half inch.  </li>
            <li> I also used it on my sister, who actually has a lot LESS hair than me for some reason and she LOVES it.  </li>
            <li> It comes with limited directions on the box, and no real styling or use tips.</li>
            <li> I would definitely reccomend this to anyone with flat, limp hair like mine!</li>
            <li> You might find the crimping difficult to hide if you have super thin hair, but mine&#x27;s pretty average thickness</li>
            <li> I suppose using it over the next few days/weeks will help me become a pro at this (maybe).  </li>
            <li> Be careful though where you set the crimps; the crimper works so well</li>
            <li> I use it every single day!!</li>
            <li> and after a few hours my hair ends up flat again</li>
            <li> Definitely for those with long thick hair or wanting volume.</li>
            <li> After my shower, I use a little volumizing mousse once it is almost dry, then I blow dry my hair upside down.</li>
            <li> Evidently I ordered the wrong item.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend to other girls who likes they hair being volumized</li>
            <li> You can control the temperature and don&#x27;t hold it on your hair too long, takes very little time.</li>
            <li> Plus, I hate to add more heat if I&#x27;m already blow drying.</li>
            <li> thin slices just below your natural part</li>
            <li> Also, I realized that I fiddle with and change my hair a lot -- putting it up, taking it down.  </li>
            <li> Lower down</li>
            <li> is my sad little tale and why I like it so much . . .  </li>
            <li> little bit of caution though: this is a MICRO crimper.</li>
            <li> I wish it were a little wider</li>
            <li> After you turn on the power button the temp settings are displayed in a little screen.  </li>
            <li> I like a little lift</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t use it everyday--</li>
            <li> I am buying a few for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions though, and after a few practice runs I got the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> There are a few YouTube videos I watched before I ordered it that show how to use it and before/after photos.</li>
            <li> I have hopelessly limp hair.</li>
            <li> think it just takes practice from using it a few times.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s quite heavy</li>
            <li> My hair is so thick that when I get split ends, they split into the thickness of the average person&#x27;s hair...</li>
            <li> This little lift iron rocks!</li>
            <li> , this Root Boost tool has exceeded my expecatations, I usually apply a little hair spray on my roots before using it and it lasts for days!</li>
            <li> There was a small glob of sticky&lt;br /&gt;substance</li>
            <li> The crimps are really small, but my hair didn&#x27;t look like pubes.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it is small</li>
            <li> I hate backcombing my hair, but this creates volume in half the time and is much easier on my hair.</li>
            <li> It is small and slow heat.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of this product, I&#x27;d seen a few how-to videos on youtube and before / after pictures and wanted to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> bought it for my wife and she havent complained.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice until it was too late.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers complained that the crimper didn&#x27;t didn&#x27;t crimp well.</li>
            <li> At least, that&#x27;s how it was for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin, limp hair with no body.</li>
            <li> and I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy/loose curly hair</li>
            <li> I purchased this mini crimper in a desperate attempt to help my flat hair.</li>
            <li> This seriously adds a LOT of volume to your hair.  </li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t as dramatic as my results so not sure</li>
            <li> I threw it in the trash because I wouldn&#x27;t bother anyone else with such a stupid concept as this crimper thing.</li>
            <li> I bought this crimper because I am tired of teasing my hair to try and get volume at the roots.</li>
            <li> Beware if you have thin hair, after continued use my hair started to break off.</li>
            <li> (Not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with that).</li>
            <li> they need to go because you don&#x27;t want any weird sunken spots.</li>
            <li> This would STRICTLY be for root boosting, unless your aim actually IS crazy frizzy chunks in you hair.</li>
            <li> The crimps show through and look so, so bad.</li>
            <li> it crimps your haair reallly ugly underneath to give vlolume, but wht</li>
            <li> if you epose the ugly crimps?  </li>
            <li> I am really disappointed in the Infiniti by Conair</li>
            <li> What the crap is this thing supposed to accomplish??</li>
            <li> but I hate that.  </li>

            <li> The crimps show through and look so, so bad. I want more body but either the crimps show or to be able to hide them, you have to start it halfway down your head (I want body at the top of my head, not by my ears). Maybe it works for other hair types, but for those with fine hair like mine, it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It gives my hair volume throughout the day. Would definitely recommend that you do not ever use the highest setting though, it is way too hot for anyone&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> This may work well for people with thin hair, but I didn&#x27;t get any more volume using this than I do when using a root volumizer before blow drying (I use Big Sexy Hair&#x27;s Root Pump Plus Mousse).  I have medium thick hair that is somewhat coarse, and this really didn&#x27;t make that much of a difference for me.  Plus, I hate to add more heat if I&#x27;m already blow drying.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Helps give me lift!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen tons of youtube videos and reviews on the Babyliss Root Boost tool, but Babyliss, at least as far as I know, is a UK only company. It would have cost loads to get one, and then I would&#x27;ve had to use some sort of converter/adapter with it, which I am always super sketchy about when it comes to heated hair styling tools. So periodically, I&#x27;d google around and search to see if there was any way to get it in the US, and after quite a bit of fruitless searching, I happened upon this here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not having ever used the actual Babyliss one from the UK, I can&#x27;t be sure it&#x27;s the exact same one in a US version, but it works like a charm. No issues whatsoever. I use it on the second to lowest heat setting, and after you get used to using it, after you figure out how to strategize its use over a full head of hair, it works beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people seem to be looking for crimpers for just stylistic crimping, and this is NOT that tool. This would STRICTLY be for root boosting, unless your aim actually IS crazy frizzy chunks in you hair. That would take forever to achieve, and I feel like would be suitable only costume parties and...editorial stuff that normal people have nothing to do with. You want to hide anything you use this on underneath normally styled hair, but it&#x27;s well worth it, because the volume is HUGE without teasing, without product, anything. It&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t use it everyday--I don&#x27;t need that kind of daily volume, and I doubt if it&#x27;s healthy for your hair--but for a little extra for special days, it&#x27;s perfect. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with flat, lifeless hair. You might find the crimping difficult to hide if you have super thin hair, but mine&#x27;s pretty average thickness and I don&#x27;t have a problem. I love this thing.</li>
            <li> It is the best invention ever! I absolutely love it! I have fine hair and have tried every volumizing product out there and after a few hours my hair ends up flat again, this Root Boost tool has exceeded my expecatations, I usually apply a little hair spray on my roots before using it and it lasts for days! My hair stays volumized until my next wash (wash my hair every other day). I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very good product, awesome price! and speedy delivery! Definitely is a mus have for anyone that wants easily added volume to their hair!</li>
            <li> Came at appointed time. it Worked great! Would definately recommend it to a friend. Works as specified on the box.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what it says. Hair can get a bit bumpy if you crimp too high up or too thick a piece. Try styling first and then volumizing. For some reason, my hair lays better if I do it this way.</li>
            <li> I was a little bummed that it didn&#x27;t work on my growing-out platinum pixie, but I didn&#x27;t really expect to be able to hide the little crimps. With  how platinum and short my hair is, it didn&#x27;t stand a chance. I did, however, try it on my sister last night and it was AMAZING for her long, thin hair! It was quick and easy to use and made her hair look at least twice as thick as usual! Definitely recommend for anyone with straight, limp, hair looking for that VAVAVOOM look without teasing!</li>
            <li> bought it for my wife and she havent complained. looks like it is winner.</li>
            <li> I found out about this gem through YouTube.  All I have to do is crimp my roots, and my baby fine hair is so full of body!!  What a wonderful product!  :-)</li>
            <li> This little tool is incredible!! I have very fine, thin hair, and have tried everything for volume.. This thing is pure magic! I hate backcombing my hair, but this creates volume in half the time and is much easier on my hair. Just remember to spray a bit of hairspray onto the section of hair, use the root booster, and you&#x27;re instantly volumized! Great product!!</li>
            <li> It really does work to boost the root area.  I crimp underneath the surface hair and it builds more volume.  Don&#x27;t crimp the top layer so the crimps don&#x27;t show.</li>
            <li> My hair is long with the shaft being medium in terms of courseness.  I don&#x27;t opt for Dolly Parton hair, but I&#x27;m of the opinion fullness at the root looks sexy and youthful.  I have spent years investing in various salon quality hairsprays and teasing combs to achieve the desired fullness, but to no avail.  No matter what products or technique I would use when teasing, the tease would only last for a couple hours.  One of my favorite beauty gurus reviewed a Sam Villa Textur Iron, which does something very similar to the Infiniti, in that they are both micro crimpers intended for the root to create fullness.  However, the Sam Villa, after various discounts still ran $110 and I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to spend that kind of money.  In doing my research, I thankfully came across the Infiniti micro crimper, and at such a good price ($20)!  It had excellent reviews and for the price I couldn&#x27;t go wrong, so I sprung for it; I&#x27;m so glad I did!!  I LOVE it!  The crimp holds all day and even somewhat into the next day.  Depending on how many horizontal layers I do, I can amp up or down the volume.  The only semi-complaint is that the heat settings seem unusually HOT, but that is likely due to that the iron is meant to butt up against the scalp.  I must be a wimp because I cannot handle anything above the lowest heat setting.  But even on the lowest heat setting, the iron effectively crimps the hair in five seconds.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a quick, easy way to create great volume. I have thin, limp hair with no body. I only have to hold this for a second at the roots and I have full hair that is much easier to manage. The only thing that could make it better is if it were cordless.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know if I wanted to spend the money to \\&quot;just try it\\&quot;. Glad I did. Did all my hair. Took some 15 min. to do the whole head. But it heats up very fast and is very hot, so just use it a few seconds on each divided strand.  The 2nd degree choice on the iron, is hot enough with out burning my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Wow! Full head of hair.  Will last till the next washing. I do use the spray \\&quot;Thicker Fuller Hair\\&quot; on the roots first. Wait till it dries a bit. (Gets too hot being it&#x27;s next to your scalp)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will always use this iron from now on.  I use the regular curling iron also, after crimping, to direct my hair.  I would recommend it.  I am buying a few for Christmas gifts. Will see what they think.</li>
            <li> This product worked as described but&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t quite do what I had hoped.  Also,&lt;br /&gt;it seemed like this product had been used&lt;br /&gt;before.  There was a small glob of sticky&lt;br /&gt;substance on barrel, directions were wrinkled and plug did not look new.  Would not buy from seller , Price 2 Save, again.</li>
            <li> I love this Conair Root Boost.  It really help me boost up my hair.  I have no longer flat hair.  Really recommend for any one who need to boost up their flat hair.  Now I can&#x27;t live without it, have to bring it with me travel oversea.  I wish it had dual voltage that I can use in different countries.</li>
            <li> If you use this correctly it is a great product.  It gives your hair the perfect amount of added volume. I have fine hair that is past my shoulder blades and this helps give it that added boost to make my hair look full of body. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Read the directions.  It works as stated.  Gives extra body at the roots to my fine flat hair and only takes a few minutes.  Pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of this product, I&#x27;d seen a few how-to videos on youtube and before / after pictures and wanted to give it a shot.  I&#x27;m not great at doing my own hair, and I&#x27;ve always had a hard time getting volume (especially during the humid summers where I live).  But this actually did work!  There is a knack to it, you have to crimp as close to the root as possible, and get the hang of crimping specific pieces that won&#x27;t show throughout the day.  I followed the directions though, and after a few practice runs I got the hang of it.  I would definitely reccomend this to anyone with flat, limp hair like mine!</li>
            <li> It only takes a couple of quick minutes, and it totally works!  I can even wake up the next day (sometimes even the day after that - I have a newborn so it happens!) and my hair still looks volumized!  I guess the only drawback would be the extra heat on my hair and any damage that may cause.  So far the best thing out there to give your hair lasting volume!</li>
            <li> The concept works and it&#x27;s a nice adjustable iron that leaves a good crimp but my super hard too curl hair is so fine, silky (not the good kind) and flat that the crimp is gone in a few hours, so it&#x27;s mainly my hair and not the iron</li>
            <li> I bought this crimper because I am tired of teasing my hair to try and get volume at the roots. It is incredibly easy to use! I tried this on the lowest heat setting and I have really thick hair and it handled it beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One little bit of caution though: this is a MICRO crimper. If you get carried away with it, you will get a very African hair look. (Not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with that).</li>
            <li> I like this iron really well.  I only wish I would have purchase a 1 inch style rather than the half inch.  It was inexpensive and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> it crimps your haair reallly ugly underneath to give vlolume, but wht if you epose the ugly crimps?  really bd idea....</li>
            <li> with straightening hair you can use this and not have to worry about your hair being flat on top&lt;br /&gt;just because you want it straight</li>
            <li> This works great and it&#x27;s perfect for what I use it for: adding volume at the base of my hair.  Make sure you don&#x27;t use it at your part so you don&#x27;t see the crimps.  I am VERY picky and think this is absolutely great.  You can control the temperature and don&#x27;t hold it on your hair too long, takes very little time.</li>
            <li> This is one of the coolest things for fine flat hair.  I have fine flat long brown hair that I can&#x27;t usually wear straight because it sticks flat to myhead  I&#x27;ve used this with the straight look as well as curly look.  You can pretty much make your hair as full and volumptuous as you can dream.  I wish it were a little wider but it doesn&#x27;t take much to just crimp an extra section making the crimped part of the hair wider then cover with the noon crimped hair.  I slept on my full straight hair and it&#x27;s still voluptuous without doing anything to it.  I pretty much can&#x27;t live without it now!  Oh it&#x27;s way better than ratting or teasing because it&#x27;s not snarling or damaging the hair as much and gives me a natural uniform volume that&#x27;s hard to achieve with teasing.</li>
            <li> Evidently I ordered the wrong item.  Not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have tried every type of root boast but with no noticable results. This product works great. You crimp the underneath layers of your hair at the root and then cover with your top layer of hair. It creates volume!!! This is wonderful and actually is a very quick process. Love it!</li>
            <li> When my new hair stylist used this on me in a salon, I was intrigued.  I have always had flat, limp hair and use a fair amount of product to give it lift and hold.  Searching this product on Amazon.com, I quickly ordered one to try at home.  It&#x27;s easy to use and the results last until washing again.  I have recommended it to everyone I know with the same hair issues.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Nice flat iron.  Does grip the short hair really well, but don&#x27;t see as much shine after usage.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says. It takes about 10 minutes to do my roots and smooth out my ends with a flat iron and I have long hair.</li>
            <li> Follow how they tell ya, and its really that easy to get the volume. You&#x27;ll be surprised at what you can create....crimp a couple chunks on the outside of your hair and you&#x27;ll look like you have feathers in your hair!</li>
            <li> I love this!  I have super thick, heavy, straight Asian hair that rests right above my butt, and teasing my hair is a pain in the butt!  Not to mention all the damage it causes to create what my boyf calls &amp;#34;the birds nest&amp;#34; on my head lol!  This little gadget gives me way more volume that won&#x27;t fall flat even when I decide to tie my hair up half way through the night lol. Sure it kinda does make the crimped part slightly resemble pubes but I think a bunch of tangles are much more unsightly!  Since my hair is super thick I have no trouble hiding it anyways.  I love the way my hair turns out every time I use this, whenever I used to tease my hair it was really hit or miss if the volume wanted to be gorgeous on uneven -___-&amp;#34;. I never have that problem now!  Also I really only have to give each section about 5 seconds of heat and tresemme thermal mousse for it to crimp all day.  This tool is amazing, a great buy!</li>
            <li> This styler is so easy to use and it really volumizes hair from your roots, as it promises to do. I have used it every day since I received it. Finally a simple solution to flat hair!!!</li>
            <li> Great styling tool to add root volume, especially for short fine hair. Easy to get close to roots since it&#x27;s small. Heats up quickly, with different temperature options. Also nice that cord is longer than most store bought tools. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Beware if you have thin hair, after continued use my hair started to break off. I didn&#x27;t notice until it was too late. I have a section of hair now that is about an 1/2 long on the side of my head. Other than that it does help with adding volume but not enough to risk losing my hair over again. I did use several different heat settings but never the highest.</li>
            <li> I found it accidentally when I was searching for root lifter mouse&#x27;s and gels one night. I had never heard of anything like it before. Actually the one I found online, another brand, was $100+ dollars so I goggled around and found this one for $25. It works EXACTLY like it says...gives lots of lift and the lift stays until the next time you wash. It is easy to use and only takes a few minutes to add into my routine each morning. There are a few YouTube videos I watched before I ordered it that show how to use it and before/after photos. When I have time I will add some photos here. It is very light weight and easy to use, it heats up fast and gets VERY hot. SO HAPPY I FOUND this.</li>
            <li> I have very fine straight hair and this adds an incredible boost to the roots, and that is exactly where it is needed.  The iron is a little warm, so you want to be careful not to burn yourself.  Can&#x27;t imagine having to go without this wonderful styler wand.</li>
            <li> What an awesome tool, truly adds incredible volume at the roots of my usually fine limp hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this for a while but didn&#x27;t want to spend too much on something that I might not like.  Let me tell you about my hair... I have really thick, straight Asian hair.  My hair is so thick that when I get split ends, they split into the thickness of the average person&#x27;s hair... Anyways, since my hair is so heavy, the top of my hair always looks really flat.  I don&#x27;t want to tease it so that is why I wanted to buy something like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently cut my waist length hair to a lob.  I decided that with a lob, more volume was necessary so I took the plunge.  I was able to use my Amazon card pts to get this and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  This seriously adds a LOT of volume to your hair.  You just need to remember to section off the top part of your hair so you can cover up all the crimped sections.  Make sure to avoid crimping hair near your face.  I probably crimp about 4 inches around my head under the crown section of my hair, making sure to avoid crimping the hair near my face.  I also used it on my sister, who actually has a lot LESS hair than me for some reason and she LOVES it.  She said she wants to purchase it too.  This, in conjunction with dry shampoo, helps keep my hair voluminous and avoid the need to shampoo excessively (Shampoo-I still shower my body daily :D )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this to anyone looking to add volume to their hair without teasing!</li>
            <li> I love using this machine it really gives my hair allot of volume and I have fine hair. I would recommend this to a friend. This is the best hair appliance I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and is the same as it describe.</li>
            <li> I love it! It&#x27;s amazing for making fine hair feel thicker, and great for braiding &amp; up-dos! It also has a choice of temperature settings, the hottest is over 400°.</li>
            <li> I am a 52 yr. old women who has had to deal with stick straight hair all her life! Where has this product been all those years! I make three rows of crimps on both sides and in back, and my hair stays &amp;#34;poufy&amp;#34; all day long! It even lasts a second day, then totally washes out with shampoo if I want to pull my hair up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Conair- this is a god-send :)</li>
            <li> I have hopelessly limp hair. I can&#x27;t do anything to volumize it. Or so I thought. Teasing doesn&#x27;t work cuz my strands are so smooth and slippery the tangles work themselves out in about an hour, and adding hairspray to the rats nests only buys me a couple more hours. Volumizing mousse and other root sprays never did much for my hair either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is rad! I used it for the first time today and I got volume that lasts! I suppose using it over the next few days/weeks will help me become a pro at this (maybe).  You just have to be careful where you place the crimps, because you don&#x27;t want them to show through, but that&#x27;s not hard to do. Also, you have to make sure you place the crimps everywhere they need to go because you don&#x27;t want any weird sunken spots. Its kind of like teasing, but easier, and longer-lasting. Some reviewers complained that the crimper didn&#x27;t didn&#x27;t crimp well. Maybe they have super thick strands (if they do, why do they need this thing?) but this has 5 heat settings, and I had no problem getting the crimp to hold. Someone also said it makes your hair look like pubes, LOL! The crimps are really small, but my hair didn&#x27;t look like pubes. I chose this crimper over others because of the ceramic plates, the floating plate technology, and the good price. I&#x27;m happy with my decision.</li>
            <li> I really like this thing.  It heats up fast and if you follow the directions you get a lot of volume.  Just be careful not to burn your scalp or leave it on longer than a second or two.  It will burn your hair.  The tiny crimps also make the any teasing you may care to do last longer.  I will say, you don&#x27;t even need to tease your hair after using because the volume it gives in incredible.  I have thick but very fine hair that likes to go limp.</li>
            <li> I love this! I use it every single day!! It gives me that extra little lift so that I don&#x27;t have flat hair.</li>
            <li> What can you say about an item like this. Works great, does the job it&#x27;s suppose to. Love the color</li>
            <li> Works great, low price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> does what I want it to do.  Maybe could do more volume but I like it</li>
            <li> I have straight and fine Asian fair . This tool doesn&#x27;t work well on my hair . Even though I use the highest heat setting, it still cannot &amp;#34;z&amp;#34; my hair root  in short time.  It is small and slow heat. Need to take a long time to finish whole root boost. Will not recommend .</li>
            <li> Immediately returned. The krimper is ultra fine and makes your hair look like pubes. I would not recommend purchasing this product unless you&#x27;re going for that frizzy look that gives you volume.</li>
            <li> Got it for my girlfriend and she loves it. It heats up very fast and goes to pretty much any temp you could want.</li>
            <li> Like it a lot. Would be better if the cord swiveled, but great otherwise.</li>
            <li> This unit heats up instantly and is light weight and easy to use.  I recommend it and the price is right.</li>
            <li> I love this little thing! I have a lot of hair but it&#x27;s very fine and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of body. This iron is perfect for giving a little lift on the underside of my hair. I also use it to give my hair texture when I&#x27;m trying to do an updo because my hair is so soft and fine that normally it just falls out! I love, love, love this thing! I even ended up coming back and getting one for my mom. She loves hers too. :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this mini crimper in a desperate attempt to help my flat hair. This is far better than any shampoo or styling product I have tried to add volume.</li>
            <li> I have long, straight blonde hair.  Thought I&#x27;d give this a try to give my roots a bit of a lift.  No matter what I did, you could still sometimes see the crimped wave pattern when my hair would move around throughout the day.  Also, I realized that I fiddle with and change my hair a lot -- putting it up, taking it down.  For this styler to work, you really have to style your hair and leave it that way.  Once you pull it back or put it up, you can start the see the crimps.  At least, that&#x27;s how it was for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair; however, it is baby fine, which makes it lay flat to my scalp. When I stumbled across this crimper, I immediately knew that I had to have it. I watched several different YouTube videos demonstrating how to use this wonderful little gadget, then put it to the test. You want to start the crimps about an inch from both your part and your hairline. I found that it is most effective if you comb each section of hair straight up before crimping, and put in three rows of side-by-side crimps close to the scalp. Let the hair cool completely, bend over so that your head is upside down, and gently brush to separate the crimps. Voila! Amazing volume that lasts for days without the wear and tear of teasing or backcombing.</li>
            <li> This product really surprised me. It multiple heat settings and works well to give a lift to my roots. I very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a crimper. But the picture does not display the plates completely.  Definitely for those with long thick hair or wanting volume.</li>
            <li> This little lift iron rocks! I love it&#x27;s easy to use and takes little time to get hot, it has numerous heat settings as well! I get compliments on the full lift I get from this iron!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It gives amazing lift to fine, thin hair like mine. I have ALWAYS struggled with ways to add volume. I finally fell in love with this! After my shower, I use a little volumizing mousse once it is almost dry, then I blow dry my hair upside down. I use the Root Booster micro-crimper at the base of my hair (avoiding the top layer which will cover the mini crimps), and curl the rest of the hair like normal. I have receieved several comments on what I did to my hair to make it look to big now! You will be happy you got one if you have fine, thin hair and want volume!</li>
            <li> I just tried it today for the first time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my sad little tale and why I like it so much . . .  I had a haircut this week and wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the way she cut it because I like more lift on top.  So enter my new friend, Crimpy, to the rescue.  My previously droopy hair looks much more bouncy now (not just on top-- all over) and I&#x27;m happy at long last.  : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  The heat settings on the iron are really cool.  After you turn on the power button the temp settings are displayed in a little screen.  There are about 5 pre-set temps you can choose from.  And it heats up fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I think it would be easy to burn your hair if you left it on for more than a few seconds at the higher settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I have fine hair but there is a lot of it (just mentioning in case you have fine hair and are wondering about it with your type).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* There was a video on you tube that used a similar product and it wasn&#x27;t as dramatic as my results so not sure if the other crimper iron works better.  But I&#x27;m very happy with this one.  It looked like the model in that video had pretty thick hair from what I could see so that might be the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  It seems that if you use this right after it&#x27;s washed it should last until the next shampoo because it really adds a serious crimp.  I can&#x27;t get it out even with going over with a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it is small and  I made a little drawstrinng that I can put it in and Ican easily fit it in an emergency bag ( a change of clothes) that I keep in my car.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair and I have used almost every product known to man in an attempt to get volume. After coming across a YouTube video on a similar crimper, I took the plunge. Glad I did! It adds great lift to my hair without using all of the products. Bye Bye teasing!</li>
            <li> This is amazing.  I have thick wavy/loose curly hair but it&#x27;s always flat on top. I don&#x27;t use hairspray and refuse to tease it.&lt;br /&gt;I discovered this and am very glad I did. The crimps are even tinier than I imagined after reading the reviews. I&#x27;ve only used it once so far because I just got it.  It kept the roots I crimped lifted all day. (Being outside and a little humid)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve not figured out the best places to crimp so they don&#x27;t show through however with my hair texture and color, it&#x27;s not quite as big of a deal if a piece peaks through than it would be if I had straight hair or lighter hair.&lt;br /&gt;I think it just takes practice from using it a few times. But it definitely does what it says. And the price was great!</li>
            <li> It certainly creates a tight little crimp in the roots of my hair...but whether or not it helps with adding volume? I&#x27;d say it helps add 20% more. Not enough that I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great price. Does just what I need.</li>
            <li> The item came very fast, but we thought that this crimper would crimp very well.  You really have to hold the crimper in your hair for a long time to make any type of crimp.</li>
            <li> This crimper is great in giving your hair an extra boost of volume. Very easy to use and the results are amazing. Be careful though where you set the crimps; the crimper works so well the crimps last sometimes even after you wash your hair, so if you make any visible you will need to hide them for days!</li>
            <li> Was not what I thought it would be.  I returned it.</li>
            <li> What the crap is this thing supposed to accomplish?? It only burned horrid miniature, Borrowers-sized crimps into my hair (actually burned, got way too hot and I barely clamped the thing down and my hair handles really high heat really well). Did not improve the volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrible concept. Saddest part is that I apparently can&#x27;t read because I thought I was buying a narrow hair straightener and was super bummed when this mess arrived. I threw it in the trash because I wouldn&#x27;t bother anyone else with such a stupid concept as this crimper thing.</li>
            <li> It works well after I watched several videos on Youtube. It needs some skills then it is very useful.</li>
            <li> Very good, my wife love it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know these existed until I saw a blog on a $180 root volumizer crimper. Um, no thank you! So I bought this and haven&#x27;t gone a [hair wash] day without it. My hair is super long so it&#x27;s quite heavy, it&#x27;s also such a smooth texture that it doesn&#x27;t hold when I tease/rat it. This volumizes my roots through crimping alone, but if I want even more volume it makes my hair hold the tease all day! It makes it a &amp;#34;rougher&amp;#34; texture but in a good way. It also makes my ponies look cuter -- like Pinterest cute. So basically if your hair doesn&#x27;t hold volume this is the tool you need!</li>
            <li> I have straight hair, shoulder length.  My hair will lay flat on my head but I hate that.  I like a little lift and this does wonders and lasts into the next day, so you don&#x27;t even need to do it again unless you shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;just make sure to do the partings the way it says to do them..thin slices just below your natural part..It is a very fine crimp. Lower down I will even ad more crimps down the hairshaft to add more volumn.  It only takes a small amount of practice, so if your good with a curling iron or any other styling tools, you&#x27;ll be a pro at this..EASY!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed in the Infiniti by Conair YOU Root Boost 1/2 inch Styler. The pictures make it look like you will get a LOT of volume, but the volume I got was unnoticeable. It comes with limited directions on the box, and no real styling or use tips. If I wanted a crimped hair style, it would be great, but as a volumizer, it&#x27;s lacking. I wish I hadn&#x27;t bothered with it and may return.</li>
            <li> Does its job! Gives my hair way more body. I have flat fine hair. Makes my hair look like I have fullness and thicker hair! Great buy!</li>
            <li> Great product, using for extra volume for the lazy days and free from teasing your hair. Would recommend to other girls who likes they hair being volumized</li>
            <li> Best thing I have spent my money on , in a long time. Volume like I used to have naturally. Amazing</li>
