            <li>Great soap bags!  </li>
            <li>This was a very good product that I used during a two week jungle trip.</li>
            <li>The idea is great.</li>
            <li>they wash up great and save all my slippery soap slivers so i am no longer throwing away any soap.</li>
            <li>Makes for a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It took me a while to find another one that I really liked, but this one is excellent.</li>
            <li>It might be good if I wanted a washcloth type soap bag.</li>
            <li>You can tell it is made really good.</li>
            <li>I like this a lot its got a good grip for the soap</li>
            <li>I think it does a really good job of exfoliating as well.</li>
            <li>This is a product I bought while on vacation and wanted to share with family since I love the practicality of the product!</li>
            <li>but my daughter wanted the kind with a side that scrubs and this one doesn&#x27;t offer that.</li>
            <li>My large bars of soap fit perfectly!  </li>
            <li>the reverse is more like a washcloth</li>
            <li>Love This bag.  </li>
            <li>Love this soap bag.</li>
            <li>we all love them.</li>
            <li>Love these soap bags.</li>
            <li>So glad I selected this type, instead of one made of sisal.  </li>
            <li>I just used mine for the first time and am buying more!</li>
            <li>Was hoping for an earth friendly replacement for the nylon mesh bags, but they work much better</li>
            <li>This is hands down, the best soap bag I have ever used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Dries out just fine, just hang it up in the shower.</li>
            <li>This soap bag is made really well and allows a nice lather.</li>
            <li>They created a good lather and are made with natural material versus your plastic pouf</li>
            <li>Then I discovered the nylon bags that work so much better at a much much MUCH cheaper price.</li>
            <li>Its soft not scratchy and is made of a great natural material to exfoliate with!</li>
            <li>This product may be good for storing a bar of soap (and allowing it to dry out)</li>
            <li>However, these bags hold the soap until they are totally done and you get a nice skin scrub with the texture of the bag with each shower.</li>
            <li>I liked it and bought a second one.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace a net soap holder, thinking it would be better because it&#x27;s made of cotton.</li>
            <li>fabric is nice and soft but has enough roughness to be able to get the dead skin off you and clean well.</li>
            <li>The bag easily holds a standard size bar of soap with room to spare.  </li>
            <li>If its saying soggy you probably have too much humidity in your shower</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really affect how the bag works.  </li>
            <li>A standard bar fit well in the bag, I used Dove.</li>
            <li>i can use all my soap to the last sliver and the bag has heldup to everyday use and feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li>love these bags, went back and got different sizes.</li>
            <li>I think that people like them and they are a cute little addition.</li>
            <li>another cannot live without it purchase.</li>
            <li>The bag is two-sided, one with a smoother finish, the other rougher, making it easy to do heavy cleaning or go light on the face.</li>
            <li>After two weeks of heavy use, this bag is still going strong.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t leave the bar of soap in the bag though or the soap just becomes soft.</li>
            <li>I really like that there are different thicknesses of material on each side, so</li>
            <li>They are very durable and will last for years.  </li>
            <li>I loved the bag but it is difficult to wash.  </li>
            <li>I typically haven&#x27;t liked using bars of soap because I don&#x27;t like the mess.</li>
            <li>I definitely prefer these natural fiber soap bags over mesh sponges.</li>
            <li>OK for scrubbing, not great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry out very well between daily showers (especially the side that has the thicker weave), but that is the trade off with this type of material versus plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was smaller than a loofah and was soft, but still durable enough to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>Collects hair, keeps soap too soft for too long.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t need to be super tight, the wet rope and the knot at the end will keep it from slipping.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I agree that it is very soft once wet.  </li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it because it doesn&#x27;t dry out between daily showers, which keeps the soap soft and wet.</li>
            <li> So, the soap turns to mush and is gone in no time flat.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve gone back to using those little clear rubber pads with the nubs.</li>

            <li> gave it four stars because the &amp;#34;eco&amp;#34; bags have a nylon/polyester tag making them not completely degradable.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it every day so that probably helps it dry out too.</li>

            <li> The downside is 100% coton stretches somewhat, dries slowly, and the product with bar of soap is slightly bigger than a standard bar soap travel case.</li>
            <li> , you should be running your bathroom fan or you are going to have other problems not just this.</li>
            <li> I primarily use it to collect the little slivers i feel bad about throwing away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : You need to wet it down for a few seconds before you use it or its like scrubbing yourself with a small brick.</li>
            <li> But if I get down to a few pieces of soap, I&#x27;ll place them in the bag</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this little bag for about six months now.  </li>
            <li> the slight shipping weight was likely doubled by the unnecessary plastic packaging for no reason I can discern.</li>
            <li> so it wasted a lot of soap when I have to rinse it after each shower.</li>
            <li> Used this soap bag a few times.</li>
            <li> It provides some exfoliation without being harsh.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t meet my expectation, it&#x27;s not mesh on both sides the reverse is more like a washcloth and it gets too soapy so it wasted a lot of soap when I have to rinse it after each shower. It might be good if I wanted a washcloth type soap bag.</li>
            <li> another cannot live without it purchase. put all your old small soaps in it, and never waste another soap</li>
            <li> This soap bag is made really well and allows a nice lather. I only gave it four stars instead of five because it doesn&#x27;t always stay closed after you use the drawstrings. Great bag, though!</li>
            <li> Love This bag.  My large bars of soap fit perfectly!  I agree that it is very soft once wet.  I just used mine for the first time and am buying more!</li>
            <li> Its soft not scratchy and is made of a great natural material to exfoliate with!</li>
            <li> Gets too slimy and nasty. I thought I could use it as a soap saver, but it&#x27;s just too gross.</li>
            <li> The idea is great. Slippery soap becomes a problem of the past. The bag is two-sided, one with a smoother finish, the other rougher, making it easy to do heavy cleaning or go light on the face. My only negative (besides the price) is that when the soapy bag dries it takes on an ugly brownish colour.</li>
            <li> Love this soap bag. You can tell it is made really good. I can&#x27;t stand those abrasive cush-cushes. This bag is perfect for my soap bars.</li>
            <li> Does the job. People complain about the bits falling out:&lt;br /&gt;Just pull the bag closed, wrap the cord around the opening (like a twist tie on a garbage bag) and loop it though. It doesn&#x27;t need to be super tight, the wet rope and the knot at the end will keep it from slipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dries out just fine, just hang it up in the shower. If its saying soggy you probably have too much humidity in your shower, you should be running your bathroom fan or you are going to have other problems not just this. I don&#x27;t use it every day so that probably helps it dry out too. I primarily use it to collect the little slivers i feel bad about throwing away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: You need to wet it down for a few seconds before you use it or its like scrubbing yourself with a small brick.</li>
            <li> this is the third bag i have purchased. two were gifts. we all love them. i can use all my soap to the last sliver and the bag has heldup to everyday use and feels good on my skin. thank you.</li>
            <li> This is just what I wanted. I bought one for my husband and I both. I typically haven&#x27;t liked using bars of soap because I don&#x27;t like the mess. However, these bags hold the soap until they are totally done and you get a nice skin scrub with the texture of the bag with each shower.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a soap bag that wasn&#x27;t made of plastic, as plastic seems to stretch out over time rendering the soap bag useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this little bag for about six months now.  There is a small snag/loose thread but it doesn&#x27;t really affect how the bag works.  The bag easily holds a standard size bar of soap with room to spare.  The front and backs have different weaving patterns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry out very well between daily showers (especially the side that has the thicker weave), but that is the trade off with this type of material versus plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would order again once this my current bag bites the dust.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace a net soap holder, thinking it would be better because it&#x27;s made of cotton. I didn&#x27;t like it because it doesn&#x27;t dry out between daily showers, which keeps the soap soft and wet.</li>
            <li> This is a product I bought while on vacation and wanted to share with family since I love the practicality of the product!</li>
            <li> I purchased these to add to my soap gift baskets. I think that people like them and they are a cute little addition.</li>
            <li> love these bags, went back and got different sizes. they wash up great and save all my slippery soap slivers so i am no longer throwing away any soap. i also use them as sachets in my drawers.</li>
            <li> I loved the bag but it is difficult to wash.  It is too small to throw in the washing machine so it has to be washed by hand.</li>
            <li> Great soap bags!  I&#x27;ll help the seller out here and tell you that the side of the bag that is not pictured is solid cotton cloth but not terry cloth.  Makes for a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars because the &amp;#34;eco&amp;#34; bags have a nylon/polyester tag making them not completely degradable.  Also, they were shipped in a zip-lock bag, inside a zip-lock bag that was taped shut with shipping tape.  I.E. the slight shipping weight was likely doubled by the unnecessary plastic packaging for no reason I can discern.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s the fact that we are using this product at our Costa Rican beach house and it&#x27;s quite humid... but these bags did not meet my expectations. The bag never quite dries out, in spite of hanging from the faucet handle.  So, the soap turns to mush and is gone in no time flat.  We&#x27;ve gone back to using those little clear rubber pads with the nubs.</li>
            <li> Used this soap bag a few times. You can&#x27;t leave your soap in it as it will melt. But if I get down to a few pieces of soap, I&#x27;ll place them in the bag so I can use them up.</li>
            <li> Love these soap bags. They created a good lather and are made with natural material versus your plastic pouf</li>
            <li> So glad I selected this type, instead of one made of sisal.  It provides some exfoliation without being harsh.  AND, now I don&#x27;t have to throw away that last pieces of soap - especially the ones made by my friend at HiddenCreekAcres.com.</li>
            <li> This was a very good product that I used during a two week jungle trip. It was smaller than a loofah and was soft, but still durable enough to exfoliate. A standard bar fit well in the bag, I used Dove. After two weeks of heavy use, this bag is still going strong. I wash in a delicates bag on the regular cycle with no problems. The downside is 100% coton stretches somewhat, dries slowly, and the product with bar of soap is slightly bigger than a standard bar soap travel case.</li>
            <li> This product may be good for storing a bar of soap (and allowing it to dry out) but my daughter wanted the kind with a side that scrubs and this one doesn&#x27;t offer that. She gave it to me and I was surprised how delicate the cotton is.</li>
            <li> I liked it and bought a second one. Then I discovered the nylon bags that work so much better at a much much MUCH cheaper price.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot its got a good grip for the soap so it never falls out of your hand. (does what its designed to do)&lt;br /&gt;The fabric is nice and soft but has enough roughness to be able to get the dead skin off you and clean well. You can&#x27;t leave the bar of soap in the bag though or the soap just becomes soft. Have to take it out of the bag each time but overall I like this product a lot.</li>
            <li> Collects hair, keeps soap too soft for too long. Wish I still had my nylon one. OK for scrubbing, not great.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for another soap bag that I&#x27;d had for years, which finally wore out. It took me a while to find another one that I really liked, but this one is excellent. I really like that there are different thicknesses of material on each side, so I can have a rougher or softer scrub if I want. I think it does a really good job of exfoliating as well. I definitely prefer these natural fiber soap bags over mesh sponges. They are very durable and will last for years.  04/2016 Update: 4 years later, and it has not fallen apart and continues to serve me well for daily use. This is hands down, the best soap bag I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Mesh is too thin. Was hoping for an earth friendly replacement for the nylon mesh bags, but they work much better so I&#x27;m switching back.</li>
