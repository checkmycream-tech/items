    <ol>
            <li>One word to describe my extensions, AWESOME!!</li>
            <li>Not the color advertised, which the picture matched my hair perfectly but when I got the extensions they were a caramel brown vs an ashy brown.&lt;br</li>
            <li>just wasn&#x27;t real impressed.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product!!</li>

            <li>Love!!!</li>
            <li>, they curled beautifully and they are still curly.</li>
            <li>There great</li>
            <li>, I had to die them (not too happy about that).</li>
            <li>+ some thickness added these are a great deal for you.</li>
            <li>But, they are great to use for up</li>
            <li>But is actually very nice.</li>
            <li>They are so easy to put in and they blend wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I would reccomend them to anybody who is looking for a good pair of extensions.</li>
            <li>was good</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>I will buy again for sure!</li>
            <li>They were shipped really quickly, and are very good quality.</li>
            <li>The ends were very tapered at the end, but they curled beautifully and looked great.  </li>
            <li>These extensions are amazing.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly amazing for the price.  </li>
            <li>I bought these to see if I liked them because if I really liked them, then I&#x27;d spend money on nice extensions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how mkuch it matched my hair and how nice it was.</li>
            <li>I believe it would be nice to make my hair fuller in places.</li>
            <li>magnificent and gentle, and recommend that fit perfectly and the color is perfect combination along with not only feel when they adhere to your hair</li>
            <li>You can always wear all six of them, color is a nice medium/dark brown.</li>
            <li>They are super easy to clip in and the hair is really nice for the price- perfect for what I use them for, which is weekend use for adding bulk to my own hair.</li>
            <li>I love my extensions, loved the color and its really easy to put them on!</li>
            <li>They match my hair color perfectly, and blend with my natural hair well.</li>
            <li>It is redder than advertised, which ended up making it match my natural hair color perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine baby hair</li>
            <li>so I consider this a quick fix while a saved up the money to buy the good stuff that cost 100</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with the texture and condition of the extensions.</li>
            <li>:) Hope this helped:)</li>
            <li>The extensions were ok.</li>
            <li>they were ok.</li>
            <li>It was okay.</li>
            <li>so I would not recommend if you are trying to add more than 2-3 inches of length.</li>
            <li>If you want extra volume this is perfect.</li>
            <li>all in all it was ok</li>
            <li>and it resulted great since it looked natural and made my hair look fuller</li>
            <li>The Clips on are really easy to use and will not damage your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>Product came folded and it does not curl easily with curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;Color</li>
            <li>Clips worked well in her fine, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I loved it easy to straighten curl human hair and so cheap!</li>
            <li>The color was very good and actually matched her hair exactly!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be fabulous for the price.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind they are cheap.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li>These were my first pair of extensions and I&#x27;m glad that I bought them.</li>
            <li>These are my first extensions, so the price is great for starting out.  </li>
            <li>I just decided to use them with my hair up and give myself a full pony tail.</li>
            <li>The hair isn&#x27;t the thickest, but it&#x27;s not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>If you want more fullness you are better off getting a full bag or two of regular track hair.</li>
            <li>These extensions were shipped quickly, and were packaged well.  </li>
            <li>burned quickly.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super bulky</li>
            <li>the hair is nice feels soft and looks real!</li>
            <li>This is my first pair of extentions!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are real hair and silky smooth</li>
            <li>I say it is worth the money , otherwise go buy $200-$300 extensions and stop complaining.</li>
            <li>and when I opened them they were more like light brown with tints of blond and red.  </li>
            <li>However, the hair itself was great but some clips/sewing to secure the clips was poor.</li>
            <li>They also didn&#x27;t blend with the hair very much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To match my hair color exactly</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve noticed that many people complain about extensions being to thin,of course they will be they are just to add length and extra volume to your hair.</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with my purchase though.</li>
            <li>The hair is nothing like the picture first of all.</li>
            <li>You get exactly what you pay for.</li>
            <li>But fast delivery!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I anticipated.</li>
            <li>They curl well, you can put your hair up easily with them, and they give you a little more body in you hair.</li>
            <li>I prefer for they looked natural when mixed with my own hair) .</li>
            <li>pretty cheap for human hair</li>
            <li>Good price, I have fun with the extension, the only down side for me is that the color was off</li>
            <li>The hair is really soft and pretty and for the price is a bargain!</li>
            <li>The hair came fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks for prompt delivery.  </li>
            <li>I bought additional Sassy Silky Straight extensions (12inch) from Sally Beauty and sewed them onto the strips for additional thickness</li>
            <li>but it is real hair, so</li>
            <li>The quality is better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I bought two sets thinking that would help but it didn&#x27;t really.</li>
            <li>It came completely straight and shiny.  </li>
            <li>The actual color is a light reddish-auburn, not at all a medium brown.</li>
            <li>I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED IN THIS ITEM AND SELLER.</li>
            <li>extensions are just kind of messy.</li>
            <li>This was much better hair for the price than I had expected!  </li>
            <li>I was able to make 2 additional 8\\&quot; double weft clip ons and double up all the ones that came with this 14\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>First off I have not tried these personally</li>
            <li>The other reviews got me so excited.</li>
            <li>The hair is pretty thin and probably wont last long which is ok with me because its my quick fix hair.</li>
            <li>Silky Straight pack+ still have a lot of hair left over)!.</li>
            <li>Got this for my 15 year old daughter, I was worried that for the price it would be junk.  </li>
            <li>As far as the quality of the extensions I have to give them 3.</li>
            <li>but when I was ready to curl them realized that it wasn&#x27;t human hair and the extensions</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try to find someone who wants funky red highlights and give it to them.</li>
            <li>However, when I reordered this time, there were like three extensions sawn in one (it looked grotesque and super cheap!).</li>
            <li>far as hair goes, it seems to be good quality, but it&#x27;s very thin.</li>
            <li>Definitely not thick enough for that.</li>
            <li>I definately recommend it for a fast fix short period of time but not for long term use.</li>
            <li>this is barely anything.  </li>
            <li>In sum, apparently, with this company you do not know what to expect.</li>
            <li>If you have thin hair that is about 3-4 inches below your shoulders and just want a couple more inches</li>
            <li>The extensions aren&#x27;t super thick or dense.</li>

            <li> The extensions aren&#x27;t super thick or dense.</li>
            <li> They were about the same length so comparably these were more like 12inch extensions and the bottoms were very thin.</li>
            <li> The color was exactly what I expected with a few reddish strands throughout (no big deal bc</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super thin at the ends.</li>
            <li> Because of that, and the extremely low price, I&#x27;ve decided to keep the set, but it&#x27;s certainly not the same as what was promised.</li>
            <li> I just got my extensions, 3 days early than i expected !!!</li>
            <li> I must admit, I was skeptical that these clip ins would be cheap looking but to my surprise they weren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Bought this hair so that my curly headed daughter could have long hair for prom.  </li>
            <li> These clip ins are worth money, they are thin but it is what is expected for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wore them a couple times and then the clips started coming loose.</li>
            <li> I have little to say about these extensions because I have not used much but at least you apply heat and endured so q</li>
            <li> and I have gotten it wet</li>
            <li> there was only one strand attached to the clips and i was not able to return or exchange.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s all... &amp; get a sew in or other style rather than extensions for thickness.</li>
            <li> This are 6 extensions, 2 small ones (1 clip), 2 medium ones (2 clips) and 2 big ones (3 clips).</li>
            <li> and UNFORTUNATELY they did not work as my first purchase.</li>
            <li> The color was completely different than what I expected and they needed trimmed about 4 inches before they looked decent but after cutting and dying....</li>
            <li> I will try to hand stitch the few that went loose.</li>
            <li> For the price... I would say they are average quality.</li>
            <li> and so I tried to dye them to match my dark brown hair....</li>
            <li> They are a little thin but its not really that noticable especially if you have thinner hair, but my hair is very thick and it still looks natural.</li>
            <li> The clips clamp tightly and the price cannot be beat.</li>
            <li> I also trimmed the ends a little because they were a little straggly.</li>
            <li> medium brown is a little lighter then in photo shown and had a reddish tint to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have a thin hair I recommend you to buy 2 sets, i just ordered my second set !!!</li>
            <li> Also, the clips on a few of the extensions wouldn&#x27;t clip all the way and hung off.  </li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t believe i wasted money on this.</li>
            <li> dont buy this to be fake, just embrace the natural you and dont waste your money or time with these hair clip ins</li>

            <li> The hair came fast. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be fabulous for the price. However, the hair itself was great but some clips/sewing to secure the clips was poor. I will try to hand stitch the few that went loose. I also trimmed the ends a little because they were a little straggly.</li>
            <li> One word to describe my extensions, AWESOME!! I got them yesterday 06/25/12 but wasn&#x27;t expecting them til the 29th. I was so pleased with the texture and condition of the extensions. I put them in last night and used my curling iron, they curled beautifully and they are still curly. I love them!!!</li>
            <li> I loved it easy to straighten curl human hair and so cheap!</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair last week. I got the 14in 6 piece set and I like the hair. Its not kinky  and nappy. It curls well and I have gotten it wet and it has still held up. However I do believe I got what I paid for. This set was only 29.99. pretty cheap for human hair so I consider this a quick fix while a saved up the money to buy the good stuff that cost 100+. The hair is pretty thin and probably wont last long which is ok with me because its my quick fix hair. I definately recommend it for a fast fix short period of time but not for long term use.</li>
            <li> These extensions are amazing. They match my hair color perfectly, and blend with my natural hair well. These were my first pair of extensions and I&#x27;m glad that I bought them. I would reccomend them to anybody who is looking for a good pair of extensions. They curl well, you can put your hair up easily with them, and they give you a little more body in you hair. They were shipped really quickly, and are very good quality. They are a little thin but its not really that noticable especially if you have thinner hair, but my hair is very thick and it still looks natural. I recommend these extensions to anybody! There great:) Hope this helped:)</li>
            <li> I just got my extensions, 3 days early than i expected !!! The hair is really soft and pretty and for the price is a bargain! If you have a thin hair I recommend you to buy 2 sets, i just ordered my second set !!! The Clips on are really easy to use and will not damage your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck !!!</li>
            <li> These clip ins are worth money, they are thin but it is what is expected for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The medium brown is a little lighter then in photo shown and had a reddish tint to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To match my hair color exactly, I dyed the extensions with the same dye as I dye my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are real hair and silky smooth pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These other posts complaining is ridiculous to read - these people expect to pay under $50 and get $200 extensions. I say it is worth the money , otherwise go buy $200-$300 extensions and stop complaining.</li>
            <li> i was not happy with my purchase. there was only one strand attached to the clips and i was not able to return or exchange.</li>
            <li> Dude these totally suck. But what do you expect, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> First off I have not tried these personally but I&#x27;ve noticed that many people complain about extensions being to thin,of course they will be they are just to add length and extra volume to your hair. If you want more fullness you are better off getting a full bag or two of regular track hair. That&#x27;s all... &amp; get a sew in or other style rather than extensions for thickness. I like extensions just to add length to my hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks for prompt delivery.  Good price, I have fun with the extension, the only down side for me is that the color was off, I had to die them (not too happy about that). I chose medium brown which is what the cosmetology teachers at my work advised for me to get and when I opened them they were more like light brown with tints of blond and red.  Overall I am pleased with my purchase though.</li>
            <li> The hair is nothing like the picture first of all. It is very thin especially on the ends. The color was exactly what I expected with a few reddish strands throughout (no big deal bc i have red undertones). For the price... I would say they are average quality. The other reviews got me so excited. When they came in I couldn&#x27;t believe how thin they were. I bought additional Sassy Silky Straight extensions (12inch) from Sally Beauty and sewed them onto the strips for additional thickness (The package was 29.99 and it came with a longggg strip of hair. I was able to make 2 additional 8\\&quot; double weft clip ons and double up all the ones that came with this 14\\&quot;  Silky Straight pack+ still have a lot of hair left over)!. They were about the same length so comparably these were more like 12inch extensions and the bottoms were very thin. Clips are secured well with seems like a glue. I have hair that just hits my shoulders so I was buying these as EXTENSIONS. Definitely not thick enough for that. If you have thin hair that is about 3-4 inches below your shoulders and just want a couple more inches + some thickness added these are a great deal for you. If not I&#x27;d recommend buying the clips from a beauty store and making some urself! I meant to post picture b4 I doubled them up, but I got to eager. Trust me they&#x27;re thin.    [...]</li>
            <li> The extensions were ok. The color was completely different than what I expected and they needed trimmed about 4 inches before they looked decent but after cutting and dying....they were ok.</li>
            <li> truth I have little to say about these extensions because I have not used much but at least you apply heat and endured so q if well.</li>
            <li> I love my extensions, loved the color and its really easy to put them on! I haven&#x27;t done anything to them but it is real hair, so I don&#x27;t think it would be a problem to curl them or straighten them. This are 6 extensions, 2 small ones (1 clip), 2 medium ones (2 clips) and 2 big ones (3 clips).</li>
            <li> Got this for my 15 year old daughter, I was worried that for the price it would be junk.  But is actually very nice.</li>
            <li> You get exactly what you pay for. The extensions aren&#x27;t super thick or dense. They did the job for the time being.  After being dyed twice they were frizzy and unusable. Keep in mind they are cheap. They worked for me.</li>
            <li> It was okay. I wore them a couple times and then the clips started coming loose. They also didn&#x27;t blend with the hair very much. You would have to cut them to match with your hair.</li>
            <li> These extensions were shipped quickly, and were packaged well.  These are my first extensions, so the price is great for starting out.  The quality is better than I expected.  I have curled and washed them, and they are holding up well.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!!! I would give it 5 stars for that. As far as the quality of the extensions I have to give them 3. They are very thin. I bought two sets thinking that would help but it didn&#x27;t really. But, they are great to use for up do&#x27;s and ponytails!!!</li>
            <li> I love them! This is my first pair of extentions! The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is when they got here they were bent up where the clip in part from the packing box. But fast delivery! Love!!!</li>
            <li> I received the item on time but when I was ready to curl them realized that it wasn&#x27;t human hair and the extensions burned quickly.</li>
            <li> The hair isn&#x27;t the thickest, but it&#x27;s not bad for the price. I have short hair, I would need to order 3 packs of this hair for it to be enough.</li>
            <li> Instead of the 14&amp;#34; length advertised in the product description, each weft is closer to 10 inches.  Disappointing.  It is redder than advertised, which ended up making it match my natural hair color perfectly.  Because of that, and the extremely low price, I&#x27;ve decided to keep the set, but it&#x27;s certainly not the same as what was promised.</li>
            <li> This was a horrible purchase and I&#x27;m telling you DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY...FALSE ADVERTISING...it is not real human hair and states medium brown as the color of the extensions but turns out they&#x27;re a reddish color and so I tried to dye them to match my dark brown hair....I couldn&#x27;t dye them because they are not real hair...waste of money and very disappointed.  Also, the clips on a few of the extensions wouldn&#x27;t clip all the way and hung off.  TRUST ME...don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> this is barely anything.  a few clips with thin hair attached... weird color. i can&#x27;t believe i wasted money on this. dont buy this to be fake, just embrace the natural you and dont waste your money or time with these hair clip ins</li>
            <li> I bought these to see if I liked them because if I really liked them, then I&#x27;d spend money on nice extensions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These extensions are just kind of messy. Not the color advertised, which the picture matched my hair perfectly but when I got the extensions they were a caramel brown vs an ashy brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wasn&#x27;t real impressed. They&#x27;re super bulky so you can see the bumps. I just decided to use them with my hair up and give myself a full pony tail. Looks alright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish they were fuller. They&#x27;re super thin at the ends.</li>
            <li> I would order from the company again  I am very pleased with the product!! I can&#x27;t believe how mkuch it matched my hair and how nice it was.</li>
            <li> Bought this hair so that my curly headed daughter could have long hair for prom.  It came completely straight and shiny.  The ends were very tapered at the end, but they curled beautifully and looked great.  This was much better hair for the price than I had expected!  Clips worked well in her fine, curly hair.  The color was very good and actually matched her hair exactly!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I anticipated. I purchased this to add extra body to my hair and some length. The clip ins are on the thin side so I would not recommend if you are trying to add more than 2-3 inches of length. If you want extra volume this is perfect. The clips clamp tightly and the price cannot be beat.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly amazing for the price.  I bought 2 packages thinking I would need it but one would have been enough.  No one can tell they are extensions.</li>
            <li> I have very fine baby hair and I ordered this item back on september 2012 and it resulted great since it looked natural and made my hair look fuller (even though they do not have a lot of hair wich I prefer for they looked natural when mixed with my own hair) . However, when I reordered this time, there were like three extensions sawn in one (it looked grotesque and super cheap!). Also, the hair is very dry and the split ends looked terrible. It took me various days to deconstruct each extension and I finished with a lot of small extensions wich look damage (like overprocessed hair) and UNFORTUNATELY they did not work as my first purchase. In sum, apparently, with this company you do not know what to expect. Very sad for I could have been a customer for life (due to my hair condition).</li>
            <li> I must admit, I was skeptical that these clip ins would be cheap looking but to my surprise they weren&#x27;t. They are super easy to clip in and the hair is really nice for the price- perfect for what I use them for, which is weekend use for adding bulk to my own hair. They seem like they are going to last for quite some time. I will buy again for sure!</li>
            <li> Product came folded and it does not curl easily with curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;Color was good but it was very thin. all in all it was ok</li>
            <li> I purchased this in Color 8, Medium Brown. The actual color is a light reddish-auburn, not at all a medium brown. When I hold it up to my hair, it looks like the funky temporary red color that the teens use to give a spot of color (red, blue, purple, etc) to their hair. For my hair, it&#x27;s UGLY!! Since the package came with Asian writing on it and nothing else, I&#x27;m not going to bother to return it. I&#x27;ll try to find someone who wants funky red highlights and give it to them. I guess I could also dye it to match my hair, but I don&#x27;t use a hair dye and, knowing my luck, I will dye it the wrong color and make it worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as hair goes, it seems to be good quality, but it&#x27;s very thin. If it were closer to my haircolor I believe it would be nice to make my hair fuller in places.</li>
            <li> the hair is nice feels soft and looks real! BUT IT IS WAY TOO SHORT! MY HAIR IS LONGER THAN THE EXTENSIONS! PLUS I TRIED CONTACTING THE SELLER AND NO ANSWER I EMAILED THEM AND STILL NO ANSWER COULDN&#x27;T GET MY MONEY BACK THE WORSE PART IS I BOUGHT 2 SETS! I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED IN THIS ITEM AND SELLER.</li>
            <li> magnificent and gentle, and recommend that fit perfectly and the color is perfect combination along with not only feel when they adhere to your hair</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very thin but they do the job, they fill in where you need them. You can always wear all six of them, color is a nice medium/dark brown.</li>
            <li> I got the Medium Brown and it matches my hair perfectly! I have a red tone to my hair so it can be difficult to find extensions to match. They are so easy to put in and they blend wonderfully. I did get two sets because I have a lot of hair so I recommend getting two sets.</li>
