            <li> I purchased this wanting to try something new at an affordable price. This scent is a bit like grapefruit (or citrus) to me. It smells crisp &amp; clean.

            <li> This is a soft yet tantalizing scent with excellent staying power, and after one spray to the wrist it immediately became my new favorite.

Never going without this one!</li>
