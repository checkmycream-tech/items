            <li>Great cologne for the money.</li>
            <li>Smells great.</li>
            <li>This perfume smells great at the moment you spray it.  </li>
            <li>My favorite!!  </li>
            <li>You can wear this cologne in any weather and still smell good.</li>
            <li>have always loved this scent</li>
            <li>I received it quickly and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>This is a great product I love the fragrance</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>Ck is always nice fragrances and this is no exception.</li>
            <li>Calvin Klein makes some of the best cologne&#x27;s/perfumes on the market and at a fraction of the price of the more higher end name brand scents on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a scent with more staying power throughout the day then you should try CK One instead.  </li>
            <li>just because I personally love the way it smells on me.  </li>
            <li>This is not an authentic CK, compared to one i just bought from Dillard&#x27;s and</li>
            <li>the best perfume that have been invented, the only thing is that both men and women equally but never mind smell the perfume is very good</li>
            <li>/&gt;Except this problem, it was pretty good.</li>
            <li>For those women who are wondering (like i did) if its too manyl of a scent to be also for a woman.. well its not it smells very fresh, and i guess OK for the price</li>
            <li>Not too strong to offend anybody.</li>
            <li>#34;What is that you are wearing?&amp;#34; So if you like clean, refreshing, and light floral notes in your scents then this is one that you should add to your collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find that when I use that the scent is much more noticeable and powerful.  </li>
            <li>CK Be does smell fantastic...</li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent to wear in the summer because it is so clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>and I hope you get a super Amazon price like I did.  </li>
            <li>Item was as described and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I keep a bottle at work too in case I need to refresh myself especially if it is a very hot or humid day in DC.  </li>
            <li>The smell lasted strong the whole day while going out for fun.</li>
            <li>Fresh scent.</li>
            <li>It has a clean smell that is subtle and unobtrusive as any great scent should be.</li>
            <li>the  scents will not last for more than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Either way, this is half the price and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I got this perfume for my boyfriend who wanted something long lasting and with a good smell and didn&#x27;t cost a bomb.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a unisex scent that is appropriate for a wide range of ages and demographics.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cologne</li>
            <li>For people who want a very strong scent, I do not recommend this,  because with its citrus notes it is meant to be subtle.  </li>
            <li>The Amazon pricing on this cologne is so much cheaper than I can find locally</li>
            <li>Buy from Amazon only and you will not have to worry about whether you are getting the real CK cologne.</li>
            <li>excelent price, excelent fragance, recomended for young folks</li>
            <li>so when I buy, I always buy directly from Amazon due to stellar customer service.  </li>
            <li>but like others said the scent does wear off quickly even if you re-apply its just not a strong lasting fragrance.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just the fact that I am not able to smell it after awhile, but I am fairly certain the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last as long as it should.</li>
            <li> This is the second Ck that i buy from amazon that is not authentic, i guess our only option is to buy retail.</li>

            <li> Is The dame productos as The description. And The fragance is The expected.</li>
            <li> This is a great product I love the fragrance</li>
            <li> Nice product.Ck is always nice fragrances and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> CK be cologne smell absolutely great. You can wear this cologne in any weather and still smell good. The smell lasted strong the whole day while going out for fun. Buy it and you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> Took over 2 weeks to receive my merchandise. This is to be a Christmas gift. Don&#x27;t purchase this as a gift if you need it faster than 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> The Amazon pricing on this cologne is so much cheaper than I can find locally I routinely buy this from Amazon as the seller.  I do not trust the resellers like I do Amazon so when I buy, I always buy directly from Amazon due to stellar customer service.  This product comes in a black bottle with a screw cap but the spray mister attachment is inside the box too.  This is my favorite scent to wear in the summer because it is so clean and fresh.  I keep a bottle at work too in case I need to refresh myself especially if it is a very hot or humid day in DC.  Just a spray on the wrist and the neck does the trick for me.  This is one of the few scents I wear that I receive compliments and inquiries about &amp;#34;What are you wearing?&amp;#34; from both males and females.  For people who want a very strong scent, I do not recommend this,  because with its citrus notes it is meant to be subtle.  If you are looking for a scent with more staying power throughout the day then you should try CK One instead.  I find that when I use that the scent is much more noticeable and powerful.  I use CK One if I want to be noticed.  I use CK Be just because I personally love the way it smells on me.  I highly recommend this cologne and I hope you get a super Amazon price like I did.  Buy from Amazon only and you will not have to worry about whether you are getting the real CK cologne.</li>
            <li> I received it quickly and in perfect condition. The smell is great. It can be used at both day and night times. Not too strong to offend anybody. Fresh scent.</li>
            <li> My favorite!!  The only reason no 5 star is because the cologne seems to wear out too soon.  I wanna say the CKbe I bought at macys lasts longer.  Either way, this is half the price and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> It was good, the only disappointed thing is that it didn&#x27;t last long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I should use several time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except this problem, it was pretty good.</li>
            <li> CK Be does smell fantastic... unfortunately, the scent vanishes in no time at all, even after an ample (or even excessive) amount is used.</li>
            <li> This is not an authentic CK, compared to one i just bought from Dillard&#x27;s and the smell is different. the  scents will not last for more than 10 minutes. This is the second Ck that i buy from amazon that is not authentic, i guess our only option is to buy retail. I been using Ck for the past 7 years the  scents usually last 8 + hours.</li>
            <li> excelent price, excelent fragance, recomended for young folks</li>
            <li> Great cologne for the money. Smells great.</li>
            <li> Calvin Klein makes some of the best cologne&#x27;s/perfumes on the market and at a fraction of the price of the more higher end name brand scents on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a unisex scent that is appropriate for a wide range of ages and demographics. It has a clean smell that is subtle and unobtrusive as any great scent should be. It gets compliments all of the time often ending with the question, &amp;#34;What is that you are wearing?&amp;#34; So if you like clean, refreshing, and light floral notes in your scents then this is one that you should add to your collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that you will like it!</li>
            <li> Not a knock off. Smells like it should and lasts as well.</li>
            <li> I got this perfume for my boyfriend who wanted something long lasting and with a good smell and didn&#x27;t cost a bomb. This worked perfectly. Item is made in USA.</li>
            <li> Item arrived by specified date and was as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just the fact that I am not able to smell it after awhile, but I am fairly certain the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last as long as it should. I&#x27;ve used CK products before and they have never diminished after one 8-hour shift. Anyone else experiencing this issue?</li>
            <li> The product was NOT real (either expired on shelf life or counterfeit)</li>
            <li> Great Buy Product as described!</li>
            <li> have always loved this scent</li>
            <li> This perfume smells great at the moment you spray it.  However, any hint of its scent will have completely disappeared within a half hour or so.  Disappointing.</li>
