            <li>I just purchased the cleansing bar and am hoping to be as happy with it as others seem to be.</li>
            <li>I also use Retin-A and this is a great compliment to the dryness caused by Retin-A.</li>

            <li>Leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li>and Olivella works great for me.  </li>
            <li>great product. .</li>
            <li>I was however tempted to try the product despite all because of the great reviews and the fact that i have been looking for an olive oil based moisturizer.</li>
            <li>moisturizer smells great</li>
            <li>This Olivella Olive oil is great</li>
            <li>I have combination skin..but bought it as an overnight moisturizer..since it is known to be a great anti-oxidant....</li>
            <li>I have oily skin so this is too oily for me to use during the day but its great at night.</li>
            <li>it does a great job.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This one is a great price too.</li>
            <li>great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This is a great product to moisturize noc and day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for my hands.</li>
            <li>This product is great.  </li>
            <li>and my skin feels great in the morning after having this on overnight.</li>
            <li>It is very effective.  </li>
            <li>People also tell me that I have very nice skin (which wasn&#x27;t the case before I&#x27;ve started using it).</li>
            <li>This product is really good and the results are visible.  </li>
            <li>I have recommended this product to my friends Who have tried and loved it.</li>
            <li>its good for those with dry/flaky skin..</li>
            <li>but wearing an itty-bitty amount is good.  </li>
            <li>I use this each night before bedtime with good results.</li>
            <li>It also, surprisingly, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores so I don&#x27;t get acne from using it.</li>
            <li>It might be good for cleansing or using with another product over it.  </li>
            <li>Even my friend who is an esthetician commented on how good it looked.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent moisturizer, has a beautiful light citrus scent and feels so good on your skin, the texture is light and doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy after you put it on.</li>
            <li>Very nice, light scent and feels great going on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I am most happy with Olivella.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer!  </li>
            <li>My skin has never felt better!  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Miracle in a bottle for sure!    </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!  </li>
            <li>I am well into my 50s, and most people think I am closer to 40!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this!  </li>
            <li>Love the smell too!</li>
            <li>Have continued to but this product - is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>My sister had gifted me Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan Oil which I loved.</li>
            <li>I liked this product.</li>
            <li>Get ready to plug your nose because it works best if it&#x27;s spoiled!</li>
            <li>It has a nice feel to it.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect since I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever tried using an olive oil moisturizer, but I was delighted by the results.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need chemicals to have nice skin.  </li>
            <li>The staff tends to be knowledgeable and quite honest.</li>
            <li>Nice to use at night.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed into my skin fairly rapidly and makes me glow!</li>
            <li>And I have oily to combination skin that is still very easily prone to a breakout (in my 40&#x27;s).</li>
            <li>It works OK, but kind of sticky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30 years old and have been through gazillions of skin moisturizers, all of which never leave me with perfect skin.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, moisturizes well, not oily on face (even though it&#x27;s oil!).</li>
            <li>I love love LOVE this moisterizer!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with how light it feels on the skin and how my skin seems smoother and has a glow.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>It is just like the olive oil from the grocery store except is has a sweet perfume added to make it smell good.</li>
            <li>It has a very light, hint of lemon smell.</li>
            <li>so I was worried it would break me out but not at all, it really does its job as a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I recognize that everyone&#x27;s body is different, but I think this is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>I really love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Besides that, I love this moisturizer and will never use another moisturizer if I can help it.</li>
            <li>and I love the results.</li>
            <li>However, when I use Olivella, my skin feels a lot better, I want to say it soothes my skin, but not to that extent.</li>
            <li>Now I use Aveeno moisturizer and my skin feels much better.</li>
            <li>I find myself reaching for this product more often than not.  </li>
            <li>Use this along with the soap and your skin will look fabulous!</li>
            <li>i love how my face feels when i wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li>im sure</li>
            <li>There are many reasons why you get brown spots on your skin</li>
            <li>Make sure to massage it in well.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>We both love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also  noticed a better complexion since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li>I was comparing this to the olive oil by DHC and I like this a lot better.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t burn or irritate my skin at all afterwards, whereas most face creams would.</li>
            <li>I found this combination to work better than anything i have ever tried so now</li>
            <li>Love this as a nighttime moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It is simply the best</li>
            <li>Will buy this again for sure.</li>
            <li>And I think 2 squirts works better than one-- even still</li>
            <li>I use this during the day on top of olivella moisture cream.</li>
            <li>I plan to order again which is probably soon because I use it  many times a day</li>
            <li>Really love the feel of my skin after it&#x27;s been applied.</li>
            <li>Next best thing for me to do</li>
            <li>I definitely love this product and would recommend it to everyone.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>I am suspect that many of the reviews (like many on Amazon) are written by the company.  </li>
            <li>You will love it.</li>
            <li>So glad I found it on here.</li>
            <li>(Be sure to use it around your eyes also.)</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>I re-bought my Clarins Multi-Active Jour that I love</li>
            <li>Love this stuff  ..</li>
            <li>I have used Olivella moisturizer for 2+ yrs now, and I have received many compliments on the state of my skin.  </li>
            <li>Love it though.</li>
            <li>My wife says her arms look better that they have in years.  </li>
            <li>Love the stuff.</li>
            <li>After using for just a week I find my skin smoother and feeling more supple.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have noted, it seems to work best when your skin is warm and moist, immediately after washing your face or jumping out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I needed a moisturizer, i always bought lotion , this time i decided to buy this very satisfied overall great</li>
            <li>find Olivella is best used overnight because when i woke up i had a fresh young glow to my skin and was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>This is the best moisturizer I have used in a long time.</li>
            <li>The mild citrus smell is really nice.  </li>
            <li>Loved it so much that I bought for my son, my co-worker, and my daughter-in-law :)  </li>
            <li>Olive oil is indeed very good for you, whether taken internally or slathered on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Surprised and happy that I can find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My skin gets smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>This is a great natural moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I swear, my face has never been in such good shape!</li>
            <li>I originally used an olive oil product that my mom bought else where, and I fell in love with how that stuff made me feel.</li>
            <li>But, after I clean my face in the evening, I still love to use it.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy I finally found my magical skin potion that works for me.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this and received so quickly</li>
            <li>I did some research and found that there are three HUGE solutions that, combined together can stop the spot from getting darker, and start to heal it.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;D ADMIRED HER SMOOTH SKIN</li>
            <li>Overall though, seems like a great product.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>The oil goes on smoothly, it is heavier than a serum but smooths your skin in weeks.  </li>
            <li>All it takes is a few drops to cover the face and works best after a shower.</li>
            <li>Does not feel greasy and you wake up with a smooth face.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re smooth now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pleasantly light and citrus scented.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and not oily or greasy at all - I am totally not a fan of shine and wouldn&#x27;t use this or recommend it if I wasn&#x27;t very happy!</li>
            <li>Lastly, I rub it in my hands, and i&#x27;m all ready for bed :D  </li>
            <li>This is a really good natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li>But, from the first week I started using this product it worked immediately!!</li>
            <li>Very lightly scented oil that I&#x27;ve been using on my face at night and first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Even the pakaging was useful!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure that it has helped repair the skin under my eyes as well.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, and makeup will apply smoothly after.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad i did because it definitely proves it&#x27;s worth keeping.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this product as it goes on light, absorbs fairly quickly, and doesn&#x27;t smell.  </li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;Reduces redness in skin, great moisturizer for dry skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for whole body as well as face and hands as a gentle, non greasy moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I completely understand why they tell you to do it that way and recommend it even more!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 62 years young and love this product!</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s all natural :)  BUY IT!</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t found a true moisturizer that feels like your skin is getting moisturized, try this.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice &amp; natural (orange essence).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but if it works on my problematic skin I think it will work well on most people, you can adjust how how much you use according to your skin.</li>
            <li>Yes the same thing that works on hands to soften them also works good for brown spots.</li>
            <li>Smells light and fresh.</li>
            <li>not greasy and leaves your skin nice and soft without being greasy.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this product is very good for an older person (59) with dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 19 and have mild acne</li>
            <li>I like that this one has squalene and a mild scent to it.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin rather quickly</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and can be used from head to toe.</li>
            <li>The price for this brand of skin oil is better than that of DHC, but the citrusy fragrance and spout that spits out more than I need are definite minuses.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and has no scent that I can detect.</li>
            <li>With my face still damp from washing, I put one squirt of Olivella on my hand, quickly rub my hands together to distribute it, and pat my face and neck all over.  </li>
            <li>This is a no-nonsense natural moisturizer that also makes an ideal anti-aging product if used regularly.</li>
            <li>It goes on as an oil would, leaving an oily feel but soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li>While there might be a small amount of vitamin A in olive oil, it seems that they have added more (as well as citrus oil, and a number of flower oils that provide its pleasant fragrance).  </li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>This bottle will last &amp;#34;forever&amp;#34; I&#x27;m sure!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned, slightly on dry side, rarely break out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have kind of oily skin that is very very sensitive and very prone to breakouts.  </li>
            <li>This is a good serum for very dry areas.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it after doing an at-home light peel with 10% salicylic acid and much to my surprise</li>
            <li>My skin is back to the amazing soft skin I know and love that results from using Clarin&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li>The ingredients are simple but effective.</li>
            <li>I am also sensitive to many ingredients so finding something natural was appealing.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li>Also make sure your face is wet, seems to help more with the absorption.</li>
            <li>I rarely write letters to companies but this one did it for me.  </li>
            <li>If I want to buy a natural product, I find Wholefoods a much better resource.  </li>
            <li>Gentle, natural, and effective.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes without being oily and is quickly absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li>and I have noticed a very positive change in my skin since using this product.  </li>
            <li>The scent is moderately strong soap-type smell but will not stay with you for long, although some may not be pleased with it.</li>
            <li>just decided today to try putting this on right after my shower like it had suggested.</li>
            <li>I had to let them know they&#x27;ve got the right stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have just recently starting using this and honestly could tell a difference with the first time.</li>
            <li>This is especially good in its most raw form because in order to remove the dark spot, you have to treat through 21 layers of skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product works good for the entire day and even after one splash of water on my face in the middle of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the light citrus smell to be acceptable and it goes away in 1-2 hours after applying the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>In conclusion  -its great instant relief for my oily clean that gets really dry when cleaned  -don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>When it comes to my skin, I like to use all natural products.. and having all of the anti-aging properties of olive oil for such a low price seems a very good deal!  </li>
            <li>One other thing for those looking to purchase the face &amp; body wash, it&#x27;s a great product, just don&#x27;t get it near your eyes!</li>
            <li>the design of the bottle is nice too because the pump ensures you only take out as much as you need.</li>
            <li>You do not need very much....</li>
            <li>But, you do get a lot of product for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This not only smells amazing, but it absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft and nourished.</li>
            <li>Those with oily skin incredibly can also use this because you only need a small amount and it is absorbed into your face quickly.</li>
            <li>really thats all it really is!!  </li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t tell a difference between this and decent olive oil, so I&#x27;d suggest going for the latter if you&#x27;re looking for that sort of thing.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve tried countless moisturizers to no avail, please try one more.</li>
            <li>I really like the way my skin feels using this product!</li>
            <li>Love the extra hydration; use at night.</li>
            <li>A FRIEND OF MINE INTRODUCED ME TO THIS PRODUCT BY GIVING ME MY FIRST BOTTLE.  </li>
            <li>Well, I did, and I&#x27;m glad I invested in this product; I plan on using the entire Olivella skincare line...</li>
            <li>it is the first thing that is working for him.</li>
            <li>Or..you can just buy olive oil and do it yourself ;)</li>
            <li>I wear Oil of Olay Daily Moisture Lotion w/SPF on top of this</li>
            <li>But I was also in my first trimester of pregnancy.</li>
            <li>IN IT&#x27;S EXACT ORDER.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I could try it out first.</li>
            <li>when I first used this product last year, I just fell in love with it..</li>
            <li>Even if you are not allergic, when i first used the product my skin did break out</li>
            <li>Wetter is better and as an extra treat, when you&#x27;re done, rub the residue into your cuticles.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I was thinking whoops</li>
            <li>It actually comes in a glass bottle- better than the photo, if you ask me.</li>
            <li>Love this - it does feel a bit greasy, but also totally nourishing.  </li>
            <li>It is okay to use occasionally in the winter when my skin is feeling drier but the rest of the year I stopped using it because it would cause me to break out</li>
            <li>I put it on at night and the next morning I was in love with my skin.  </li>
            <li>I make sure to do extra pats around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also after cleansing in the morning, this product goes on first</li>
            <li>This is all I need and cheek and lip stain for Hawaii&#x27;s summer hot and humid months.</li>
            <li>This is not the first time I&#x27;ve been burned by listening to reviews.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>it is good for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Feels good on the skin, not too heavy.</li>
            <li>My breakouts went away on their own - without use of other products.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so smooth and soft and it really nourishes my skin.</li>
            <li>Keeps me looking young and handsome ay 63 years old</li>
            <li>After reading the positive reviews about this product, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>i can proudly say i have finally found my secret to healthy skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;What&#x27;s ironic is that when I first started using the soap, I couldn&#x27;t justify the cost of this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I am hoping to have another baby and recent studies suggest that women who are pregnant, or trying to get pregnant, should avoid retinyl palmitate.  </li>
            <li>super soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>So many moisturizers claim to make your skin moist and dewy, but leave my face feeling quite dry.  </li>
            <li>This may work better for you if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li>I will buy it again, love it love it, I will recommend it especially to people with dry to normal skin.</li>
            <li>it was like putting pure Olive Oil on my skin....</li>
            <li>guess when there isn&#x27;t a known cure for a certain condition people will just buy stuff HOPPING that it will be</li>
            <li>My excessively dry eyebrows are nearly perfectly smooth now and the skin on my cheeks feels younger and more</li>
            <li>All natural and just great for my dry facial skin.</li>
            <li>But when I consider how much cream I had to scoop out of jars over the years, this is now an actually very inexpensive product with so much promise.  </li>
            <li>Nonetheless it is much cheaper than argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to really wipe my cell phone off after talking on the phone b/c</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s so much oil on my face coming through my make up.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t put too much on in my opinion.</li>
            <li>So I just gently brush the eyeliner under my eyes with my finger (not with a towel cause</li>
            <li>It was light enough to absorb in about 15 minutes, and makeup could be applied.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>much, but loves putting on this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>, however the body CREAM is very liquidy.  </li>
            <li>I was worried this product would be too oily, but it does soften and dries relatively fast..</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am 42 and have had combination skin that gets much oilier during the warmer months.  </li>
            <li>thanks me every day.  </li>
            <li>Started using this 9 days ago, twice a day, without seeing or feeling all that much of a difference in the texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I really like this oil</li>
            <li>My wish would be that it was available in a larger size.  </li>
            <li>and then my Dermalogical tinted primer with spf 40 (or Dr. Perricone No Concealer with spf 30 using very sparingly).  </li>
            <li>Nope, nope, and....not really.</li>
            <li>after all, this is almost straight olive oil....</li>
            <li>dont really know how it works but got it for my sister.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, moisture lasts.  </li>
            <li>It is simply an olive oil that has this wonderful fragrance of real olive oil, a perfume to which I&#x27;ve become addicted to.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a light-feeling oil, with a very light scent of lavender and citrus from other oils it contains.  </li>
            <li>It soaks right in and doesn&#x27;t leave my sensitive, combination skin with excess oil build up.</li>
            <li>First and foremost what i love about this product is that it&#x27;s natural, is not used in animal testing, and has a very low toxicity rate (according to ewg.org) with no cancer causing chemicals, unlike most of the common moisturizers out there.</li>
            <li>and it came all oily, the box was all oily so apparently it spilled and wasnt packaged right... already a bummer.</li>
            <li>but just put it on before bed with a slightly damp face and let it work its magic.</li>
            <li>I use mostly on my face; occasionally on the back of my hands and elbows.</li>
            <li>Next, I can use the remaining on my hair just on the top part where my hair separates so the tiny hairs don&#x27;t stick up in the air.</li>
            <li>Finally a product worthy of a letter and a review.  </li>
            <li>She Who Never Grows Older.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s a decent moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My skin just felt drier, older and less healthy.  </li>
            <li>live in a dry climate, and I put this moisturizer on right after I get out of the shower, its soaks right in with no greasiness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have shared bars of it with family and they speak highly of it as well..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more oily to touch.</li>
            <li>I am 45 and have very sensitive skin, not really prone to breakouts, however, it becomes irritated easily.</li>
            <li>I have to scrub my face every morning with a baby washcloth in order to properly clean the pores (if I don&#x27;t I will get acne) which of course makes my skin feel dry.  </li>
            <li>but of course it eventually is soaked in, and I&#x27;m not sure if she&#x27;s been able to determine how much the moisturizing lasts after the feeling of the liquid goes away.</li>
            <li>My facialist told me to apply some olive oil to freshly washed facial skin in the shower to combat winter dryness.</li>
            <li>, one of them was nice and tight, the 2nd bottle had a leak and the box package was 50% soaked in oil.</li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t say how it&#x27;s working for my fine lines as it&#x27;s only been a short</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>will keep using it daily, and see if it is as effective in a few weeks as it seems to be now.</li>
            <li>I decided to keep it and try it out, as I hadn&#x27;t found a decent alternative, but it&#x27;s just far too oily for my combination skin.</li>
            <li>I got this for my partner who has super dry skin on her face and who works outdoors.</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin with some breakouts.</li>
            <li>i try  the oil to flake noticed the red lines and fonts have their place White Light</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product to someone who would like to put something natural on their skin.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it as a natural alternative to day creams.</li>
            <li>In general my skin looks more dewy and less crepey.  </li>
            <li>I bought this on a whim after reading its reviews with an amazon gift card I received for xmas and WOW!</li>
            <li>have extremely sensitive skin, as well as eczema, and I&#x27;ve had no negative reaction to this product.  </li>
            <li>This item was almost the exact same thing  but cheaper!  </li>
            <li>At night, after cleansing this is the first thing that goes on my face and neck and lastly pat around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>My skin was glowing the next morning after using it at night the first time.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve had it a few months and use it twice daily) and thought I&#x27;d share my review since I love this stuff so much.  </li>
            <li>I am a person with sensitive skin, that gets super oily during the day and uncomfortably dry when cleaned.</li>
            <li>As an added bonus, my makeup foundation just glides right on with this stuff, although be careful with eye shadow as it might interfere with adhesion if it hasn&#x27;t absorbed enough yet.</li>
            <li>it goes on well and is not thick by any measure, especially when you take a minute to massage is gently on your face as the instructions tell you to.</li>
            <li>I was disappointed, it felt lovely on the skin and has a nice scent but this product made me break out on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>I put it on my damp skin after washing my face at night and have been happier with the results than when I was using other night special potion face lotions.</li>
            <li>The scent is a little bit strong for sensitive people, also.</li>
            <li>I liked the smell, and now that the product is empty, I washed and reused the bottle for blends of other oils!</li>
            <li>36 YO female, have moisturized my whole life, live in freezing winter climate.</li>
            <li>This is definitely crucial, otherwise no matter the cause of the age spot, it WILL get bigger if your skin does not have adequate protection from the sun.</li>
            <li>I just know that when my skin is dry, the dryness disappears right after I use this.  </li>
            <li>My skin used to get dry, especially my cheeks and especially in winter, but this oil works magic.</li>
            <li>, I found out is a very good product, nice moisturizer, it doesn&#x27;t seat on your skin, it absorbs quick enough, and blends so good with any sunscreen I have used with it, contrary with any others moisturizers I&#x27;ve been used on the past, which they will come out in small rolls when I rub the sunscreen on top of it leaving a horrible mess all over my face is just a nightmare especially on morning time when the time is so limited.</li>
            <li>In just a little while my skin was soft and smooth like a babies bottom.  </li>
            <li>I choose this product because I wanted to try something natural on my skin.</li>
            <li>I prefer natural or mostly natural health care products and this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li>Olivella has helped to nearly eliminate my rosacea.</li>
            <li>My skin is so sensitive that aloe vera stings.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I have very acne-prone skin, but this has actually reduced my breakouts.</li>
            <li>And what makes this product convenient is, because it&#x27;s oil-based, it naturally becomes a make-up remover without the chemicals.</li>
            <li>Instead, will feel soft and un-oily  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of olive oil products but the virgin oil moisturizer is by far, a must-have.</li>
            <li>Granted, I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have always had acne prone and sensitive skin (been on Accutane twice)</li>
            <li>AND SHE&#x27;S 82 YRS OLD.  </li>
            <li>Having to keep it away from the eye area has made this product completely unusable on any of my face.</li>
            <li>It makes the skin immediately soft and supple.</li>
            <li>skin does feel soft all day.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much at all but a moist face just isn&#x27;t enough.  </li>
            <li>I have turned my 90 year old mother and 81 year old aunt on to oil.</li>
            <li>The outer layers of skin seemed moist from my regular moisturizer with sunscreen, but my deeper layers of skin really missed the Olivella.  </li>
            <li>I like to use natural things that work.  </li>
            <li>It could be my skin is too sensitive</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft, and not greasy because I have oily skin.  </li>
            <li>It leaves the skin so soft and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>All natural too.</li>
            <li>I am 60 years old and was needing something to help with the aging process.</li>
            <li>Soothing and makes my skin as soft as it should be.</li>
            <li>Keeps skin well hydrated and does not have all the harsh chemicals that most products have-back to basic nature&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li>I put it on my face every night after I clean it and give my skin a little massage.</li>
            <li>I agree with other users to have a moist skin for the olive oil to be absorbed by your skin and not have an oily glow on it.</li>
            <li>i just hope the seller does not mess up again.</li>
            <li>I love putting it on after I shower or exfoliate because where my skin would feel uncomfortably tight and dry and sometimes flaky before, this takes care of all that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I was just here ordering my second bottle because my first is running low</li>
            <li>you live in a dry or desert climate, I highly recommend using this stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this product to use on weekends or on days when I do not feel like following my normal skincare regime.  </li>
            <li>You mind think it is oily, but you don&#x27;t put a lot, just a little bit on your fingers and massage it onto your face, and your face will absorb it quickly and won&#x27;t leave your face oily.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried at first that the oil would react poorly, but I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I had no idea using it when my face was still a little moist would really help with the absorption that much</li>
            <li>This is the only cosmetic I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>After reading all the great reviews about this product, I was surprised at how badly it irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li>It is very helpful in a dry climate like Colorado.  </li>
            <li>I have dry to combination skin and was worried about slathering straight oil on my face -</li>
            <li>Really the only issue I had was the pump on the container broke leaving about 1/3 bottle left.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and obviously it works for some, just not for me.  </li>
            <li>No fine lines around mine and my lipstick proves it - no more creeping into fine lines around my lips.  </li>
            <li>There are three major factors that work together  to help treat, eliminate and hide the brown spot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it with my face dripping wet, as recommended by one reviewer, but it seems to absorb better when my skin is wet, but not quite so sopping wet.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a natural moisturizer, which this is (from what I can tell), but this is actually oil, not a lotion as it appears in the product photo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;2)Citric Acid is a key all natural bleaching ingredient.</li>
            <li>I like it, and it is not oily on my sensitive facial skin.</li>
            <li>Olivella All Natural Virgin Olive Oil Moisturizer From Italy (50ml) 1.69 Fluid Ounces]].  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this for a solid month and am completely indifferent to it.  </li>
            <li>I also apply it to my neck and have noticed the loose looking wrinkles that come with getting older have vanished.</li>
            <li>First I have to reveal I am in my late 50&#x27;s &amp; have tried many products some cheap some very expensive &amp; have learned price doesn&#x27;t always guarantee results.  </li>
            <li>I searched Amazon high and low for a moisturizer without toxic ingredients, and since so many manufacturers don&#x27;t include ingredients on their product descriptions I was unable to make an educated decision.  </li>
            <li>I found after switching to organic or natural facial products my skin is so much healthier and less prone to redness and breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Olivella All Natural Virgin Olive Oil Moisturizer from Italy is the only way to keep skin supple - especially after a day in the sun!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several natural oils before and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t enlarge my pores and doesn&#x27;t make my T-area too oily.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the major ingredients that make it work (that actually back up the research I did: Olea Europea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Squalene, Citris Aurantium, Dulcis (Orange), Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lavadula Angustifiola</li>
            <li>It seemed far too much for such a little bit.  </li>
            <li>I have to make myself use my normal skincare, and only because I just opened new bottles and cannot see letting them go to waste.</li>
            <li>After three days, the rough dry areas were back to normal color and by the end of the week, all symptoms were completely gone.</li>
            <li>I have been using this olive oil moisturizer for at least a year now, and I don&#x27;t want to buy any other moisturizer to replace it because my skin is very sensitive and most of other brands I can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li>and I could really use just a little tiny pump, but I stop at 2.</li>

            <li> I have recommended this product to my friends Who have tried and loved it.</li>
            <li> its good for those with dry/flaky skin..</li>
            <li> but wearing an itty-bitty amount is good.  </li>
            <li> I use this each night before bedtime with good results.</li>
            <li> It also, surprisingly, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores so I don&#x27;t get acne from using it.</li>
            <li> It might be good for cleansing or using with another product over it.  </li>
            <li> Even my friend who is an esthetician commented on how good it looked.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent moisturizer, has a beautiful light citrus scent and feels so good on your skin, the texture is light and doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy after you put it on.</li>
            <li> Very nice, light scent and feels great going on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I am most happy with Olivella.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!  </li>
            <li> My skin has never felt better!  </li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Miracle in a bottle for sure!    </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  </li>
            <li> I am well into my 50s, and most people think I am closer to 40!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this!  </li>
            <li> Love the smell too!</li>
            <li> Have continued to but this product - is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> My sister had gifted me Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan Oil which I loved.</li>
            <li> I liked this product.</li>
            <li> Get ready to plug your nose because it works best if it&#x27;s spoiled!</li>
            <li> It has a nice feel to it.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect since I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever tried using an olive oil moisturizer, but I was delighted by the results.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need chemicals to have nice skin.  </li>
            <li> The staff tends to be knowledgeable and quite honest.</li>
            <li> Nice to use at night.</li>
            <li> It is absorbed into my skin fairly rapidly and makes me glow!</li>
            <li> And I have oily to combination skin that is still very easily prone to a breakout (in my 40&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> It works OK, but kind of sticky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old and have been through gazillions of skin moisturizers, all of which never leave me with perfect skin.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, moisturizes well, not oily on face (even though it&#x27;s oil!).</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE this moisterizer!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with how light it feels on the skin and how my skin seems smoother and has a glow.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> It is just like the olive oil from the grocery store except is has a sweet perfume added to make it smell good.</li>
            <li> It has a very light, hint of lemon smell.</li>
            <li> so I was worried it would break me out but not at all, it really does its job as a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I recognize that everyone&#x27;s body is different, but I think this is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I really love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Besides that, I love this moisturizer and will never use another moisturizer if I can help it.</li>
            <li> and I love the results.</li>
            <li> However, when I use Olivella, my skin feels a lot better, I want to say it soothes my skin, but not to that extent.</li>
            <li> Now I use Aveeno moisturizer and my skin feels much better.</li>
            <li> I find myself reaching for this product more often than not.  </li>
            <li> Use this along with the soap and your skin will look fabulous!</li>
            <li> i love how my face feels when i wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> im sure</li>
            <li> There are many reasons why you get brown spots on your skin</li>
            <li> Make sure to massage it in well.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> We both love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also  noticed a better complexion since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li> I was comparing this to the olive oil by DHC and I like this a lot better.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t burn or irritate my skin at all afterwards, whereas most face creams would.</li>
            <li> I found this combination to work better than anything i have ever tried so now</li>
            <li> Love this as a nighttime moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It is simply the best</li>
            <li> Will buy this again for sure.</li>
            <li> And I think 2 squirts works better than one-- even still</li>
            <li> I use this during the day on top of olivella moisture cream.</li>
            <li> I plan to order again which is probably soon because I use it  many times a day</li>
            <li> Really love the feel of my skin after it&#x27;s been applied.</li>
            <li> Next best thing for me to do</li>
            <li> I definitely love this product and would recommend it to everyone.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> I am suspect that many of the reviews (like many on Amazon) are written by the company.  </li>
            <li> You will love it.</li>
            <li> So glad I found it on here.</li>
            <li> (Be sure to use it around your eyes also.)</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> I re-bought my Clarins Multi-Active Jour that I love</li>
            <li> Love this stuff  ..</li>
            <li> I have used Olivella moisturizer for 2+ yrs now, and I have received many compliments on the state of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Love it though.</li>
            <li> My wife says her arms look better that they have in years.  </li>
            <li> Love the stuff.</li>
            <li> After using for just a week I find my skin smoother and feeling more supple.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, it seems to work best when your skin is warm and moist, immediately after washing your face or jumping out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I needed a moisturizer, i always bought lotion , this time i decided to buy this very satisfied overall great</li>
            <li> find Olivella is best used overnight because when i woke up i had a fresh young glow to my skin and was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I have used in a long time.</li>
            <li> The mild citrus smell is really nice.  </li>
            <li> Loved it so much that I bought for my son, my co-worker, and my daughter-in-law :)  </li>
            <li> Olive oil is indeed very good for you, whether taken internally or slathered on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Surprised and happy that I can find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My skin gets smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> This is a great natural moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I swear, my face has never been in such good shape!</li>
            <li> I originally used an olive oil product that my mom bought else where, and I fell in love with how that stuff made me feel.</li>
            <li> But, after I clean my face in the evening, I still love to use it.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy I finally found my magical skin potion that works for me.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this and received so quickly</li>
            <li> I did some research and found that there are three HUGE solutions that, combined together can stop the spot from getting darker, and start to heal it.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;D ADMIRED HER SMOOTH SKIN</li>
            <li> Overall though, seems like a great product.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> The oil goes on smoothly, it is heavier than a serum but smooths your skin in weeks.  </li>
            <li> All it takes is a few drops to cover the face and works best after a shower.</li>
            <li> Does not feel greasy and you wake up with a smooth face.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re smooth now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pleasantly light and citrus scented.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and not oily or greasy at all - I am totally not a fan of shine and wouldn&#x27;t use this or recommend it if I wasn&#x27;t very happy!</li>
            <li> Lastly, I rub it in my hands, and i&#x27;m all ready for bed :D  </li>
            <li> This is a really good natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li> But, from the first week I started using this product it worked immediately!!</li>
            <li> Very lightly scented oil that I&#x27;ve been using on my face at night and first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Even the pakaging was useful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure that it has helped repair the skin under my eyes as well.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, and makeup will apply smoothly after.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad i did because it definitely proves it&#x27;s worth keeping.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this product as it goes on light, absorbs fairly quickly, and doesn&#x27;t smell.  </li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;Reduces redness in skin, great moisturizer for dry skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for whole body as well as face and hands as a gentle, non greasy moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I completely understand why they tell you to do it that way and recommend it even more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 62 years young and love this product!</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s all natural :)  BUY IT!</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t found a true moisturizer that feels like your skin is getting moisturized, try this.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice &amp; natural (orange essence).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but if it works on my problematic skin I think it will work well on most people, you can adjust how how much you use according to your skin.</li>
            <li> Yes the same thing that works on hands to soften them also works good for brown spots.</li>
            <li> Smells light and fresh.</li>
            <li> not greasy and leaves your skin nice and soft without being greasy.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product is very good for an older person (59) with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 19 and have mild acne</li>
            <li> I like that this one has squalene and a mild scent to it.</li>
            <li> It absorbs into the skin rather quickly</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and can be used from head to toe.</li>
            <li> The price for this brand of skin oil is better than that of DHC, but the citrusy fragrance and spout that spits out more than I need are definite minuses.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and has no scent that I can detect.</li>
            <li> With my face still damp from washing, I put one squirt of Olivella on my hand, quickly rub my hands together to distribute it, and pat my face and neck all over.  </li>
            <li> This is a no-nonsense natural moisturizer that also makes an ideal anti-aging product if used regularly.</li>
            <li> It goes on as an oil would, leaving an oily feel but soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li> While there might be a small amount of vitamin A in olive oil, it seems that they have added more (as well as citrus oil, and a number of flower oils that provide its pleasant fragrance).  </li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> This bottle will last &amp;#34;forever&amp;#34; I&#x27;m sure!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned, slightly on dry side, rarely break out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have kind of oily skin that is very very sensitive and very prone to breakouts.  </li>
            <li> This is a good serum for very dry areas.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it after doing an at-home light peel with 10% salicylic acid and much to my surprise</li>
            <li> My skin is back to the amazing soft skin I know and love that results from using Clarin&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li> The ingredients are simple but effective.</li>
            <li> I am also sensitive to many ingredients so finding something natural was appealing.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li> Also make sure your face is wet, seems to help more with the absorption.</li>
            <li> I rarely write letters to companies but this one did it for me.  </li>
            <li> If I want to buy a natural product, I find Wholefoods a much better resource.  </li>
            <li> Gentle, natural, and effective.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes without being oily and is quickly absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li> and I have noticed a very positive change in my skin since using this product.  </li>
            <li> The scent is moderately strong soap-type smell but will not stay with you for long, although some may not be pleased with it.</li>
            <li> just decided today to try putting this on right after my shower like it had suggested.</li>
            <li> I had to let them know they&#x27;ve got the right stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have just recently starting using this and honestly could tell a difference with the first time.</li>
            <li> This is especially good in its most raw form because in order to remove the dark spot, you have to treat through 21 layers of skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product works good for the entire day and even after one splash of water on my face in the middle of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the light citrus smell to be acceptable and it goes away in 1-2 hours after applying the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In conclusion  -its great instant relief for my oily clean that gets really dry when cleaned  -don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> When it comes to my skin, I like to use all natural products.. and having all of the anti-aging properties of olive oil for such a low price seems a very good deal!  </li>
            <li> One other thing for those looking to purchase the face &amp; body wash, it&#x27;s a great product, just don&#x27;t get it near your eyes!</li>
            <li> the design of the bottle is nice too because the pump ensures you only take out as much as you need.</li>
            <li> You do not need very much....</li>
            <li> But, you do get a lot of product for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This not only smells amazing, but it absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft and nourished.</li>
            <li> Those with oily skin incredibly can also use this because you only need a small amount and it is absorbed into your face quickly.</li>
            <li> really thats all it really is!!  </li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t tell a difference between this and decent olive oil, so I&#x27;d suggest going for the latter if you&#x27;re looking for that sort of thing.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve tried countless moisturizers to no avail, please try one more.</li>
            <li> I really like the way my skin feels using this product!</li>
            <li> Love the extra hydration; use at night.</li>
            <li> A FRIEND OF MINE INTRODUCED ME TO THIS PRODUCT BY GIVING ME MY FIRST BOTTLE.  </li>
            <li> Well, I did, and I&#x27;m glad I invested in this product; I plan on using the entire Olivella skincare line...</li>
            <li> it is the first thing that is working for him.</li>
            <li> Or..you can just buy olive oil and do it yourself ;)</li>
            <li> I wear Oil of Olay Daily Moisture Lotion w/SPF on top of this</li>
            <li> But I was also in my first trimester of pregnancy.</li>
            <li> IN IT&#x27;S EXACT ORDER.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I could try it out first.</li>
            <li> when I first used this product last year, I just fell in love with it..</li>
            <li> Even if you are not allergic, when i first used the product my skin did break out</li>
            <li> Wetter is better and as an extra treat, when you&#x27;re done, rub the residue into your cuticles.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was thinking whoops</li>
            <li> It actually comes in a glass bottle- better than the photo, if you ask me.</li>
            <li> Love this - it does feel a bit greasy, but also totally nourishing.  </li>
            <li> It is okay to use occasionally in the winter when my skin is feeling drier but the rest of the year I stopped using it because it would cause me to break out</li>
            <li> I put it on at night and the next morning I was in love with my skin.  </li>
            <li> I make sure to do extra pats around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also after cleansing in the morning, this product goes on first</li>
            <li> This is all I need and cheek and lip stain for Hawaii&#x27;s summer hot and humid months.</li>
            <li> This is not the first time I&#x27;ve been burned by listening to reviews.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> it is good for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Feels good on the skin, not too heavy.</li>
            <li> My breakouts went away on their own - without use of other products.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so smooth and soft and it really nourishes my skin.</li>
            <li> Keeps me looking young and handsome ay 63 years old</li>
            <li> After reading the positive reviews about this product, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> i can proudly say i have finally found my secret to healthy skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;What&#x27;s ironic is that when I first started using the soap, I couldn&#x27;t justify the cost of this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping to have another baby and recent studies suggest that women who are pregnant, or trying to get pregnant, should avoid retinyl palmitate.  </li>
            <li> super soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> So many moisturizers claim to make your skin moist and dewy, but leave my face feeling quite dry.  </li>
            <li> This may work better for you if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I will buy it again, love it love it, I will recommend it especially to people with dry to normal skin.</li>
            <li> it was like putting pure Olive Oil on my skin....</li>
            <li> guess when there isn&#x27;t a known cure for a certain condition people will just buy stuff HOPPING that it will be</li>
            <li> My excessively dry eyebrows are nearly perfectly smooth now and the skin on my cheeks feels younger and more</li>
            <li> All natural and just great for my dry facial skin.</li>
            <li> But when I consider how much cream I had to scoop out of jars over the years, this is now an actually very inexpensive product with so much promise.  </li>
            <li> Nonetheless it is much cheaper than argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to really wipe my cell phone off after talking on the phone b/c</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s so much oil on my face coming through my make up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put too much on in my opinion.</li>
            <li> So I just gently brush the eyeliner under my eyes with my finger (not with a towel cause</li>
            <li> It was light enough to absorb in about 15 minutes, and makeup could be applied.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> much, but loves putting on this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> , however the body CREAM is very liquidy.  </li>
            <li> I was worried this product would be too oily, but it does soften and dries relatively fast..</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am 42 and have had combination skin that gets much oilier during the warmer months.  </li>
            <li> thanks me every day.  </li>
            <li> Started using this 9 days ago, twice a day, without seeing or feeling all that much of a difference in the texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I really like this oil</li>
            <li> My wish would be that it was available in a larger size.  </li>
            <li> and then my Dermalogical tinted primer with spf 40 (or Dr. Perricone No Concealer with spf 30 using very sparingly).  </li>
            <li> Nope, nope, and....not really.</li>
            <li> after all, this is almost straight olive oil....</li>
            <li> dont really know how it works but got it for my sister.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, moisture lasts.  </li>
            <li> It is simply an olive oil that has this wonderful fragrance of real olive oil, a perfume to which I&#x27;ve become addicted to.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a light-feeling oil, with a very light scent of lavender and citrus from other oils it contains.  </li>
            <li> It soaks right in and doesn&#x27;t leave my sensitive, combination skin with excess oil build up.</li>
            <li> First and foremost what i love about this product is that it&#x27;s natural, is not used in animal testing, and has a very low toxicity rate (according to ewg.org) with no cancer causing chemicals, unlike most of the common moisturizers out there.</li>
            <li> and it came all oily, the box was all oily so apparently it spilled and wasnt packaged right... already a bummer.</li>
            <li> but just put it on before bed with a slightly damp face and let it work its magic.</li>
            <li> I use mostly on my face; occasionally on the back of my hands and elbows.</li>
            <li> Next, I can use the remaining on my hair just on the top part where my hair separates so the tiny hairs don&#x27;t stick up in the air.</li>
            <li> Finally a product worthy of a letter and a review.  </li>
            <li> She Who Never Grows Older.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it&#x27;s a decent moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My skin just felt drier, older and less healthy.  </li>
            <li> live in a dry climate, and I put this moisturizer on right after I get out of the shower, its soaks right in with no greasiness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have shared bars of it with family and they speak highly of it as well..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more oily to touch.</li>
            <li> I am 45 and have very sensitive skin, not really prone to breakouts, however, it becomes irritated easily.</li>
            <li> I have to scrub my face every morning with a baby washcloth in order to properly clean the pores (if I don&#x27;t I will get acne) which of course makes my skin feel dry.  </li>
            <li> but of course it eventually is soaked in, and I&#x27;m not sure if she&#x27;s been able to determine how much the moisturizing lasts after the feeling of the liquid goes away.</li>
            <li> My facialist told me to apply some olive oil to freshly washed facial skin in the shower to combat winter dryness.</li>
            <li> , one of them was nice and tight, the 2nd bottle had a leak and the box package was 50% soaked in oil.</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t say how it&#x27;s working for my fine lines as it&#x27;s only been a short</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> will keep using it daily, and see if it is as effective in a few weeks as it seems to be now.</li>
            <li> I decided to keep it and try it out, as I hadn&#x27;t found a decent alternative, but it&#x27;s just far too oily for my combination skin.</li>
            <li> I got this for my partner who has super dry skin on her face and who works outdoors.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin with some breakouts.</li>
            <li> i try  the oil to flake noticed the red lines and fonts have their place White Light</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product to someone who would like to put something natural on their skin.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it as a natural alternative to day creams.</li>
            <li> In general my skin looks more dewy and less crepey.  </li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim after reading its reviews with an amazon gift card I received for xmas and WOW!</li>
            <li> have extremely sensitive skin, as well as eczema, and I&#x27;ve had no negative reaction to this product.  </li>
            <li> This item was almost the exact same thing  but cheaper!  </li>
            <li> At night, after cleansing this is the first thing that goes on my face and neck and lastly pat around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> My skin was glowing the next morning after using it at night the first time.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve had it a few months and use it twice daily) and thought I&#x27;d share my review since I love this stuff so much.  </li>
            <li> I am a person with sensitive skin, that gets super oily during the day and uncomfortably dry when cleaned.</li>
            <li> As an added bonus, my makeup foundation just glides right on with this stuff, although be careful with eye shadow as it might interfere with adhesion if it hasn&#x27;t absorbed enough yet.</li>
            <li> it goes on well and is not thick by any measure, especially when you take a minute to massage is gently on your face as the instructions tell you to.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed, it felt lovely on the skin and has a nice scent but this product made me break out on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I put it on my damp skin after washing my face at night and have been happier with the results than when I was using other night special potion face lotions.</li>
            <li> The scent is a little bit strong for sensitive people, also.</li>
            <li> I liked the smell, and now that the product is empty, I washed and reused the bottle for blends of other oils!</li>
            <li> 36 YO female, have moisturized my whole life, live in freezing winter climate.</li>
            <li> This is definitely crucial, otherwise no matter the cause of the age spot, it WILL get bigger if your skin does not have adequate protection from the sun.</li>
            <li> I just know that when my skin is dry, the dryness disappears right after I use this.  </li>
            <li> My skin used to get dry, especially my cheeks and especially in winter, but this oil works magic.</li>
            <li> , I found out is a very good product, nice moisturizer, it doesn&#x27;t seat on your skin, it absorbs quick enough, and blends so good with any sunscreen I have used with it, contrary with any others moisturizers I&#x27;ve been used on the past, which they will come out in small rolls when I rub the sunscreen on top of it leaving a horrible mess all over my face is just a nightmare especially on morning time when the time is so limited.</li>
            <li> In just a little while my skin was soft and smooth like a babies bottom.  </li>
            <li> I choose this product because I wanted to try something natural on my skin.</li>
            <li> I prefer natural or mostly natural health care products and this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> Olivella has helped to nearly eliminate my rosacea.</li>
            <li> My skin is so sensitive that aloe vera stings.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I have very acne-prone skin, but this has actually reduced my breakouts.</li>
            <li> And what makes this product convenient is, because it&#x27;s oil-based, it naturally becomes a make-up remover without the chemicals.</li>
            <li> Instead, will feel soft and un-oily  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of olive oil products but the virgin oil moisturizer is by far, a must-have.</li>
            <li> Granted, I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have always had acne prone and sensitive skin (been on Accutane twice)</li>
            <li> AND SHE&#x27;S 82 YRS OLD.  </li>
            <li> Having to keep it away from the eye area has made this product completely unusable on any of my face.</li>
            <li> It makes the skin immediately soft and supple.</li>
            <li> skin does feel soft all day.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much at all but a moist face just isn&#x27;t enough.  </li>
            <li> I have turned my 90 year old mother and 81 year old aunt on to oil.</li>
            <li> The outer layers of skin seemed moist from my regular moisturizer with sunscreen, but my deeper layers of skin really missed the Olivella.  </li>
            <li> I like to use natural things that work.  </li>
            <li> It could be my skin is too sensitive</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft, and not greasy because I have oily skin.  </li>
            <li> It leaves the skin so soft and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> All natural too.</li>
            <li> I am 60 years old and was needing something to help with the aging process.</li>
            <li> Soothing and makes my skin as soft as it should be.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin well hydrated and does not have all the harsh chemicals that most products have-back to basic nature&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> I put it on my face every night after I clean it and give my skin a little massage.</li>
            <li> I agree with other users to have a moist skin for the olive oil to be absorbed by your skin and not have an oily glow on it.</li>
            <li> i just hope the seller does not mess up again.</li>
            <li> I love putting it on after I shower or exfoliate because where my skin would feel uncomfortably tight and dry and sometimes flaky before, this takes care of all that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I was just here ordering my second bottle because my first is running low</li>
            <li> you live in a dry or desert climate, I highly recommend using this stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use on weekends or on days when I do not feel like following my normal skincare regime.  </li>
            <li> You mind think it is oily, but you don&#x27;t put a lot, just a little bit on your fingers and massage it onto your face, and your face will absorb it quickly and won&#x27;t leave your face oily.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried at first that the oil would react poorly, but I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I had no idea using it when my face was still a little moist would really help with the absorption that much</li>
            <li> This is the only cosmetic I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> After reading all the great reviews about this product, I was surprised at how badly it irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li> It is very helpful in a dry climate like Colorado.  </li>
            <li> I have dry to combination skin and was worried about slathering straight oil on my face -</li>
            <li> Really the only issue I had was the pump on the container broke leaving about 1/3 bottle left.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and obviously it works for some, just not for me.  </li>
            <li> No fine lines around mine and my lipstick proves it - no more creeping into fine lines around my lips.  </li>
            <li> There are three major factors that work together  to help treat, eliminate and hide the brown spot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it with my face dripping wet, as recommended by one reviewer, but it seems to absorb better when my skin is wet, but not quite so sopping wet.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a natural moisturizer, which this is (from what I can tell), but this is actually oil, not a lotion as it appears in the product photo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;2)Citric Acid is a key all natural bleaching ingredient.</li>
            <li> I like it, and it is not oily on my sensitive facial skin.</li>
            <li> Olivella All Natural Virgin Olive Oil Moisturizer From Italy (50ml) 1.69 Fluid Ounces]].  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this for a solid month and am completely indifferent to it.  </li>
            <li> I also apply it to my neck and have noticed the loose looking wrinkles that come with getting older have vanished.</li>
            <li> First I have to reveal I am in my late 50&#x27;s &amp; have tried many products some cheap some very expensive &amp; have learned price doesn&#x27;t always guarantee results.  </li>
            <li> I searched Amazon high and low for a moisturizer without toxic ingredients, and since so many manufacturers don&#x27;t include ingredients on their product descriptions I was unable to make an educated decision.  </li>
            <li> I found after switching to organic or natural facial products my skin is so much healthier and less prone to redness and breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Olivella All Natural Virgin Olive Oil Moisturizer from Italy is the only way to keep skin supple - especially after a day in the sun!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several natural oils before and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t enlarge my pores and doesn&#x27;t make my T-area too oily.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the major ingredients that make it work (that actually back up the research I did: Olea Europea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Squalene, Citris Aurantium, Dulcis (Orange), Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lavadula Angustifiola</li>
            <li> It seemed far too much for such a little bit.  </li>
            <li> I have to make myself use my normal skincare, and only because I just opened new bottles and cannot see letting them go to waste.</li>
            <li> After three days, the rough dry areas were back to normal color and by the end of the week, all symptoms were completely gone.</li>
            <li> I have been using this olive oil moisturizer for at least a year now, and I don&#x27;t want to buy any other moisturizer to replace it because my skin is very sensitive and most of other brands I can&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> and I could really use just a little tiny pump, but I stop at 2.</li>
            <li> It definitely makes my skin my soft, helps lighten up my dark circles under my eyes &amp; helps reduces wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> , this bottle will last me a long time, I&#x27;m sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> though I have extremely sensitive skin, the slight fragrance in this product does not bother me.</li>
            <li> I suffer from dry patches on my face sometimes and after two days of this, they&#x27;re totally gone.</li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes is dry and sagging a bit, and I have an occasional break out in my t-zone.  </li>
            <li> I have spent so much on name brand products which were a waste.</li>
            <li> No oil left on my dry face!</li>
            <li> A note for anyone else who has sensitive skin like mine, try replacing your facial wash with raw, unfiltered honey, then applying Olivella after rinsing.</li>
            <li> A little background on my skin:  I am in my early 50&#x27;s and have combination skin.</li>
            <li> The main ingredient is extra virgin olive oil and it also contains squalene, a natural oil produced by the human skin that hydrates and contains antioxidants to help with repair and aging, which sadly, means all skin types after the age of 30.</li>
            <li> a long time if used in moderation</li>
            <li> had it for so long</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even remember how long its been.</li>
            <li> One short pump and those few drops glide over my entire face, my ears AND the front and back of my neck.  </li>
            <li> I also use it before a long bike ride to ease wind burn.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The bottle is extremely slow but a little goes a SUPER long way!</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t that make me break out or clog my pores or make me strangely shiny?!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most expensive olive oil per ounce with a little scent you&#x27;ll ever buy.</li>
            <li> A bottle lasts a very long time for me</li>
            <li> Itchy, dry, raised, rashes ALL over my body.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still damp, it gets rid of that dry, taut feeling.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be extremely dry after I wash my face and then overcompensates and becomes oily in the T zone.</li>
            <li> , i have no idea why some people think it is too much fragrance, the smell is subtle and almost citrus like.</li>
            <li> My skin is so dry in winter</li>
            <li> It was still DRY..</li>
            <li> so i try to focus on the dry areas while using benzoyl peroxide on any areas that seem they are about to break out.</li>
            <li> My chin and check/nose areas are really dry, but my forehead is oily.</li>
            <li> I even live in Texas where it&#x27;s always crazy hot</li>
            <li> and I will continue using it every single day.....</li>
            <li> my skin hasn&#x27;t seen a single breakout...</li>
            <li> Usually I apply at night so in the morning my skin is soft</li>
            <li> and I normally never break out.</li>
            <li> My husband has very dry skin.</li>
            <li> It seems to just evaporate off the surface and leaves my skin looking very dry in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have an oily skin with a bit of very dry area in my face, so I put this product in the dry-zone.</li>
            <li> If I know I&#x27;ll be working late into the night, I&#x27;ll apply it in the early evening and allow it to work overtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 1 pump barely gets me past my cheeks , so two gets up to my forehead</li>
            <li> I was afraid this product might make the situation worse and possibly cause breakouts, but I&#x27;m thrilled to say I&#x27;ve had NO adverse effects.</li>
            <li> This is a much needed elixir for my tired skin.  </li>
            <li> I leave my face dripping wet.  </li>
            <li> (BTW, I&#x27;ve been applying it to my wet face immediately after showering in the morning or washing up at night, and after it air dries, I apply my day or night cream over it.)</li>
            <li> Just use 1-2drops on wet hands and apply to neck and face.</li>
            <li> skin while it is wet, so that the oil soaks in when your skin dries.  </li>
            <li> I cleanse my face and while it is still a little damp apply a small amount of the oil prior to applying any other facial products.</li>
            <li> thats bad for your eyes) and wipe my finger on a napkin (If I need more oil, I just use a bit of the remaining half of the droplet).   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helpful for other parts of the anatomy also.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try that at first b/c water and oil</li>
            <li> This product is a godsend, just like other reviewers suggested I put it on while my face</li>
            <li> and I tried all the other product..</li>
            <li> Just one small squirt is sufficient for your enitre face, and is terrific after I shave.  </li>
            <li> product just didn&#x27;t excite me the way it seems to excite other people.</li>
            <li> I suspect I paid an awful lot of money for what appears to be plain old olive oil, but I must admit it is very moisturizing and one tiny pump dispenses enough oil to cover your entire face and neck.</li>
            <li> Lasts a very long time, a few drops do the job.</li>
            <li> and for days when my face is especially dry.</li>
            <li> and it is nature, I used it on face everyday ,and it is neither oily or dry, I recommend it !</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it makes my face so moist that when I have my cell phone up to my cheek</li>
            <li> but i had remembered reading somewhere how since the it can actually help normalize your skin that breakouts are sometimes a common thing in the beginning</li>
            <li> Not exactly 100% virgin olive oil!  </li>
            <li> Listen to me ~ if you believe none of the other reviews I am here to tell you this product is a miracle!  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find any directions or ingredients (in English) on the bottle/packaging itself, so I turned to reviewers on Amazon who said to apply this moisturizer - although it is comparable to a serum - while your face is wet, or damp at the very least.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews of previous customers and decided to buy it.</li>
            <li> Like half of the droplet goes on my slightly dampened skin.</li>
            <li> Slight citrus scent.</li>
            <li> Lid was half unscrewed.  </li>
            <li> (pregnancy hormones, pigmentation problems due to a pimple, exposure to sun, and just plain age).</li>
            <li> no longer use an eye cream, no special neck cream at all - all I need is Olivella and my skin</li>
            <li> The pump is a bit hard to depress</li>
            <li> My estetician told me about  using a little olive oil in my moisturizer at night</li>
            <li> I use this every night, after a shower, but I use veerrry little.</li>
            <li> if it feels a little greasy</li>
            <li> Only a bit over a quarter of the moisturizer was in fact left in the bottle, which greatly angered me as it is a thoughtless mistake on the seller to not pack the product well to prevent such a thing from happening.</li>
            <li> Not greasy &amp; rejuvenates ski that needs that little something beyond an emollient .</li>
            <li> not sure if it is due to this product</li>
            <li> A friend noticed the difference in my skin within a few days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it a few days now ..</li>
            <li> Just massage it in as your face air dries and the moisture left behind is heavenly.  </li>
            <li> This prevents pulling on my skin and keeps the product from going on too heavily.  </li>
            <li> I actually found that skin looks worse.  </li>
            <li> Caused all kinds of skin irritation after few uses.</li>
            <li> Softens without being greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past week, and imagine my surprise when I glanced at the ingredients list to see what they had used to scent the oil (because it doesn&#x27;t smell like olive oil) and found, among other things, retinyl palmitate!  </li>
            <li> sometimes suffer from rosacea, especially during the cold months when our house is dry and</li>
            <li> Use very little)  -if used in moderation, doesn&#x27;t look like you have oily skin  </li>
            <li> but what happened instead was I put a small amount over my face, and neck, and</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the hullabaloo is over this product.  </li>
            <li> I am 42yrs old and I have used very expensive products in the past.</li>
            <li> and it does not have all the weird ingredients too long to type out or pronounce or any petroleum products.</li>
            <li> Do try it and again, do not apply to merely moist or dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Is long lasting, but pump is a bit annoying.</li>
            <li> have been using it since winter and have hardly used 10% of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It is so oily it is hard to keep on your face.</li>
            <li> This has been my little skincare secret for 2 years.</li>
            <li> Ever since I can remember I&#x27;ve had problematic skin, bad acne in my teens,now that I&#x27;m old (er)</li>
            <li> I have oily/combination skin still prone to breakouts even though I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> ..goes on nicely, no oily residue, skin just soaks it up and loves it.</li>
            <li> was running late this morning</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have even had a tiny pimple, it&#x27;s crazy.  </li>
            <li> it boils down to this, even if i am still angry at the seller i will order again because the product is awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before expensive and sometimes dangerous medical routines to remove brown spots, try this!</li>
            <li> my hair kept getting stuck on my face because it was soooo thick!  </li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m lathering tons of oil on my face needlessly.</li>
            <li> I have used olive oil moisturizers before during the winter months, but the brand I used was expensive.</li>
            <li> There is just nothing wrong with this stuff.</li>
            <li> The lotions she was using just weren&#x27;t cutting it.</li>
            <li> Even my manicurist is shocked over how I no longer have raggedy cuticles that I&#x27;ve suffered since forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Olive oil face moisterizer has been one of my favorites for quite some time. It&#x27;s helpful for other parts of the anatomy also.</li>
            <li> I choose this product because I wanted to try something natural on my skin. I read the reviews of previous customers and decided to buy it. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase. My sister had gifted me Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan Oil which I loved. it. I find Argan Oil one notch above this product that&#x27;s why I gave it 4 stars. It&#x27;s a little more oily to touch. Nonetheless it is much cheaper than argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it since winter and have hardly used 10% of the bottle. I use mostly on my face; occasionally on the back of my hands and elbows. I agree with other users to have a moist skin for the olive oil to be absorbed by your skin and not have an oily glow on it. This product works good for the entire day and even after one splash of water on my face in the middle of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the light citrus smell to be acceptable and it goes away in 1-2 hours after applying the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to someone who would like to put something natural on their skin.</li>
            <li> You guys! I bought this on a whim after reading its reviews with an amazon gift card I received for xmas and WOW! I swear, my face has never been in such good shape! I&#x27;m 19 and have mild acne so I was worried it would break me out but not at all, it really does its job as a great moisturizer. Very soothing and not oily or greasy at all - I am totally not a fan of shine and wouldn&#x27;t use this or recommend it if I wasn&#x27;t very happy! 5 for Olivella! You go Olivella!</li>
            <li> I prefer natural or mostly natural health care products and this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint. The ingredients are simple but effective. As other reviewers have noted, it seems to work best when your skin is warm and moist, immediately after washing your face or jumping out of the shower. It soaks right in and doesn&#x27;t leave my sensitive, combination skin with excess oil build up. I use up any leftover oil on my decollete and hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes suffer from rosacea, especially during the cold months when our house is dry and if I eat any sugar during that time it stresses my skin enough that I end up with rosacea. Olivella has helped to nearly eliminate my rosacea. My excessively dry eyebrows are nearly perfectly smooth now and the skin on my cheeks feels younger and more supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I have extremely sensitive skin, the slight fragrance in this product does not bother me. The main ingredient is extra virgin olive oil and it also contains squalene, a natural oil produced by the human skin that hydrates and contains antioxidants to help with repair and aging, which sadly, means all skin types after the age of 30. I recognize that everyone&#x27;s body is different, but I think this is a wonderful product. It has saved me heaps of money on the organic skin care products I was using before. A note for anyone else who has sensitive skin like mine, try replacing your facial wash with raw, unfiltered honey, then applying Olivella after rinsing.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY moisturizer I&#x27;ve EVER used that has NOT irritated my face. My skin is so sensitive that aloe vera stings. Somehow, Olivella causes me no discomfort whatsoever. Additionally, I have very acne-prone skin, but this has actually reduced my breakouts. If you&#x27;ve tried countless moisturizers to no avail, please try one more. This is a miracle for me.</li>
            <li> I really like the way my skin feels using this product! It doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily, my skin just absorbs it all. I will buy this product again!</li>
            <li> This product is great for your skin.  I have used it for years.  It smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have just recently starting using this and honestly could tell a difference with the first time. My skin had a glow that I have not noticed for some time. I am 45 and have very sensitive skin, not really prone to breakouts, however, it becomes irritated easily. I have experienced nothing but radiant, happy skin! I too have used on my cuticles and hair (the ends) which has proven to be a benefit. I just purchased the cleansing bar and am hoping to be as happy with it as others seem to be. I was wanting to ask if anyone uses this night AND morning? If not, what products, if any, do you use in the morning? Would appreciate anyone&#x27;s input! This moisturizer is truly heaven sent!</li>
            <li> I have the driest Irish skin in some places and oily in others. I am also sensitive to many ingredients so finding something natural was appealing. My estetician told me about  using a little olive oil in my moisturizer at night and then I found this. I also use Retin-A and this is a great compliment to the dryness caused by Retin-A. If you haven&#x27;t found a true moisturizer that feels like your skin is getting moisturized, try this. And it&#x27;s not $100 a bottle!!!</li>
            <li> I really love this moisturizer. It makes my skin so smooth and soft and it really nourishes my skin. My only complaint is that it makes my face so moist that when I have my cell phone up to my cheek or I touch my cheek my make up comes off with oil all over it. I have to really wipe my cell phone off after talking on the phone b/c there&#x27;s so much oil on my face coming through my make up. I don&#x27;t put too much on in my opinion. I use 2 pumps . 1 pump barely gets me past my cheeks , so two gets up to my forehead and I could really use just a little tiny pump, but I stop at 2. So I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m lathering tons of oil on my face needlessly. Besides that, I love this moisturizer and will never use another moisturizer if I can help it. Buy this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I just decided today to try putting this on right after my shower like it had suggested. I was skeptical to try that at first b/c water and oil don&#x27;t mix. I guess I was nervous some type of separation would happen with the oil on my face! lol. But I tried it immediately after getting out of the shower today with only one pump instead of two and WHAT A DIFFERENCE that made. I had no idea using it when my face was still a little moist would really help with the absorption that much and it doesn&#x27;t feel like my face is covered in oil anymore. It was a good moisturizer before, but now using it the way it was recommended ( my fault for not doing so sooner! ) I completely understand why they tell you to do it that way and recommend it even more!</li>
            <li> I use this on my face, neck, and hands daily. I love that it&#x27;s natural and I love the results. I&#x27;m 44. You can&#x27;t tell!</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE this moisterizer! I have oily/combination skin still prone to breakouts even though I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s. This product makes my skin feel moisterized &amp; dewy with out feeling oily. My breakouts went away on their own - without use of other products. I also haven&#x27;t had any further breakouts since I started using it. I put it on every night before bed and my skin has never been softer. I also apply it to my neck and have noticed the loose looking wrinkles that come with getting older have vanished. I would recommend this product to everyone. It is a miracle in a bottle!</li>
            <li> I am a person with sensitive skin, that gets super oily during the day and uncomfortably dry when cleaned. When I use regular cream moisturizer, it irritates my skin making it itchy sometimes. However, when I use Olivella, my skin feels a lot better, I want to say it soothes my skin, but not to that extent. I just know that when my skin is dry, the dryness disappears right after I use this.  I use this every night, after a shower, but I use veerrry little. Like half of the droplet goes on my slightly dampened skin. And what makes this product convenient is, because it&#x27;s oil-based, it naturally becomes a make-up remover without the chemicals. So I just gently brush the eyeliner under my eyes with my finger (not with a towel cause thats bad for your eyes) and wipe my finger on a napkin (If I need more oil, I just use a bit of the remaining half of the droplet).   Next, I can use the remaining on my hair just on the top part where my hair separates so the tiny hairs don&#x27;t stick up in the air. It adds a bit of shine to my hair as well.   Lastly, I rub it in my hands, and i&#x27;m all ready for bed :D  In conclusion  -its great instant relief for my oily clean that gets really dry when cleaned  -don&#x27;t cause acne for my skin type  -can be used as a make-remover while moisturizing my face  -relaxing smell  -adds shine and smoothens up my hair(but dont use it on strands of hair or it&#x27;ll make u look like you haven&#x27;t washed ur hair in days. Use very little)  -if used in moderation, doesn&#x27;t look like you have oily skin  -If done after a shower with damp face and wake up in morning, will not look oily at all. Instead, will feel soft and un-oily  -Last a long time if used in moderation (I just use one-two drops a day) had it for so long I don&#x27;t even remember how long its been. (maybe 4-5months?)</li>
            <li> Lasts a very long time, a few drops do the job.</li>
            <li> After reading the positive reviews about this product, I decided to give it a try. I like the fact that it&#x27;s all natural and it&#x27;s not tested on animal. However, when I put it on my face, I felt burning sensation on my cheeks and my skin turned red. Now I use Aveeno moisturizer and my skin feels much better.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes your skin look radiant and elastic. It absorbs quickly, and makeup will apply smoothly after. The smell is nice &amp; natural (orange essence).&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using it daily, and see if it is as effective in a few weeks as it seems to be now.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, moisturizes well, not oily on face (even though it&#x27;s oil!). Surprised and happy that I can find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use on weekends or on days when I do not feel like following my normal skincare regime.  I find myself reaching for this product more often than not.  I have to make myself use my normal skincare, and only because I just opened new bottles and cannot see letting them go to waste.</li>
            <li> I had a severe allergic reaction to laundry detergent. Itchy, dry, raised, rashes ALL over my body. When I realized It was the detergent, I stopped it immediately and although the symptoms subsided, after a week, I still had severely irritated patches of skin in my bra and panty areas. Because I cannot take Antihistamines, everything I tried had to be topical and NOTHING helped. After three weeks of torture, and no logic to support why Olivella would work when the prescribed creams didn&#x27;t,I gave it a try. WELL, after just one day the itching was gone. After three days, the rough dry areas were back to normal color and by the end of the week, all symptoms were completely gone. I&#x27;ve used a lot of olive oil products but the virgin oil moisturizer is by far, a must-have.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed, it felt lovely on the skin and has a nice scent but this product made me break out on my face and neck. Granted, I have sensitive skin - so take that with a grain of salt.</li>
            <li> This product is great! Great moisturizer! Leaves my skin feeling great. Have you noticed the key word? NON greasy feeling. It has a very light, hint of lemon smell.</li>
            <li> Love the extra hydration; use at night.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!  I have always had acne prone and sensitive skin (been on Accutane twice) and Olivella works great for me.  I found after switching to organic or natural facial products my skin is so much healthier and less prone to redness and breakouts.  I was a little worried at first that the oil would react poorly, but I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This product is really good and the results are visible.  However, since my last purchase, they decided to change the bottle design which can leak from the neck; though not severe.  I ordered 2 bottles, one of them was nice and tight, the 2nd bottle had a leak and the box package was 50% soaked in oil.</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt better!  Use this along with the soap and your skin will look fabulous!</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S GREAT!  A FRIEND OF MINE INTRODUCED ME TO THIS PRODUCT BY GIVING ME MY FIRST BOTTLE.  I&#x27;D ADMIRED HER SMOOTH SKIN AND SHE&#x27;S 82 YRS OLD.  I AM NOW ON MY SECOND BOTTLE AND HAVE HOPE THAT IT MAY DO THE SAME FOR ME.  TIME WILL TELL.</li>
            <li> great product. . .I&#x27;m used to paying three times this price for the same type of product.</li>
            <li> HI,  This is a wonderful product.  It is very helpful in a dry climate like Colorado.  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> First I have to reveal I am in my late 50&#x27;s &amp; have tried many products some cheap some very expensive &amp; have learned price doesn&#x27;t always guarantee results.  Ever since I can remember I&#x27;ve had problematic skin, bad acne in my teens,now that I&#x27;m old (er) my skin is still acne prone,. I have to scrub my face every morning with a baby washcloth in order to properly clean the pores (if I don&#x27;t I will get acne) which of course makes my skin feel dry.  This product is a godsend, just like other reviewers suggested I put it on while my face it&#x27;s still damp, it gets rid of that dry, taut feeling. I use 2 to 3 pumps &amp; slather it all over my face &amp; neck which feels heavenly, wait about 15 min till it absorbs sometimes I overdo it &amp; if it feels a little greasy I just buff with a make-up sponge.  I just ordered a 2nd bottle since I&#x27;m running low &amp; I just can&#x27;t be without this. No product works well on everyone but if it works on my problematic skin I think it will work well on most people, you can adjust how how much you use according to your skin.</li>
            <li> I liked this product. It was light enough to absorb in about 15 minutes, and makeup could be applied. I liked the smell, and now that the product is empty, I washed and reused the bottle for blends of other oils! Even the pakaging was useful!</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  I have recommended this product to my friends Who have tried and loved it.</li>
            <li> I love Olivella !!!  I have been using their products for a while now, and I could not be happier.. When it comes to my skin, I like to use all natural products.. and having all of the anti-aging properties of olive oil for such a low price seems a very good deal!  5 stars !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Olivella oil for almost a month and I absolutely love it! My skin tends to be extremely dry after I wash my face and then overcompensates and becomes oily in the T zone. I was afraid this product might make the situation worse and possibly cause breakouts, but I&#x27;m thrilled to say I&#x27;ve had NO adverse effects. I cleanse my face and while it is still a little damp apply a small amount of the oil prior to applying any other facial products. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this product back in the summer and when this bottle runs out I will order it again. I am 42yrs old and I have used very expensive products in the past. I am going to stick with this now.</li>
            <li> I searched Amazon high and low for a moisturizer without toxic ingredients, and since so many manufacturers don&#x27;t include ingredients on their product descriptions I was unable to make an educated decision.  I am hoping to have another baby and recent studies suggest that women who are pregnant, or trying to get pregnant, should avoid retinyl palmitate.  I went with Olivella because the bottle said 100% Virgin Olive Oil.  I have been using it for the past week, and imagine my surprise when I glanced at the ingredients list to see what they had used to scent the oil (because it doesn&#x27;t smell like olive oil) and found, among other things, retinyl palmitate!  Not exactly 100% virgin olive oil!  While there might be a small amount of vitamin A in olive oil, it seems that they have added more (as well as citrus oil, and a number of flower oils that provide its pleasant fragrance).  I am sorely disappointed!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this and received so quickly</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find any directions or ingredients (in English) on the bottle/packaging itself, so I turned to reviewers on Amazon who said to apply this moisturizer - although it is comparable to a serum - while your face is wet, or damp at the very least. Well, I did, and I&#x27;m glad I invested in this product; I plan on using the entire Olivella skincare line...I&#x27;m sold. One other thing for those looking to purchase the face &amp; body wash, it&#x27;s a great product, just don&#x27;t get it near your eyes! Maybe it was just me, but I assumed since the product was a majority olive oil that I could use it in the shower to help remove my eye makeup...ouch. Sting.</li>
            <li> I initially wrote a one star review for this because the item was received open and the contents were spilled all over the box. Only a bit over a quarter of the moisturizer was in fact left in the bottle, which greatly angered me as it is a thoughtless mistake on the seller to not pack the product well to prevent such a thing from happening. I was however tempted to try the product despite all because of the great reviews and the fact that i have been looking for an olive oil based moisturizer. it boils down to this, even if i am still angry at the seller i will order again because the product is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;the moisturizer smells great, i have no idea why some people think it is too much fragrance, the smell is subtle and almost citrus like. it goes on well and is not thick by any measure, especially when you take a minute to massage is gently on your face as the instructions tell you to. Also make sure your face is wet, seems to help more with the absorption. i love how my face feels when i wake up in the morning. super soft and moisturized. the design of the bottle is nice too because the pump ensures you only take out as much as you need. so yes i would recommend this product. i just hope the seller does not mess up again.</li>
            <li> My husband has very dry skin. This Olivella Olive oil is great it is the first thing that is working for him.</li>
            <li> I wanted a natural moisturizer, which this is (from what I can tell), but this is actually oil, not a lotion as it appears in the product photo. I decided to keep it and try it out, as I hadn&#x27;t found a decent alternative, but it&#x27;s just far too oily for my combination skin. I tried just using it around my eyes, but if the slightest bit of this got into my eye, there seemed to actually be a cloud over my vision for the rest of the night. Having to keep it away from the eye area has made this product completely unusable on any of my face. Also the dispenser sticks, so you can&#x27;t control the amount of oil that comes out with each use. Every time I used it it would run out all over my fingers. I honestly can&#x27;t tell a difference between this and decent olive oil, so I&#x27;d suggest going for the latter if you&#x27;re looking for that sort of thing. Now I&#x27;m using Oil of Olay Hydrating Fluid.</li>
            <li> Unless you have the dryest of all dryest skin types...dont go for this!  im sure its good for those with dry/flaky skin..but even then...you can only dab a bit of this.  I have combination skin..but bought it as an overnight moisturizer..since it is known to be a great anti-oxidant....but what happened instead was I put a small amount over my face, and neck, and my hair kept getting stuck on my face because it was soooo thick!  it was like putting pure Olive Oil on my skin....really thats all it really is!!  Again...I wont knock it for those who have ultry-dry skin...but wearing an itty-bitty amount is good.  Or..you can just buy olive oil and do it yourself ;)</li>
            <li> There are many reasons why you get brown spots on your skin (pregnancy hormones, pigmentation problems due to a pimple, exposure to sun, and just plain age). I did some research and found that there are three HUGE solutions that, combined together can stop the spot from getting darker, and start to heal it. There are three major factors that work together  to help treat, eliminate and hide the brown spot. Here&#x27;s what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)ALWAYS WEAR SUNSCREEN! This is definitely crucial, otherwise no matter the cause of the age spot, it WILL get bigger if your skin does not have adequate protection from the sun. I wear Oil of Olay Daily Moisture Lotion w/SPF on top of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)Citric Acid is a key all natural bleaching ingredient. This coming from fruits such as oranges and lemons, lemons having the highest amount of citric acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)Olive Oil! Yes the same thing that works on hands to soften them also works good for brown spots. The Vitamin E in the Olive Oil moisturizes your skin, and stimulates the cells in your skin to regenerate. This is especially good in its most raw form because in order to remove the dark spot, you have to treat through 21 layers of skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Athough this product does not include buttermilk, I still apply buttermilk twice a week to the spot (and my face) twice a week in addition to this product. Get ready to plug your nose because it works best if it&#x27;s spoiled! I put mine in a pump bottle that dispenses nail polish remover. I use a cotton swab, dab a couple times then wipe off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one brown spot (and there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m posting a pic of it). I noticed it after a pimple healed. But I was also in my first trimester of pregnancy. So hormonal or because of the pimple or both? Not sure. But, from the first week I started using this product it worked immediately!! The bottle is extremely slow but a little goes a SUPER long way! I only use a tiny bit each night and under makeup. Make sure to massage it in well. After all, it is an oil!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is truly an INCREDIBLE product!!! A+++! Here&#x27;s the major ingredients that make it work (that actually back up the research I did: Olea Europea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Squalene, Citris Aurantium, Dulcis (Orange), Retinyl Palmitate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Lavadula Angustifiola (Lavender) Oil, Cananga Odorata Flower Oil. **THIS IS THE INGREDIENT LIST IN IT&#x27;S EXACT ORDER.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before expensive and sometimes dangerous medical routines to remove brown spots, try this! I love it and I will continue using it every single day.....You WON&#x27;T regret it!</li>
            <li> I got this for my partner who has super dry skin on her face and who works outdoors. The lotions she was using just weren&#x27;t cutting it. She has been using this since Christmas and says it works well and keeps her face moisturized when it&#x27;s on there... but of course it eventually is soaked in, and I&#x27;m not sure if she&#x27;s been able to determine how much the moisturizing lasts after the feeling of the liquid goes away. Overall though, seems like a great product.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  It is very effective.  So many moisturizers claim to make your skin moist and dewy, but leave my face feeling quite dry.  This product is excellent!  It moisturizes extremey well and makes my skin look dewy!  I would definitaly order again.</li>
            <li> I use this each night before bedtime with good results.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  It is simply an olive oil that has this wonderful fragrance of real olive oil, a perfume to which I&#x27;ve become addicted to.  The oil goes on smoothly, it is heavier than a serum but smooths your skin in weeks.  I don&#x27;t know if it will fare well for wrinkles, but the texture and complection of my skin has indeed improved.  This is a much needed elixir for my tired skin.  I would highly recommend it as a natural alternative to day creams.</li>
            <li> I got this for myself and my daughter.  We both love it.  It has a nice feel to it.  My daughter doesn&#x27;t wear makeup, etc. much, but loves putting on this moisturizer.  It is a definite BUY!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful skin moisturizer and seems to work away wrinkles and crepe-y skin around my neck and cleavage.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect since I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever tried using an olive oil moisturizer, but I was delighted by the results. It makes the skin immediately soft and supple. I&#x27;ve also  noticed a better complexion since I&#x27;ve started using it. I would likely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I was comparing this to the olive oil by DHC and I like this a lot better. The company even sent me a sample packet so I could try it out first. I like that this one has squalene and a mild scent to it. I have oily skin so this is too oily for me to use during the day but its great at night. I&#x27;ve used it after doing an at-home light peel with 10% salicylic acid and much to my surprise I woke up with no chapped skin. It didn&#x27;t burn or irritate my skin at all afterwards, whereas most face creams would. I will continue to use for this purpose (post peel face protector) and for days when my face is especially dry.</li>
            <li> My skin is so dry in winter and I tried all the other product..It was still DRY.. when I first used this product last year, I just fell in love with it.. It made my skin moistured and radiant.Since then, .I order it now every winter!</li>
            <li> Obviously, I wouldn&#x27;t consider using this product for cooking..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..goes on nicely, no oily residue, skin just soaks it up and loves it.</li>
            <li> First and foremost what i love about this product is that it&#x27;s natural, is not used in animal testing, and has a very low toxicity rate (according to ewg.org) with no cancer causing chemicals, unlike most of the common moisturizers out there. All it takes is a few drops to cover the face and works best after a shower. The scent is moderately strong soap-type smell but will not stay with you for long, although some may not be pleased with it. It absorbs into the skin rather quickly so your face does not seem oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find Olivella is best used overnight because when i woke up i had a fresh young glow to my skin and was pleased with the results. Some should be advised that you may be allergic to the ingredients and do a test before hand. Even if you are not allergic, when i first used the product my skin did break out but i had remembered reading somewhere how since the it can actually help normalize your skin that breakouts are sometimes a common thing in the beginning so i continued to use it. I&#x27;m glad i did because it definitely proves it&#x27;s worth keeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have mix combo of oily/dry skin so i try to focus on the dry areas while using benzoyl peroxide on any areas that seem they are about to break out. I found this combination to work better than anything i have ever tried so now i can proudly say i have finally found my secret to healthy skin. Hopefully this may help others!</li>
            <li> My chin and check/nose areas are really dry, but my forehead is oily. I have used olive oil moisturizers before during the winter months, but the brand I used was expensive. I decided to try this one and it works just as well. I use it at night and my skin drinks it in. The dryness went away the next day.</li>
            <li> Excelent product! My skin gets smooth and healthy. Usually I apply at night so in the morning my skin is soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 62 years young and love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! Lightweight, not too greasy, absorbs well, great for my skin! And I have oily to combination skin that is still very easily prone to a breakout (in my 40&#x27;s). A bottle lasts a very long time for me and I just received my third bottle! Great price as well!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.  Apply regularly, before make-up, after cleansing and anytime I need a moisture boost.  Awesome product!</li>
            <li> Love this as a nighttime moisturizer.  Very nice, light scent and feels great going on.</li>
            <li> Very lightly scented oil that I&#x27;ve been using on my face at night and first thing in the morning.  A friend noticed the difference in my skin within a few days.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying the body cream and wrinkle cream as well.  I like both, however the body CREAM is very liquidy.  (not what I expected)&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive skin, as well as eczema, and I&#x27;ve had no negative reaction to this product.  I will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;My only problem would be the pump not working.  I have to unscrew the cap each time I need to use it.  A bit of an annoyance, however it doesn&#x27;t lose a STAR for that.</li>
            <li> I like the product a lot. I&#x27;ve been using it a few days now .. I have super dry skin with some breakouts. I was worried this product would be too oily, but it does soften and dries relatively fast.. I use it day and night now. My only gripe is the bottle/pump mechanism . The pump is a bit hard to depress which is why I knocked off a star.  This bottle will last &amp;#34;forever&amp;#34; I&#x27;m sure! I use about 2-3 pumps per application.&lt;br /&gt;My skin does feel soft all day.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and can be used from head to toe. Smells light and fresh. Is long lasting, but pump is a bit annoying.</li>
            <li> Who would think olive oil could be a moisturizer but it is and it does a great job. Those with oily skin incredibly can also use this because you only need a small amount and it is absorbed into your face quickly. Does not feel greasy and you wake up with a smooth face.</li>
            <li> Simply put, this is the reason my age is always mistaken.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend washing your face at night and then sleeping with this on your face.&lt;br /&gt;Not oily; your skin just drinks it.&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Listen to me ~ if you believe none of the other reviews I am here to tell you this product is a miracle!  I rarely write letters to companies but this one did it for me.  I had to let them know they&#x27;ve got the right stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 42 and have had combination skin that gets much oilier during the warmer months.  This product is one that I have used for two years now exclusively as my night oil and it has become a mainstay in my cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the trick, though.  After cleansing my face (I also use Olivella bar soap) I leave my face dripping wet.  One short pump and those few drops glide over my entire face, my ears AND the front and back of my neck.  It doesn&#x27;t take much at all but a moist face just isn&#x27;t enough.  Just massage it in as your face air dries and the moisture left behind is heavenly.  Not the slightest bit oily at all.  And don&#x27;t skip your lips.  No fine lines around mine and my lipstick proves it - no more creeping into fine lines around my lips.  They&#x27;re smooth now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a tendency to be a night owl so I often don&#x27;t wait until before bed to apply this wonderful elixir.  If I know I&#x27;ll be working late into the night, I&#x27;ll apply it in the early evening and allow it to work overtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s ironic is that when I first started using the soap, I couldn&#x27;t justify the cost of this moisturizer.  It seemed far too much for such a little bit.  But when I consider how much cream I had to scoop out of jars over the years, this is now an actually very inexpensive product with so much promise.  I assure you whatever your complexion, your skin will thank you for adding this to the regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I no longer use an eye cream, no special neck cream at all - all I need is Olivella and my skin thanks me every day.  Finally a product worthy of a letter and a review.  Do try it and again, do not apply to merely moist or dry skin.  Wetter is better and as an extra treat, when you&#x27;re done, rub the residue into your cuticles.  Even my manicurist is shocked over how I no longer have raggedy cuticles that I&#x27;ve suffered since forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miracle in a bottle for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get it at Harmon&#x27;s in my neighborhood for around $15 and change.how I no longer have raggedy cuticles that I&#x27;ve suffered since forever.      Miracle in a bottle for sure!    I get it at Harmon&#x27;s in my neighborhood for around $15 and change.</li>
            <li> It is simply the best</li>
            <li> It is so oily it is hard to keep on your face. It is just like the olive oil from the grocery store except is has a sweet perfume added to make it smell good.</li>
            <li> 36 YO female, have moisturized my whole life, live in freezing winter climate. The weather here has played hell on my face since I moved here, and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that can withstand the freezing temperatures, the dryness, and the wind. I also use it before a long bike ride to ease wind burn. It&#x27;s wonderful. It also, surprisingly, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores so I don&#x27;t get acne from using it. I&#x27;m pretty sure that it has helped repair the skin under my eyes as well. There is just nothing wrong with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been using this olive oil moisturizer for at least a year now, and I don&#x27;t want to buy any other moisturizer to replace it because my skin is very sensitive and most of other brands I can&#x27;t use. You mind think it is oily, but you don&#x27;t put a lot, just a little bit on your fingers and massage it onto your face, and your face will absorb it quickly and won&#x27;t leave your face oily.</li>
            <li> This not only smells amazing, but it absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft and nourished. Haven&#x27;t had any breakouts or reactions from it. Will buy this again for sure.</li>
            <li> Keeps me looking young and handsome ay 63 years old</li>
            <li> This olive oil moisturizer is great stuff! Have been using it for years and have no intention of not using it.  One of my friends calls me She Who Never Grows Older.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  I have turned my 90 year old mother and 81 year old aunt on to oil. The first time I used it I was thinking whoops&lt;br /&gt;it is going to be too greasy.  In just a little while my skin was soft and smooth like a babies bottom.  No oil left on my dry face! I will never run out of this product. I will purchase from this provider each time.  I appreciate receiving an email from them concerned about my satisfaction!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer works well for me even during winter in Arizona. I like it, and it is not oily on my sensitive facial skin. I will continuing using this product!</li>
            <li> Olive oil is indeed very good for you, whether taken internally or slathered on the skin.  The price for this brand of skin oil is better than that of DHC, but the citrusy fragrance and spout that spits out more than I need are definite minuses.  Otherwise it&#x27;s a decent moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Started using this 9 days ago, twice a day, without seeing or feeling all that much of a difference in the texture of my skin.  I&#x27;ve tried it with my face dripping wet, as recommended by one reviewer, but it seems to absorb better when my skin is wet, but not quite so sopping wet.  And I think 2 squirts works better than one-- even still, this bottle will last me a long time, I&#x27;m sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was running late this morning, so didn&#x27;t take the time to use the [[ASIN:B000EGMHKQ Olivella All Natural Virgin Olive Oil Moisturizer From Italy (50ml) 1.69 Fluid Ounces]].  I could definitely feel the difference today!  My skin just felt drier, older and less healthy.  The outer layers of skin seemed moist from my regular moisturizer with sunscreen, but my deeper layers of skin really missed the Olivella.  (BTW, I&#x27;ve been applying it to my wet face immediately after showering in the morning or washing up at night, and after it air dries, I apply my day or night cream over it.)</li>
            <li> This is a great natural moisturizer.  Just one small squirt is sufficient for your enitre face, and is terrific after I shave.  It is absorbed into my skin fairly rapidly and makes me glow!</li>
            <li> I really like this oil moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I live in a dry climate, and I put this moisturizer on right after I get out of the shower, its soaks right in with no greasiness.&lt;br /&gt; I am very pleased with how light it feels on the skin and how my skin seems smoother and has a glow.&lt;br /&gt; Very Pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent moisturizer, has a beautiful light citrus scent and feels so good on your skin, the texture is light and doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy after you put it on. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I use this during the day on top of olivella moisture cream. I suspect I paid an awful lot of money for what appears to be plain old olive oil, but I must admit it is very moisturizing and one tiny pump dispenses enough oil to cover your entire face and neck. It absorbs quickly and has no scent that I can detect.</li>
            <li> I am most happy with Olivella. It&#x27;s very pleasantly light and citrus scented. It&#x27;s good for whole body as well as face and hands as a gentle, non greasy moisturizer. I plan to order again which is probably soon because I use it  many times a day and it does not have all the weird ingredients too long to type out or pronounce or any petroleum products.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have been using it for about 3 years. Really love the feel of my skin after it&#x27;s been applied.</li>
            <li> My facialist told me to apply some olive oil to freshly washed facial skin in the shower to combat winter dryness. This has been my little skincare secret for 2 years. It keeps my face well-balanced- hydrated and not greasy at all. This one is a great price too. The packaging looks very different from the picture here. It actually comes in a glass bottle- better than the photo, if you ask me.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Excellent seller!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful moisturizer, I use it morning and night.  My wish would be that it was available in a larger size.  Next best thing for me to do I suppose is to order 2 bottles at a time.  Therefore, in my next order I  plan to do so,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the moisturizer I have the face and body soap.  I have shared bars of it with family and they speak highly of it as well..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Carol</li>
            <li> I like this product as it goes on light, absorbs fairly quickly, and doesn&#x27;t smell.  It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product is very good for an older person (59) with dry skin.  It seems to just evaporate off the surface and leaves my skin looking very dry in the morning. It might be good for cleansing or using with another product over it.  I will not buy it again and have to look for something else.  The scent is a little bit strong for sensitive people, also.</li>
            <li> I definitely love this product and would recommend it to everyone.  I have seen an improvement in my skin, not only in the softness but also a reduction in wrinkles.  You don&#x27;t need chemicals to have nice skin.  Mother nature has it all.</li>
            <li> Love this - it does feel a bit greasy, but also totally nourishing.  It&#x27;s not just a moisturizer, it&#x27;s like a moisture serum.  The mild citrus smell is really nice.  I suffer from dry patches on my face sometimes and after two days of this, they&#x27;re totally gone.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer leaves my skin feeling greasy. I have combination skin and in my 40&#x27;s. This oil didn&#x27;t absorb well in my skin. It is okay to use occasionally in the winter when my skin is feeling drier but the rest of the year I stopped using it because it would cause me to break out and I normally never break out. I also don&#x27;t like the smell. I will eventually finish the bottle but will not buy it again. Next time I will stick to cream moisturizer. This may work better for you if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s and I have noticed a very positive change in my skin since using this product.  I use the pump soap, shower gel and body lotion as well.  You do not need very much....literally a pea sized squirt and it covers well.</li>
            <li> I used this product before but had difficulty finding it again.  I use it in the morning under my eyes on my crows feet and forehead and have seen improvement. Cheaper then Botox!!</li>
            <li> I originally used an olive oil product that my mom bought else where, and I fell in love with how that stuff made me feel. I put it on at night and the next morning I was in love with my skin.  So I decided to find some on amazon the next day.  This item was almost the exact same thing  but cheaper!  And I use it almost every day.&lt;br /&gt;If you live in a dry or desert climate, I highly recommend using this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the same bottle for months now.&lt;br /&gt;Just apply it after you remove your make up and after you wash your face every night. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Have continued to but this product - is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a good serum for very dry areas.  Not greasy &amp; rejuvenates ski that needs that little something beyond an emollient .</li>
            <li> A little background on my skin:  I am in my early 50&#x27;s and have combination skin. The skin around my eyes is dry and sagging a bit, and I have an occasional break out in my t-zone.  I have been using Olivella for about two months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially I used this product morning and night, but I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s a bit oily to use under my makeup.  But, after I clean my face in the evening, I still love to use it.  With my face still damp from washing, I put one squirt of Olivella on my hand, quickly rub my hands together to distribute it, and pat my face and neck all over.  This prevents pulling on my skin and keeps the product from going on too heavily.  I make sure to do extra pats around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a light-feeling oil, with a very light scent of lavender and citrus from other oils it contains.  It does not cause me to break out.  I had a couple of brownish age spots on my face that have faded away....not sure if it is due to this product but I haven&#x27;t changed anything else.  In general my skin looks more dewy and less crepey.  It&#x27;s not a facelift in a jar, but I&#x27;m very happy with it and my results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK. I have an oily skin with a bit of very dry area in my face, so I put this product in the dry-zone. It works OK, but kind of sticky.</li>
            <li> Loved it so much that I bought for my son, my co-worker, and my daughter-in-law :)  At night, after cleansing this is the first thing that goes on my face and neck and lastly pat around the eyes.  Optional to add night cream during summer nights.  Winter nights if not enough then I would add hydrating night cream.  Also after cleansing in the morning, this product goes on first and then my Dermalogical tinted primer with spf 40 (or Dr. Perricone No Concealer with spf 30 using very sparingly).  This is all I need and cheek and lip stain for Hawaii&#x27;s summer hot and humid months.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I have used in a long time. My skin was glowing the next morning after using it at night the first time. Even my friend who is an esthetician commented on how good it looked.</li>
            <li> just what I needed, thank you!!</li>
            <li> The product claims \\&quot;Magnificent anti-aging Elixir truly replenishes and revitalizes your skin while your body is at rest, during sleep.\\&quot;.  I actually found that skin looks worse.  I am suspect that many of the reviews (like many on Amazon) are written by the company.  It does nothing for my skin.     If I want to buy a natural product, I find Wholefoods a much better resource.  The staff tends to be knowledgeable and quite honest.</li>
            <li> I like to use natural things that work.  This one of them.  You need to try this one.  You will love it.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ll be using on my face from here on out. So glad I found it on here. This is a no-nonsense natural moisturizer that also makes an ideal anti-aging product if used regularly. (Be sure to use it around your eyes also.) I have dry to combination skin and was worried about slathering straight oil on my face - wouldn&#x27;t that make me break out or clog my pores or make me strangely shiny?! Nope, nope, and....not really. It is a bit greasy going on.....after all, this is almost straight olive oil....but just put it on before bed with a slightly damp face and let it work its magic. I love putting it on after I shower or exfoliate because where my skin would feel uncomfortably tight and dry and sometimes flaky before, this takes care of all that. As an added bonus, my makeup foundation just glides right on with this stuff, although be careful with eye shadow as it might interfere with adhesion if it hasn&#x27;t absorbed enough yet. This is an awesome product which is an excellent choice for men too and people of all ages. Gentle, natural, and effective. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> it is good for everyday use. and it is nature, I used it on face everyday ,and it is neither oily or dry, I recommend it !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the hullabaloo is over this product.  It&#x27;s the most expensive olive oil per ounce with a little scent you&#x27;ll ever buy. I&#x27;m fair skinned, slightly on dry side, rarely break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this for a solid month and am completely indifferent to it.  I re-bought my Clarins Multi-Active Jour that I love (I was trying to cut corners).  My skin is back to the amazing soft skin I know and love that results from using Clarin&#x27;s skin care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product just didn&#x27;t excite me the way it seems to excite other people.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff  ..great moisturizer. ..not greasy and leaves your skin nice and soft without being greasy. Second order for me</li>
            <li> dont really know how it works but got it for my sister. I think she knows what she asked for.</li>
            <li> i havent tried this product yet, i am writing because i just received it in the mail and it came all oily, the box was all oily so apparently it spilled and wasnt packaged right... already a bummer.</li>
            <li> I have cholinergic urticaria (heat hives) I don&#x27;t know why I thought this might cure my condition&lt;br /&gt;I guess when there isn&#x27;t a known cure for a certain condition people will just buy stuff HOPPING that it will be a cure&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT buy if you have CU</li>
            <li> I have combo sensiive skin type. This is a great product to moisturize noc and day. Keeps skin well hydrated and does not have all the harsh chemicals that most products have-back to basic nature&#x27;s product. It is simply vegan. I have spent so much on name brand products which were a waste. I am grateful amazon sells his product. Just use 1-2drops on wet hands and apply to neck and face. Slight citrus scent. MARILOU</li>
            <li> I know the oil works well...I have used it before.  But on this shipment the lid was not sealed. Lid was half unscrewed.  Oil leaked making box oily.  Outer box not packages well either.  Disappointed in shipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give the Olivella Virgin Olive Oil.... 5 STARS!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipment.... 1 STAR - I did receive it.</li>
            <li> I have used Olivella moisturizer for 2+ yrs now, and I have received many compliments on the state of my skin.  I am well into my 50s, and most people think I am closer to 40! It&#x27;s also great for my hands.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I finally found my magical skin potion that works for me.  I&#x27;m 30 years old and have been through gazillions of skin moisturizers, all of which never leave me with perfect skin.  This stuff works for me!!  I have kind of oily skin that is very very sensitive and very prone to breakouts.  Ever since I started using this stuff my skin hasn&#x27;t seen a single breakout...I don&#x27;t think I have even had a tiny pimple, it&#x27;s crazy.  I even live in Texas where it&#x27;s always crazy hot and my makeup is sweating sitting on my face as I chase my toddlers around the parks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I was just here ordering my second bottle because my first is running low (I&#x27;ve had it a few months and use it twice daily) and thought I&#x27;d share my review since I love this stuff so much.  Best part - it&#x27;s all natural :)  BUY IT!</li>
            <li> fantastic!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I like it so much&lt;br /&gt;good pruduct!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Product is greasy and gave me blemishes</li>
            <li> It definitely makes my skin my soft, helps lighten up my dark circles under my eyes &amp; helps reduces wrinkles.  Really the only issue I had was the pump on the container broke leaving about 1/3 bottle left.  I open the bottle to use the plastic straw insert which pumps up the moisturizer to apply the olive oil on my face.</li>
            <li> I have red lines after birth and after 2 years i i try  the oil to flake noticed the red lines and fonts have their place White Light</li>
            <li> I needed a moisturizer, i always bought lotion , this time i decided to buy this very satisfied overall great product.&lt;br /&gt;Reduces redness in skin, great moisturizer for dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Really recommend to others!</li>
            <li> When I bought this moisturizer I was expecting a lotion but instead I received oil as moisturizer, I&#x27;ve never used oil for moisturizer before, I found out is a very good product, nice moisturizer, it doesn&#x27;t seat on your skin, it absorbs quick enough, and blends so good with any sunscreen I have used with it, contrary with any others moisturizers I&#x27;ve been used on the past, which they will come out in small rolls when I rub the sunscreen on top of it leaving a horrible mess all over my face is just a nightmare especially on morning time when the time is so limited. I will buy it again, love it love it, I will recommend it especially to people with dry to normal skin.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly. I apply it to my face/neck in the evening. But I can&#x27;t say how it&#x27;s working for my fine lines as it&#x27;s only been a short while since I&#x27;ve been using it. Does not feel oily, which is great!</li>
            <li> Olivella All Natural Virgin Olive Oil Moisturizer from Italy is the only way to keep skin supple - especially after a day in the sun!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for about 4 years. This is the only cosmetic I can&#x27;t live without. I put it on my face every night after I clean it and give my skin a little massage. The massage is essential because the oil doesn&#x27;t sink in like a regular cream. My skin used to get dry, especially my cheeks and especially in winter, but this oil works magic. People also tell me that I have very nice skin (which wasn&#x27;t the case before I&#x27;ve started using it). I&#x27;ve tried several natural oils before and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t enlarge my pores and doesn&#x27;t make my T-area too oily.</li>
            <li> Caused all kinds of skin irritation after few uses. This is not the first time I&#x27;ve been burned by listening to reviews.&lt;br /&gt; I had to go to a dermatologist and she told me to stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;I heard recently news of products made elsewhere getting the &amp;#34;made in Italy&amp;#34; stamp as they pass through. I have no idea if this one is but regardless, it was a disaster for me. It could be my skin is too sensitive so won&#x27;t diss it completely.&lt;br /&gt;Use with caution if you must.</li>
            <li> After reading all the great reviews about this product, I was surprised at how badly it irritated my skin.  My skin is very sensitive and obviously it works for some, just not for me.  But, you do get a lot of product for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Whoever would have thought to put oil on skin that was once oily?  I didn&#x27;t, but decided to try it.  My skin is now combination and this moisturizes without breaking my skin out.  I put it on my damp skin after washing my face at night and have been happier with the results than when I was using other night special potion face lotions.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Very moisturizing, moisture lasts.  Feels good on the skin, not too heavy. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  It leaves my skin soft, and not greasy because I have oily skin.  The trick for using this oil is you put it on you skin while it is wet, so that the oil soaks in when your skin dries.  It leaves your skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I love this!  It leaves the skin so soft and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> This is oil not a lotion. Love it though. All natural and just great for my dry facial skin. All natural too.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and feel of this. Very good moisturizer.  It is oily (obviously) so if you don&#x27;t like that consistency, this is not for you. But it absorbs well and my skin feels great in the morning after having this on overnight.</li>
            <li> This is a really good natural moisturizer. It goes on as an oil would, leaving an oily feel but soaks in quickly. Nice to use at night. Love the smell too!</li>
            <li> We have been using Olivella for over a year now.  It was recommended by our dermatologist to help combat sun damage on arms and chest area.  Also very good for treating scars from skin cancers.  It moisturizes without being oily and is quickly absorbed into the skin.  My wife says her arms look better that they have in years.  Love the stuff.</li>
            <li> Softens without being greasy or heavy. After using for just a week I find my skin smoother and feeling more supple. I am 60 years old and was needing something to help with the aging process. This works.</li>
            <li> Soothing and makes my skin as soft as it should be.</li>
    </ol>
