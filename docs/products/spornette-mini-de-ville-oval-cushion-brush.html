            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to have found this item, this brush glides thru my mixed 3C-4B hair when straight, very good for smoothing edges as well it also provides a nice scalp massage.</li>

            <li>Althought its mostly nylon, it does get the job done.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>There is more than a sufficient quantity of bristles--all of which are spaced evenly &amp; vertically aligned in 5 \\&quot;columns\\&quot; across the brush section.</li>
            <li>love this brand and brush.  </li>

            <li>Good quality brush,works great for little hands .  </li>
            <li>mini brush is ideally sized to fit in any handbag (perhaps, even in some evening bags), but it&#x27;s still plenty big to function as a brush should.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly however, this particular brush is truly well-made &amp; I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>fit&#x27;s in my purse or coat pocket.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bristles themselves are, indeed, genuine boar.</li>
            <li>I think this would be a good product for small children with not alot of hair though and its minature size is good for them to hold.</li>
            <li>As this was my first foray into boar bristle brushes, I am pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>Just Right!</li>
            <li>Good deal overall,</li>
            <li>All that I&#x27;ve read about boar brushes came true with this brush.  </li>

            <li>The bristles are just right for thinning hair (no tug or pull).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just wanted to say this is a great small brush.  </li>
            <li>keep mine handy, and it finds a gentle use 5 or 6 times daily.</li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t feel the need to spend tons of cash on a huge brush when I have fine, medium long hair.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>The bristles are fine, but the rest is low quality.  </li>
            <li>Even with very thick (&amp; often, unruly) hair, I feel extremely confident using it &amp; am always satisfied</li>
            <li>It is well made and the price was reasonable as well.</li>
            <li>True Blue &amp;#34;)))</li>
            <li>the effective boar bristle part is only 3.5\\&quot; long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably invest in a larger brush in the future, but this brush will work just fine for awhile.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a replacement for a very old Goody brush with boar bristles.</li>
            <li>Wow wow wow!!  </li>

            <li>Another order for same brush, that should tell you how much I like it.</li>
            <li>and its natural bristles</li>
            <li>But have not found a natural bristle brush made in the USA.  </li>
            <li>A small travel brush that will do a good job brushing out my long hair on a long trip!</li>
            <li>The actual bristle section is a generous 3.5 inches...which is more than half the length of the entire brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It fairly decent for short hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching high &amp; low for a purse-size boar brush for YEARS!</li>
            <li>Your normal, single pull across the bristles won&#x27;t always do the trick here.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this brush! It has the right bristles for my hair &amp; fits perfectly in my purse to boot!</li>
            <li> A very nice, quality boar bristle hairbrush for women;  it fits very easily into your purse, tote or travel bag.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and I figured this brush would be sufficient to brush my hair. It is very small and barely does its job. I think this would be a good product for small children with not alot of hair though and its minature size is good for them to hold.</li>
            <li> Holding up great. Bristles not falling out or breaking)) fit&#x27;s in my purse or coat pocket. Detangles and smooth&#x27;s hair nicely</li>
            <li> I got this item on time. It fairly decent for short hair. Althought its mostly nylon, it does get the job done. Good carry around/travel brush</li>
            <li> Brush came way before expected. It was EXACTLY what I wanted! A small travel brush that will do a good job brushing out my long hair on a long trip! It fits in my waist wallet!</li>
            <li> Boar bristles only brush to use</li>
            <li> I kept hearing wonderful things about restoring luster to damaged hair using boar bristle brushes - so I wanted one! However, I didn&#x27;t feel the need to spend tons of cash on a huge brush when I have fine, medium long hair. I searched around Amazon until I found this brush and even with the other review being rather negative, I took the chance and ordered it.  Overall, I am pleased with my purchase. Some things to think about before purchasing:  1. The brush size is called \\&quot;mini\\&quot; for a reason. The brush (from tip to handle) is approx. 6.5\\&quot; long and the effective boar bristle part is only 3.5\\&quot; long. It&#x27;s a good travel size. When holding the brush I don&#x27;t use the tiny handle and instead just palm the head.  2. The bristle are sturdy but still soft. I immediately noticed a difference in my hair when I used the brush. No more flyaways!  3. It&#x27;s pretty cheap. I wasn&#x27;t too happy to see it was made in China but you get what you pay for.  As this was my first foray into boar bristle brushes, I am pleased with the result. I&#x27;ll probably invest in a larger brush in the future, but this brush will work just fine for awhile.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  I needed a small brush to throw in my purse.  This is perfect-small enough to travel but substantial enough too.</li>
            <li> The brush handle is flimsy.  (It&#x27;s like cheap contact paper over something.....not wood!!)  The bristles are fine, but the rest is low quality.  Could find the same thing at the dollar store.  Would not buy again.  Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Great for teasing out tangles in fine hair. Good size for kids</li>
            <li> Skeptical at first due to the small size, this brush delivers big performance.&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful contoured wood handle fits the hand, makes this the perfect&lt;br /&gt;portable brush. The bristles are just right for thinning hair (no tug or pull).&lt;br /&gt;I keep mine handy, and it finds a gentle use 5 or 6 times daily.</li>
            <li> Another order for same brush, that should tell you how much I like it. I also ordered the pocket sized version.</li>
            <li> Not too stiff, not too soft, Just Right! And the perfect size for a purse or grand kids...you can quit looking with this brush!</li>
            <li> I reviewed the slaggier one, but meant it to be for this- it is the PERFECT travel brush- makes my hair look professionally done and fits standing up in my suitcase.  I Love it!!!</li>
            <li> easy to carry in every day bags!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a replacement for a very old Goody brush with boar bristles. I&#x27;ve looked and looked and looked around somemore and could not find a hair brush that was even close until NOW! Yah!! I&#x27;m so happy to have found this item, this brush glides thru my mixed 3C-4B hair when straight, very good for smoothing edges as well it also provides a nice scalp massage. I will be repurchasing a larger version of this brush. Excellent, excellent quality by the way. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Good quality brush,works great for little hands .  My kid loves brushing his own hair this way. Also will use as a travel brush!  and its natural bristles though its made in China.  But have not found a natural bristle brush made in the USA.  Good deal overall,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching high &amp; low for a purse-size boar brush for YEARS! But, lo &amp; behold, here it is, at last!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW IS BELOW!!**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note: I&#x27;ve used it on DRY hair only)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIZE:&lt;br /&gt;This mini brush is ideally sized to fit in any handbag (perhaps, even in some evening bags), but it&#x27;s still plenty big to function as a brush should. It measures approximately 6.5 inches long. The actual bristle section is a generous 3.5 inches...which is more than half the length of the entire brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HANDLE:&lt;br /&gt;The brush contains a sturdy, medium-thick handle with a wavy cut-out along the sides. This ingenious design makes the brush extraordinarily easy to hold/use &amp; prevents any slippage from or movement out of your grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BRISTLES:&lt;br /&gt;The bristles themselves are, indeed, genuine boar. There is more than a sufficient quantity of bristles--all of which are spaced evenly &amp; vertically aligned in 5 \\&quot;columns\\&quot; across the brush section. The bristles are durable &amp; function BETTER than expected (absolutely NO damaged or broken-off bristles, even despite serious tangles). That said, the texture &amp; arrangement of the bristles can make removing hair stuck in the brush, a bit tricky. Your normal, single pull across the bristles won&#x27;t always do the trick here. Instead, you may need to unwind &amp; weave the hair out from within the bristles and then, try again to pull the hair from the brush. Not a big deal at all...but might be worth mentioning for any \\&quot;Boar Brush Newbies\\&quot; out there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MADE IN CHINA:&lt;br /&gt;Finally, yes, it is manufactured in China (but, what isn&#x27;t these days?). Surprisingly however, this particular brush is truly well-made &amp; I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this tiny product promises a phenomenal brushing experience! Even with very thick (&amp; often, unruly) hair, I feel extremely confident using it &amp; am always satisfied afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Just wanted to say this is a great small brush.  If you have limited space, this is the brush for you.  It is well made and the price was reasonable as well.</li>
            <li> Wow wow wow!!  All that I&#x27;ve read about boar brushes came true with this brush.  I bought a larger one and KNEW I had to have one for my purse.  It totally refreshes the shine in my hair every time I use it during the day.  I know it contributes to the healthiness of my hair.  I was every 3-4 days and pulling the oils down from the root is critical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this brand and brush.  True Blue &amp;#34;)))</li>
