            <li>not the Andre Lorent sport sunscreen, in my book this is truly the best sunscreen on the market right now.</li>
            <li>That said though it is a wonderful product and if the price was right</li>
            <li>the smell is pleasant ,very light .</li>

            <li>It is truly amazing.  </li>
            <li>Lorent sunscreen is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice lotion plus protects my skin.</li>
            <li>I also thought it had a nice scent to it, not too</li>
            <li>It has a great fragrance, stays on when I am doing things outside and is an all around great product!</li>
            <li>My grand daughter (the fairest of fair) tried this under protest.</li>
            <li>I tried on my own face</li>
            <li>Nice sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Has a nice scent.  </li>
            <li>That wouldn&#x27;t necessarily deter me if it was the best sunscreen around at a great price.</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth it does offer good sun protection !</li>
            <li>Over all I think this is a great product and is made from the safer ingredients then most cheap sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>I also like that it is very easy to apply</li>
            <li>LOVE IT, LOVE IT.!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy this sunscreen is great for sensitive skin and is paraben free!</li>
            <li>I liked this sunscreen better than others because my skin could still breathe.</li>
            <li>and it goes on the skin very smoothly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light, but I found it a bit displeasing.</li>
            <li>( you get the picture) but this penetrates your skin quickly leaving it with a feeling of non oily coverage.so it felt good .I&#x27;ll</li>
            <li>She is very fair and has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It was silky smooth and smelled so nice.</li>
            <li>this sunscreen lotion will make me feel confident that I am protected from sunburns and ultraviolet rays.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the smell of most sunscreens</li>
            <li>I have fallen in love with this product.</li>
            <li>My husband and I love to kayak</li>
            <li>The sport sunscreen is so smooth like a nice face cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I received the Andre Lorent Sport Sunscreen Lotion the day before we went to Soak City USA, so we were able to try it out for the day.</li>
            <li>I just recently purchased &amp; tried this product &amp; I think this is a great sunscreen!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s money in gold, and I am so glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I hope you will all give it a try, I am sure glad I did it .</li>
            <li>Lorent Sport Sunscreen &amp; am pleased with this purchase .</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not greasy like most lotion sunscreen .</li>
            <li>I would like it even more if it were  in a spray form</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic sunscreen!</li>
            <li>Even after sweating and swimming in a tropical climate I was able to prevent sunburn and walk away with a lovely tan.</li>
            <li>My biggest concern with sunscreen is that most clog my pores and irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>and I love to garden</li>
            <li>Over the years I have used many types of sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Not only was the sunscreen excellent, but the service from the company was also outstanding.  </li>
            <li>It soaked in, and wasn’t greasy; it felt as if I had just put on my favorite lotion.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic Sunscreen!  </li>
            <li>I really liked the quality ingredients of this sunscreen: zinc, vitamins A and E, and free of unwanted adfditives.</li>
            <li>Glad to find something I can use on my face without irritation.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because the over the counter sunscreens are just not working; no matter how many times I re-apply.</li>
            <li>I think there are equivalent sunscreens that are either cheaper or you get more for the price.</li>
            <li>but I love the way it feels when you apply it to your skin.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t an overwhelming &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the scent.</li>
            <li>I Love the smell and feel of this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>No nasty smell.</li>
            <li>Doesnt leave a greasy residue like most.</li>
            <li>So glad to have gotten in on this deal.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel like I used my favorite moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I love the sun</li>
            <li>This lotion went on smooth and didn&#x27;t sweat off, so I liked it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So, first review, wonderful texture, goes on super easy and spreads on skin easily.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!!!!!</li>
            <li>The fact that it is great for Sensitive Skin and Paraben Free makes me feel safe about using it for all my kids!</li>
            <li>The first thing that I loved about Andre Lorent Sport Sunscreen, is the color scheme.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this product does exactly what it advertises in a pleasant to use , easily portable package.</li>
            <li>It was very effective in 90 degree heat and high humidity.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased at how easily the lotion was to apply to my arms and legs.</li>
            <li>I love the easy application and consistency of this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for developing a GREAT sunscreen!</li>
            <li>I love the that this product is paraben free and it is water and sweat resistant.  </li>
            <li>Both myself and my husband were very pleased with our first time using your product.</li>
            <li>It felt light and breathable, much more like a quality moisturizer than a sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I love that it is paraben free.</li>
            <li>The sunscreen is easy to apply and it has a light scent to it, not like most sunscreens</li>
            <li>Thus far, the product is very effective in preventing sunburns and give you confidence that your skin will be protected from ultraviolet rays.</li>
            <li>The true test will be when I go to the beach in a month!</li>
            <li>I am blonde hair, light eyes, and have very fair skin which easily burns.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasing scent and applies easily.</li>
            <li>Sunscreen goes on easy, not greasy.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>:  Easy to squeeze tube</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>and it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>so it makes it easy to see where you are applying and areas that might be missed.</li>
            <li>This one however applies well and easily rubs in.</li>
            <li>but it this  sunscreen applied easily and rubbed in well.</li>
            <li>I like that this sunscreen doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance</li>
            <li>It does not have a strong odor.  </li>
            <li>I put it to the test over three days at high altitude to see if it was as good as it was advertised.  </li>
            <li>I liked this product very much.</li>
            <li>My husband is rather fair skinned and normally burns quite easily.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin so was excited to see a sunscreen that sounded promising.</li>
            <li>My skin is so fair, I would normally be sunburned within 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>and it seemed to stay on just fine.</li>
            <li>but this one has a pleasant soft smell that I like.  </li>
            <li>The very first thing I noticed was that the lotion is NOT greasy--not at all!  </li>
            <li>The non greasy formula is perfect for being non slippery when hands on with the little ones.  </li>
            <li>This was gentle, effective and kept me break out free.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a huge bonus for me.</li>
            <li>When I applied to my skin, it went on smoothly with no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Non-greasy when applied with a light scent.  </li>
            <li>It is so light you could use it on your face.</li>
            <li>The non-greasy formula goes on smoothly</li>
            <li>I applied this to my kids on everything but faces as it did not say if it is tear free or not.  </li>
            <li>arms and face are so smooth and the product remained on my skin all day</li>
            <li>-the smell was so light in odor-no one would know that you have sunscreen on your body-</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and with no greasy feel and does not leave a greasy residue on everything you touch.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and lightly.</li>
            <li>Its non oily formula was great for my skin and my teenage son.</li>
            <li>I also feel comfortable with the ingredients in this one and the fact they are not tested on animals is a huge plus in my book.</li>
            <li>For that reason I will never go out in public again wearing this sunscreen, lol.</li>
            <li>That said, I don&#x27;t think it goes on terribly smooth.</li>
            <li>I had perfect protection from the intense sun rays with an initial application in the morning, and a touch up reapplication in the afternoon.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice soft sent and doesn&#x27;t smell like most sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>and I used it right away so that I would be able to give my opinion regarding the product.</li>
            <li>I am a very visual person, and love bright, bold colors.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to give this product a try.</li>
            <li>So glad to have found a product we can all use and one that really works!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I would have known about it if not given the opportunity to try it with the unique program through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I just received this and was excited to try it as I have three kids ages 9, 7, and 4</li>
            <li>The lotion is very rich and creamy and exactly as it was described on the order.</li>
            <li>I live in Minnesota and it is warm &amp; humid today.  </li>
            <li>As this is a new product, EWG hasn&#x27;t reviewed it yet, so you have to do your own legwork to determine the safety of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>I am especially sensitive to many skin care products, but this sunscreen lotion did not cause any reactions and still did a fantastic job at protecting my skin.</li>
            <li>First off,I love using my Amazon Prime , the Two day shipping &amp; free shipping is so worth</li>
            <li>The lotion applied easily and absorbed quickly with no oily residue or stickiness.  </li>
            <li>Now for the true test.  </li>
            <li>Third, I loved the way it felt when you put the product on.</li>
            <li>It actually feels good on my skin as well as protecting it from sun damage.</li>
            <li>Love it although we haven&#x27;t had much sun</li>
            <li>I received the product free to review and think its well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I had no burn and no bad taste from sweat dripping of my face.  </li>
            <li>I am a red head with a very fair complexion who happens to live in Florida.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was excellent and it arrived early than I expected.</li>
            <li>I received the product quickly.</li>
            <li>I will also add that there was no running of the product off my skin, as it really felt like it was well absorbed rather than feeling like it is sitting on top of my skin waiting to be wiped off.  </li>
            <li>It is lightly scented which is nice for my husband and teenage boys.  </li>
            <li>I am SUPER picky about the sunscreen I use because I have a history of skin cancer in my family.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is also high in zinc, which I tend to think lasts longer and protects better.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant but not overwhelming like many sunscreens are.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m very interested in seeing how it rates once EWG has a look at it.</li>
            <li>Had a very hot week-end temperatures and even while outdoors product stayed on.  </li>
            <li>When I use a sunscreen product, I expect it to protect me from the sun, but what I particularly noticed &amp; liked about the Sport Sunscreen is that it didn&#x27;t feel very &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and I have to tell you how excited I am to have found a sunscreen that has exactly what I have been looking for.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased that not only did my makeup products apply easily over this sunscreen, it did not get &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; nor did it cake or settle in any areas of my face.</li>
            <li>Very light weight, non greasy and my skin feels soft and fresh all day.  </li>
            <li>Their claim to being waterproof is accurate and much appreciated.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you it is worth</li>
            <li>It’s nice to find a product that will help protect you against the harmful rays of the sun, and help with anti-aging, as I finally hit an age where I am beginning to worry about that.</li>
            <li>not over powering...light and fresh.</li>
            <li>That being said, I sweat A LOT when I exercise, especially outdoors, so this sunscreen is nice because it doesn&#x27;t run into your eyes and sting them when you re-apply it to your face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>At my age (62), the most action I see is a walk three times a week and gardening after work, the point is the lotion stays on and doesn&#x27;t sting.</li>
            <li>This is the 3rd product that I have tried from this company and just like the other 2 products I LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li>The consistency of the sunscreen is just right</li>
            <li>Right out of the box</li>
            <li>Their is a slight pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Something&#x27;s like this would normally cause a screaming fit.</li>
            <li>I have never been completely happy with any of the sunscreens I have tried in the past.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and is not thick or greasy.  </li>
            <li>It is not greasy &amp; it&#x27;s  easy to apply to the skin, and it doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky feeling that many other sunscreens do.</li>
            <li>It is non greasy and really has a mild scent.</li>
            <li>I liked the small hole in the top of the lid so not to much comes out at a time.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gone to the beach or been out in the sun very much.</li>
            <li>To me, this is a high quality sunscreen that can easily worn daily as well as for more intense needs.</li>
            <li>It was certainly not greasy or thick, and the smell was pleasant, not too strong or overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much for the opportunity to try this!</li>
            <li>just in time to use over a hot and sunny Pittsburgh weekend.</li>
            <li>Working in hot and humid conditions, the lotion did not need to be reapplied for 2 1/2 to 3 hours.</li>
            <li>I definitely have to say, compared to the sunscreen I used on vacation, this felt more like a skin-softening lotion.  </li>
            <li>Would most definitely recommend</li>
            <li>Second, I love the fact that the Andre Lorent Sport Sunscreen contains vitamins and antioxidants.</li>
            <li>Andre Lorent Sports Sunscreen changed my mind with first use.</li>
            <li>First, I noticed this did not feel like sunscreen when applied</li>
            <li>The first test is the smell.</li>
            <li>We were out in the most crucial part of the day (around lunch) and stayed out all afternoon.</li>
            <li>She didn&#x27;t burn after a whole day in the pool!</li>
            <li>I hope my video review helps for anyone who is willing to try this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>After using it my skin felt soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Its hot and humid in the Midwest, and I work out in the heat and sun.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty pricy sunscreen ($25 for the tube).</li>
            <li>I had much to do outside in the yard and garden decided to give my new Andre Lorent lotion an honest test.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen actually felt good on my hands and absorbed on myskin readily with NO WHITE APPEARANCE OR STICKY RESIDUE.</li>
            <li>The formula of this sunscreen states it is friendly to individuals with sensitive skin, and it is non-greasy.   </li>
            <li>The scent is clean, not heavy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through a lot of different lotions trying to find one that actually protected my skin from burn but none had done a good job</li>
            <li>In my opinion it is a little steep, otherwise I was very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you all the positive things about this product.  </li>
            <li>Amazing sun protection for all types of water and extreme outdoor activity!</li>
            <li>I have finally found my tried and true sunscreen that I will be using all the time!</li>
            <li>After a long hike up a local mountain to pick huckleberries in the bright sun</li>
            <li>This is a very decent sunscreen and it does the job it&#x27;s intended to do.</li>
            <li>However, if you want a product that is not greasy/oily/thick/white/smelly then you should certainly give this a try.  </li>
            <li>This is certainly a product I will consider using again.</li>
            <li>I am certain of this because I did not get burned even though I was at the beach for about two hours.  </li>
            <li>I know they say you can’t judge a book by its cover, but sometimes I will pick certain products based on the color scheme of the product.</li>
            <li>(If I really tried to smell it, there was a light scent, but it was definitely not overwhelming like most brands.)  </li>
            <li>This is a real winner in my book.</li>
            <li>Thanks for giving me the opportunity to try it, I&#x27;d purchase it for myself and friends/family.</li>
            <li>I am very picky about what I put on my skin and my children&#x27;s skin.  </li>
            <li>It feels so smooth and silky and definitely does not leave skin looking or feeling greasy!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As an esthetician, I am really picky about sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the opportunity</li>
            <li>As a result, I have become even more careful using sunscreen when I go out for any reason.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone including children!</li>
            <li>It lasted the whole time we were in the pool splashing around with out any problems.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had much sun to try out the sun block</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week, and I must say I really like it.</li>
            <li>I really like this sunblock.</li>
            <li>I really like this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>If anyone has any questions, please feel free to leave a comment to my review and I will get back to you!</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are two things I don&#x27;t like much about this product.</li>
            <li>He said the product goes on milky and takes a bit to absorb but during the day, it did not run into his eyes and sting when he sweated, so he really likes this product.</li>
            <li>First, I am hesitant to try a product new to me.</li>
            <li>and when I&#x27;m more active.</li>
            <li>There is no other way to put it other than the fact that this is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>The results are a strawberry blonde little girl with a fair complexion not being sunburned.</li>
            <li>I purchased this with a really decent coupon code</li>
            <li>It soaks in quickly and does not leave you with white streaks.</li>
            <li>That is far more than I generally pay for organic/all-natural sunscreen, so I don&#x27;t think I would buy this on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I knew it was going to be high quality.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>and I can be a bit sensitive to certain products so that is also a bonus.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works as I expected, and since I&#x27;ve had melanoma that is important to me.  </li>
            <li>As my video says, this sunscreen works very well for me (and my 2 year old son).</li>
            <li>Only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about</li>
            <li>No streaking, stinging, or burning sensations and, most importantly to me, no stinky chemical or flowery smell.</li>
            <li>The protest didn&#x27;t last long, it went on smoothly, didn&#x27;t have an odor, lasted and lasted!</li>
            <li>smells nice and is moderately thick.</li>
            <li>I live near St. Louis which has very high humidity and temps</li>
            <li>I find the lotion to have a light feeling and unlike other lotions that seem to &amp;</li>
            <li>I live on the southeast coast</li>
            <li>We live in the mountains of Colorado and spend a ton of time outdoors camping, four wheeling, hiking etc.</li>
            <li>What else I loved about this brand was its thin, not a heavy paste.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this sunscreen did not bother me at all.</li>
            <li>also have very sensitive skin, so that was also a plus, no irritation or stinging when I put it</li>
            <li>I went outside when it was sunny and HOT (mid-90s) for about 1.5 hours.  </li>
            <li>As always, with anything ordered from Amazon, it was delI&#x27;ve red on time and exactly what it was supposed to be in the package.</li>
            <li>I usually do not write reviews on products that I purchase.  </li>
            <li>Since I live near the beach</li>
            <li>It absorbed into my skin with barely any residue left on the surface.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and very sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>Will definitely recommend and use this product as it feels better in my skin than any other I&#x27;ve used!  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, the melanoma was removed with little fuss, and it was self-contained.  </li>
            <li>I try very hard not to because I have such fair skin but thus far this sunscreen has worked as promised.</li>
            <li>For the past several years I&#x27;ve been using the spray-on sunscreens that are quick and convenient, but don&#x27;t seem to provide the adequate protection.  </li>
            <li>Its hard to tell if this is more sunscreen or moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>My family and I went tubing on a clear 90 degree day.</li>
            <li>After applying to your face it disappears and leaves your skin ultra soft.  </li>
            <li>I completely followed the instructions on the box (applying  every two hours).</li>
            <li>My skin felt soft and protected.  </li>
            <li>This product has a very &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; fragrance, which reminds me of regular suntan lotion...</li>
            <li>( I received it at a discounted price) and I must say I pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>After all, that is the least worry when choosing a sunscreen and the function of this one does just as it should :)</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin but have not had a problem so far</li>
            <li>and I had no heavy, gooey coating on my skin.</li>
            <li>However, it dried to a light and non-greasy feeling product and held up well during my workout.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday , rain or shine, goes on so smoothly-</li>
            <li>I have used it so far on my arms when I am out working in the yard.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that the other sunscreen had over this one is that it was fragrance free.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend Andre Lorent&#x27;s Sport Sunscreen, especially for any outdoor activities.</li>
            <li>Will update further as I continue the use and see how it does up in high country</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for all ages and I plan to purchase it for family and especially for my son and daughter-in law who also have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This one also has a higher concentration of zinc oxide and other helpful ingredients than anything I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>Once you start to rub it into the skin, it produces that infamous sunscreen smell, which I LOVE!</li>
            <li>I did not have to reapply the product constantly which saved me money, time, and an argument from an 8 year old.</li>
            <li>Since I have to be careful when exposing myself to the sun, I appreciated the warning on the box with regards to Sun Protection Measures.  </li>
            <li>It  has a very faint pleasant scent..</li>
            <li>Honestly, I haven&#x27;t had any bad experiences with this brand and the company is very customer oriented.</li>
            <li>In fact, when I closed my eyes and smelled the product on my arm, it really brought back memories of my toes in the sand with the ocean waves crashing on the shore!  </li>
            <li>The smell is very subtle and doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals, which I love.</li>
            <li>I spent three days at a mountain resort hiking, ziplining and just hanging out, all in the high mountain sunshine.  </li>
            <li>I received my Sport Sunscreen this past Wednesday and started using it right away.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had the strongest sun here since I received the product, but I have used it daily because I have very sensitive &amp; age related dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for those with an active lifestyle in the sun.</li>
            <li>Its also nice that it doesn&#x27;t have that awful sunscreen smell that pretty much all sunscreens have.</li>

            <li> It is truly amazing.  </li>
            <li> Lorent sunscreen is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice lotion plus protects my skin.</li>
            <li> I also thought it had a nice scent to it, not too</li>
            <li> It has a great fragrance, stays on when I am doing things outside and is an all around great product!</li>
            <li> My grand daughter (the fairest of fair) tried this under protest.</li>
            <li> I tried on my own face</li>
            <li> Nice sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Has a nice scent.  </li>
            <li> That wouldn&#x27;t necessarily deter me if it was the best sunscreen around at a great price.</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth it does offer good sun protection !</li>
            <li> Over all I think this is a great product and is made from the safer ingredients then most cheap sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> I also like that it is very easy to apply</li>
            <li> LOVE IT, LOVE IT.!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy this sunscreen is great for sensitive skin and is paraben free!</li>
            <li> I liked this sunscreen better than others because my skin could still breathe.</li>
            <li> and it goes on the skin very smoothly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light, but I found it a bit displeasing.</li>
            <li> ( you get the picture) but this penetrates your skin quickly leaving it with a feeling of non oily coverage.so it felt good .I&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> She is very fair and has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It was silky smooth and smelled so nice.</li>
            <li> this sunscreen lotion will make me feel confident that I am protected from sunburns and ultraviolet rays.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of most sunscreens</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with this product.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love to kayak</li>
            <li> The sport sunscreen is so smooth like a nice face cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I received the Andre Lorent Sport Sunscreen Lotion the day before we went to Soak City USA, so we were able to try it out for the day.</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased &amp; tried this product &amp; I think this is a great sunscreen!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s money in gold, and I am so glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I hope you will all give it a try, I am sure glad I did it .</li>
            <li> Lorent Sport Sunscreen &amp; am pleased with this purchase .</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not greasy like most lotion sunscreen .</li>
            <li> I would like it even more if it were  in a spray form</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Even after sweating and swimming in a tropical climate I was able to prevent sunburn and walk away with a lovely tan.</li>
            <li> My biggest concern with sunscreen is that most clog my pores and irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> and I love to garden</li>
            <li> Over the years I have used many types of sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Not only was the sunscreen excellent, but the service from the company was also outstanding.  </li>
            <li> It soaked in, and wasn’t greasy; it felt as if I had just put on my favorite lotion.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic Sunscreen!  </li>
            <li> I really liked the quality ingredients of this sunscreen: zinc, vitamins A and E, and free of unwanted adfditives.</li>
            <li> Glad to find something I can use on my face without irritation.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because the over the counter sunscreens are just not working; no matter how many times I re-apply.</li>
            <li> I think there are equivalent sunscreens that are either cheaper or you get more for the price.</li>
            <li> but I love the way it feels when you apply it to your skin.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t an overwhelming &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the scent.</li>
            <li> I Love the smell and feel of this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> No nasty smell.</li>
            <li> Doesnt leave a greasy residue like most.</li>
            <li> So glad to have gotten in on this deal.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel like I used my favorite moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I love the sun</li>
            <li> This lotion went on smooth and didn&#x27;t sweat off, so I liked it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So, first review, wonderful texture, goes on super easy and spreads on skin easily.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> The fact that it is great for Sensitive Skin and Paraben Free makes me feel safe about using it for all my kids!</li>
            <li> The first thing that I loved about Andre Lorent Sport Sunscreen, is the color scheme.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this product does exactly what it advertises in a pleasant to use , easily portable package.</li>
            <li> It was very effective in 90 degree heat and high humidity.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased at how easily the lotion was to apply to my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> I love the easy application and consistency of this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for developing a GREAT sunscreen!</li>
            <li> I love the that this product is paraben free and it is water and sweat resistant.  </li>
            <li> Both myself and my husband were very pleased with our first time using your product.</li>
            <li> It felt light and breathable, much more like a quality moisturizer than a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I love that it is paraben free.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen is easy to apply and it has a light scent to it, not like most sunscreens</li>
            <li> Thus far, the product is very effective in preventing sunburns and give you confidence that your skin will be protected from ultraviolet rays.</li>
            <li> The true test will be when I go to the beach in a month!</li>
            <li> I am blonde hair, light eyes, and have very fair skin which easily burns.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasing scent and applies easily.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen goes on easy, not greasy.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily.  </li>
            <li> :  Easy to squeeze tube</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> and it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> so it makes it easy to see where you are applying and areas that might be missed.</li>
            <li> This one however applies well and easily rubs in.</li>
            <li> but it this  sunscreen applied easily and rubbed in well.</li>
            <li> I like that this sunscreen doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance</li>
            <li> It does not have a strong odor.  </li>
            <li> I put it to the test over three days at high altitude to see if it was as good as it was advertised.  </li>
            <li> I liked this product very much.</li>
            <li> My husband is rather fair skinned and normally burns quite easily.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin so was excited to see a sunscreen that sounded promising.</li>
            <li> My skin is so fair, I would normally be sunburned within 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> and it seemed to stay on just fine.</li>
            <li> but this one has a pleasant soft smell that I like.  </li>
            <li> The very first thing I noticed was that the lotion is NOT greasy--not at all!  </li>
            <li> The non greasy formula is perfect for being non slippery when hands on with the little ones.  </li>
            <li> This was gentle, effective and kept me break out free.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a huge bonus for me.</li>
            <li> When I applied to my skin, it went on smoothly with no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy when applied with a light scent.  </li>
            <li> It is so light you could use it on your face.</li>
            <li> The non-greasy formula goes on smoothly</li>
            <li> I applied this to my kids on everything but faces as it did not say if it is tear free or not.  </li>
            <li> arms and face are so smooth and the product remained on my skin all day</li>
            <li> -the smell was so light in odor-no one would know that you have sunscreen on your body-</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and with no greasy feel and does not leave a greasy residue on everything you touch.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and lightly.</li>
            <li> Its non oily formula was great for my skin and my teenage son.</li>
            <li> I also feel comfortable with the ingredients in this one and the fact they are not tested on animals is a huge plus in my book.</li>
            <li> For that reason I will never go out in public again wearing this sunscreen, lol.</li>
            <li> That said, I don&#x27;t think it goes on terribly smooth.</li>
            <li> I had perfect protection from the intense sun rays with an initial application in the morning, and a touch up reapplication in the afternoon.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice soft sent and doesn&#x27;t smell like most sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> and I used it right away so that I would be able to give my opinion regarding the product.</li>
            <li> I am a very visual person, and love bright, bold colors.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to give this product a try.</li>
            <li> So glad to have found a product we can all use and one that really works!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would have known about it if not given the opportunity to try it with the unique program through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I just received this and was excited to try it as I have three kids ages 9, 7, and 4</li>
            <li> The lotion is very rich and creamy and exactly as it was described on the order.</li>
            <li> I live in Minnesota and it is warm &amp; humid today.  </li>
            <li> As this is a new product, EWG hasn&#x27;t reviewed it yet, so you have to do your own legwork to determine the safety of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I am especially sensitive to many skin care products, but this sunscreen lotion did not cause any reactions and still did a fantastic job at protecting my skin.</li>
            <li> First off,I love using my Amazon Prime , the Two day shipping &amp; free shipping is so worth</li>
            <li> The lotion applied easily and absorbed quickly with no oily residue or stickiness.  </li>
            <li> Now for the true test.  </li>
            <li> Third, I loved the way it felt when you put the product on.</li>
            <li> It actually feels good on my skin as well as protecting it from sun damage.</li>
            <li> Love it although we haven&#x27;t had much sun</li>
            <li> I received the product free to review and think its well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I had no burn and no bad taste from sweat dripping of my face.  </li>
            <li> I am a red head with a very fair complexion who happens to live in Florida.  </li>
            <li> The packaging was excellent and it arrived early than I expected.</li>
            <li> I received the product quickly.</li>
            <li> I will also add that there was no running of the product off my skin, as it really felt like it was well absorbed rather than feeling like it is sitting on top of my skin waiting to be wiped off.  </li>
            <li> It is lightly scented which is nice for my husband and teenage boys.  </li>
            <li> I am SUPER picky about the sunscreen I use because I have a history of skin cancer in my family.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> It is also high in zinc, which I tend to think lasts longer and protects better.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant but not overwhelming like many sunscreens are.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m very interested in seeing how it rates once EWG has a look at it.</li>
            <li> Had a very hot week-end temperatures and even while outdoors product stayed on.  </li>
            <li> When I use a sunscreen product, I expect it to protect me from the sun, but what I particularly noticed &amp; liked about the Sport Sunscreen is that it didn&#x27;t feel very &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and I have to tell you how excited I am to have found a sunscreen that has exactly what I have been looking for.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased that not only did my makeup products apply easily over this sunscreen, it did not get &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; nor did it cake or settle in any areas of my face.</li>
            <li> Very light weight, non greasy and my skin feels soft and fresh all day.  </li>
            <li> Their claim to being waterproof is accurate and much appreciated.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you it is worth</li>
            <li> It’s nice to find a product that will help protect you against the harmful rays of the sun, and help with anti-aging, as I finally hit an age where I am beginning to worry about that.</li>
            <li> not over powering...light and fresh.</li>
            <li> That being said, I sweat A LOT when I exercise, especially outdoors, so this sunscreen is nice because it doesn&#x27;t run into your eyes and sting them when you re-apply it to your face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> At my age (62), the most action I see is a walk three times a week and gardening after work, the point is the lotion stays on and doesn&#x27;t sting.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd product that I have tried from this company and just like the other 2 products I LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> The consistency of the sunscreen is just right</li>
            <li> Right out of the box</li>
            <li> Their is a slight pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Something&#x27;s like this would normally cause a screaming fit.</li>
            <li> I have never been completely happy with any of the sunscreens I have tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and is not thick or greasy.  </li>
            <li> It is not greasy &amp; it&#x27;s  easy to apply to the skin, and it doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky feeling that many other sunscreens do.</li>
            <li> It is non greasy and really has a mild scent.</li>
            <li> I liked the small hole in the top of the lid so not to much comes out at a time.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gone to the beach or been out in the sun very much.</li>
            <li> To me, this is a high quality sunscreen that can easily worn daily as well as for more intense needs.</li>
            <li> It was certainly not greasy or thick, and the smell was pleasant, not too strong or overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much for the opportunity to try this!</li>
            <li> just in time to use over a hot and sunny Pittsburgh weekend.</li>
            <li> Working in hot and humid conditions, the lotion did not need to be reapplied for 2 1/2 to 3 hours.</li>
            <li> I definitely have to say, compared to the sunscreen I used on vacation, this felt more like a skin-softening lotion.  </li>
            <li> Would most definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Second, I love the fact that the Andre Lorent Sport Sunscreen contains vitamins and antioxidants.</li>
            <li> Andre Lorent Sports Sunscreen changed my mind with first use.</li>
            <li> First, I noticed this did not feel like sunscreen when applied</li>
            <li> The first test is the smell.</li>
            <li> We were out in the most crucial part of the day (around lunch) and stayed out all afternoon.</li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t burn after a whole day in the pool!</li>
            <li> I hope my video review helps for anyone who is willing to try this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> After using it my skin felt soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Its hot and humid in the Midwest, and I work out in the heat and sun.  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty pricy sunscreen ($25 for the tube).</li>
            <li> I had much to do outside in the yard and garden decided to give my new Andre Lorent lotion an honest test.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen actually felt good on my hands and absorbed on myskin readily with NO WHITE APPEARANCE OR STICKY RESIDUE.</li>
            <li> The formula of this sunscreen states it is friendly to individuals with sensitive skin, and it is non-greasy.   </li>
            <li> The scent is clean, not heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a lot of different lotions trying to find one that actually protected my skin from burn but none had done a good job</li>
            <li> In my opinion it is a little steep, otherwise I was very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you all the positive things about this product.  </li>
            <li> Amazing sun protection for all types of water and extreme outdoor activity!</li>
            <li> I have finally found my tried and true sunscreen that I will be using all the time!</li>
            <li> After a long hike up a local mountain to pick huckleberries in the bright sun</li>
            <li> This is a very decent sunscreen and it does the job it&#x27;s intended to do.</li>
            <li> However, if you want a product that is not greasy/oily/thick/white/smelly then you should certainly give this a try.  </li>
            <li> This is certainly a product I will consider using again.</li>
            <li> I am certain of this because I did not get burned even though I was at the beach for about two hours.  </li>
            <li> I know they say you can’t judge a book by its cover, but sometimes I will pick certain products based on the color scheme of the product.</li>
            <li> (If I really tried to smell it, there was a light scent, but it was definitely not overwhelming like most brands.)  </li>
            <li> This is a real winner in my book.</li>
            <li> Thanks for giving me the opportunity to try it, I&#x27;d purchase it for myself and friends/family.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about what I put on my skin and my children&#x27;s skin.  </li>
            <li> It feels so smooth and silky and definitely does not leave skin looking or feeling greasy!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As an esthetician, I am really picky about sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the opportunity</li>
            <li> As a result, I have become even more careful using sunscreen when I go out for any reason.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to everyone including children!</li>
            <li> It lasted the whole time we were in the pool splashing around with out any problems.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had much sun to try out the sun block</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week, and I must say I really like it.</li>
            <li> I really like this sunblock.</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> If anyone has any questions, please feel free to leave a comment to my review and I will get back to you!</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are two things I don&#x27;t like much about this product.</li>
            <li> He said the product goes on milky and takes a bit to absorb but during the day, it did not run into his eyes and sting when he sweated, so he really likes this product.</li>
            <li> First, I am hesitant to try a product new to me.</li>
            <li> and when I&#x27;m more active.</li>
            <li> There is no other way to put it other than the fact that this is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> The results are a strawberry blonde little girl with a fair complexion not being sunburned.</li>
            <li> I purchased this with a really decent coupon code</li>
            <li> It soaks in quickly and does not leave you with white streaks.</li>
            <li> That is far more than I generally pay for organic/all-natural sunscreen, so I don&#x27;t think I would buy this on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I knew it was going to be high quality.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> and I can be a bit sensitive to certain products so that is also a bonus.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works as I expected, and since I&#x27;ve had melanoma that is important to me.  </li>
            <li> As my video says, this sunscreen works very well for me (and my 2 year old son).</li>
            <li> Only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about</li>
            <li> No streaking, stinging, or burning sensations and, most importantly to me, no stinky chemical or flowery smell.</li>
            <li> The protest didn&#x27;t last long, it went on smoothly, didn&#x27;t have an odor, lasted and lasted!</li>
            <li> smells nice and is moderately thick.</li>
            <li> I live near St. Louis which has very high humidity and temps</li>
            <li> I find the lotion to have a light feeling and unlike other lotions that seem to &amp;</li>
            <li> I live on the southeast coast</li>
            <li> We live in the mountains of Colorado and spend a ton of time outdoors camping, four wheeling, hiking etc.</li>
            <li> What else I loved about this brand was its thin, not a heavy paste.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this sunscreen did not bother me at all.</li>
            <li> also have very sensitive skin, so that was also a plus, no irritation or stinging when I put it</li>
            <li> I went outside when it was sunny and HOT (mid-90s) for about 1.5 hours.  </li>
            <li> As always, with anything ordered from Amazon, it was delI&#x27;ve red on time and exactly what it was supposed to be in the package.</li>
            <li> I usually do not write reviews on products that I purchase.  </li>
            <li> Since I live near the beach</li>
            <li> It absorbed into my skin with barely any residue left on the surface.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and very sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> Will definitely recommend and use this product as it feels better in my skin than any other I&#x27;ve used!  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, the melanoma was removed with little fuss, and it was self-contained.  </li>
            <li> I try very hard not to because I have such fair skin but thus far this sunscreen has worked as promised.</li>
            <li> For the past several years I&#x27;ve been using the spray-on sunscreens that are quick and convenient, but don&#x27;t seem to provide the adequate protection.  </li>
            <li> Its hard to tell if this is more sunscreen or moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> My family and I went tubing on a clear 90 degree day.</li>
            <li> After applying to your face it disappears and leaves your skin ultra soft.  </li>
            <li> I completely followed the instructions on the box (applying  every two hours).</li>
            <li> My skin felt soft and protected.  </li>
            <li> This product has a very &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; fragrance, which reminds me of regular suntan lotion...</li>
            <li> ( I received it at a discounted price) and I must say I pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> After all, that is the least worry when choosing a sunscreen and the function of this one does just as it should :)</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin but have not had a problem so far</li>
            <li> and I had no heavy, gooey coating on my skin.</li>
            <li> However, it dried to a light and non-greasy feeling product and held up well during my workout.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday , rain or shine, goes on so smoothly-</li>
            <li> I have used it so far on my arms when I am out working in the yard.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that the other sunscreen had over this one is that it was fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend Andre Lorent&#x27;s Sport Sunscreen, especially for any outdoor activities.</li>
            <li> Will update further as I continue the use and see how it does up in high country</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for all ages and I plan to purchase it for family and especially for my son and daughter-in law who also have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This one also has a higher concentration of zinc oxide and other helpful ingredients than anything I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> Once you start to rub it into the skin, it produces that infamous sunscreen smell, which I LOVE!</li>
            <li> I did not have to reapply the product constantly which saved me money, time, and an argument from an 8 year old.</li>
            <li> Since I have to be careful when exposing myself to the sun, I appreciated the warning on the box with regards to Sun Protection Measures.  </li>
            <li> It  has a very faint pleasant scent..</li>
            <li> Honestly, I haven&#x27;t had any bad experiences with this brand and the company is very customer oriented.</li>
            <li> In fact, when I closed my eyes and smelled the product on my arm, it really brought back memories of my toes in the sand with the ocean waves crashing on the shore!  </li>
            <li> The smell is very subtle and doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals, which I love.</li>
            <li> I spent three days at a mountain resort hiking, ziplining and just hanging out, all in the high mountain sunshine.  </li>
            <li> I received my Sport Sunscreen this past Wednesday and started using it right away.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had the strongest sun here since I received the product, but I have used it daily because I have very sensitive &amp; age related dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for those with an active lifestyle in the sun.</li>
            <li> Its also nice that it doesn&#x27;t have that awful sunscreen smell that pretty much all sunscreens have.</li>
            <li> The product is a little bit pricey compared to other sunscreen lotion but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> This surprised me because my other zinc sunscreen that does leave my skin white and sticky has only 4% zinc oxide.</li>
            <li> The packaging proclaims this sunscreen was developed for the “extreme sporting lifestyle” and is water resistant for 80 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It went on smooth and silky, not greasy or heavy feeling, and I never had any skin reaction or burning in my eyes like I have had happen with sunscreens in the past.  </li>
            <li> Light, I don&#x27;t typically like the real heavy feeling of some sunscreens...</li>
            <li> However I am not sure I would spend this much money on this product.  </li>
            <li> I will use up the tube and it&#x27;s a decent product overall, just not a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> I have two young boys and when it says tear less, it means what it says I did acids</li>
            <li> I paid far less to try it out and submit a review.</li>
            <li> I am highly allergic to most sunscreens and the Andre Lorent sunscreen has no parabens or any other bad stuff in it.</li>
            <li> I can be out in the water for about 80 min before I have to reapply it, and it is very water resistant, it doesn&#x27;t just wash away in a few minutes like some other brands do.</li>
            <li> I put it on before my run outdoors and noticed no extra sweat (as I do sometimes with other sport sunscreens) and it kept me protected the entire time.</li>
            <li> I also wiped my forehead a few times, and was certain that it was going to drip down in my eyes and burn.</li>
            <li> It initially goes on white, but only takes a few moments to rub on and then fade.  </li>
            <li> My husband spent all day yesterday at a car show  and while he was outside all day, he did not re-apply the product - and did not get a sunburn.</li>
            <li> there was absolutely no irritation to my eyes or skin and after being out all day, I fell asleep without washing my face last night.  </li>
            <li> It was a smaller bottle than I expected.</li>
            <li> I would definitely be a long term consumer.</li>
            <li> I spent an hour outside today and did not get sunburned at all.</li>
            <li> I regularly use a water resistant sunscreen with at least a 30 rating every day all year long.(Even in snow covered New England.)</li>
            <li> It stayed on, even with activity that might have made it necessary to reapply with other sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> This product goes above and beyond any other sunscreen I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, stays on for a long time!</li>
            <li> Maybe it is a fluke and is just my tube, I searched other reviews and didn&#x27;t see any similar problem.  </li>
            <li> I see a dermatologist on a regular basis due to being diagnosed with Actinic Keratosis.  </li>
            <li> The final test would be if it held up to the test of being active on a 95 degree day.  </li>
            <li> I will be starting a half marathon training program soon and will be using it to protect from the California sun during my long morning runs.  </li>
            <li> I have been careful using various sunscreens throughout my life because I am extremely prone to sunburn.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a different sensitive skin sunscreen before and it was thick and harder to apply.</li>
            <li> The only down fall</li>
            <li> While some may consider it expensive in relation to the commonly known sunscreens, the ultimate protection and the natural feeling is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> One and a half hours later reapplied after being in the water all that time.</li>
            <li> It was one of those days that was semi-cloudy, and not particularly humid -</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first that any sunscreen would be much different than another.</li>
            <li> again today when I went outside and gardened for a little over an hour.  </li>
            <li> I had absolutely no problems.</li>
            <li> It does feel a bit heavy going on, so I am not likely to use it as my day to day sunblock.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this for at the pool or for everyday sunscreen.</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful what I put on my skin also.</li>
            <li> I tried this sunscreen the last few days.</li>
            <li> I have only had this products for a few days.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is minimal, so it didn&#x27;t interfere with any other fragrance was using.  </li>
            <li> Being a resident of Vegas, I always wear sunscreen lotion because of the scorching heat of the sun you usually experience especially during summer time.</li>
            <li> Some of the other sunscreens I had on,y on for about 30 min</li>
            <li> We are both retired, and we won&#x27;t be using the product while we run a marathon - or any other extreme sporting event</li>
            <li> This is a refined product targeting an audience participating in an extreme sporting lifestyle.</li>
            <li> Spent time in our garden, played ball, it didn&#x27;t melt away!</li>
            <li> For example other waterproof sunscreens seem to hold in the heat and make me feel hotter in the sun.</li>
            <li> I will have to order another one due to the summer weather</li>
            <li> That brings me to the other thing I don&#x27;t care for about this product - the price.</li>
            <li> She spends everyday 10-12 hours a day outside and in the sun and harsh chlorinated water.</li>
            <li> This is a sport sunscreen and is recommended for ACTIVE participants.</li>
            <li> I however was not brave enough to actually put it in my eye.</li>
            <li> Not only is it paraben-free it does not feel thick when applying and rubs in well.</li>
            <li> but they all do that due to the nature of the product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve tried a sunscreen that felt this &#x27;dry&#x27; after application.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually like putting this type on my face due to sweating ,rolls down gets in your eyes</li>
            <li> After rubbing it in for a while, it absorbed and wasn&#x27;t terribly sticky like some sunscreens, but it didn&#x27;t absorb as well as normal body lotion</li>
            <li> It is not oily and did not burn my face which I have had issues with in the past with other brands.</li>
            <li> Before I discuss my opinion of this product, I want to tell you a little bit about myself.  </li>
            <li> If face cream or makeup has sunscreen, I usually cannot use it due to my eyes burning and swelling.</li>
            <li> I used it on my face, under my usual makeup and on my other exposed skin.</li>
            <li> For the amount you get I feel this sunscreen is a little pricey at $50</li>
            <li> The kids did not complain of the burning/stinging feeling that they do with EVERY other product and it lasted and lasted!!  </li>
            <li> I received this sunscreen a few days ago and had a chance to try it out this weekend.</li>
            <li> I dried off and re-applied.</li>
            <li> It keeps you protected without being heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> I would have no problem putting this on everyday.</li>
            <li> my daughter, who didn&#x27;t use the sunscreen, was pretty badly sunburned</li>
            <li> I have had trouble in the past with sunscreen feeling to oily on my face, no issues with this product.  </li>
            <li> Normally, I really hate the feel of sunscreens, but this one quickly soaked into my skin</li>
            <li> It was a little thick as I had to rub in a bit to not look like a ghost.</li>
            <li> There is very little smell (the small scent there is,</li>
            <li> Once it was rubbed in I did not feel like an oil slick.  </li>
            <li> My daughter uses sunscreen but as the children play they usually wear off the lotion through sweating.</li>
            <li> Even so, a couple of years ago, I was diagnosed with a small in situ melanoma.  </li>
            <li> The product is definitely not sticky, and I was not in any way uncomfortable wearing it.  </li>
            <li> I was out for over an hour I usually get burned on gave and</li>
            <li> I have been researching the pros and the cons on all the Sunscreen products since I was diagnosed with skin cancer this past year on my nose.  </li>
            <li> Hardly any odor&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has hardly any odor</li>
            <li> It has zinc oxide in it which sometimes makes sunscreen hard to apply</li>
            <li> The product is everything the packaging says it is, it isn&#x27;t greasy or thick.</li>
            <li> It seemed to almost have separated a bit when I went to apply it, so it was quite thick, but a bit watery halfway during application.</li>
            <li> I did use it on my face so no more face sunscreen and goodbye to that waxy sunscreen stick!</li>
            <li> I like that this product uses Zinc Oxide (a natural mineral) instead of crap from a laboratory.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, we had just returned on this past weekend from the beach</li>
            <li> You can burn quickly at high altitude and this did the job of protecting the family without smelling awful or attracting bugs in the outdoors.</li>
            <li> Some sunscreens are too thick and become very difficult to rub in and leave that awful ghostly white skin.</li>
            <li> There are some questionable ingredients</li>
            <li> I hate the sticky, tacky feel of my usual sunscreens and can&#x27;t wait to wash them off my hands.</li>
            <li> There has been a lot in the news lately about kids getting horrible sun burns after using sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Too bad there is not a perfume in this smell.</li>
            <li> I hate walking into a room and people smell that I&#x27;m wearing sunscreen.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Just received the Andr&#x27;e Lorent Ultra Sport Sunscreen so I gave it a try. I live near St. Louis which has very high humidity and temps and I am under strict Dr&#x27;s orders to wear sunscreen when I go outside.&lt;br /&gt; Before I cut the grass I applied the Ultra Sport Sunscreen to my face, legs and arms. It has a pleasing scent and applies easily. I was perspiring quite alot but the sunscreen didnot burn my eyes and it stayed on the entire time I was in the yard.(about an hour)&lt;br /&gt;This works and doesnt burn your eyes.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is awesome. My grand-daughters came over this weekend and we hit the beach. I had just received this purchase and decided that we would all try it out. It was silky smooth and smelled so nice. It lasted for hours and we didn&#x27;t burn at all. I would recommend this to everyone. I have fair skin and I am so impressed. This is a real winner in my book. I had to keep my oldest grand-daughter from sneaking it into her bag and taking it home. She loved it too. Now I have a great gift idea too! Thank you so much for the opportunity to try this!</li>
            <li> My Sport Sunscreen Lotion arrived Friday...just in time to use over a hot and sunny Pittsburgh weekend. I had much to do outside in the yard and garden decided to give my new Andre Lorent lotion an honest test.  First, I am hesitant to try a product new to me. I am blonde hair, light eyes, and have very fair skin which easily burns. I was pleased at how easily the lotion was to apply to my arms and legs. I was amazed at how well it worked on my face. I am especially sensitive to many skin care products, but this sunscreen lotion did not cause any reactions and still did a fantastic job at protecting my skin. Working in hot and humid conditions, the lotion did not need to be reapplied for 2 1/2 to 3 hours. My skin was well protected and the lotion smells good too!</li>
            <li> I received this on Saturday and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out!  For the past several years I&#x27;ve been using the spray-on sunscreens that are quick and convenient, but don&#x27;t seem to provide the adequate protection.  The very first thing I noticed was that the lotion is NOT greasy--not at all!  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve tried a sunscreen that felt this &#x27;dry&#x27; after application.  Even the spray-ons leave a greasy feeling, but this one did not!  There was also little-to-no smell.  (If I really tried to smell it, there was a light scent, but it was definitely not overwhelming like most brands.)  Now for the true test.  I went outside when it was sunny and HOT (mid-90s) for about 1.5 hours.  I sweated.  A lot.  No burn, no redness at all from the sun.  I used it again yesterday, for about the same amount of time and had the same result.  Non-greasy feel + protection from the sun &#x3D; happy customer!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m outdoors all the time in the Western Montana sun.  I like that this product uses Zinc Oxide (a natural mineral) instead of crap from a laboratory.  Its hard to tell if this is more sunscreen or moisturizer.  After applying to your face it disappears and leaves your skin ultra soft.  After a long hike up a local mountain to pick huckleberries in the bright sun I had no burn and no bad taste from sweat dripping of my face.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I received my order 2 days ago and I used it right away so that I would be able to give my opinion regarding the product. Thus far, the product is very effective in preventing sunburns and give you confidence that your skin will be protected from ultraviolet rays. Being a resident of Vegas, I always wear sunscreen lotion because of the scorching heat of the sun you usually experience especially during summer time. The product is a little bit pricey compared to other sunscreen lotion but it is worth it. However, I got a deal on it; the product was on sale when I bought it. Sometimes, I go to our neighboring stores by just walking and this sunscreen lotion will make me feel confident that I am protected from sunburns and ultraviolet rays. The packaging was excellent and it arrived early than I expected. I will recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I received the Andre Lorent Sunscreen one day after ordering!  I was very pleased by the non greasy formula and how nice it made my skin feel!  I don&#x27;t like the smell of most sunscreens but this one has a pleasant soft smell that I like.  I will definitely recommend this sunscreen to my family and friends for purchase.</li>
            <li> I received my suntan lotion yesterday and got to use it today. I have fallen in love with this product. One of the reasons why I like it is because they do not do animal testing with their product. I have two young boys and when it says tear less, it means what it says I did acids you get it in my youngest child&#x27;s eyes. Something&#x27;s like this would normally cause a screaming fit. This time he rubbed his eye and let me continue. That was impressive. Also I like how once applied the water simply ran of their skin, however the product was not oily or greasy feeling. There is no other way to put it other than the fact that this is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this with a really decent coupon code so I was excited to give this product a try. Although I haven&#x27;t gotten the opportunity to use it in the sun yet, I did test it out on my arm to get a sense of how I would like it had I brought it to the beach.  Unfortunately, we had just returned on this past weekend from the beach and I ordered the product on Sunday night.  I definitely have to say, compared to the sunscreen I used on vacation, this felt more like a skin-softening lotion.  It initially goes on white, but only takes a few moments to rub on and then fade.  It absorbed into my skin with barely any residue left on the surface.  It was certainly not greasy or thick, and the smell was pleasant, not too strong or overwhelming.  In fact, when I closed my eyes and smelled the product on my arm, it really brought back memories of my toes in the sand with the ocean waves crashing on the shore!  I can&#x27;t say how it does in the sun since I haven&#x27;t used it yet.  However, if you want a product that is not greasy/oily/thick/white/smelly then you should certainly give this a try.  I will update my review with how well I feel the sun protection was when I go out in the sun this weekend.</li>
            <li> I received my sport sunscreen lotion. I attended an outdoor festival with &amp;#62;90 degree temperatures , in the hottest part of the day.  I completely followed the instructions on the box (applying  every two hours). I find the lotion to have a light feeling and unlike other lotions that seem to &amp;#34;sweat off&amp;#34;, I  continued to feel the sun protection throughout the day.  While some may consider it expensive in relation to the commonly known sunscreens, the ultimate protection and the natural feeling is well worth the price. I highly recommend this product for those with an active lifestyle in the sun.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin so was excited to see a sunscreen that sounded promising. I received the product quickly. My husband and I love to kayak and we also go to Belize when we can. I&#x27;ve gone through a lot of different lotions trying to find one that actually protected my skin from burn but none had done a good job so was eager to try it out. The sport sunscreen is so smooth like a nice face cream. If it&#x27;s sunny I am using it as my facial under makeup moisturizer (but don&#x27;t tell my husband). It&#x27;s a nice lotion plus protects my skin. I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I received this sunscreen earlier today. First, I have to say the packaging is very attractive. As always, with anything ordered from Amazon, it was delI&#x27;ve red on time and exactly what it was supposed to be in the package. The next thing I noticed was when I opened the box. The scent is pleasant but not overwhelming like many sunscreens are. I feel as though I can wear this sunscreen on a daily basis and not just when I&#x27;m going to the pool or to the beach. I decided to take my daughter to the pool today and I used this on us both. Their claim to being waterproof is accurate and much appreciated. I did not have to reapply the product constantly which saved me money, time, and an argument from an 8 year old. The results are a strawberry blonde little girl with a fair complexion not being sunburned. Also, I noticed the place directly under her eyes that always seems to turn pink was not today when we arrived home from the pool. This is certainly a product I will consider using again.</li>
            <li> I received the Andre Lorent Sport Sunscreen Lotion the day before we went to Soak City USA, so we were able to try it out for the day. When I applied to my skin, it went on smoothly with no greasy feeling. Went in the water and my skin still didn&#x27;t feel greasy or like the lotion was washing off. One and a half hours later reapplied after being in the water all that time. No sunburn!! I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The lotion applied easily and absorbed quickly with no oily residue or stickiness.  The scent is clean, not heavy. I live in Minnesota and it is warm &amp; humid today.  I took my dog out for a run, with a hazy sun. My Andre Lorent Sport Sunscreen lotion did not run nor did it &amp;#34;sweat off&amp;#34;. My skin felt soft and protected.  Great product! Thanks for giving me the opportunity to try it, I&#x27;d purchase it for myself and friends/family.</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased &amp; tried this product &amp; I think this is a great sunscreen! It is not greasy &amp; it&#x27;s  easy to apply to the skin, and it doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky feeling that many other sunscreens do. I also thought it had a nice scent to it, not too strong.&lt;br /&gt; I would definitely recommend this product to others!</li>
            <li> Sunscreen goes on easy, not greasy. Pleasant smell. Out all day, did not burn. Definitely  would buy again.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!!  I am very picky about what I put on my skin and my children&#x27;s skin.  I love the that this product is paraben free and it is water and sweat resistant.  I live on the southeast coast so I had an opportunity to use this sunscreen at the beach today!  This product has a very &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; fragrance, which reminds me of regular suntan lotion...mmmm!  It was a little thick as I had to rub in a bit to not look like a ghost. Once it was rubbed in I did not feel like an oil slick.  It absorbed great!  The only thing that stung my eyes today was the salt water.  Not my sunscreen!  The best part.....I did not burn and my pores did not clog.  I am a happy beach goin&#x27; camper!</li>
            <li> I just received this and love it!!!!!  It feels so smooth and silky and definitely does not leave skin looking or feeling greasy!!!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> My Andre Lorent Sunscreen arrived just in time for me to take it on vacation with me.  I put it to the test over three days at high altitude to see if it was as good as it was advertised.  It was!  I spent three days at a mountain resort hiking, ziplining and just hanging out, all in the high mountain sunshine.  I had perfect protection from the intense sun rays with an initial application in the morning, and a touch up reapplication in the afternoon.  It stayed on, even with activity that might have made it necessary to reapply with other sunscreens.  It went on smooth and silky, not greasy or heavy feeling, and I never had any skin reaction or burning in my eyes like I have had happen with sunscreens in the past.  The fragrance is minimal, so it didn&#x27;t interfere with any other fragrance was using.  I will be starting a half marathon training program soon and will be using it to protect from the California sun during my long morning runs.  I would highly recommend Andre Lorent&#x27;s Sport Sunscreen, especially for any outdoor activities.</li>
            <li> Andre Lorent did it again, I been using my sport sunscreen now for a week ( I received it at a discounted price) and I must say I pleasantly surprised. The sunscreen is easy to apply and it has a light scent to it, not like most sunscreens, that make you smell like a coconut. I am highly allergic to most sunscreens and the Andre Lorent sunscreen has no parabens or any other bad stuff in it. I also like that it is very easy to apply, you don&#x27;t have to rub it in for &amp;#34; hours&amp;#34; and you don&#x27;t look all pasty afterwards. I can be out in the water for about 80 min before I have to reapply it, and it is very water resistant, it doesn&#x27;t just wash away in a few minutes like some other brands do. Some of the other sunscreens I had on,y on for about 30 min and I started to burn up, but not the Andre Lorent sport sunscreen, in my book this is truly the best sunscreen on the market right now. Let me tell you it is worth it&#x27;s money in gold, and I am so glad I purchased it. I will definitely stick with Andre Lorent and nothing can bring me to give it up again. I also know that I am protected and don&#x27;t have to worry about skin cancer. I hope you will all give it a try, I am sure glad I did it . Have a great day and fun outdoors with the best sunscreen ever.</li>
            <li> I received this sunscreen a few days ago and had a chance to try it out this weekend. It is a great product. SPF 30+, water resistant for 80+ minutes.  Loved that it is hypoallergenic, also loved that it has 10% zinc. It is non greasy and really has a mild scent. Goes on easily.  I have three boys and spend a lot of time outdoors with them.  Used it on their faces and even while playing sports it remained on and provided great protection.  It is also moisturizing. Plan to use it to protect tattoos from the sun so they don&#x27;t fade.</li>
            <li> I like that this sunscreen doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance and it comes in a convenient tube. As this is a new product, EWG hasn&#x27;t reviewed it yet, so you have to do your own legwork to determine the safety of the ingredients. There are some questionable ingredients so I&#x27;m very interested in seeing how it rates once EWG has a look at it.</li>
            <li> Received this sunscreen and I LOVE it!  It has a great fragrance, stays on when I am doing things outside and is an all around great product!</li>
            <li> First off,I love using my Amazon Prime , the Two day shipping &amp; free shipping is so worth the membership .I bought Andre  Lorent Sport Sunscreen &amp; am pleased with this purchase . it&#x27;s not greasy like most lotion sunscreen . the smell is pleasant ,very light . I don&#x27;t usually like putting this type on my face due to sweating ,rolls down gets in your eyes ( you get the picture) but this penetrates your skin quickly leaving it with a feeling of non oily coverage.so it felt good .I&#x27;ll continue to use &amp; am going to use under my makeup as it is moisturizing as well . I would like it even more if it were  in a spray form</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy this sunscreen is great for sensitive skin and is paraben free! The product is everything the packaging says it is, it isn&#x27;t greasy or thick. I&#x27;ve tried a different sensitive skin sunscreen before and it was thick and harder to apply. This one also has a higher concentration of zinc oxide and other helpful ingredients than anything I&#x27;ve seen. The only thing that the other sunscreen had over this one is that it was fragrance free. If you like the smell of sunscreen though then you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem with this option. After all, that is the least worry when choosing a sunscreen and the function of this one does just as it should :)</li>
            <li> Received this item and immediately put it to work.  Used in 95 degree heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Easy to squeeze tube&lt;br /&gt;  Goes on skin well and is not greasy&lt;br /&gt;  Hardly any odor&lt;br /&gt;  Works very well under heavy heat and humidity&lt;br /&gt;  Stays in the skin through sweat&lt;br /&gt;  Does not sting eyes or cause watering&lt;br /&gt;  Excellent skin protection&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Did reapply to face after three hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product does exactly what it advertises in a pleasant to use , easily portable package. Would most definitely recommend</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic sunscreen! As an esthetician, I am really picky about sunscreen.  It was perfect for my face, and my body. Even after sweating and swimming in a tropical climate I was able to prevent sunburn and walk away with a lovely tan. My biggest concern with sunscreen is that most clog my pores and irritate my skin. This was gentle, effective and kept me break out free.</li>
            <li> I received my sunscreen lotion when it was promised. My daughter&#x27;s family and I had gone out for a family get together and since this is Georgia in the middle of summer I decided to use the Andre Lorent Sport Sunscreen Lotion on my grandsons. They are very fair skinned and are always getting sunburned. My daughter uses sunscreen but as the children play they usually wear off the lotion through sweating. We had been there for about 4 hours and that evening when we went home my daughter, who didn&#x27;t use the sunscreen, was pretty badly sunburned but my grandsons weren&#x27;t even red. The lotion never sweated off or came off while they were swimming. I would rate this a 5 star for ease of use and for the excellent protection.</li>
            <li> Received the sunscreen and had the opportunity to use this weekend as we took a trip to the beach for my son&#x27;s 9th birthday.  The product was amazing as we were all in the pool, sun and saltwater ALL day!  The kids did not complain of the burning/stinging feeling that they do with EVERY other product and it lasted and lasted!!  We shared with our friends and all were equally impressed!  So glad to have found a product we can all use and one that really works!  Thanks so much for developing a GREAT sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Waited to write review until I had actually had some time to use and see reaction of my skin.  So, first review, wonderful texture, goes on super easy and spreads on skin easily.  Light, I don&#x27;t typically like the real heavy feeling of some sunscreens...but this one is great!  It works as I expected, and since I&#x27;ve had melanoma that is important to me.  Only thing I&#x27;m not crazy about is the white color it leaves but they all do that due to the nature of the product! Will definitely recommend and use this product as it feels better in my skin than any other I&#x27;ve used!  Will update further as I continue the use and see how it does up in high country and when I&#x27;m more active.</li>
            <li> Received my order on Saturday and used it over the week-end.  Very pleased with the product.  Easy to apply.  Non-greasy when applied with a light scent.  Had a very hot week-end temperatures and even while outdoors product stayed on.  I have extremely sensitive skin but have not had a problem so far and I believe the zinc oxide in the product is why.</li>
            <li> Both myself and my husband were very pleased with our first time using your product. My husband spent all day yesterday at a car show  and while he was outside all day, he did not re-apply the product - and did not get a sunburn. It was one of those days that was semi-cloudy, and not particularly humid - so he didn&#x27;t feel that he had been sweating profusely and needed to re-apply. My husband is rather fair skinned and normally burns quite easily. He did not get burned at all. When I use a sunscreen product, I expect it to protect me from the sun, but what I particularly noticed &amp; liked about the Sport Sunscreen is that it didn&#x27;t feel very &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; when I applied it. Normally, I really hate the feel of sunscreens, but this one quickly soaked into my skin and I had no heavy, gooey coating on my skin. We are both retired, and we won&#x27;t be using the product while we run a marathon - or any other extreme sporting event - so I can&#x27;t give you feedback from that perspective. I look forward to using it again, and because of my delight with the &amp;#34;non-sticky&amp;#34; feel, I think I will try using it on my face. Thanks for the opportunity&lt;br /&gt;to try this product! I don&#x27;t think I would have known about it if not given the opportunity to try it with the unique program through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I just received this sunscreen about a week ago and have had a couple of opportunities to try it out.  The consistency of the sunscreen is just right and it is easy to apply. It is not oily and did not burn my face which I have had issues with in the past with other brands. I was out at the pool for several hours and did not burn. My only concern with this product is the price. In my opinion it is a little steep, otherwise I was very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try this Sport Sunscreen Lotion through Amazon.  Before I discuss my opinion of this product, I want to tell you a little bit about myself.  I am a red head with a very fair complexion who happens to live in Florida.  I have been careful using various sunscreens throughout my life because I am extremely prone to sunburn.  Even so, a couple of years ago, I was diagnosed with a small in situ melanoma.  Fortunately, the melanoma was removed with little fuss, and it was self-contained.  As a result, I have become even more careful using sunscreen when I go out for any reason.  Since I live near the beach and I love to garden, this occurs quite often.  Over the years I have used many types of sunscreen.  I have struggled with sunscreens coming off when I get in the water and being sticky. I have never been completely happy with any of the sunscreens I have tried in the past.  This all changed when I tried Andre Lorent Ultra Sport Sunscreen SPF 30+.  The packaging proclaims this sunscreen was developed for the “extreme sporting lifestyle” and is water resistant for 80 minutes.  Since I have to be careful when exposing myself to the sun, I appreciated the warning on the box with regards to Sun Protection Measures.  The box suggests individuals should limit time in the sun between 10 AM – 2 PM.  This is good advice when living in Florida.  The formula of this sunscreen states it is friendly to individuals with sensitive skin, and it is non-greasy.   I tried this sunscreen this weekend when I went to the beach and again today when I went outside and gardened for a little over an hour.  The product is definitely not sticky, and I was not in any way uncomfortable wearing it.  Furthermore, it did not wash off when I was in the ocean.  I am certain of this because I did not get burned even though I was at the beach for about two hours.  My skin is so fair, I would normally be sunburned within 30 minutes.  I would highly recommend this product.  Not only was the sunscreen excellent, but the service from the company was also outstanding.  The product arrived when scheduled, and the company followed up with an email requesting feedback.  I have used many sunscreens during my life, and this one is the best product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:67dcfbb849415f9ebfd47d0e6835b320]] Received the Andre Lorent Ultra Sport Sunscreen today. Right out of the box I knew it was going to be high quality. It has hardly any odor and it goes on the skin very smoothly. It soaks in quickly and does not leave you with white streaks. My skin reacted to it like it was a moisturizer.  It is so light you could use it on your face. Used it for my 4 mile run and I could not even tell I had it on.  No streaking, stinging, or burning sensations and, most importantly to me, no stinky chemical or flowery smell. This product goes above and beyond any other sunscreen I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> I know they say you can’t judge a book by its cover, but sometimes I will pick certain products based on the color scheme of the product. The first thing that I loved about Andre Lorent Sport Sunscreen, is the color scheme. I am a very visual person, and love bright, bold colors. Second, I love the fact that the Andre Lorent Sport Sunscreen contains vitamins and antioxidants. It’s nice to find a product that will help protect you against the harmful rays of the sun, and help with anti-aging, as I finally hit an age where I am beginning to worry about that. Third, I loved the way it felt when you put the product on. It soaked in, and wasn’t greasy; it felt as if I had just put on my favorite lotion.  I loved the way it felt. The final test would be if it held up to the test of being active on a 95 degree day.  I lathered myself up, and went to work in the yard.  I loved the fact that it didn&#x27;t feel as if it was oozing from my pores along with my sweat. I also wiped my forehead a few times, and was certain that it was going to drip down in my eyes and burn. To my amazement, it didn&#x27;t burn. I stayed outside for about an hour and didn&#x27;t sunburn at all. I would definitely recommend this product to all my family and friends. I would also recommend it to people that I do not know.</li>
            <li> I received this sunscreen as I was about to work in my yard! It was wonderful!  Stayed on...non greasy. ..lasted for the 2 hrs that I was outside....loved the scent too....not over powering...light and fresh. Would definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> Fantastic Sunscreen!  I like that you can wear this while hiking, running, etc. The non-greasy formula goes on smoothly and I love that it is Paba-Free! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I buy this product for my daughter that is a head lifeguard, coach and swim teacher. She is very fair and has sensitive skin. She spends everyday 10-12 hours a day outside and in the sun and harsh chlorinated water. She loves André Lorent Ultra Sport Sunscreen The moisturizing  and healing properties are wonderful and soothing. The non greasy formula is perfect for being non slippery when hands on with the little ones.  The fact that it is great for Sensitive Skin and Paraben Free makes me feel safe about using it for all my kids!</li>
            <li> This is not your discount store, mainstream sunscreen.  It does not apply like an oil or like a lotion.  It does not have a strong odor.  It does not sting the eyes.  What does it do?  It protects and it feels good; silky.  It moisturizers.  It stays on.  It helps heal the skin.  This is a refined product targeting an audience participating in an extreme sporting lifestyle.</li>
            <li> I received this at discount rate and I&#x27;m happy with the protection I used when I was mowing the lawn at 84 degree weather I like the way it applies and looks after you apply I tried to get picture with it on my arm. I like the scent. I was out for over an hour I usually get burned on gave and and it protected me. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first that any sunscreen would be much different than another. Andre Lorent Sports Sunscreen changed my mind with first use. I have sensitive skin and very sensitive eyes. If face cream or makeup has sunscreen, I usually cannot use it due to my eyes burning and swelling. Yeaterday I had a golf tournament for work and decided to give my Andre Lorent Sport Sunscreen a try. I used it on my face, under my usual makeup and on my other exposed skin. First, I noticed this did not feel like sunscreen when applied and it did not look like sunscreen after application. It felt light and breathable, much more like a quality moisturizer than a sunscreen. I hate the sticky, tacky feel of my usual sunscreens and can&#x27;t wait to wash them off my hands. This sunscreen actually felt good on my hands and absorbed on myskin readily with NO WHITE APPEARANCE OR STICKY RESIDUE. (Yes, I am picky and notice textures and how things feel.) This surprised me because my other zinc sunscreen that does leave my skin white and sticky has only 4% zinc oxide. This sunscreen has 10% zinc oxide. I really liked the quality ingredients of this sunscreen: zinc, vitamins A and E, and free of unwanted adfditives. I was pleased that not only did my makeup products apply easily over this sunscreen, it did not get &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; nor did it cake or settle in any areas of my face. My makeup looked great all day out in the sun. there was absolutely no irritation to my eyes or skin and after being out all day, I fell asleep without washing my face last night.  NO burning, itching, or swelling this morning. I will also add that there was no running of the product off my skin, as it really felt like it was well absorbed rather than feeling like it is sitting on top of my skin waiting to be wiped off.  To me, this is a high quality sunscreen that can easily worn daily as well as for more intense needs. It actually feels good on my skin as well as protecting it from sun damage. Glad to find something I can use on my face without irritation.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because the over the counter sunscreens are just not working; no matter how many times I re-apply. This is a sport sunscreen and is recommended for ACTIVE participants. The first test is the smell. This lotion smells wonderful. Out of the tube it has a citrusy smell; very pleasant and refreshing. It is a white lotion so it makes it easy to see where you are applying and areas that might be missed. Once you start to rub it into the skin, it produces that infamous sunscreen smell, which I LOVE! Too bad there is not a perfume in this smell. I would definitely purchase and wear it! I used this product yesterday while in the pool. It worked great. We were out in the most crucial part of the day (around lunch) and stayed out all afternoon. I re-applied once after one hour. I dried off and re-applied. I had absolutely no problems. Not one red blotch!  It is non-greasy, which I love! I have very sensitive skin and this sunscreen did not bother me at all. I do like the fact that it is Paba-Free &amp; hypoallergenic. I did use it on my face so no more face sunscreen and goodbye to that waxy sunscreen stick! I highly recommend this product to everyone including children! A+</li>
            <li> I like that this is a non-chemical sunblock.  It does feel a bit heavy going on, so I am not likely to use it as my day to day sunblock.  However, it dried to a light and non-greasy feeling product and held up well during my workout.</li>
            <li> Amazing! My grand daughter (the fairest of fair) tried this under protest. The protest didn&#x27;t last long, it went on smoothly, didn&#x27;t have an odor, lasted and lasted! In our Louisiana climate, it was 103 with a heat index of 115! She didn&#x27;t burn after a whole day in the pool! Spent time in our garden, played ball, it didn&#x27;t melt away! She took it home with her!</li>
            <li> Great product.  I just received this and was excited to try it as I have three kids ages 9, 7, and 4 and we have a pool so they are outside all day playing and in the pool.  It was a smaller bottle than I expected. 3.4 ounces.  It has a nice soft sent and doesn&#x27;t smell like most sunscreen.  It goes on smoothly and is not thick or greasy.  It lasted the whole time we were in the pool splashing around with out any problems.  I applied this to my kids on everything but faces as it did not say if it is tear free or not.  I tried on my own face and I didn&#x27;t feel any signs of stinging while in the water.  I however was not brave enough to actually put it in my eye. Over all I think this is a great product and is made from the safer ingredients then most cheap sunscreens.  However I am not sure I would spend this much money on this product.  I think there are equivalent sunscreens that are either cheaper or you get more for the price. That said though it is a wonderful product and if the price was right I would definitely be a long term consumer.</li>
            <li> Great product doesn&#x27;t feel greasy goes on smooth.  Haven&#x27;t had much sun to try out the sun block but I love the way it feels when you apply it to your skin.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is wonderful.  It keeps you protected without being heavy or greasy.  It is lightly scented which is nice for my husband and teenage boys.  I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Love it although we haven&#x27;t had much sun I still tried it.  It goes on smooth and it&#x27;s not greasy or sticky great product.  I ordered this via my husband account since he has prime.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week, and I must say I really like it. There isn&#x27;t an overwhelming &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; smell. The smell is very subtle and doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals, which I love. I hate walking into a room and people smell that I&#x27;m wearing sunscreen. Also, it&#x27;s not greasy at all. Which is a big thing for me since I need to take care of my skin, so I wear sunscreen daily, not just when I&#x27;m going to spend a lot of time outdoors. That being said, I sweat A LOT when I exercise, especially outdoors, so this sunscreen is nice because it doesn&#x27;t run into your eyes and sting them when you re-apply it to your face. Honestly, I haven&#x27;t had any bad experiences with this brand and the company is very customer oriented. Great product!</li>
            <li> I like this sunscreen, it&#x27;s a lot thicker then most, as stays on for a good amount of time! I&#x27;m on a medication that I&#x27;m not suppose to be out in the sun, but with this lotion so for so good, no burn! Which works for me!</li>
            <li> the packaging was excellent as was the delivery on time. This is an excellent product.Would recommend to anyone-I have used on my arms and face and actually is almost like a moisturiser .my arms and face are so smooth and the product remained on my skin all day-the smell was so light in odor-no one would know that you have sunscreen on your body-I use it everyday , rain or shine, goes on so smoothly-</li>
            <li> I was given a discount to rate this sunscreen. I am very happy with this product. I absolutely love the scent. If you like the scent of copper**** you will like this. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all!! I would have no problem putting this on everyday. I spent an hour outside today and did not get sunburned at all. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but worth it. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I received my Sport Sunscreen this past Wednesday and started using it right away.  It is truly amazing.  Very light weight, non greasy and my skin feels soft and fresh all day.  At my age (62), the most action I see is a walk three times a week and gardening after work, the point is the lotion stays on and doesn&#x27;t sting. It is definitely a good product and one I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Stays on well, non greasy, perfect for outdoor sports!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had the strongest sun here since I received the product, but I have used it daily because I have very sensitive &amp; age related dry skin.  The product does not leave a greasy film on the skin and also leaves my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> I liked this product very much. It was very effective in 90 degree heat and high humidity.  Non greasy and pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Works well and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> Nice sunscreen. Not greasy, stays on for a long time!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:47dba2f2272ef27cce7d936ac435a986]] As my video says, this sunscreen works very well for me (and my 2 year old son). There is very little smell (the small scent there is, it is pleasant). I hope my video review helps for anyone who is willing to try this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> We live in the mountains of Colorado and spend a ton of time outdoors camping, four wheeling, hiking etc. This sunscreen is awesome! There&#x27;s no overpowering chemical odor and it wasn&#x27;t sticky like some sunscreens can be. It&#x27;s very smooth going on, not runny  and worked great. You can burn quickly at high altitude and this did the job of protecting the family without smelling awful or attracting bugs in the outdoors. Love the stuff!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen provides great waterproof coverage.  I have had trouble in the past with sunscreen feeling to oily on my face, no issues with this product.  Amazing sun protection for all types of water and extreme outdoor activity!</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a couple of days now. It goes on smoothly and with no greasy feel and does not leave a greasy residue on everything you touch. I love that it is paraben free. After using it my skin felt soft and smooth. I used it in the afternoon at the pool and as a sunscreen it worked well. It did not sting my eyes or my daughter&#x27;s eyes. Their is a slight pleasant scent. I liked this sunscreen better than others because my skin could still breathe. For example other waterproof sunscreens seem to hold in the heat and make me feel hotter in the sun. This did not do that. I would definitely recommend this for at the pool or for everyday sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I really like this sunblock. It goes on smoothly and lightly.</li>
            <li> I Love the smell and feel of this sunscreen.  My husband is an official for peewee baseball and football so spends a lot of time in the sun.  He will have this tube in his bag to protect his head and neck!!</li>
            <li> There has been a lot in the news lately about kids getting horrible sun burns after using sunscreen. Ive been looking for a reliable brand that i wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about.&lt;br /&gt;Andre Lorent sunscreen is amazing. My family and I went tubing on a clear 90 degree day. We applied the Andre Lorent sunscreen before we left the house. Not one of us even got a hint of red. It def works!  What else I loved about this brand was its thin, not a heavy paste. Its non oily formula was great for my skin and my teenage son. No breakouts!</li>
            <li> smells nice and is moderately thick. Because it leaves a white cast you might as well use something a bit stronger your face...</li>
            <li> Very pleased with how well it goes on and feels...not greasy feeling like a lot of them</li>
            <li> Works well!!! Not greasy!!! Great product!!</li>
            <li> I received the product free to review and think its well worth the money. This is the only sunscreen i will purchase in the future. No nasty smell. Stays on great. Doesnt leave a greasy residue like most.</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen. It has a very nice texture to it. Some sunscreens are too thick and become very difficult to rub in and leave that awful ghostly white skin. This one however applies well and easily rubs in. I haven&#x27;t gone to the beach or been out in the sun very much. I try very hard not to because I have such fair skin but thus far this sunscreen has worked as promised. Its also nice that it doesn&#x27;t have that awful sunscreen smell that pretty much all sunscreens have. I also feel comfortable with the ingredients in this one and the fact they are not tested on animals is a huge plus in my book. The only reason I took off one star was because of price. For the amount you get I feel this sunscreen is a little pricey at $50 however the quality is there so if your budget allows I would definitely recommend Andre Lorent!</li>
            <li> So glad to have gotten in on this deal. Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I&#x27;m beach bound in about 2 weeks! Came just in time. I haven&#x27;t been in the sun yet and I&#x27;m sure this will do a great job of protecting me.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is great! It&#x27;s not greasy and kept me sunburn-free all day at the beach.  I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> I love the easy application and consistency of this sunscreen. It has a pleasant odor and doesn&#x27;t have that overpowering sunscreen odor to it.  It does work, I have sweated outside for 3 hours and didn&#x27;t burn.&lt;br /&gt; The only down fall I had fluorescent yellow marks all over me where I applied the sunscreen.  They appeared about 20 min after application. Tested it out another day, same problem again.  Maybe it is a fluke and is just my tube, I searched other reviews and didn&#x27;t see any similar problem.  For that reason I will never go out in public again wearing this sunscreen, lol. For what it&#x27;s worth it does offer good sun protection !</li>
            <li> I received the product within 2 days of ordering. The lotion is very rich and creamy and exactly as it was described on the order.</li>
            <li> I usually do not write reviews on products that I purchase.  However, I purchased Andre’ Lorent’s Ultra Sport Suncreen SPF 30+  and I have to tell you how excited I am to have found a sunscreen that has exactly what I have been looking for.  I have been researching the pros and the cons on all the Sunscreen products since I was diagnosed with skin cancer this past year on my nose.  I ordered Ultra sport sunscreen and I received it within two days time .  Let me tell you all the positive things about this product.  It has Zinc Oxide and Sundrisol7, which is an anti-aging agent, a great protection against the dangers of the sun-rays. This product has  Vitamin E and Vitamin B-5. It makes my skin feel like I used my favorite moisturizer.  It is not greasy, I can’t’ even tell that I have put it on.  I have a lot of allergies so I have to be careful what I put on my skin also. The best part of all for me is that I could use it on my face. It didn’t burn and neither did it run into my eyes when I was in the water. LOVE IT!!! LOVE IT, LOVE IT.!  I would recommend this product for all ages and I plan to purchase it for family and especially for my son and daughter-in law who also have very sensitive skin. If anyone has any questions, please feel free to leave a comment to my review and I will get back to you!</li>
            <li> I received  the Andre Lorent 30+ Ultra Sport Sunscreen.from Amazon..I have fair skin and spend a lot of time in the sun. I see a dermatologist on a regular basis due to being diagnosed with Actinic Keratosis.  I regularly use a water resistant sunscreen with at least a 30 rating every day all year long.(Even in snow covered New England.) I tried this sunscreen the last few days. It  has a very faint pleasant scent.. It has zinc oxide in it which sometimes makes sunscreen hard to apply but it this  sunscreen applied easily and rubbed in well. I liked the small hole in the top of the lid so not to much comes out at a time. I used it outdoors while gardening and also at the beach and it held up well.  No sunburn and no  burning sunscreen feeling in my eyes from sweating. I used in on both my face and the rest of my exposed skin. I did reapply after swimming (as instructed by my doctor).I Would  definitely purchase again depending on cost.  I use  a lot of lotion so I do shop around for  sales.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd product that I have tried from this company and just like the other 2 products I LOVE IT!!!! I am SUPER picky about the sunscreen I use because I have a history of skin cancer in my family. I love the sun but I must use a sunscreen that is going to protect my fair skin. I put this sunscreen to the test this last Saturday when I was out on a friends boat. I am so happy with the protection I got all day and how well the lotion held up in all the water activities I did. I have finally found my tried and true sunscreen that I will be using all the time!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this sporty sunscreen. Not only is it paraben-free it does not feel thick when applying and rubs in well. No greased up feeling, didn&#x27;t bother my eyes even with sweating. I put it on before my run outdoors and noticed no extra sweat (as I do sometimes with other sport sunscreens) and it kept me protected the entire time. This is my second sunscreen from Andre Lorent and I will be a repeat customer from now on!</li>
            <li> I have only had this products for a few days.  I have used it so far on my arms when I am out working in the yard.  Goes on without being greasy.  Dries quickly.  Has a nice scent.  The true test will be when I go to the beach in a month!</li>
            <li> This product is great. I will recommend this to my friends and family. I will have to order another one due to the summer weather</li>
            <li> Its hot and humid in the Midwest, and I work out in the heat and sun.  This lotion went on smooth and didn&#x27;t sweat off, so I liked it!&lt;br /&gt;I also have very sensitive skin, so that was also a plus, no irritation or stinging when I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> This is a very decent sunscreen and it does the job it&#x27;s intended to do. I appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t have some of the harmful ingredients a lot of sunscreens have. That&#x27;s a huge bonus for me. It is also high in zinc, which I tend to think lasts longer and protects better. That said, I don&#x27;t think it goes on terribly smooth. It seemed to almost have separated a bit when I went to apply it, so it was quite thick, but a bit watery halfway during application. After rubbing it in for a while, it absorbed and wasn&#x27;t terribly sticky like some sunscreens, but it didn&#x27;t absorb as well as normal body lotion so I definitely felt like I had sunscreen on. I wore it to the pool for about an hour and had no problems with protection and it seemed to stay on just fine. I didn&#x27;t experience any reaction from it either and I can be a bit sensitive to certain products so that is also a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two things I don&#x27;t like much about this product. One is the fragrance. It&#x27;s very light, but I found it a bit displeasing. That wouldn&#x27;t necessarily deter me if it was the best sunscreen around at a great price. That brings me to the other thing I don&#x27;t care for about this product - the price. This is a pretty pricy sunscreen ($25 for the tube). That is far more than I generally pay for organic/all-natural sunscreen, so I don&#x27;t think I would buy this on a regular basis. I paid far less to try it out and submit a review. I will use up the tube and it&#x27;s a decent product overall, just not a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> Reallly good product. I had my husband try it because he is in construction and is in the sun all day. He said the product goes on milky and takes a bit to absorb but during the day, it did not run into his eyes and sting when he sweated, so he really likes this product.</li>
