            <li>This stuff is AMAZING!!</li>
            <li>Great for at-home nail care.</li>
            <li>Have used this strengther for years will good results.  </li>
            <li>I never could have imagined my nails looking this good.</li>
            <li>I use this on it&#x27;s own as a nail protectant when I don&#x27;t feel like having colored nail polish on.  </li>
            <li>I like the Matte finish since I do not have nice nail</li>
            <li>This is the BEST matte clear polish that a man can use.  </li>
            <li>;  Also, it goes on very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t streak like others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive noticed some nail growth, but because I have to still use a top coat and a matte coat, i&#x27;m still sitting here damaging the sides of my nails</li>
            <li>(something else i wanted to get away from) with top coats and remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why more people don&#x27;t know about this.  </li>
            <li>I tell everyone I know :)</li>
            <li>It lasts about 4 days which is good since I wash my hands often, do dishes in HOT water and don&#x27;t wear glove.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for around 10 years, cuz I have very soft nails, and it works great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not too happy so far.</li>
            <li>I have a set of perfect 10 due to this product.</li>
            <li>It  goes on matte just like it says and dries smooth.</li>
            <li>My nails were flimsy and bendy before I started using this, and people are constantly gabbing on about how great Nail Envy is</li>
            <li>I prefer the matte rather than the original (shiny).  </li>
            <li>I was told on many occasions that this product would be perfect for my nails, but it failed to deliver.  </li>
            <li>Dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>They should be adequate for those with somewhat stronger nails.</li>
            <li>I am a guy that has nails that split vertically into the quick.  </li>
            <li>The polish goes on easily, dries fast, and has a discreet finish.</li>
            <li>But again I got to add that the &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; they put it this polish really makes those nail tuff!!</li>
            <li>Love the white matte because it keeps my real nails free of dye from polish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had horribly flat, drab nails and within a few hours of application my nails looked beautiful!</li>
            <li>You must follow directions exactly.  </li>
            <li>From the first time you use it you can tell...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about three months now, and it&#x27;s definitely not helped at all, in fact, my fingernails are peeling more than they used to.</li>
            <li>but the finish was so glossy, that, as a guy, I was too self conscious to wear comfortably.  </li>
            <li>Super choice for protecting your nails to keep them looking good when you work hard with your hands as I do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was super excited when this finally arrived in the mail.  </li>
            <li>This is such a fantastic nail polish.</li>
            <li>I must be wearing this on my nails at all times I depend so much on it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Provides nails with a fast, professional, matte finish.  </li>
            <li>I also really like using it alone for a natural look that still offers some protection for my nail.</li>
            <li>This helps keep them strong, and break significantly less than ever before.</li>
            <li>I believe the true test of the strength of any nail harder is to test on a teacher&#x27;s nails for one day or two.  </li>
            <li>It does not dry to a pure matte finish, but does have a dulled semi-gloss look to it.  </li>
            <li>but with this polish they look healthy and strong....protected...and less than a month later...</li>
            <li>It makes your nails look natural and buffed.</li>
            <li>Does not make your nails look like they are polished, leaves them natural.</li>
            <li>Aside from the improved appearance of my hands, I also have better dexterity because I no longer have at least one sore fingertip at a time.</li>
            <li>Wife says it&#x27;s the best base coat ever.</li>
            <li>I treat only the index, middle and ring finger of my right hand</li>
            <li>I have been troubled with nails that break below the quick easily.</li>
            <li>After a couple of days, the matte rubs off a little, leaving a mildly semi-gloss finish, which I don&#x27;t mind at all.  </li>
            <li>Even close observers are hard pressed to tell that your wearing nail polish; which is important for me.</li>
            <li>The matte finish is highly desirable (actually shows as a low sheen).  </li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;ve seen a few reviews where users purchased this thinking it was a matte topcoat.  </li>
            <li>on teachers who subject their hands to chalk etc for 185 days and then determine if their product really works.  </li>
            <li>They are thin and split easy</li>
            <li>Which I prefer while I&#x27;m treating my nails, matte draws less attention to hands in need of repair than other super glossy nail treatments out</li>

            <li> I ended up having to put Seche Vite over it to get a dry layer, and then use a matte topcoat.</li>
            <li> so i could have a single layer of treatment that was matte on my nails.  </li>
            <li> Prefer Sally Hansen&#x27;s Diamond Hard strengthener by far.</li>
            <li> I put two or three coats on at a time, being careful to coat the nail tip and the *underside</li>
            <li> I get compliments on my nails all the time and only need one coat every few weeks.</li>
            <li> It provides a pretty hard sheel over the nail, but mine are weak enough to keep breaking.</li>
            <li> I have tried other nail strengtheners which protected my nails.</li>
            <li> The cost of the product is considerably less on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use this product by itself in a pinch but typically wear it under nail polish.  </li>
            <li> this stuff makes my fingernails feel tough, like they can endure the beating i put them through daily.</li>
            <li> I found the brush had a hard time stroking out a thin layer, and there were a couple instances where I had to dip the brush twice to complete my thumb or my ring finger (my biggest nails).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I watched two episodes of my fav show and it never fully dried.  </li>
            <li> I have had a lot of trouble with them since being diagnosed with psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I type all day long and am very, very hard on my nails.  </li>
            <li> It was a waste of hard earned money.</li>
            <li> However, when I opened it up, mine had a faint yellow tint to it.  </li>
            <li> I find one coat is usually sufficient but sometimes use two.  </li>
            <li> OPI Nail Envy is the answer to a fingerpicker&#x27;s dream, especially if you have thin or easily broken nails.</li>
            <li> Hard to strengthen one&#x27;s finger nails when the product doesn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> I then TRIED to apply one thin coat.  </li>
            <li> Also tends to strengthen thin nails.</li>
            <li> My nails haven&#x27;t ripped, broken, or torn in the month that I&#x27;ve been using this.</li>
            <li> This is my forever go to nail base and is the ONLY reason I have nails!  </li>
            <li> This works well as a single layer, or as a base coat, on the toe nails.  </li>
            <li> This flakes, unseals itself from nail, and looks weird.</li>
            <li> I have horrible, brittle nails due to hashimotos.</li>
            <li> it just felt sticky like a sticky base coat.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I use this on it&#x27;s own as a nail protectant when I don&#x27;t feel like having colored nail polish on.  It lasts about 4 days which is good since I wash my hands often, do dishes in HOT water and don&#x27;t wear glove.  It makes your nails look natural and buffed.</li>
            <li> I was told on many occasions that this product would be perfect for my nails, but it failed to deliver.  I believe the true test of the strength of any nail harder is to test on a teacher&#x27;s nails for one day or two.  My OPI nail color didn&#x27;t last at all and chipped constantly.  OPI needs to test its polish and strengtheners etc. on teachers who subject their hands to chalk etc for 185 days and then determine if their product really works.  It was a waste of hard earned money.</li>
            <li> Product arrived timely.  Have used this strengther for years will good results.  You must follow directions exactly.  I prefer the matte rather than the original (shiny).  The cost of the product is considerably less on Amazon.</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;ve seen a few reviews where users purchased this thinking it was a matte topcoat.  That is not the case, this is only a nail treatment.  It does not dry to a pure matte finish, but does have a dulled semi-gloss look to it.  Which I prefer while I&#x27;m treating my nails, matte draws less attention to hands in need of repair than other super glossy nail treatments out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was super excited when this finally arrived in the mail.  However, when I opened it up, mine had a faint yellow tint to it.  It also smells different than the other nail treatments I own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I removed my polish, scrubbed my hands and nails, then waited for them to dry (+20 minutes).  I then TRIED to apply one thin coat.  I found the brush had a hard time stroking out a thin layer, and there were a couple instances where I had to dip the brush twice to complete my thumb or my ring finger (my biggest nails).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with a successful thin layer, this stuff never dries thoroughly!!! I watched two episodes of my fav show and it never fully dried.  it just felt sticky like a sticky base coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point of buying this was so i could have a single layer of treatment that was matte on my nails.  I ended up having to put Seche Vite over it to get a dry layer, and then use a matte topcoat. Booo!!!!  I&#x27;ve used this stuff 3 times now, and it has never dried/cured to a finish...just sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive noticed some nail growth, but because I have to still use a top coat and a matte coat, i&#x27;m still sitting here damaging the sides of my nails (something else i wanted to get away from) with top coats and remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not too happy so far.</li>
            <li> This works well as a single layer, or as a base coat, on the toe nails.  The matte finish is highly desirable (actually shows as a low sheen).  The draw-back:  On the finger nails it starts to peel back by the next day.  Hard to strengthen one&#x27;s finger nails when the product doesn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this item before at beauty stores.....expensive!!! A $10.00 difference. GREAT price on Amazon! I&#x27;ve been using it for around 10 years, cuz I have very soft nails, and it works great.  It&#x27;s makes a good base coat too.</li>
            <li> OPI Nail Envy is the answer to a fingerpicker&#x27;s dream, especially if you have thin or easily broken nails. I put two or three coats on at a time, being careful to coat the nail tip and the *underside* of the nail as well. This treatment will last about a week, at which time you should remove the product with nail polish remover and rub vitamin E oil into your nails and let them rest for a day. I treat only the index, middle and ring finger of my right hand and I can play for days with no nail splitting or breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, Nail Envy dries to a semi-gloss (not matte) finish. This is still preferable (I guess) to a gloss finish, if you worry about such things (I don&#x27;t).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: OPI Nail Envy is as essential to my guitar playing now as strings or a capo. Try it - it works!</li>
            <li> This is such a fantastic nail polish. It  goes on matte just like it says and dries smooth. It works great as a base coat or even all alone.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t be without any nail envy. I have a set of perfect 10 due to this product. Love the white matte because it keeps my real nails free of dye from polish.</li>
            <li> Great for at-home nail care. Provides nails with a fast, professional, matte finish.  Dries quickly.  Also tends to strengthen thin nails.</li>
            <li> From the first time you use it you can tell...even if you just have slivers of nail left....they are protected. Mine are now grown out again and I&#x27;m not ever skipping using this product.  It&#x27;s all I use now. I never could have imagined my nails looking this good. They are thin and split easy but with this polish they look healthy and strong....protected...and less than a month later...I actually have nails...my own nails!!!!  Don&#x27;t just look healthy!!! They are healthy!!!</li>
            <li> I will always re-purchase this OPI Nail Envy. I must be wearing this on my nails at all times I depend so much on it. My nails are like, 100% stronger with this on</li>
            <li> Super choice for protecting your nails to keep them looking good when you work hard with your hands as I do. Holds up to repeated hand washes with degreaser from turning wrenches. Does not make your nails look like they are polished, leaves them natural. But again I got to add that the &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; they put it this polish really makes those nail tuff!! You got to get this stuff. Wife says it&#x27;s the best base coat ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about three months now, and it&#x27;s definitely not helped at all, in fact, my fingernails are peeling more than they used to.</li>
            <li> The base coat works great for keeping all types of finishes on my nails--glitter, another matte, cream, it worked well with all of them. I also really like using it alone for a natural look that still offers some protection for my nail.</li>
            <li> My nails haven&#x27;t ripped, broken, or torn in the month that I&#x27;ve been using this. Aside from the improved appearance of my hands, I also have better dexterity because I no longer have at least one sore fingertip at a time. Will be using this stuff FOR LIFE.</li>
            <li> I have been troubled with nails that break below the quick easily. I have tried other nail strengtheners which protected my nails. but the finish was so glossy, that, as a guy, I was too self conscious to wear comfortably.  This product seems to be the perfect answer.  I can have the benefits of a nail strengthener, without the glossy finish that screams, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m wearing nail polish!&amp;#34;  Also, it goes on very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t streak like others I&#x27;ve tried.  After a couple of days, the matte rubs off a little, leaving a mildly semi-gloss finish, which I don&#x27;t mind at all.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I like the Matte finish since I do not have nice nail this finish doesn&#x27;t show them off, like the shiny would..</li>
            <li> My nails were flimsy and bendy before I started using this, and people are constantly gabbing on about how great Nail Envy is so I assumed it might help a little bit but probably wouldn&#x27;t live up to the hype. Even when I take it off, my nails feel stronger and firmer and they don&#x27;t bend and break anymore, though, so, defs recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST matte clear polish that a man can use.  I get compliments on my nails all the time and only need one coat every few weeks.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!! I&#x27;ve always had horribly flat, drab nails and within a few hours of application my nails looked beautiful! It shaped them and it&#x27;s a matte finish so you can&#x27;t tell you&#x27;re even wearing it! I&#x27;m definitely buying this again!!!!!</li>
            <li> I boutght this product to keep my nails intact. I have had a lot of trouble with them since being diagnosed with psoriasis. The polish goes on easily, dries fast, and has a discreet finish. Even close observers are hard pressed to tell that your wearing nail polish; which is important for me. It provides a pretty hard sheel over the nail, but mine are weak enough to keep breaking. They should be adequate for those with somewhat stronger nails.</li>
            <li> Unimpressed. Prefer Sally Hansen&#x27;s Diamond Hard strengthener by far. This flakes, unseals itself from nail, and looks weird.</li>
            <li> The best under coating you can use!</li>
            <li> This is my forever go to nail base and is the ONLY reason I have nails!  I have horrible, brittle nails due to hashimotos. I take Biotin supplements daily but nothing seems to ultimately &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; my nails. This helps keep them strong, and break significantly less than ever before. I type all day long and am very, very hard on my nails.  Without this product I wouldn&#x27;t have any nails at all!  I use this product by itself in a pinch but typically wear it under nail polish.  I find one coat is usually sufficient but sometimes use two.  I don&#x27;t know why more people don&#x27;t know about this.  I tell everyone I know :)</li>
            <li> I am a guy that has nails that split vertically into the quick.  This product hardens them when used often, so they don&#x27;t split, and has a matte finish so I don&#x27;t look like I just went to the beauty parlor.</li>
            <li> this stuff makes my fingernails feel tough, like they can endure the beating i put them through daily. and i can actually get them to grow now!</li>
