            <li>I love this product it works so much better then</li>
            <li>But am I glad I purchased it?  </li>
            <li>It works so much better than a towel.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The problem with most towels is that they don&#x27;t stay put, which is why I wanted to try [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I have and have used Turbie Twists and its ok</li>
            <li>and I love the fit of that one a lot better.</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t really fit my hair though, its the \\&quot;better than no</li>
            <li>Easy to use - check  Absorbs water - check  </li>
            <li>Easy to put hair up</li>
            <li>The turban is easy to use and stays on the head, keeps your hair out of your face while you&#x27;re doing your makeup.</li>
            <li>Now with Mimi&#x27;s Hair Turban it&#x27;s easy as 1, 2, 3.</li>
            <li>My good old micro fiber towel still works and looks better.</li>
            <li>Absolutely - saves me time, and my hair always looks nice after styling.  </li>
            <li>Aquis turban wrap seems to work better and it stays in place pretty well.  </li>
            <li>So far I love it!</li>
            <li>cool - eeeh,</li>
            <li>Love this head towel, highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This is not a bad product but it didn&#x27;t work for my purpose.  </li>
            <li>The hair turban is like an oversized, super absorbant shower cap.</li>
            <li>Need to get a few more!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since this dries your hair more so than if you leave it air dry or keep it in a towel, I found that when I do then blow dry my hair, my hair feel more healthy and not as fried when I&#x27;m finished.</li>
            <li>First it has a noxious odor which remained after 7 washings.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different hair turbans, each claiming to be the fastest at drying your hair.  </li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure, then I used it and it seems bigger than the TurbieTwist.  </li>
            <li>I have long (to my bra strap) hair right now, but I can tell it will still be ok as my hair gets longer.  </li>
            <li>My hair dries super fast, normally it takes forever in a non-microfiber towel.</li>
            <li>I have thought about sewing one on, but I&#x27;m not 100% positive where to put it.</li>
            <li>I wanted to use it over curlers and it wasn&#x27;t large or stretchy enough to be comfortable.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell if this speeds my drying time at all.</li>
            <li>not so much    </li>
            <li>Highly recommended product!</li>
            <li>I like the material but these hair towels have way too much elastic.</li>
            <li>I ordered a different kind at the same time</li>
            <li>Easy to put on, it stays in place and I have noticed that it helps dry my hair much faster.</li>
            <li>It is nice that it&#x27;s smaller and doesn&#x27;t weigh so heavy on my neck and shoulders.</li>
            <li>I only have one right now, but I plan on purchasing at least one more</li>
            <li>I thought I might not be coordinated enought to wrap it (!), but I figured it out quickly and now use it daily.  </li>
            <li>This is a one step product because it is large enough.</li>
            <li>(o: Seriously, this is great for quickly absorbing water from your hair after a shower, so you can blow dry less and be ready faster.</li>
            <li>Everything on earth REALLY sticks to this towel, especially from the laundering process.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 4 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>so I never mess it up.  </li>
            <li>It works but is too small to be comfortable.</li>
            <li>I used Mimi&#x27;s Diva Dryer after major cervical spinal surgery.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work on a smaller head like my 10 year old.</li>
            <li>With having long thick hair for most all my life, I have always wrapped it up in a towel after my shower.</li>
            <li>The Diva Dryer dries hair faster than other turbans, the material is very soft, and it cuts my morning routine time dramatically.  </li>

            <li> Bonus: less hot air on your hair means less damage, &#x3D;better-looking hair.</li>
            <li> I prefer to hang this dry next to my delicates</li>
            <li> Finally when it was attached and in place it left my hair wetter than it usually is when I wrap it in a simple cotton terry towel.  </li>

            <li> This Turban helped keep my hair up off my neck, so I could put on my cervical collar and keep my wound dry.</li>
            <li> Hair gets dry faster.</li>
            <li> Beware - don&#x27;t use a dryer sheet if you dry this in the dryer!  </li>
            <li> Wrap around the back of your neck so that the button is on the back of your head/top of your neck, twist twist twist and loop the small loop over the button.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed because I bought this as a stocking stuffer Christmas present for someone, and now I won&#x27;t be able to return it and get another one in time, probably.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve returned all the other hair turbans).  </li>
            <li> Before this I could never figure out how to wrap my hair in towels like I always see other girls do.</li>
            <li> years ago I had the Aquis hair drying towel when it was sold at The Body Shop, I used to wrap my hair in the microfiber towel then use a regular towel over it, since it was so small.  </li>
            <li> and I really feel bad when I have to dry my hair with a regular towel.</li>
            <li> It actually makes them hard to control and presses on the ears.</li>
            <li> Have to dig it out when your head is upside down, it makes no sense.  </li>
            <li> so I was shocked at the tight fit.</li>
            <li> said that the drying time on their hair was cut in half</li>
            <li> It seems to help reduce frizz as well, perhaps because of less time using a hair dryer...</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll buy one of these for my mom and boyfriend&#x27;s little sisters too.</li>
            <li> The little rope ring to loop on the button is on the inside!?1?</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> However, I am a little put-off by the lint debris problem!</li>
            <li> If you do, microfiber will slowly lose its ultra-drying power.  </li>
            <li> Next it was very difficult to twist and attach the end to the button.  </li>
            <li> This looks stupid in my bathroom and twisting plus buttoning is not worth it.</li>
            <li> Just to add I have very thin hair and not a lot</li>

            <li> I love this product it works so much better then a towel It is well made no problum with the button I even bought One for my daughter, sister and 2 nieces All with very long hair and thay said that the drying time on their hair was cut in half</li>
            <li> I am always having to use a bulky towel to wrap my hair in.  Now i have the Diva dryer and the size is perfect, secures easily and dries your hair quickly.  Excellent product - must have for woman!</li>
            <li> For anyone with hair who cares about looking presentable. (o: Seriously, this is great for quickly absorbing water from your hair after a shower, so you can blow dry less and be ready faster. Bonus: less hot air on your hair means less damage, &#x3D;better-looking hair. Yay.</li>
            <li> These work well and are so,much lighter than a bulky bath towel on your head.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if this speeds my drying time at all. It is nice that it&#x27;s smaller and doesn&#x27;t weigh so heavy on my neck and shoulders. However, I am a little put-off by the lint debris problem! Everything on earth REALLY sticks to this towel, especially from the laundering process.</li>
            <li> Easy to use - check  Absorbs water - check  Looks cool - eeeh, not so much    But am I glad I purchased it?  Absolutely - saves me time, and my hair always looks nice after styling.  Great value product!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 4 year old daughter. She loves it! It works so much better than a towel. My only problem with it is that there wasn&#x27;t a button on it. It has the loop, but no button. I have thought about sewing one on, but I&#x27;m not 100% positive where to put it. So we just wrap her hair and tuck it in the side.</li>
            <li> Incredible time saver, it&#x27;s great.  Wrap around the back of your neck so that the button is on the back of your head/top of your neck, twist twist twist and loop the small loop over the button.  Beware - don&#x27;t use a dryer sheet if you dry this in the dryer!  If you do, microfiber will slowly lose its ultra-drying power.  I prefer to hang this dry next to my delicates so I never mess it up.  I think I&#x27;ll buy one of these for my mom and boyfriend&#x27;s little sisters too.</li>
            <li> Came on time and works fairly well.  Easy to put hair up but some hair in back may fall out.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred to give this product zero stars but the form did not provide zero as an option.  First it has a noxious odor which remained after 7 washings.  Next it was very difficult to twist and attach the end to the button.  Finally when it was attached and in place it left my hair wetter than it usually is when I wrap it in a simple cotton terry towel.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Use a towel. I would have returned this but for Amazon&#x27;s 30 day policy.</li>
            <li> This is a great addition to your morning routine to help save some time and get you out the door sooner. The hair turban is like an oversized, super absorbant shower cap. I have yet to master the \\&quot;technique\\&quot; of making the turban, so I resorted to placing my hair inside the cap, twisting the back and placing it on one side of my shoulder.&lt;br /&gt;Since this dries your hair more so than if you leave it air dry or keep it in a towel, I found that when I do then blow dry my hair, my hair feel more healthy and not as fried when I&#x27;m finished.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different hair turbans, each claiming to be the fastest at drying your hair.  I finally decided to purchase this one online, and I&#x27;m truly happiest with this product (I&#x27;ve returned all the other hair turbans).  The Diva Dryer dries hair faster than other turbans, the material is very soft, and it cuts my morning routine time dramatically.  It seems to help reduce frizz as well, perhaps because of less time using a hair dryer...Highly recommended product!</li>
            <li> This looks stupid in my bathroom and twisting plus buttoning is not worth it. My good old micro fiber towel still works and looks better. Save your money.</li>
            <li> I used Mimi&#x27;s Diva Dryer after major cervical spinal surgery. This Turban helped keep my hair up off my neck, so I could put on my cervical collar and keep my wound dry. This also helped speed up the drying of my hair.</li>
            <li> This arrived today and I opened it up to find it had a brown stain on the fabric and a rip all along one side of it.  The package was not damaged, so I know it didn&#x27;t happen in transit.  For some reason, it seems I was sent a defective or even used (possibly returned) product.  I&#x27;m really disappointed because I bought this as a stocking stuffer Christmas present for someone, and now I won&#x27;t be able to return it and get another one in time, probably.</li>
            <li> The overall head piece is to big I would try a different brand..</li>
            <li> I like the material but these hair towels have way too much elastic. It actually makes them hard to control and presses on the ears. The little rope ring to loop on the button is on the inside!?1? Have to dig it out when your head is upside down, it makes no sense.  OK, but no way the best ever as claimed.</li>
            <li> This is not a bad product but it didn&#x27;t work for my purpose.  I wanted to use it over curlers and it wasn&#x27;t large or stretchy enough to be comfortable.</li>
            <li> I love it. Hair gets dry faster. The turban is easy to use and stays on the head, keeps your hair out of your face while you&#x27;re doing your makeup.</li>
            <li> With having long thick hair for most all my life, I have always wrapped it up in a towel after my shower. The purpose was to help the drying process and keep it out of my face while doing my morning routine. (Putting on make-up, brushing my teeth, etc.) The problem with most towels is that they don&#x27;t stay put, which is why I wanted to try [[ASIN:B000AMA4DQ Mimi&#x27;s Diva Dryer by Aquis Microfiber Hair Turban, Patented Design, White]]. So far I love it! Easy to put on, it stays in place and I have noticed that it helps dry my hair much faster. I only have one right now, but I plan on purchasing at least one more so that I can rotate them when one needs to be washed.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on a smaller head like my 10 year old.</li>
            <li> Before this I could never figure out how to wrap my hair in towels like I always see other girls do. Now with Mimi&#x27;s Hair Turban it&#x27;s easy as 1, 2, 3. Easy instructions and fits perfect on my head. My hair dries super fast, normally it takes forever in a non-microfiber towel. I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it a lot and I really feel bad when I have to dry my hair with a regular towel.</li>
            <li> I really like the \\&quot;turban\\&quot;- perfect after a shower on wet/damp hair.  I thought I might not be coordinated enought to wrap it (!), but I figured it out quickly and now use it daily.  I&#x27;ll probably buy another one soon!</li>
            <li> Need to get a few more!!</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but I don&#x27;t like it as well as the one I accidentally left in a hotel room!</li>
            <li> Love this head towel, highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Would not want to be without them.  Wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> I have and have used Turbie Twists and its ok, it doesn&#x27;t really fit my hair though, its the \\&quot;better than no towel\\&quot; option.&lt;br /&gt;This Aquis turban wrap seems to work better and it stays in place pretty well.  I have long (to my bra strap) hair right now, but I can tell it will still be ok as my hair gets longer.  At first I wasn&#x27;t sure, then I used it and it seems bigger than the TurbieTwist.  I didn&#x27;t measure them side by side, but I will stick with this brand from now on... years ago I had the Aquis hair drying towel when it was sold at The Body Shop, I used to wrap my hair in the microfiber towel then use a regular towel over it, since it was so small.  This is a one step product because it is large enough.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would buy this again. It works but is too small to be comfortable. Just to add I have very thin hair and not a lot so I was shocked at the tight fit. I ordered a different kind at the same time (Eurow Microfiber Hair Turban) and I love the fit of that one a lot better.</li>
