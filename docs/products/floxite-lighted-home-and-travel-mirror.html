    <ol>
            <li>Already took a trip with it and it was awesome!!</li>
            <li>The magnification is especially great.</li>
            <li>This is the best I found.</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>Perfect, I just used it on a 12 day cruise &amp; it was awesome -</li>
            <li>It is compact in size and excellent for traveling, but my friend plans to use it at home, as well.  </li>
            <li>Very happy!</li>
            <li>The 10x magnification is huge/great and the illumination is very good.  </li>
            <li>I consider this a great purchase.</li>
            <li>It is also not an attractive item.</li>
            <li>LOL  </li>
            <li>So I returned it to Amazon, and Amazon was great.</li>
            <li>I find this a very handy makeup mirror.  </li>
            <li>Perfect size for traveling - nice to place in luggage, good lighting.</li>
            <li>The 10X magnification is perfect for seeing the smallest hairs for tweezing, although if you don&#x27;t wear bifocals yet this may be more magnification than you need.  </li>
            <li>The bulbs have a yellowish tint to them, which is OK if you need it for evening makeup, not the best for day time.  </li>
            <li>This is so compact that it travels easily and works great!</li>
            <li>It came with the batteries needed and the amount of light is perfect.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I love this mirror!</li>
            <li>Really a nice mirror and,</li>
            <li>The magnification is so good that when I first saw my face in it, I screamed!  </li>
            <li>The top mirror broke in one week.  </li>
            <li>I love this one.  </li>
            <li>What I miss most when I am traveling and staying in a hotel, is no magnified make-up mirror.</li>
            <li>but I love this mirror.  </li>
            <li>Lighting is just right for me (senior)...very bright and shows every line, freckle and wrinkle.  </li>
            <li>It is light and easy to use with a very strong magnification.</li>
            <li>The mirrors are fantastic - I bought 3 for family members and they all love them.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight, and easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>It packed easily and I packed it between clothing so it would not damage which it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>It is made of a light weight plastic that seems fairly strong so splitting or breakage should not be an issue unless one happens to step on it.</li>
            <li>It has a larger mirror and the amount of light is great.  </li>
            <li>and it is light weight.  </li>
            <li>However, it said Free Shipping</li>
            <li>Cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>The Pro&#x27;s: This mirror is a good size and is easy to use and set up in various locations if one is traveling.</li>
            <li>The only thing good is the amount of light.  </li>
            <li>This mirror is not as bright as the full circle lighted Floxite I formerly had.</li>
            <li>the lights aren&#x27;t bright enough to see to pluck a stray hair and you do have to be super close to the mirror to see or it is distorted.</li>
            <li>Finally did so, and am SO pleased with it!  </li>
            <li>I saw a few reviews that werent great</li>
            <li>No matter where I place it, I can&#x27;t get the right viewing level.</li>
            <li>The lights are bright (even on battery power) and completely circle the mirror, illuminating my entire face.  </li>
            <li>The first travel mirror I bought was the Zadro.  </li>
            <li>The stand closes over the mirror when not in use protecting the mirror from dirt and grime while keeping it safe at the same time.</li>
            <li>It was falling apart when I first opened it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting to purchase this mirror for months, but the cost was pretty high.  </li>
            <li>I like that the mirror operates on batteries because many hotel or cruise ship electrical outlets are remote or inaccessible.  </li>
            <li>The lights illuminate very well.  </li>
            <li>But the mirror really is a piece of junk.</li>
            <li>Says it illuminates much more than her old regular make-up mirror.  </li>
            <li>The good points are: I can use it hands free, the lights are on the magnified side (one mirror I bought had a mag side and regular side with lights on regular side only)and brighter than most travel mirrors, the mirror is large enough to see into and not distorted (although all magnified mirrors are distorted on the sides) and flat enough to pack in between clothes.</li>
            <li>much* more subject to damage.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li>It would be great to use if you only want to see very small areas at a time, like putting on eye makeup.  </li>
            <li>in retrospect, truly worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 29 days later:  Yesterday the cover broke off.  </li>
            <li>One has to have other lights on in the room or your lighting is like a very dim blue florescent bulb at the most.</li>
            <li>i first used this at a friend&#x27;s home, ordered one for myself and it arrived,worked, and i use it daily.</li>
            <li>This mirrors magnification is intense, causing it to be extremely distorted unless your face is right up against the mirror.</li>
            <li>The mirror is large enough that I can see most of my face, not just one small part at a time.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it folds down flat to about an inch</li>
            <li>This mirror has only one level of lighting and should have at least two, the dim level which is the only choice and bright.</li>
            <li>As a frequent traveler and 59 years old, I looked at a lot of lighted magnifying travel mirrors in the shops and online (and read lots of reviews) before ordering this one.  </li>
            <li>(The manufacturer, Floxite Company, offers a plug-in adapter separately for $10</li>
            <li>It was difficult to find a mirror that was as good as the one we had.  </li>
            <li>I either have to stoop way down or stand on my toes to get the right level.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right size as I wasn&#x27;t looking for something really small.  </li>
            <li>Its thin shape means it is easy to pack and also to store.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> The first travel mirror I bought was the Zadro.  Not worth the money.  The top mirror broke in one week.  The battery cover will not stay on so the batteries fall out every time you pick it up!!  The mirror size is small.  The only thing good is the amount of light.  So this time I bought the Floxite.  I love this one.  It has a larger mirror and the amount of light is great.  I love the fact that it folds down flat to about an inch so it goes in the makeup drawer and fits in my suitcase and does not take up a lot of room and it is light weight.  Already took a trip with it and it was awesome!!</li>
            <li> I returned this item.  I had to have the mirror so close to my eyes to get my face into focus.  That left a very small area of my face visible.  It would be great to use if you only want to see very small areas at a time, like putting on eye makeup.  It wasn&#x27;t what I had in mind.</li>
            <li> We got this travel mirror as a replacement for one we&#x27;d had for years.  It was difficult to find a mirror that was as good as the one we had.  This mirror is a bit larger than we would like for travel, but is loaded with features.  The magnification is especially great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to purchase this mirror for months, but the cost was pretty high.  Finally did so, and am SO pleased with it!  The 10x magnification is huge/great and the illumination is very good.  It is quite a large mirror yet takes up very little space in a vanity drawer, due to it&#x27;s thin profile.  Really a nice mirror and, in retrospect, truly worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 29 days later:  Yesterday the cover broke off.  The mirror hasn&#x27;t been dropped, tweaked or otherwise had anything happen to it OTHER THAN MY HOLDING IT BY THE COVER AS I USE IT.  For a mirror that costs almost $40 to break in this manner is unacceptable.  So...now there is no protection for the mirrored portion and it will get dusty and be *much* more subject to damage.  Very poor design.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a lighted X10 travel mirror all together. This is the best I found. The good points are: I can use it hands free, the lights are on the magnified side (one mirror I bought had a mag side and regular side with lights on regular side only)and brighter than most travel mirrors, the mirror is large enough to see into and not distorted (although all magnified mirrors are distorted on the sides) and flat enough to pack in between clothes. It does a few minor problems (but workable for me). The lighting could be a little brighter and it is a little big for traveling.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> Perfect, I just used it on a 12 day cruise &amp; it was awesome - No stray hairs for me!! It is light and easy to use with a very strong magnification. I will always use it on vacation.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror! What I miss most when I am traveling and staying in a hotel, is no magnified make-up mirror. This is so compact that it travels easily and works great!</li>
            <li> As a frequent traveler and 59 years old, I looked at a lot of lighted magnifying travel mirrors in the shops and online (and read lots of reviews) before ordering this one.  I am very pleased with it.  The mirror is large enough that I can see most of my face, not just one small part at a time.  The 10X magnification is perfect for seeing the smallest hairs for tweezing, although if you don&#x27;t wear bifocals yet this may be more magnification than you need.  The lights are bright (even on battery power) and completely circle the mirror, illuminating my entire face.  I like that the mirror operates on batteries because many hotel or cruise ship electrical outlets are remote or inaccessible.  (The manufacturer, Floxite Company, offers a plug-in adapter separately for $10 and I got one in case the batteries run low.)  The mirror is lightweight, weighing only about 15 ounces (430g) - less than a pound - including the 3 batteries.  The adapter plug weighs 5 ounces (140g), so together they will add only 1 1/4 pounds (570g) to my suitcase.  I also like the hinged cover that protects both the glass and the on/off switch, so it can&#x27;t accidentally switch on in my suitcase.  Some reviewers complained that the mirror can only sit at one angle, requiring them to scrunch down in order to use it.  If this bothers you, try raising the mirror by setting it on a stack of books or magazines.  Bottom line: if you are over 45 and want a serious travel mirror, get this one.</li>
            <li> Like the mirror.  But one of the pivoting pegs that holds the base and the top together fell out after less than 1 week of use.  The bulbs have a yellowish tint to them, which is OK if you need it for evening makeup, not the best for day time.  I bought this because I knew I was going to be in the hospital after knee surgery for several weeks and it packed well and worked when I needed it to.  But it was when I got back home that I discovered the peg had fallen out some time as I was packing up to leave.  I would recommend this mirror but would say to check the pegs on the sides regularly.</li>
            <li> This is not a complaint about the mirrors because I just ordered 2  and will not receive them for a few days.  However, it said Free Shipping but on my bill I am being charged.  I feel that I was misled.</li>
            <li> I find this a very handy makeup mirror.  The magnification is so helpful for us glasses wearers, who obviously can&#x27;t wear glasses while we put on our makeup.  It is lightweight, and easy to hold.  The lights illuminate very well.  Its thin shape means it is easy to pack and also to store.</li>
            <li> This mirror is not as bright as the full circle lighted Floxite I formerly had. Sunlight shows things this mirror does not...</li>
            <li> The Pro&#x27;s: This mirror is a good size and is easy to use and set up in various locations if one is traveling. The stand closes over the mirror when not in use protecting the mirror from dirt and grime while keeping it safe at the same time. It has a push button on switch that lights all the lights around the mirror. It is made of a light weight plastic that seems fairly strong so splitting or breakage should not be an issue unless one happens to step on it. It is battery operated so you do not have to have an electrical cord dangling.It does have an electrical adapter hole on the side but mine did not come with the adapter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Con&#x27;s: The lights are spaced too far apart and are not bright enough to truly illuminate the face. One has to have other lights on in the room or your lighting is like a very dim blue florescent bulb at the most.This mirror has only one level of lighting and should have at least two, the dim level which is the only choice and bright.The mirror does not come with an electrical adapter even though there is a connection for one on the mirror.I rated this item 3 stars because the lighting is not sufficient and it does not come with an electrical adapter cord.</li>
            <li> The mirrors are fantastic - I bought 3 for family members and they all love them. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Just wish it were a little taller.</li>
            <li> i first used this at a friend&#x27;s home, ordered one for myself and it arrived,worked, and i use it daily.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for someone and she loves it!  Says it illuminates much more than her old regular make-up mirror.  It is compact in size and excellent for traveling, but my friend plans to use it at home, as well.  It came with batteries included.    I consider this a great purchase.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wanting a travel mirror for makeup application, DO NOT BUY THIS!  This mirrors magnification is intense, causing it to be extremely distorted unless your face is right up against the mirror. Not at all helpful for what I needed. However, if I can find a way to hold it up to my face it does work for eyebrow tweezing. It is also not an attractive item. when it is closed it makes me think of a toilet lid. I would&#x27;ve returned it but the return cost was too much for the trouble.</li>
            <li> I bought this to go on a cruise because cabin lighting not bright enough.  It packed easily and I packed it between clothing so it would not damage which it didn&#x27;t.  Lighting is just right for me (senior)...very bright and shows every line, freckle and wrinkle.  Makes you want to do something about them.  The magnification is so good that when I first saw my face in it, I screamed!  WHO IS THAT??  People, do not be afraid of yourselves.  Remember, you are your worst critic and no one will see the spot you&#x27;re fixated on!  LOL  But seriously I do wish it had 2 viewing levels.  No matter where I put it I either have to stoop way down or stand on my toes to get the right level.  Actually, it should have at least 3 viewing levels instead of only one.  No matter where I place it, I can&#x27;t get the right viewing level.</li>
            <li> It was a piece of junk. Cheap plastic. It was falling apart when I first opened it. I called the company, as it said in the enclosed brochure, and the woman was rude and told me to send it to whoever had my money. So I returned it to Amazon, and Amazon was great. But the mirror really is a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I saw a few reviews that werent great but I love this mirror.  I bought it to take on vacations and when I travel.  It&#x27;s just the right size as I wasn&#x27;t looking for something really small.  It came with the batteries needed and the amount of light is perfect.  Very happy!</li>
            <li> I would return but have to pay return postage so think I will just keep it as others have commented......the lights aren&#x27;t bright enough to see to pluck a stray hair and you do have to be super close to the mirror to see or it is distorted.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for traveling - nice to place in luggage, good lighting.</li>
