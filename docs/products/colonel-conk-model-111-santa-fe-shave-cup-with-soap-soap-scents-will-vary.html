            <li>I&#x27;m definitely glad I bought it!</li>
            <li>Works beautifully with my shaving brush and its low profile is perfect on the sink.  </li>
            <li>To me, it&#x27;s the perfect size for a large soap disk or for creating a lather with shave cream.</li>
            <li>Nice Size to Grip in Hand, Bottom Is Unfinshed</li>
            <li>However it catches the brush handle and makes a nice clinking noise.</li>
            <li>Plus it sits perfectly on a shelf in the medicine cabinet or decoratively on the counter without taking up much space.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the best shave of my life.</li>
            <li>Also fits nice in your hand as you lather up your brush.</li>

            <li>but I use my own cream.</li>
            <li>It looks really nice</li>

            <li>.. nice look...  </li>
            <li>have to say, there is a nice difference, between using the brush method vs. applying soap from your hand.  </li>

            <li>That being said, it is still a nice bowl with nice colors.</li>
            <li>It also looks nice, and the Col. Conk Bayrum shave soap it came with</li>
            <li>nice stone bowl, holds heat well.  </li>
            <li>This bowl has a nice weight in your hand and is well made.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be made really nice.</li>
            <li>This is a nice stoneware bowl.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s definitely stylish and a nice touch to your collection as well.  </li>
            <li>Some might want the water thing (skettle?) to keep things more warm.  </li>
            <li>so it keeps warm once you heat it up with hot water, and it is a great size.  </li>
            <li>The proportions are pleasant, and more importantly to me fit my hand well as I&#x27;m holding it when working up a lather.</li>
            <li>best way to use this bowl is to run hot water into it for 30 seconds or until the water is hot and the bowl is warm to the touch.  </li>

            <li>Fits nicely in my hand and is easy to control - no dropping this one.</li>
            <li>Mine has a very pleasant, light scent and it worked up to a decent lather.</li>
            <li>Not in love with the scent but for that price you can&#x27;t beat a bowl and some soap.</li>
            <li>The bowl looks great sitting out - very decorative piece.  </li>
            <li>This is simply an OK bowl for a beginner</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with the lather, scent, or the overall consistency of this soap.</li>
            <li>I scent I received is called Amber, which smells just ok.</li>
            <li>can spend more, but don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>You cannot find a better shaving bowl......</li>
            <li>(my favorite brush is a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Love the bowl.  </li>
            <li>Better than using a mug or cup.  </li>
            <li>I use Mitchells Wool Fat shaving soap most of the time.</li>
            <li>Nice size and free shaving soap.</li>
            <li>It is attractive and looks good next to my safety razor shaver set.</li>
            <li>I have not tried it with the included shaving soap and I am assuming it will work better with shaving soaps.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Give the soap a try and see it works better for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it when China is spelled &amp;#34;Made in AMERICA!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Lovely colors.</li>
            <li>Love the size and shape of it.</li>
            <li>Overall, great product!!</li>
            <li>I fell in love with them.  </li>
            <li>I got a better, closer shave.  </li>
            <li>Like I said, I&#x27;d love to give it five stars but...</li>
            <li>I am more than satisfied with this shave cup.</li>
            <li>but this bowl has made me want to shave more.</li>
            <li>so I assume all&#x27;s well and enjoyed.</li>
            <li>The best bowl (in terms of practicality) that I&#x27;ve used was a simple plastic cereal bowl.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s probably more durable than the coffee mugs you use every day.  </li>
            <li>If your looking for something to set more on a granite or marble counter or just want that look</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before I gifted it</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pleased with its construction and aesthetics.</li>
            <li>my favorite is [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This cup does a much better job at keeping the heat.</li>
            <li>Started using the shave cup to be more environmentally friendly, turns out that I like it much better than the pressurized cans and its cheaper too!</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s tiny actually.. perfect for your palm)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shallower and wider is much better and easier to get to the froth.</li>
            <li>w/handle would probably not accommodate all soap sizes to drop into the mug (if you want to do it that way.. which i get the impression most people do).  </li>
            <li>; on top to keep lather in (it will escape mind</li>
            <li>Not quite sure.  </li>
            <li>Some might want more texturing for aggressive/easier lathering.  </li>
            <li>The rim is too curved so the brush bangs off the sides of the top.  </li>
            <li>i love the way they look on my vanity....</li>
            <li>im thinking about maybe buying 2 more....</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I bought this.  </li>
            <li>I love the look of this shave cup.</li>
            <li>By no means a deal breaker, but a slightly larger opening would&#x27;ve made it perfect.</li>
            <li>I love this bowl....</li>
            <li>I love using this cup.</li>
            <li>Love the look.</li>
            <li>very well made, and has some great earth tones in the bowl.</li>
            <li>I love this bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The product I received had more greens and purples.</li>
            <li>The effect is that I get a hot to warm lather to use because the bowl holds a nice amount of heat in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A pretty good bowl.  </li>
            <li>Good at first.</li>
            <li>It holds the round shaving soaps perfectly and looks amazing on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>you can just as easily (actually MORE easily) hold a bowl in the palm of your hands for this then grab a skinny handle and use that to hold the weight of the cup up.  </li>
            <li>Heavy, nicely built and the color is as pictured, matches perfect.</li>
            <li>What I&#x27;m really pleased with, is that when I was done shaving, my face felt nice and cool and smooth.</li>
            <li>I like Proraso Sandalwood Shaving soap better, but this Colnel Conk soap is fine.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it works great, and looks good in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>and it looks pretty nice for sure</li>
            <li>It works great and doesn&#x27;t take long to whip up a nice cream.  </li>
            <li>It is just the right size and fits nicely in the palm of my hand.</li>
            <li>soap that came with it is excellent though, I would highly recommend it to others who are looking for a decent soap.</li>
            <li>Easy to whip up a lather.</li>
            <li>This mug very quickly replaced my shaving cup.  </li>
            <li>I love this cup, well made, nice looking and very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>The only issue I have with it which is just a side-effect of it being curved in at the top (which is great for keeping the lather in) is my metal handled brush clunks against the rim, but I bought it expecting that.</li>
            <li>You want something easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>So.. bowls are just as easy to handle over mugs or cups with handles.  </li>
            <li>NOt to worry.. lathering is easy wiht this bowl</li>
            <li>good solid bowl,serves it purpose nice colors</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect size for the average shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>I sit it in HOT water drawn in my sink to keep the lather on the warm side.  </li>
            <li>This one looked pretty nice</li>
            <li>I wanted a shaving bowl/mug that would be easy and comfortable to hold, that was pleasing to look at and that would be easy to use to work up a lather with using a variety of brushes and creams.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a high quality product, holds heat respectably, and looks nice on your counter.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pleased with the item I was most interested in.  </li>
            <li>mode that cermic bowls are fine</li>
            <li>But it leaves the skin feeling fine.</li>
            <li>It would be perfect if it were just a half an inch deeper.</li>
            <li>works fine.</li>
            <li>let the cup sit in hot water before I use it, and it holds the heat really well, giving me a nice, warm lather.</li>
            <li>and it really isn&#x27;t a huge deal -</li>
            <li>It retains heat reasonably well, so the soap goes on warm, which is ideal for a wet shave.</li>
            <li>it proudly sits next to the brush stand.</li>
            <li>The soap is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Softens my beard for a smooth effortless shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Those don&#x27;t sound like ingredients that I want on my face.</li>
            <li>The product seemed and felt cheap, but the ingredients confirmed my thoughts.</li>
            <li>Well for me here are the important things.  </li>
            <li>For me value for money is all about quality, aesthetics and fit for purpose.</li>
            <li>Free Shaving Brush Stand from Parker Safety Razor]]</li>
            <li>It allows you to position the bowl incredibly comfortably.</li>
            <li>It is solid and looks great.</li>
            <li>that being said, the cup is great, it&#x27;s not so deep that you have to go elbow</li>
            <li>They all seem to be cheaply made even though they weren&#x27;t cheap.  </li>
            <li>It fits nicely in my hand but does not allow much room to work the shave cream around with a badger brush.  </li>
            <li>Now while the bowl fits comfortably in the palm of my hand, the soap tends to spin around inside the bowl.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too worried about the sound</li>
            <li>I buy the packs of 100 for convince they are available in 25,50,100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>that isn&#x27;t that important.</li>
            <li>and now i can enjoy the heat of the lather too</li>
            <li>It does look nice and i have dropped it once or twice in the sink and it has not broken.</li>
            <li>Great solid dish.</li>
            <li>Great price (especially with the soap included).</li>
            <li>The actual bowl is of great quality, and it really helps make a nice lather.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is made in the good old USA and that is a plus.</li>
            <li>For $19 you get $4 worth of Colonel Conk shaving soap and a nice looking ceramic bowl about the right size and shape for use as a shaving soap bowl.</li>
            <li>It has a nice texture on the inside that helps build lather pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this Shave Cup, its attractive, masculine and of an appropriate size for its purpose.</li>
            <li>Looks Classic And Being Hand Made, One  Of A Kind</li>
            <li>Unique feel.</li>
            <li>Husband was excited when he recv&#x27;d it</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that each one is unique.</li>
            <li>When accomplished, however, this soap affords a closer, more comfortable shave than anything in a can, jar, or tube.</li>
            <li>I love this heavy, attractive -</li>
            <li>It wipes clean and shiny after finishing.  </li>
            <li>Stays hot for nice hot lather.</li>
            <li>The material, once heated with warm water nicely holds heat providing a warm lather even into a second or third pass.</li>
            <li>Nothing really special about it</li>
            <li>The bowl itself is nothing special.</li>
            <li>its more like a bowl, not a cup, it has a classic look, like the material, and can fit shaving soaps no problem.</li>
            <li>Really great looking bowl, haven&#x27;t tried the included shaving soap because I bought this as part of several pieces I thought I needed for first time shaving with DE safety razors.  </li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve written a full review for this brush as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll cool off faster and well before you&#x27;re done anyway.  </li>
            <li>My husband LOVED his Christmas present.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s weird but it looks really classic and awesome which makes me feel pretty classic and awesome when I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First, does it has texture to make whipping up tons of creamy lather easy?  </li>
            <li>Furthermore, the wide mouth allows you to work up a good lather quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>Hard to get a good lather going, but the bowl looks pretty good.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s a nice size for complementing the bathroom but without having a large object taking up too much space on the counter.</li>
            <li>This is a great bowl for wet shaving!</li>
            <li>This bowl is both wide and very easy to make a rich luxurious lather with your shaving brush and favorite shaving soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well made and the colors on it is clear and bright.     </li>
            <li>The complimentary soap that comes with it is good, but I don&#x27;t necessarily care for the scent.  </li>
            <li>The bowl itself is great looking, but it didn&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My brush has standard length bristles and the depth of the bowl is just perfect for your hand holding the brush to remain above the rim while soaping it.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly  and was packed so no chips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather re-heat the bowl quickly between passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i will uses it ocassionally with the cream to make a super lather</li>
            <li>It definitely works much better than a ceramic kitchen cereal bowl I was using, and I like the width more than a shaving mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To be honest, I originally bought this bowl as an inexpensive option to use while I shopped around for the ultimate shaving bowl.  </li>
            <li>I soak this bowl filled with water as hot as I can get it from the faucet.</li>
            <li>I filled the bowl with hot water, and let the brush soak, while I washed my body.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the look of this bowl, and the size - not to big, not to small, made HERE, in the good old U.S. of A - and damn proud of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I wanted a nice heavy bowl, that would hold the heat, and give me room to really whip up a good head of foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Then tonight I made nachos for a light dinner and found a good use for it as a condiment cup for sour cream and guacamole.</li>
            <li>It even came with Colonel Conk&#x27;s Almond soap which spelled pretty good initially.  </li>
            <li>This was exactly what my husband wanted for Father&#x27;s Day!</li>
            <li>Works very well when I use it to shave!!</li>
            <li>What a great little bowl.  </li>
            <li>Believe me, it&#x27;s worth it .</li>
            <li>You will have a smile on your face with every use.</li>
            <li>Does it have enough mass to absorb and maintain heat to keep the lather warm?  </li>
            <li>I almost always use the 3 pass method for shaving, and even on the third application of the lather, it is nice and warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Such a nice bowl.</li>
            <li>It is nice enough</li>
            <li>Well worth the price for this item.</li>
            <li>Overall it is a nice bowl but didn&#x27;t quite measure up to what I wanted for the shaving cream mixing.</li>
            <li>The soap that came with it, &amp;#34;Amber,&amp;#34; is OK but has sort of a soft powdery scent.  </li>
            <li>Together, it is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t too fun either.  </li>
            <li>I will not rate the soap since the using it will provide each person their own experience and they will likely varie,</li>
            <li>My wife likes it on our counter better than my old chipped Army unit mug.</li>
            <li>It just would be nice if the bowls maintained the same color groupings as pictured on the product purchase page.</li>
            <li>and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Nice, I don&#x27;t know why some think it is too deep</li>
            <li>though now i just apply directly to face w/o trying to create more foam to save on time.</li>
            <li>Very nice looking little bowl that works for the intended purpose.</li>
            <li>The bowl is attractive and I&#x27;d be willing to pay about $7 for it, so the total would be about $11 or perhaps $12, but $19 is really too much money for what this is.</li>
            <li>The shape of the bowl is just right for whipping up lather without spilling over the sides.&lt;br /&gt;Tip</li>
            <li>this bowl is the right size i think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just right.  </li>
            <li>This is the only soap bowl I own as well as the first.  </li>
            <li>Solid and seems to fit easily into his hand when he&#x27;s using it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large enough to allow about 1/2 inch of space around the soap bar to everything dries out between uses, and it just looks really nice.  </li>
            <li>Needed a new shaving bowl, and this filled the bill.</li>
            <li>but I did not expect light tan and light BLUE</li>
            <li>Each is unique in the patterns and the size is optimal for getting a nice thick rich lather.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Simply put, this bowl is amazing and relatively small for easy storage on your sink.</li>
            <li>I would very much recommend it to others.  </li>
            <li>It looks good and I like the idea of a ceramic cup, but I did find one little thing.  </li>
            <li>First of all, it&#x27;s somewhat organic and appears handmade, so points for coolness there.</li>
            <li>The top of the bowl curves back in, which seems to help build lather on the concave side of the bowl.</li>
            <li>looks almost exactly like the one</li>
            <li>First and foremost, this product is a bowl NOT a cup.</li>
            <li>As I said I think you can get similar or better performance out of something else</li>
            <li>In addition to my praises for it aboveI also think it&#x27;s the perfect size to pack for a trip ... not too big, not too small ...</li>
            <li>first time I used it was with Colonel Conk Bay Rum (I received the Lime version with this</li>
            <li>/&gt;No movement since the first use.  </li>
            <li>This is my first shave bowl.  </li>
            <li>Looks exactly as pictured and comes with a puck of conk soap (Amber, as I had hoped).  </li>
            <li>Overall pleased with purchase though.</li>
            <li>I like that it came with exactly the soap i used.</li>
            <li>Just used it for the first time tonight.</li>
            <li>have to say the first time I used the brush and bowl</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>I would love to rate this five stars but it has one flaw that can be a big one to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing that I think would make it nicer would be to put some silicone on the bottom so as not to scratch the sink top.  </li>
            <li>Really nice but a bit slippery when wet.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for;</li>
            <li>It also retains heat pretty well.  </li>
            <li>First and only bowl with a satisfied customer</li>
            <li>More of a Maroon to brown to white in appearance.</li>
            <li>Bought this item around 4 months back from amazon and I am absolutely in love with it.</li>
            <li>I love this bowl bought 3 two as gifts no 2 are the same also comes with Soap!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It arrives exactly the way it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li>I like that it is slightly larger than most to allow the collection of the foam produced.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than what I had before which had a slightly smaller diameter.</li>
            <li>pretty convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like it, it holds the heat when I soak in in hot water</li>
            <li>This is my first bowl</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving cup or bowl</li>
            <li>My shaving brush hits the sides of the bowl pretty consistently when I&#x27;m working up a lather</li>
            <li>Read the most critical review listed!  </li>
            <li>it came with, mine being almond (which has broken on me - being more of a Bay Rum / Sandalwood / Barbershop guy) in the metal bowl I had first bought add a lather bowl (and found way too small), where it&#x27;s a perfect fit.</li>
            <li>Good looking cup, heavy feel.</li>
            <li>With this bowl, wide means any soap can fit itno it just fine.  </li>
            <li>Nice handmade bowl Native American style from New Mexico; comes with large puck of Col. Conk shaving soap.</li>
            <li>Nice bowl, looks sharp, wish it had some texture applied to the bottom to aid in lather.</li>
            <li>a handle on a mug or bowl is not a consideration, this one sits flat on the counter and allows me to whip my shaving brush around without moving the bowl all over the place, I could place a moist towel or rubber mat on the granite counter top and the bowl on that</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice bowl, the complaints that it isn&#x27;t perfectly formed are missing the point, it is supposed to be kind of free form, but I was very disappointed that mine came with no soap</li>
            <li>I want to pamper myself a bit more and go back to the brush, but do it with a real bristle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard is good in that you aren&#x27;t constantly &amp;#34;clanking&amp;#34; the bowl with the handle of yoru brush and potentially chipping the bowl.  </li>
            <li>We have discovered that a bowl a bit larger would more likely offer a richer lather, but this one works just fine.</li>
            <li>its pretty, easy to hold, enough space./size.</li>
            <li>It does lather decently, but i think some extra features in the bottom would add some better lathering.</li>
            <li>it-they&#x27;ll break down and you&#x27;ll get a nice, creamy product.</li>
            <li>I picked the Spitalfields 100% Pure Premium Badger Bristle with long handle since it holds water better and is softer and to go along with that i go the Colonel Conk Model 111</li>
            <li>This cup slips easily into my shaving kit, unlike my big shaving mug that can now stay in the bathroom.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too crazy about the color, but in terms of using as a shave cup, it&#x27;s pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>This one kinda hits a few sweet spots :)</li>
            <li>The interior of the Shave Cup has just enough texture to assist in more easily building a good lather quickly, however, the inner walls are sloped inward too much (towards the top) given the depth of the Cup to allow efficient movement without constantly hitting the sides (if your a cream user) with the brush handle, this would not be an issue if you use the hard (puck sized) soaps such as is supplied with the Shave Cup-not recommended for cream users.</li>
            <li>it came with a large col. conk shaving soap (almond scent)...</li>
            <li>Handmade and very high quality.  </li>
            <li>Compared with the real and pictures, there is a certain color, also gave a box of shaving soap</li>
            <li>and I really liked this little bowl.  </li>
            <li>My little nitpick is a handle would be nice, but I&#x27;m really just nitpicking.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy shaving with this bowl and it really just is a solid, no frills shave cup.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.     </li>
            <li>but you can get the same performance from a cheap stoneware bowl from Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>This makes working up a lather much faster and easier, without concern about chipping or breaking the bowl from hitting it</li>
            <li>I really like how this bowl fits in my hand.</li>
            <li>This works really well with the colonel conk soap bar things.</li>
            <li>I fill it with the hottest water I can get from the tap and let it sit while I&#x27;m getting ready to shave.  </li>
            <li>The shaving soap is what I really like.</li>
            <li>The soap it comes with is alright, but I don&#x27;t really like it, so</li>
            <li>I had a stainless steel shave cup before this one that started rusting so it was time for a replacement.  </li>
            <li>I like my foam to be hot and with the stainless mug it wouldn&#x27;t retain the heat and would cool off by the time I mixed it up and applied.  </li>
            <li>The size of this one really helps.</li>
            <li>well.. how much chrome, stainless steal, and ebony/ivory can</li>
            <li>(no by much)</li>
            <li>The shave cup color was better than I expected...</li>
            <li>When i make my cream too much of it just comes flying out if i mix vigorously ( which you should be doing).</li>
            <li>I really like all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find the size, depth, and lip work very well</li>
            <li>The bowl feels extremely tiny in my hands, kind of like if Angre the Giant ate cereal from a kids cereal bowl.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not worried about tipping it if I want to just use one hand to later up the soap, and rinsing it off with warm water leaves the same glossy sheen that it came with.  </li>
            <li>The bowl retains heat well from soaking my brush in warm water for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I gave it four stars because I feel like the top could have been a little wider as I have very large hands.  </li>
            <li>Load the brush, dump the water out, drop in a splash of new hot water, and start lathering.  </li>
            <li>It smells a little too sweet, but it lathers fine for me</li>
            <li>So this is my 2nd &amp;#34;frother bowl&amp;#34; since switchign to wet shaving the last 2 months (it&#x27;s been an INTENSE 2 months as I&#x27;ve studied, practiced, experienced, and pursued the &amp;#34;perfect shave for me&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>Other soap/lather bowls cost more and don&#x27;t come with soap.</li>
            <li>Remove the brush and give it a gentle shake to clear out some of the water it is retaining and dump the hot water out of the bowl.</li>
            <li>There are some earth tones from brown to tan, lush greens and a pretty purple striping as well.</li>
            <li>planning go go with shave gel next to get full capacity of bowl.</li>
            <li>Nice bowl, well made, too small though.</li>
            <li>I also like how it came with a Colonel Conk soap, which provided a decent scent and shave.</li>
            <li>I had looked at some of the wood bowls, which look nice, but I worried about them always being wet and possibly rotting the wood.  </li>
            <li>This is a decent bowl.  </li>
            <li>It has a decent heft and quality feel.  </li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t by the bowl and expect to get a decent shave soap with it.</li>
            <li>is probably my second favorite soap next to Proraso</li>
            <li>Holds heat decently.</li>
            <li>would buy this again, unless I saw a differently styled bowl that was the same size and shape that I happened to like the aesthetics more.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>But I do feel the cost is about $5 too high.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I wish it had a little more texture on the inside.</li>
            <li>The cup is a classic New Mexico hand-thrown ceramic cup.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten the chance to use the soap, but as far as the cup goes I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li>Worth getting the bowl and chucking the soap...or donating to local shelter.</li>
            <li>The problem is the top is too narrow.  </li>
            <li>it means your froth is going to ride up your brush and onto the handle and above (not so useful).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got that nice handmade look to it without the pretentious price tag to accompany it.</li>
            <li>As a soap maker, I would quickly order this again to steer fellows away from canned foam lubricants, but for personal use, will probably try to find something as pretty but just a bit bigger if/when the time comes for a replacemet.</li>
            <li>It is a bit larger than soap diameter and the extra water can be easily poured out if needed.  </li>
            <li>This bowl might be just right for someone else, but I like to use a larger bowl to create leather with.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t seem to have that issue with my stainless steel bowl as the rim is lower and the stainless steel bowl seems to have more of an open base and is more accessible.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m rating this product so low because I feel this is an inferior product and also because there isn&#x27;t an ingredient list available to the public.</li>
            <li>I find that it lathers really well, stays slippery enough that my face doesn&#x27;t complain, and the lather lasts really well.</li>
            <li>Fits well in hand and deep enough for plenty of rich lather.</li>
            <li>Overall, I was pretty bummed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like the soap you get, the bowl it still a pretty solid deal by itself in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It looks really classy!</li>
            <li>Like the bowl, like the design, but it is bigger than most shaving soaps other that the Colonel Conk soap, so it moves around in the bowl while you are trying to lather.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think a cup, mug, bowl, etc. would be a big deal</li>
            <li>Still makes a neck of a lather bowl, if you can look past that, as the lip keeps the lather from migrating out the top / sides.</li>
            <li>It is big without being too big and it stays warm there by keeping your lather warm long enough for your down stroke, cross stroke, and up stroke.  </li>
            <li>i keep my vanity clean and looking sharp when im not at the sink...</li>
            <li>I especially like how the top edges curl in-- not too much, but just enough to make it harder to launch your lather across the room.</li>
            <li>the way it fits in your hand I am 5&#x27;6&amp;#34; so I don&#x27;t have giant hands, easy to hold when wet..</li>
            <li>It is slightly slippery if it gets wet on the outside, and I wouldn&#x27;t want to drop it, but it feels good in the palm of the hand when using it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually for the large 3.75 ounce bar.  </li>
            <li>There are much better shave soaps out there, so I suggest spending a little extra.</li>
            <li>The opening is wide enough to lather comfortably.</li>
            <li>Its me well..the only thing I really don&#x27;t like is the size.</li>
            <li>As far as shaving bowls go this does this job</li>
            <li>The colors on the one I received are similar to the photo shown, but much brighter comparatively.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the smallness of the bowl itself.</li>
            <li>I call it a bowl - for shaving soap, using the old fashioned brush method.  </li>
            <li>Instead I use a high-glycerin content soft shaving soap with a badger hair brush.  </li>
            <li>Stick with Taylor of Old Bond or Proraso shave cream.  </li>
            <li>I emptied nearly all the water from the bowl leaving just a touch in, then brush whipped my head of foam in the bowl...  </li>
            <li>It fits squarely in the palm of my hand, and I can grip it so that I have complete control of it.</li>
            <li>and I like it so far.</li>
            <li>Very well made, and it&#x27;s an American product.</li>
            <li>, the whole ceramic bowl goes with my asian</li>
            <li>I love how it looks, and it is just the right size for the larger refills of various hard soaps.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The included soap I got was &#x27;Amber&#x27; scented, and works fine, since it&#x27;s glycerin based, it leaves my face a little &#x27;slick&#x27;, which is good, but some folks may find the feeling a little disconcerting.  </li>
            <li>soap hat comes with it lathers up nicely and has a very faint, mild scent.</li>
            <li>An important point about the proportion of this bowl is that it&#x27;s not so deep that I find myself hitting it with my brush handle as I have with other bowls I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had many other ones other than an old mug that is an antique from my Grandfather that I err on not using anymore.</li>
            <li>Produces a rich lather in a few seconds and is a delight to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(P.S. - I can&#x27;t comment on the soap that came with the bowl because I haven&#x27;t used it, mostly because I prefer creams and if I use a hard shaving soap these days it likely to be Proraso for Sensitive Skin.)</li>
            <li>The unglazed bottom is a huge plus, because without it I&#x27;m not sure how I could hold it without dropping it.</li>
            <li>While there are less expensive options out there for shaving bowls and mugs, and more expensive ones as well, this one fits the bill for me perfectly.</li>
            <li>have an older stainless steel bowl I was using previously for my shaving cream and will probably return to using that for the creams.  </li>
            <li>so I spent a few more dollars and bought this beauty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it works just fine, and fits perfectly in my thick fingered ape hands (Size 12 ring).  </li>
            <li>it is not super deep, but it has a wide mouth so you can build a great head of foam vs the deep narrow mouth cups.  </li>
            <li>it is not super deep, but it has a wide mouth so you can build a great head of foam vs the deep narrow mouth cups.  </li>
            <li>used to use a cheap artificial bristle shaving brush, and cheap soap cup back in my 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>But secondary concern (or maybe primary for you..</li>
            <li>But after seeing and using this bowl, it was clear, I had already purchased the ultimate shaving bowl!  </li>
            <li>(but this is apparent from the pictures)</li>
            <li>I can see that it would be very slippery when wet</li>
            <li>There are several points of view on a shaving bowl or mug, handle or no handle, just use an old mug or bowl you have sitting around...</li>
            <li>do&#x27;nt oftn write somethign with no real downsider but this one really doesn&#x27;t have any.  </li>
            <li>deep to get your brush in it, a normal sized badger bristle brush will stand just so the handle is outside the cup.</li>
            <li>The bowl had cracked right down the middle</li>
            <li>Shallow cup with wide top makes it easy to whip up a thick batch of lather.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I really like it and recommend it.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t really call this a cup but in any case i just got this the other day</li>
            <li>In my experience, it builds a lather about twice as fast as other bowls or mugs.  </li>
            <li>; (very subtle) keeps most of it in.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very attractive, but I find the base too wide.  </li>
            <li>It is nice and heavy, thick.</li>
            <li>The bottom is indeed unglazed and a little rough, which is fine on my standard counter.  </li>
            <li>I shave in the shower, so it was a little tricky at first.</li>
            <li>Shaving is no fun, but it is much easier with this shave cup.</li>
            <li>Shallow is better (as long as it&#x27;s deep enough to hodl the amount of froth you want to create).  </li>
            <li>A little large for my hand but still functional.</li>
            <li>The bottom of the bowl is a little coarse giving it plenty of friction so there is also little worry about it sliding around even if the counter top is wet.</li>
            <li>My husband has said he misses a handle but really hasn&#x27;t complained loudly about not having one.</li>

            <li> so it&#x27;s very easy to get a good lather going in the bowl before applying.  </li>
            <li> The bowl is very stylish and easy to make a great lather.</li>
            <li> I love this shave system!</li>
            <li> Quite handsome!  </li>
            <li> I believe it&#x27;s hand made and made in AMERICA, which I just LOVE!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> Works beautifully with my shaving brush and its low profile is perfect on the sink.  </li>
            <li> To me, it&#x27;s the perfect size for a large soap disk or for creating a lather with shave cream.</li>
            <li> Nice Size to Grip in Hand, Bottom Is Unfinshed</li>
            <li> However it catches the brush handle and makes a nice clinking noise.</li>
            <li> Plus it sits perfectly on a shelf in the medicine cabinet or decoratively on the counter without taking up much space.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the best shave of my life.</li>
            <li> Also fits nice in your hand as you lather up your brush.</li>
            <li> This shaving bowl by Colonel Conk nicely fulfills every one of my criteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It would be nice if you could choose the scent</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s glazed nicely &amp; I can&#x27;t complain about anything.  </li>
            <li> Nice color</li>
            <li> It came with Colonel Conk&#x27;s glycerin shave soap which was a nice bonus to the bowl.  </li>
            <li> Even so, it is not a problem to whip up a nice lather.  </li>
            <li> It was a good economical way to get a great shaving cup.</li>
            <li> Nice looking bowl.</li>
            <li> you get a nice ceramic bowl AND some shaving soap.</li>
            <li> The soap comes in its own plastic container so you can gift it to the in-laws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> but I use my own cream.</li>
            <li> It looks really nice</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s a nice touch.</li>
            <li> This is a nicely made bowl.  </li>
            <li> If you warm it up it holds heat</li>
            <li> Nice bowl, and</li>
            <li> The soap was a nice add on as well.</li>
            <li> but then again its a nice piece to have around too.</li>
            <li> nice size</li>
            <li> .. nice look...  </li>
            <li> have to say, there is a nice difference, between using the brush method vs. applying soap from your hand.  </li>
            <li> Santa Fe Shave Cup with Soap is a really nice tool for my shaving.</li>
            <li> The weight of the bowl is nice.  </li>
            <li> The weight of the bowl is nice.  </li>
            <li> have a really nice glass shelf that holds all of my shaving stuff.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice feel and allow plenty of room for the lather to collect.  </li>
            <li> The clay holds the heat well and makes for nice, warm lather.  </li>
            <li> Nice weight, size, and looks manly.  </li>
            <li> Nice colors.</li>
            <li> That being said, it is still a nice bowl with nice colors.</li>
            <li> It also looks nice, and the Col. Conk Bayrum shave soap it came with</li>
            <li> nice stone bowl, holds heat well.  </li>
            <li> This bowl has a nice weight in your hand and is well made.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be made really nice.</li>
            <li> This is a nice stoneware bowl.</li>
            <li> There are some that have reservoirs to keep stuff warm.</li>
            <li> Nice bowl and soap combination.</li>
            <li> Looks nice too.</li>
            <li> It is curved nicely.</li>
            <li> it allows for a really nice lather to be build up along the edges.</li>
            <li> It has a nice finish just like the picture and fits in my hand well.</li>
            <li> the bowl is hand made in mexico and seems to retain heat very well and is the perfect size for the amount of shaving cream you need for 3-4 passes.</li>
            <li> It feels and fits nice in the hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice substantial bowel but returned item.</li>
            <li> It looks nice, is sized well and has a hefty feel to it.  </li>
            <li> It retains heat to ensure warm lather.  </li>
            <li> The colors are nice.</li>
            <li> This bowl is stylish and perfect size, fits right in your hand to make your shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Kept its heat very nicely as well, and was easy to clean, and the bowl is attractive to look at.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to build a nice lather in this bowl.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shave bowl, excellent buy!</li>
            <li> Also, the fact that it comes with a free soap makes this an amazing deal!</li>
            <li> Beautiful bowl,and worth the price.</li>
            <li> Very easy to hold in my hand and work up a lather.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect size to fit your hand and the shape is just right for building a lather.  </li>
            <li> It is very attractive as far as the colors and design are.  </li>
            <li> It looks handsome and will blend nicely with any decor.</li>
            <li> Looks nice on the bathroom counter top.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely stylish and a nice touch to your collection as well.  </li>
            <li> Some might want the water thing (skettle?) to keep things more warm.  </li>
            <li> so it keeps warm once you heat it up with hot water, and it is a great size.  </li>
            <li> The proportions are pleasant, and more importantly to me fit my hand well as I&#x27;m holding it when working up a lather.</li>
            <li> best way to use this bowl is to run hot water into it for 30 seconds or until the water is hot and the bowl is warm to the touch.  </li>
            <li> Great shaving cup that performs exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Beautifully made and very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Absorbs heat easily and keeps the cream warm.</li>
            <li> Fits nicely in my hand and is easy to control - no dropping this one.</li>
            <li> Mine has a very pleasant, light scent and it worked up to a decent lather.</li>
            <li> Not in love with the scent but for that price you can&#x27;t beat a bowl and some soap.</li>
            <li> The bowl looks great sitting out - very decorative piece.  </li>
            <li> This is simply an OK bowl for a beginner</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with the lather, scent, or the overall consistency of this soap.</li>
            <li> I scent I received is called Amber, which smells just ok.</li>
            <li> can spend more, but don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> You cannot find a better shaving bowl......</li>
            <li> (my favorite brush is a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Love the bowl.  </li>
            <li> Better than using a mug or cup.  </li>
            <li> I use Mitchells Wool Fat shaving soap most of the time.</li>
            <li> Nice size and free shaving soap.</li>
            <li> It is attractive and looks good next to my safety razor shaver set.</li>
            <li> I have not tried it with the included shaving soap and I am assuming it will work better with shaving soaps.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Give the soap a try and see it works better for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it when China is spelled &amp;#34;Made in AMERICA!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Lovely colors.</li>
            <li> Love the size and shape of it.</li>
            <li> Overall, great product!!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with them.  </li>
            <li> I got a better, closer shave.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, I&#x27;d love to give it five stars but...</li>
            <li> I am more than satisfied with this shave cup.</li>
            <li> but this bowl has made me want to shave more.</li>
            <li> so I assume all&#x27;s well and enjoyed.</li>
            <li> The best bowl (in terms of practicality) that I&#x27;ve used was a simple plastic cereal bowl.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s probably more durable than the coffee mugs you use every day.  </li>
            <li> If your looking for something to set more on a granite or marble counter or just want that look</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before I gifted it</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pleased with its construction and aesthetics.</li>
            <li> my favorite is [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This cup does a much better job at keeping the heat.</li>
            <li> Started using the shave cup to be more environmentally friendly, turns out that I like it much better than the pressurized cans and its cheaper too!</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s tiny actually.. perfect for your palm)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shallower and wider is much better and easier to get to the froth.</li>
            <li> w/handle would probably not accommodate all soap sizes to drop into the mug (if you want to do it that way.. which i get the impression most people do).  </li>
            <li> ; on top to keep lather in (it will escape mind</li>
            <li> Not quite sure.  </li>
            <li> Some might want more texturing for aggressive/easier lathering.  </li>
            <li> The rim is too curved so the brush bangs off the sides of the top.  </li>
            <li> i love the way they look on my vanity....</li>
            <li> im thinking about maybe buying 2 more....</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I bought this.  </li>
            <li> I love the look of this shave cup.</li>
            <li> By no means a deal breaker, but a slightly larger opening would&#x27;ve made it perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this bowl....</li>
            <li> I love using this cup.</li>
            <li> Love the look.</li>
            <li> very well made, and has some great earth tones in the bowl.</li>
            <li> I love this bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The product I received had more greens and purples.</li>
            <li> The effect is that I get a hot to warm lather to use because the bowl holds a nice amount of heat in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A pretty good bowl.  </li>
            <li> Good at first.</li>
            <li> It holds the round shaving soaps perfectly and looks amazing on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> you can just as easily (actually MORE easily) hold a bowl in the palm of your hands for this then grab a skinny handle and use that to hold the weight of the cup up.  </li>
            <li> Heavy, nicely built and the color is as pictured, matches perfect.</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;m really pleased with, is that when I was done shaving, my face felt nice and cool and smooth.</li>
            <li> I like Proraso Sandalwood Shaving soap better, but this Colnel Conk soap is fine.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it works great, and looks good in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> and it looks pretty nice for sure</li>
            <li> It works great and doesn&#x27;t take long to whip up a nice cream.  </li>
            <li> It is just the right size and fits nicely in the palm of my hand.</li>
            <li> soap that came with it is excellent though, I would highly recommend it to others who are looking for a decent soap.</li>
            <li> Easy to whip up a lather.</li>
            <li> This mug very quickly replaced my shaving cup.  </li>
            <li> I love this cup, well made, nice looking and very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I have with it which is just a side-effect of it being curved in at the top (which is great for keeping the lather in) is my metal handled brush clunks against the rim, but I bought it expecting that.</li>
            <li> You want something easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> So.. bowls are just as easy to handle over mugs or cups with handles.  </li>
            <li> NOt to worry.. lathering is easy wiht this bowl</li>
            <li> good solid bowl,serves it purpose nice colors</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfect size for the average shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> I sit it in HOT water drawn in my sink to keep the lather on the warm side.  </li>
            <li> This one looked pretty nice</li>
            <li> I wanted a shaving bowl/mug that would be easy and comfortable to hold, that was pleasing to look at and that would be easy to use to work up a lather with using a variety of brushes and creams.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s a high quality product, holds heat respectably, and looks nice on your counter.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pleased with the item I was most interested in.  </li>
            <li> mode that cermic bowls are fine</li>
            <li> But it leaves the skin feeling fine.</li>
            <li> It would be perfect if it were just a half an inch deeper.</li>
            <li> works fine.</li>
            <li> let the cup sit in hot water before I use it, and it holds the heat really well, giving me a nice, warm lather.</li>
            <li> and it really isn&#x27;t a huge deal -</li>
            <li> It retains heat reasonably well, so the soap goes on warm, which is ideal for a wet shave.</li>
            <li> it proudly sits next to the brush stand.</li>
            <li> The soap is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Softens my beard for a smooth effortless shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Those don&#x27;t sound like ingredients that I want on my face.</li>
            <li> The product seemed and felt cheap, but the ingredients confirmed my thoughts.</li>
            <li> Well for me here are the important things.  </li>
            <li> For me value for money is all about quality, aesthetics and fit for purpose.</li>
            <li> Free Shaving Brush Stand from Parker Safety Razor]]</li>
            <li> It allows you to position the bowl incredibly comfortably.</li>
            <li> It is solid and looks great.</li>
            <li> that being said, the cup is great, it&#x27;s not so deep that you have to go elbow</li>
            <li> They all seem to be cheaply made even though they weren&#x27;t cheap.  </li>
            <li> It fits nicely in my hand but does not allow much room to work the shave cream around with a badger brush.  </li>
            <li> Now while the bowl fits comfortably in the palm of my hand, the soap tends to spin around inside the bowl.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too worried about the sound</li>
            <li> I buy the packs of 100 for convince they are available in 25,50,100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> that isn&#x27;t that important.</li>
            <li> and now i can enjoy the heat of the lather too</li>
            <li> It does look nice and i have dropped it once or twice in the sink and it has not broken.</li>
            <li> Great solid dish.</li>
            <li> Great price (especially with the soap included).</li>
            <li> The actual bowl is of great quality, and it really helps make a nice lather.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is made in the good old USA and that is a plus.</li>
            <li> For $19 you get $4 worth of Colonel Conk shaving soap and a nice looking ceramic bowl about the right size and shape for use as a shaving soap bowl.</li>
            <li> It has a nice texture on the inside that helps build lather pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this Shave Cup, its attractive, masculine and of an appropriate size for its purpose.</li>
            <li> Looks Classic And Being Hand Made, One  Of A Kind</li>
            <li> Unique feel.</li>
            <li> Husband was excited when he recv&#x27;d it</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that each one is unique.</li>
            <li> When accomplished, however, this soap affords a closer, more comfortable shave than anything in a can, jar, or tube.</li>
            <li> I love this heavy, attractive -</li>
            <li> It wipes clean and shiny after finishing.  </li>
            <li> Stays hot for nice hot lather.</li>
            <li> The material, once heated with warm water nicely holds heat providing a warm lather even into a second or third pass.</li>
            <li> Nothing really special about it</li>
            <li> The bowl itself is nothing special.</li>
            <li> its more like a bowl, not a cup, it has a classic look, like the material, and can fit shaving soaps no problem.</li>
            <li> Really great looking bowl, haven&#x27;t tried the included shaving soap because I bought this as part of several pieces I thought I needed for first time shaving with DE safety razors.  </li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve written a full review for this brush as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll cool off faster and well before you&#x27;re done anyway.  </li>
            <li> My husband LOVED his Christmas present.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird but it looks really classic and awesome which makes me feel pretty classic and awesome when I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First, does it has texture to make whipping up tons of creamy lather easy?  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, the wide mouth allows you to work up a good lather quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> Hard to get a good lather going, but the bowl looks pretty good.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s a nice size for complementing the bathroom but without having a large object taking up too much space on the counter.</li>
            <li> This is a great bowl for wet shaving!</li>
            <li> This bowl is both wide and very easy to make a rich luxurious lather with your shaving brush and favorite shaving soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well made and the colors on it is clear and bright.     </li>
            <li> The complimentary soap that comes with it is good, but I don&#x27;t necessarily care for the scent.  </li>
            <li> The bowl itself is great looking, but it didn&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My brush has standard length bristles and the depth of the bowl is just perfect for your hand holding the brush to remain above the rim while soaping it.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly  and was packed so no chips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather re-heat the bowl quickly between passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i will uses it ocassionally with the cream to make a super lather</li>
            <li> It definitely works much better than a ceramic kitchen cereal bowl I was using, and I like the width more than a shaving mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To be honest, I originally bought this bowl as an inexpensive option to use while I shopped around for the ultimate shaving bowl.  </li>
            <li> I soak this bowl filled with water as hot as I can get it from the faucet.</li>
            <li> I filled the bowl with hot water, and let the brush soak, while I washed my body.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the look of this bowl, and the size - not to big, not to small, made HERE, in the good old U.S. of A - and damn proud of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wanted a nice heavy bowl, that would hold the heat, and give me room to really whip up a good head of foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Then tonight I made nachos for a light dinner and found a good use for it as a condiment cup for sour cream and guacamole.</li>
            <li> It even came with Colonel Conk&#x27;s Almond soap which spelled pretty good initially.  </li>
            <li> This was exactly what my husband wanted for Father&#x27;s Day!</li>
            <li> Works very well when I use it to shave!!</li>
            <li> What a great little bowl.  </li>
            <li> Believe me, it&#x27;s worth it .</li>
            <li> You will have a smile on your face with every use.</li>
            <li> Does it have enough mass to absorb and maintain heat to keep the lather warm?  </li>
            <li> I almost always use the 3 pass method for shaving, and even on the third application of the lather, it is nice and warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Such a nice bowl.</li>
            <li> It is nice enough</li>
            <li> Well worth the price for this item.</li>
            <li> Overall it is a nice bowl but didn&#x27;t quite measure up to what I wanted for the shaving cream mixing.</li>
            <li> The soap that came with it, &amp;#34;Amber,&amp;#34; is OK but has sort of a soft powdery scent.  </li>
            <li> Together, it is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t too fun either.  </li>
            <li> I will not rate the soap since the using it will provide each person their own experience and they will likely varie,</li>
            <li> My wife likes it on our counter better than my old chipped Army unit mug.</li>
            <li> It just would be nice if the bowls maintained the same color groupings as pictured on the product purchase page.</li>
            <li> and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Nice, I don&#x27;t know why some think it is too deep</li>
            <li> though now i just apply directly to face w/o trying to create more foam to save on time.</li>
            <li> Very nice looking little bowl that works for the intended purpose.</li>
            <li> The bowl is attractive and I&#x27;d be willing to pay about $7 for it, so the total would be about $11 or perhaps $12, but $19 is really too much money for what this is.</li>
            <li> The shape of the bowl is just right for whipping up lather without spilling over the sides.&lt;br /&gt;Tip</li>
            <li> this bowl is the right size i think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just right.  </li>
            <li> This is the only soap bowl I own as well as the first.  </li>
            <li> Solid and seems to fit easily into his hand when he&#x27;s using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s large enough to allow about 1/2 inch of space around the soap bar to everything dries out between uses, and it just looks really nice.  </li>
            <li> Needed a new shaving bowl, and this filled the bill.</li>
            <li> but I did not expect light tan and light BLUE</li>
            <li> Each is unique in the patterns and the size is optimal for getting a nice thick rich lather.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Simply put, this bowl is amazing and relatively small for easy storage on your sink.</li>
            <li> I would very much recommend it to others.  </li>
            <li> It looks good and I like the idea of a ceramic cup, but I did find one little thing.  </li>
            <li> First of all, it&#x27;s somewhat organic and appears handmade, so points for coolness there.</li>
            <li> The top of the bowl curves back in, which seems to help build lather on the concave side of the bowl.</li>
            <li> looks almost exactly like the one</li>
            <li> First and foremost, this product is a bowl NOT a cup.</li>
            <li> As I said I think you can get similar or better performance out of something else</li>
            <li> In addition to my praises for it aboveI also think it&#x27;s the perfect size to pack for a trip ... not too big, not too small ...</li>
            <li> first time I used it was with Colonel Conk Bay Rum (I received the Lime version with this</li>
            <li> /&gt;No movement since the first use.  </li>
            <li> This is my first shave bowl.  </li>
            <li> Looks exactly as pictured and comes with a puck of conk soap (Amber, as I had hoped).  </li>
            <li> Overall pleased with purchase though.</li>
            <li> I like that it came with exactly the soap i used.</li>
            <li> Just used it for the first time tonight.</li>
            <li> have to say the first time I used the brush and bowl</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> I would love to rate this five stars but it has one flaw that can be a big one to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing that I think would make it nicer would be to put some silicone on the bottom so as not to scratch the sink top.  </li>
            <li> Really nice but a bit slippery when wet.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for;</li>
            <li> It also retains heat pretty well.  </li>
            <li> First and only bowl with a satisfied customer</li>
            <li> More of a Maroon to brown to white in appearance.</li>
            <li> Bought this item around 4 months back from amazon and I am absolutely in love with it.</li>
            <li> I love this bowl bought 3 two as gifts no 2 are the same also comes with Soap!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It arrives exactly the way it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li> I like that it is slightly larger than most to allow the collection of the foam produced.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than what I had before which had a slightly smaller diameter.</li>
            <li> pretty convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like it, it holds the heat when I soak in in hot water</li>
            <li> This is my first bowl</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving cup or bowl</li>
            <li> My shaving brush hits the sides of the bowl pretty consistently when I&#x27;m working up a lather</li>
            <li> Read the most critical review listed!  </li>
            <li> it came with, mine being almond (which has broken on me - being more of a Bay Rum / Sandalwood / Barbershop guy) in the metal bowl I had first bought add a lather bowl (and found way too small), where it&#x27;s a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> Good looking cup, heavy feel.</li>
            <li> With this bowl, wide means any soap can fit itno it just fine.  </li>
            <li> Nice handmade bowl Native American style from New Mexico; comes with large puck of Col. Conk shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Nice bowl, looks sharp, wish it had some texture applied to the bottom to aid in lather.</li>
            <li> a handle on a mug or bowl is not a consideration, this one sits flat on the counter and allows me to whip my shaving brush around without moving the bowl all over the place, I could place a moist towel or rubber mat on the granite counter top and the bowl on that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice bowl, the complaints that it isn&#x27;t perfectly formed are missing the point, it is supposed to be kind of free form, but I was very disappointed that mine came with no soap</li>
            <li> I want to pamper myself a bit more and go back to the brush, but do it with a real bristle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard is good in that you aren&#x27;t constantly &amp;#34;clanking&amp;#34; the bowl with the handle of yoru brush and potentially chipping the bowl.  </li>
            <li> We have discovered that a bowl a bit larger would more likely offer a richer lather, but this one works just fine.</li>
            <li> its pretty, easy to hold, enough space./size.</li>
            <li> It does lather decently, but i think some extra features in the bottom would add some better lathering.</li>
            <li> it-they&#x27;ll break down and you&#x27;ll get a nice, creamy product.</li>
            <li> I picked the Spitalfields 100% Pure Premium Badger Bristle with long handle since it holds water better and is softer and to go along with that i go the Colonel Conk Model 111</li>
            <li> This cup slips easily into my shaving kit, unlike my big shaving mug that can now stay in the bathroom.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too crazy about the color, but in terms of using as a shave cup, it&#x27;s pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> This one kinda hits a few sweet spots :)</li>
            <li> The interior of the Shave Cup has just enough texture to assist in more easily building a good lather quickly, however, the inner walls are sloped inward too much (towards the top) given the depth of the Cup to allow efficient movement without constantly hitting the sides (if your a cream user) with the brush handle, this would not be an issue if you use the hard (puck sized) soaps such as is supplied with the Shave Cup-not recommended for cream users.</li>
            <li> it came with a large col. conk shaving soap (almond scent)...</li>
            <li> Handmade and very high quality.  </li>
            <li> Compared with the real and pictures, there is a certain color, also gave a box of shaving soap</li>
            <li> and I really liked this little bowl.  </li>
            <li> My little nitpick is a handle would be nice, but I&#x27;m really just nitpicking.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy shaving with this bowl and it really just is a solid, no frills shave cup.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.     </li>
            <li> but you can get the same performance from a cheap stoneware bowl from Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> This makes working up a lather much faster and easier, without concern about chipping or breaking the bowl from hitting it</li>
            <li> I really like how this bowl fits in my hand.</li>
            <li> This works really well with the colonel conk soap bar things.</li>
            <li> I fill it with the hottest water I can get from the tap and let it sit while I&#x27;m getting ready to shave.  </li>
            <li> The shaving soap is what I really like.</li>
            <li> The soap it comes with is alright, but I don&#x27;t really like it, so</li>
            <li> I had a stainless steel shave cup before this one that started rusting so it was time for a replacement.  </li>
            <li> I like my foam to be hot and with the stainless mug it wouldn&#x27;t retain the heat and would cool off by the time I mixed it up and applied.  </li>
            <li> The size of this one really helps.</li>
            <li> well.. how much chrome, stainless steal, and ebony/ivory can</li>
            <li> (no by much)</li>
            <li> The shave cup color was better than I expected...</li>
            <li> When i make my cream too much of it just comes flying out if i mix vigorously ( which you should be doing).</li>
            <li> I really like all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find the size, depth, and lip work very well</li>
            <li> The bowl feels extremely tiny in my hands, kind of like if Angre the Giant ate cereal from a kids cereal bowl.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not worried about tipping it if I want to just use one hand to later up the soap, and rinsing it off with warm water leaves the same glossy sheen that it came with.  </li>
            <li> The bowl retains heat well from soaking my brush in warm water for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because I feel like the top could have been a little wider as I have very large hands.  </li>
            <li> Load the brush, dump the water out, drop in a splash of new hot water, and start lathering.  </li>
            <li> It smells a little too sweet, but it lathers fine for me</li>
            <li> So this is my 2nd &amp;#34;frother bowl&amp;#34; since switchign to wet shaving the last 2 months (it&#x27;s been an INTENSE 2 months as I&#x27;ve studied, practiced, experienced, and pursued the &amp;#34;perfect shave for me&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li> Other soap/lather bowls cost more and don&#x27;t come with soap.</li>
            <li> Remove the brush and give it a gentle shake to clear out some of the water it is retaining and dump the hot water out of the bowl.</li>
            <li> There are some earth tones from brown to tan, lush greens and a pretty purple striping as well.</li>
            <li> planning go go with shave gel next to get full capacity of bowl.</li>
            <li> Nice bowl, well made, too small though.</li>
            <li> I also like how it came with a Colonel Conk soap, which provided a decent scent and shave.</li>
            <li> I had looked at some of the wood bowls, which look nice, but I worried about them always being wet and possibly rotting the wood.  </li>
            <li> This is a decent bowl.  </li>
            <li> It has a decent heft and quality feel.  </li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t by the bowl and expect to get a decent shave soap with it.</li>
            <li> is probably my second favorite soap next to Proraso</li>
            <li> Holds heat decently.</li>
            <li> would buy this again, unless I saw a differently styled bowl that was the same size and shape that I happened to like the aesthetics more.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> But I do feel the cost is about $5 too high.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I wish it had a little more texture on the inside.</li>
            <li> The cup is a classic New Mexico hand-thrown ceramic cup.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten the chance to use the soap, but as far as the cup goes I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li> Worth getting the bowl and chucking the soap...or donating to local shelter.</li>
            <li> The problem is the top is too narrow.  </li>
            <li> it means your froth is going to ride up your brush and onto the handle and above (not so useful).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got that nice handmade look to it without the pretentious price tag to accompany it.</li>
            <li> As a soap maker, I would quickly order this again to steer fellows away from canned foam lubricants, but for personal use, will probably try to find something as pretty but just a bit bigger if/when the time comes for a replacemet.</li>
            <li> It is a bit larger than soap diameter and the extra water can be easily poured out if needed.  </li>
            <li> This bowl might be just right for someone else, but I like to use a larger bowl to create leather with.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t seem to have that issue with my stainless steel bowl as the rim is lower and the stainless steel bowl seems to have more of an open base and is more accessible.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rating this product so low because I feel this is an inferior product and also because there isn&#x27;t an ingredient list available to the public.</li>
            <li> I find that it lathers really well, stays slippery enough that my face doesn&#x27;t complain, and the lather lasts really well.</li>
            <li> Fits well in hand and deep enough for plenty of rich lather.</li>
            <li> Overall, I was pretty bummed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like the soap you get, the bowl it still a pretty solid deal by itself in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It looks really classy!</li>
            <li> Like the bowl, like the design, but it is bigger than most shaving soaps other that the Colonel Conk soap, so it moves around in the bowl while you are trying to lather.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think a cup, mug, bowl, etc. would be a big deal</li>
            <li> Still makes a neck of a lather bowl, if you can look past that, as the lip keeps the lather from migrating out the top / sides.</li>
            <li> It is big without being too big and it stays warm there by keeping your lather warm long enough for your down stroke, cross stroke, and up stroke.  </li>
            <li> i keep my vanity clean and looking sharp when im not at the sink...</li>
            <li> I especially like how the top edges curl in-- not too much, but just enough to make it harder to launch your lather across the room.</li>
            <li> the way it fits in your hand I am 5&#x27;6&amp;#34; so I don&#x27;t have giant hands, easy to hold when wet..</li>
            <li> It is slightly slippery if it gets wet on the outside, and I wouldn&#x27;t want to drop it, but it feels good in the palm of the hand when using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually for the large 3.75 ounce bar.  </li>
            <li> There are much better shave soaps out there, so I suggest spending a little extra.</li>
            <li> The opening is wide enough to lather comfortably.</li>
            <li> Its me well..the only thing I really don&#x27;t like is the size.</li>
            <li> As far as shaving bowls go this does this job</li>
            <li> The colors on the one I received are similar to the photo shown, but much brighter comparatively.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the smallness of the bowl itself.</li>
            <li> I call it a bowl - for shaving soap, using the old fashioned brush method.  </li>
            <li> Instead I use a high-glycerin content soft shaving soap with a badger hair brush.  </li>
            <li> Stick with Taylor of Old Bond or Proraso shave cream.  </li>
            <li> I emptied nearly all the water from the bowl leaving just a touch in, then brush whipped my head of foam in the bowl...  </li>
            <li> It fits squarely in the palm of my hand, and I can grip it so that I have complete control of it.</li>
            <li> and I like it so far.</li>
            <li> Very well made, and it&#x27;s an American product.</li>
            <li> , the whole ceramic bowl goes with my asian</li>
            <li> I love how it looks, and it is just the right size for the larger refills of various hard soaps.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The included soap I got was &#x27;Amber&#x27; scented, and works fine, since it&#x27;s glycerin based, it leaves my face a little &#x27;slick&#x27;, which is good, but some folks may find the feeling a little disconcerting.  </li>
            <li> soap hat comes with it lathers up nicely and has a very faint, mild scent.</li>
            <li> An important point about the proportion of this bowl is that it&#x27;s not so deep that I find myself hitting it with my brush handle as I have with other bowls I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had many other ones other than an old mug that is an antique from my Grandfather that I err on not using anymore.</li>
            <li> Produces a rich lather in a few seconds and is a delight to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(P.S. - I can&#x27;t comment on the soap that came with the bowl because I haven&#x27;t used it, mostly because I prefer creams and if I use a hard shaving soap these days it likely to be Proraso for Sensitive Skin.)</li>
            <li> The unglazed bottom is a huge plus, because without it I&#x27;m not sure how I could hold it without dropping it.</li>
            <li> While there are less expensive options out there for shaving bowls and mugs, and more expensive ones as well, this one fits the bill for me perfectly.</li>
            <li> have an older stainless steel bowl I was using previously for my shaving cream and will probably return to using that for the creams.  </li>
            <li> so I spent a few more dollars and bought this beauty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it works just fine, and fits perfectly in my thick fingered ape hands (Size 12 ring).  </li>
            <li> it is not super deep, but it has a wide mouth so you can build a great head of foam vs the deep narrow mouth cups.  </li>
            <li> it is not super deep, but it has a wide mouth so you can build a great head of foam vs the deep narrow mouth cups.  </li>
            <li> used to use a cheap artificial bristle shaving brush, and cheap soap cup back in my 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> But secondary concern (or maybe primary for you..</li>
            <li> But after seeing and using this bowl, it was clear, I had already purchased the ultimate shaving bowl!  </li>
            <li> (but this is apparent from the pictures)</li>
            <li> I can see that it would be very slippery when wet</li>
            <li> There are several points of view on a shaving bowl or mug, handle or no handle, just use an old mug or bowl you have sitting around...</li>
            <li> do&#x27;nt oftn write somethign with no real downsider but this one really doesn&#x27;t have any.  </li>
            <li> deep to get your brush in it, a normal sized badger bristle brush will stand just so the handle is outside the cup.</li>
            <li> The bowl had cracked right down the middle</li>
            <li> Shallow cup with wide top makes it easy to whip up a thick batch of lather.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I really like it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t really call this a cup but in any case i just got this the other day</li>
            <li> In my experience, it builds a lather about twice as fast as other bowls or mugs.  </li>
            <li> ; (very subtle) keeps most of it in.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very attractive, but I find the base too wide.  </li>
            <li> It is nice and heavy, thick.</li>
            <li> The bottom is indeed unglazed and a little rough, which is fine on my standard counter.  </li>
            <li> I shave in the shower, so it was a little tricky at first.</li>
            <li> Shaving is no fun, but it is much easier with this shave cup.</li>
            <li> Shallow is better (as long as it&#x27;s deep enough to hodl the amount of froth you want to create).  </li>
            <li> A little large for my hand but still functional.</li>
            <li> The bottom of the bowl is a little coarse giving it plenty of friction so there is also little worry about it sliding around even if the counter top is wet.</li>
            <li> My husband has said he misses a handle but really hasn&#x27;t complained loudly about not having one.</li>
            <li> It holds large and small soap cakes.  </li>
            <li> My initial instinct was that deep was better, wide didn&#x27;t seem to make sense for &amp;#34;frothing&amp;#34; and iwas comlpetely wrong.  </li>
            <li> Since the entire thing is solid and ceramic, cleaning is a breeze, just running it under water until all the excess soap washes out and dry it off with a towel.  </li>
            <li> Previously I used a wooden cup but it developed a crack</li>
            <li> The heat only holds for so long</li>
            <li> Not sure there&#x27;s much more to say about it, but after 8 months or so of using it, I can&#x27;t even conceive of a single complaint.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s made in New Mexico, USA (which means it&#x27;s not a cheap or radioactive piece of junk from China).  </li>
            <li> Then I drain the bowl, wipe the outside dry and work up a lather in it using my brush.</li>
            <li> It worked for a short while before breaking loose and spinning again.  </li>
            <li> I shave my head as well as the face, so I wanted to also get something soft and a bit longer with a little &amp;#34;heft&amp;#34; to it.  </li>
            <li> It was a bit expensive compared to others I considered, but since I cut the cord to costly 5-blade disposables, I felt justified in splurging a bit.  </li>
            <li> - is fragile and is to be used carefully.</li>
            <li> but it definitely does have some quirks that could make your shaving experience easier, harder, better/worse eperienced.  </li>
            <li> Deep is atually harder.</li>
            <li> It was a lot smaller than i expected</li>
            <li> I thought this would be pretty fragile, given that it&#x27;s sort of thin.</li>
            <li> The upper lip is rounded in just slightly, but the bottom of the bowl is mostly flat</li>
            <li> I tried to &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; it to the bottom by letting the lather dry underneath it.  </li>
            <li> Someone else might rate this a five star, in fact, if you were only using this bowl to hold a round bar of shaving soap, I would have rated this bowl a ten.</li>
            <li> woke up, was about to shave, picked up my bowl and only picked up half of it.</li>
            <li> And Rough</li>
            <li> Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> The rough bottom helps you get and keep a grip while you mix your</li>
            <li> , 2) there are no real ribs in the bottom to help with lather building.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really a problem, just an observation.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly wide compared to the cake of soap.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, it&#x27;s not really a problem since my brush still gets lathered up even with the spinning.</li>
            <li> I really do NOT like the soap.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not really the problem.  </li>
            <li> As wet shaving is a practice of patience and being careful not to slice up your face-</li>
            <li> (i just switched to soap which is harder to lather.. or longer to lather)..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s handmade, and is my go to bowl when wet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit slippery when wet.  </li>
            <li> The only think I don&#x27;t like is the bottom is rough not smooth like the rest of the bowl.  </li>
            <li> As one other said the bowl does not really have any dark grey color.</li>
            <li> It fits in my palm nicely, and due to the texture on the base doesn&#x27;t slip around in my hand even when wet.</li>
            <li> As I didn&#x27;t want a soap dish for the large bar, it&#x27;s disappointing that though the product is fine, the fact that it&#x27;s the wrong size and not as advertised is not.  </li>
            <li> Someday one or the other is going to chip.</li>
            <li> Not too big, not too small.  </li>
            <li> Since my wife has coveted this from day one, I&#x27;ve given it to her to use for peanuts and other appetizers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through 4-5 shave bowls over the past several years and this has been my favorite.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My bowl was not smooth in the bottom and has a long ridge running across the bottom.</li>
            <li> ceramic vs metallic vs other.  </li>
            <li> Other things to look for:  </li>
            <li> All small factors but enough</li>
            <li> Not too big or small.  </li>
            <li> My other shaving soap that I bought from a well known retailer always leaves my face raw and burning; it was like dry shaving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice heavy shave cup with a slightly texturized, ceramic base</li>
            <li> The smell is extremely faint, and I don&#x27;t really smell the bay rum.</li>
            <li> Not as dark as advertised albeit seller did mention that the colors will vary.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has thick walls, solidly constructed.</li>
            <li> One down side, is when building a lather it comes up</li>
            <li> an over the edges, so I have to keep forcing the excess down</li>
            <li> bowl was a little lighter than the picture, whitish on half and purplish on the other half.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shallow enough so that the brush handle doesn&#x27;t hit the rim</li>
            <li> slight texture to the inside.</li>
            <li> I like that this bowl has a slight &amp;#34;curl-in&amp;#34</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s shallow enough that when you&#x27;re lathering up some can go over the sides..</li>
            <li> that there&#x27;s less circumference to &amp;#34;whip&amp;#34; for lathering up.  </li>
            <li> Slightly thirsty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that I make less of a mess at the lip.</li>
            <li> I agree with some previous reviews that it could be a little shallower.  </li>
            <li> , i wouldn&#x27;t mind it being a little bit taller.</li>
            <li> I didnt even get a chance to use this bowl before I dropped it and broke into little pieces.</li>
            <li> then took the brush and dipped and swirled it a little into the soap block, to apply soap to the brush.  </li>
            <li> , I would like it to be a little wider and taller</li>
            <li> : Although I originally was disappointed with the color of the product, I must admit that it has grown on me over time.</li>
            <li> (I do spill a little lather).  </li>
            <li> It is wide enough that it begins to be a little uncomfortable without a handle.  </li>
            <li> Have gone through a few shaving bowls.  </li>
            <li> Santa Fe Shave Cup was never as the picture color luck like at Amazon., it is actually green.</li>
            <li> not even a nick is missing from the ceramic.</li>
            <li> Heavy weight, sturdy.</li>
            <li> Also, it gets a bit messy with the lather ending up around the handle and knocking my knuckles on the the sides</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m being harsh, I just wish I could have bought it without the soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for awhile and came close to pulling the trigger on a few</li>
            <li> I do wish it wasn&#x27;t so heavy, and also wish it was just a bit wider.</li>
            <li> Bought as a lather bowl, but abandoned that after a few nights of the brush handle / my knuckles banging the side.</li>
            <li> Solid bowl, material not cheap or cheesy.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers think it&#x27;s either too small, or knock it for not having a handle.  </li>
            <li> If fits my small palm well.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if that was a mistake,</li>
            <li> I collect small pieces of pottery</li>
            <li> No more messing around with all the foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I purchased this as advertised for the small 2.25 ounce Col. Conk shaving soap bar.  </li>
            <li> would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for the slightly small opening.</li>
            <li> but i think its a small bowl.</li>
            <li> Just working past the knuckle/brush bang on the side, as it holds the lather in the bowl (not spilling out of the sides like with the latte mug).</li>
            <li> but seriously you cant mess up a cup.</li>
            <li> It is a little shallow</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why some have complained that this shaving bowl is too small.</li>
            <li> For me it&#x27;s to narrow and shallow.</li>
            <li> (you may want to leave behind a few drops, but not much more).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tough to whip up a lather in the morning without waking my brush off the sides and waking the neighborhood.</li>
            <li> I see no reason to go above average as I have not owned anything to compare this too, and a bad rating would mean I was displeased, which I was not.</li>
            <li> some drastically others may hardly notice.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossibly hard to find shave cups for puck-type shave soaps.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the soap that is included but that seems to be a secondary thought with this product anyway since the scent you get varies.</li>
            <li> If it were larger, it would be awkward to hold in one hand.  </li>
            <li> It is thick ceramic</li>
            <li> am however very disappointed that the color of the bowl is drastically different from the bowl pictured, being the only reason I gave four stars not five.</li>
            <li> The broken parts were too small to glue together.</li>
            <li> Shallow</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of bay rum, but the scent left me feeling extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it isn&#x27;t really small.</li>
            <li> Just down and dirty shaving.</li>
            <li> Very hard to lather...... doesn&#x27;t have a good&lt;br /&gt;feel on my face...</li>
            <li> After a poor experience with another bowl, I decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li> It will scratch your hand and worse yet, can scratch your shelf.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Luckily the Mitchells refill fits in this bowl perfectly, so no worries!</li>
            <li> Once soap has been used for awhile, it tends to slide around and is difficult to lather.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, I returned mine.</li>
            <li> The soap selection is random</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t look the part, so I decided to upgrade.  </li>
            <li> wanted to include a photo here but was unable</li>
            <li> (sorry.. been calling it &amp;#34;froth&amp;#34; to this point).  </li>
            <li> And not that expensive</li>
            <li> but since it will always be wet, the felt might get nasty or moldy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> somehow (maybe it was cold?).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had to buy these base slider things to keep from scratching my shelf.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice Size to Grip in Hand, Bottom Is Unfinshed And Rough So It Wont Pop Out Of Your Hand. Looks Classic And Being Hand Made, One  Of A Kind</li>
            <li> This cup slips easily into my shaving kit, unlike my big shaving mug that can now stay in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap hat comes with it lathers up nicely and has a very faint, mild scent. It worked ell on my beard. softening and lubricating it nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> First of all, it&#x27;s somewhat organic and appears handmade, so points for coolness there. The bowl itself is a good size for lathering the soap. It retains heat reasonably well, so the soap goes on warm, which is ideal for a wet shave.</li>
            <li> After a poor experience with another bowl, I decided to give this one a try. It is nice and heavy, thick. Absorbs heat easily and keeps the cream warm. Fits nicely in my hand and is easy to control - no dropping this one. The top of the bowl curves back in, which seems to help build lather on the concave side of the bowl. It also adds to the ease of grip from above. However it catches the brush handle and makes a nice clinking noise. Someday one or the other is going to chip. I figure that&#x27;s the price to pay for having the sides to build lather on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came packaged with a Col. Conk Amber shave puck. Not in love with the scent but for that price you can&#x27;t beat a bowl and some soap.</li>
            <li> Pros: It&#x27;s shallow enough so that the brush handle doesn&#x27;t hit the rim (I broke a coffee mug this way) and it&#x27;s aesthetically pleasing.     Cons: Nothing really special about it and it&#x27;s over priced. Could also be mistaken for a plant pot.</li>
            <li> We have discovered that a bowl a bit larger would more likely offer a richer lather, but this one works just fine. Plus it sits perfectly on a shelf in the medicine cabinet or decoratively on the counter without taking up much space. A purchased soap disc fits perfectly inside the bowl for gift giving as part of a set.  As a soap maker, I would quickly order this again to steer fellows away from canned foam lubricants, but for personal use, will probably try to find something as pretty but just a bit bigger if/when the time comes for a replacemet.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be pretty fragile, given that it&#x27;s sort of thin. I was wrong. This thing has flown cross-country several times, and stood up to numerous bashings with my brush during the occasional overly-vigorous lathering process.</li>
            <li> I like the bowl. Its me well..the only thing I really don&#x27;t like is the size. Wish it was a bit bigger and deeper. Other than that, I really like it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> just a great looking cup. sturdy and a great finish. it proudly sits next to the brush stand.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice shave set. The bowl looks great sitting out - very decorative piece.  This was exactly what my husband wanted for Father&#x27;s Day!</li>
            <li> very good cup to hold a shave soap puck.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shaving bowl.  It works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine looks almost exactly like the one pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holds heat well, lots of room for lathering, the included soap is even pleasant although I use cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the best shave of my life. The soap is fantastic. Softens my beard for a smooth effortless shave. The bowl is very stylish and easy to make a great lather.I love this shave system!</li>
            <li> Excellent Lather bowl. Fits well in hand and deep enough for plenty of rich lather.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t really call this a cup but in any case i just got this the other day and I really like it.     It&#x27;s very well made and the colors on it is clear and bright.     Also fits nice in your hand as you lather up your brush. So this definitely is a welcome edition to my shaving kit.</li>
            <li> The bowl is perfect size. It holds the disk perfectly and looks cool too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read reviews complaining about the cost. Believe me, it&#x27;s worth it . You will have a smile on your face with every use.</li>
            <li> the bowl is beautiful, amazon says bowls may vary in appearance, but mine looked just like the one pictured... it came with a large col. conk shaving soap (almond scent)... incredible smell... i also bought some col. conk bay rum, but the almond scent blows it away... i would recommend this to any of my friends.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, this product is a bowl NOT a cup. This is simply an OK bowl for a beginner but I often feel like this product leaves something to be desired. The bowl feels extremely tiny in my hands, kind of like if Angre the Giant ate cereal from a kids cereal bowl. It&#x27;s a little tough to whip up a lather in the morning without waking my brush off the sides and waking the neighborhood. The unglazed bottom is a huge plus, because without it I&#x27;m not sure how I could hold it without dropping it. I&#x27;ll probably continue to use this product but will continues to look for something slightly bigger, wider, and maybe something with grooves at the bottom. For this price I could of stuck with a regular bowl from my cupboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Here&#x27;s my review on the puck that came with the bowl***&lt;br /&gt;I used this puck a couple of times and I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with the lather, scent, or the overall consistency of this soap. The smell is extremely faint, and I don&#x27;t really smell the bay rum. I&#x27;m a fan of bay rum, but the scent left me feeling extremely disappointed. I&#x27;m rating this product so low because I feel this is an inferior product and also because there isn&#x27;t an ingredient list available to the public. I had to send an email to info@colconkproducts.com just to get an ingredient list. Below are the ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Triethanolamine&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin&lt;br /&gt;SLES (a variation of sodium Laureth Sulfite)&lt;br /&gt;DI Water&lt;br /&gt;Propylene Glycol&lt;br /&gt;Soap Flakes&lt;br /&gt;Stearic Acid&lt;br /&gt;Tatrasodium EDTA&lt;br /&gt;Titanium Dioxide&lt;br /&gt;Polysorbate-20&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those don&#x27;t sound like ingredients that I want on my face. The product seemed and felt cheap, but the ingredients confirmed my thoughts. There are much better shave soaps out there, so I suggest spending a little extra. In the future, I hope that Colonel Conk re-formulates and puts the ingredient list somewhere on their packaging.</li>
            <li> The bowl is very nice to handle and it arrived with an almond scented soap (Which is very good)</li>
            <li> Works beautifully with my shaving brush and its low profile is perfect on the sink.  Great hand-made quality.  Unique feel.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this just about every day to shave.  Shaving is no fun, but it is much easier with this shave cup.</li>
            <li> Really great looking bowl, haven&#x27;t tried the included shaving soap because I bought this as part of several pieces I thought I needed for first time shaving with DE safety razors.  Instead I&#x27;ve been using Proraso shaving soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00837YY18 B00837YY18]]</li>
            <li> Looks great in the bathroom, well-made, and does the job. Easy to whip up a lather. Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> As far as shaving bowls go this does this job and it looks pretty nice for sure but you can get the same performance from a cheap stoneware bowl from Wal-Mart. The bowl fits well in my hand but has edges that I find I hit with the brush often when lathering. I haven&#x27;t used the soap that is included but that seems to be a secondary thought with this product anyway since the scent you get varies. I scent I received is called Amber, which smells just ok. As I said I think you can get similar or better performance out of something else, I now use this bowl to hold packages of DE razor blades.</li>
            <li> Needed a new shaving bowl, and this filled the bill. Very nice quality, and builds up a nice lather for shaving.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I originally bought this bowl as an inexpensive option to use while I shopped around for the ultimate shaving bowl.  But after seeing and using this bowl, it was clear, I had already purchased the ultimate shaving bowl!  What makes it a perfect shaving bowl?  Well for me here are the important things.  First, does it has texture to make whipping up tons of creamy lather easy?  Yes.  Does it have a curled edge to keep the lather in the bowl?  Yes. Does it have enough mass to absorb and maintain heat to keep the lather warm?  Yes.  Does it look great?  Yes.  It is a homerun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way to use this bowl is to run hot water into it for 30 seconds or until the water is hot and the bowl is warm to the touch.  Then set the bowl aside with your badger brush in it and let your brush moisten for a minute or so.  Remove the brush and give it a gentle shake to clear out some of the water it is retaining and dump the hot water out of the bowl. (you may want to leave behind a few drops, but not much more).  Then load your brush with soap and start whipping up the lather.  I almost always use the 3 pass method for shaving, and even on the third application of the lather, it is nice and warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can spend more, but don&#x27;t.  You cannot find a better shaving bowl......</li>
            <li> Compared with the real and pictures, there is a certain color, also gave a box of shaving soap</li>
            <li> The cup is a classic New Mexico hand-thrown ceramic cup.  Quite handsome!  The soap I received was Colonel Conk&#x27;s almond with avocado oil.  It might take a shave or two for you figure out the consistence of lather that best fits your shaving apparatus and style. When accomplished, however, this soap affords a closer, more comfortable shave than anything in a can, jar, or tube. Period!</li>
            <li> For me value for money is all about quality, aesthetics and fit for purpose. While there are less expensive options out there for shaving bowls and mugs, and more expensive ones as well, this one fits the bill for me perfectly. I wanted a shaving bowl/mug that would be easy and comfortable to hold, that was pleasing to look at and that would be easy to use to work up a lather with using a variety of brushes and creams. This shaving bowl by Colonel Conk nicely fulfills every one of my criteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all it&#x27;s a well made ceramic bowl that I think is very attractive. The colors on the one I received are similar to the photo shown, but much brighter comparatively. There are some earth tones from brown to tan, lush greens and a pretty purple striping as well. The proportions are pleasant, and more importantly to me fit my hand well as I&#x27;m holding it when working up a lather. An important point about the proportion of this bowl is that it&#x27;s not so deep that I find myself hitting it with my brush handle as I have with other bowls I&#x27;ve used. This makes working up a lather much faster and easier, without concern about chipping or breaking the bowl from hitting it (my favorite brush is a [[ASIN:B002UB3BF8 100% Silvertip Badger Bristle Shaving Brush (Chrome Handle) and Free Shaving Brush Stand from Parker Safety Razor]] - I&#x27;ve written a full review for this brush as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m prepping my face with water and pre-shave I soak this bowl filled with water as hot as I can get it from the faucet. I leave my brush in it while I&#x27;m prepping as well for it to soak at the same time. Then I drain the bowl, wipe the outside dry and work up a lather in it using my brush. The effect is that I get a hot to warm lather to use because the bowl holds a nice amount of heat in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final testament of my appreciation for this shaving bowl is that I&#x27;ve just ordered another to take on the road with me when I travel. In addition to my praises for it aboveI also think it&#x27;s the perfect size to pack for a trip ... not too big, not too small ... it&#x27;s just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(P.S. - I can&#x27;t comment on the soap that came with the bowl because I haven&#x27;t used it, mostly because I prefer creams and if I use a hard shaving soap these days it likely to be Proraso for Sensitive Skin.)</li>
            <li> Feels good in your hand.  The rough bottom helps you get and keep a grip while you mix your lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it was with Colonel Conk Bay Rum (I received the Lime version with this but I have not tried it yet).  The puck moved around a bit but once there was lather in the bowl, it acted like a glue and held it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No movement since the first use.  The soap must act as a glue keeping it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Love the bowl.  The complimentary soap that comes with it is good, but I don&#x27;t necessarily care for the scent.  It would be nice if you could choose the scent</li>
            <li> Very nice shaving bowl.  Some reviewers think it&#x27;s either too small, or knock it for not having a handle.  I think it works just fine, and fits perfectly in my thick fingered ape hands (Size 12 ring).  The included soap I got was &#x27;Amber&#x27; scented, and works fine, since it&#x27;s glycerin based, it leaves my face a little &#x27;slick&#x27;, which is good, but some folks may find the feeling a little disconcerting.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This lathering bowl is great.  It&#x27;s a perfect size for the average shaving brush.  Not too big, not too small.  Better than using a mug or cup.  Plus, it&#x27;s made in New Mexico, USA (which means it&#x27;s not a cheap or radioactive piece of junk from China).  It&#x27;s glazed nicely &amp; I can&#x27;t complain about anything.  It does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why some have complained that this shaving bowl is too small. To me, it&#x27;s the perfect size for a large soap disk or for creating a lather with shave cream. If it were larger, it would be awkward to hold in one hand.  Also, it&#x27;s a nice size for complementing the bathroom but without having a large object taking up too much space on the counter. I like how each one is individually made, so all have somewhat different patterns and tones. Very nice looking little bowl that works for the intended purpose. I also like how it came with a Colonel Conk soap, which provided a decent scent and shave.</li>
            <li> I wanted a no hassle soap bowl for my shaving soap.  I had looked at some of the wood bowls, which look nice, but I worried about them always being wet and possibly rotting the wood.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about that with this bowl.  It&#x27;s large enough to allow about 1/2 inch of space around the soap bar to everything dries out between uses, and it just looks really nice.  I added a mission style razor and brush holder and everything looks great together.</li>
            <li> The bowl itself is great looking, but it didn&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I woke up, was about to shave, picked up my bowl and only picked up half of it. The bowl had cracked right down the middle somehow (maybe it was cold?). Overall, I was pretty bummed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap that came with it is excellent though, I would highly recommend it to others who are looking for a decent soap.</li>
            <li> Nice color but seriously you cant mess up a cup. Good size to work up a good lather. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I really like how this bowl fits in my hand. It allows you to position the bowl incredibly comfortably. Furthermore, the wide mouth allows you to work up a good lather quickly and easily. Also, the fact that it comes with a free soap makes this an amazing deal!</li>
            <li> This is my first shave bowl.  It came with Colonel Conk&#x27;s glycerin shave soap which was a nice bonus to the bowl.  I gave it four stars because I feel like the top could have been a little wider as I have very large hands.  Even so, it is not a problem to whip up a nice lather.  It is solid and looks great.</li>
            <li> For $19 you get $4 worth of Colonel Conk shaving soap and a nice looking ceramic bowl about the right size and shape for use as a shaving soap bowl. The bowl is attractive and I&#x27;d be willing to pay about $7 for it, so the total would be about $11 or perhaps $12, but $19 is really too much money for what this is. For the price they should toss in an inexpensive stand for a shaving brush and razor.</li>
            <li> Such a nice bowl. It is nice enough I let my hubby leave it out on the counter. Solid and seems to fit easily into his hand when he&#x27;s using it.</li>
            <li> The bowl itself is beautiful, and a great addition to my routine. It fits in my palm nicely, and due to the texture on the base doesn&#x27;t slip around in my hand even when wet. I love how it looks, and it is just the right size for the larger refills of various hard soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only ding I can give to this purchase is the Colonel Conk shaving soaps. I have tried two different ones and I don&#x27;t do like how they feel and function on my face - they don&#x27;t lather up well with our water, and they don&#x27;t seem to stay slippery or have lather that lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to put things in perspective I use Mitchells Wool Fat shaving soap most of the time. I find that it lathers really well, stays slippery enough that my face doesn&#x27;t complain, and the lather lasts really well. For further perspective I use a Merkur 34c and Derby or Astra blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily the Mitchells refill fits in this bowl perfectly, so no worries! Worth getting the bowl and chucking the soap...or donating to local shelter.</li>
            <li> Beautiful bowl,and worth the price. Nice size and free shaving soap.</li>
            <li> This cup works great. I like Proraso Sandalwood Shaving soap better, but this Colnel Conk soap is fine. It was a good economical way to get a great shaving cup. I&#x27;d definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> My only beef with this cup is that 1) no handle (but this is apparent from the pictures), 2) there are no real ribs in the bottom to help with lather building.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that being said, the cup is great, it&#x27;s not so deep that you have to go elbow deep to get your brush in it, a normal sized badger bristle brush will stand just so the handle is outside the cup. It does lather decently, but i think some extra features in the bottom would add some better lathering. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a high quality product, holds heat respectably, and looks nice on your counter.</li>
            <li> Nice looking bowl. The soap that it comes with smells great too</li>
            <li> I bought this for the bowl. For (20?) bucks you get a nice ceramic bowl AND some shaving soap. Other soap/lather bowls cost more and don&#x27;t come with soap. The description says the soap scent varies, mine was almond flavored. It smells a little too sweet, but it lathers fine for me and I&#x27;m still going to use it. If you don&#x27;t like the soap you get, the bowl it still a pretty solid deal by itself in my opinion. The soap comes in its own plastic container so you can gift it to the in-laws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great place to start for beginning wet-shaving!</li>
            <li> Looks exactly as pictured and comes with a puck of conk soap (Amber, as I had hoped).  Well worth the price for this item.</li>
            <li> Great shave bowl and the stone means that you can float it in the basin to warm the lather for a nice soothing shave.</li>
            <li> It came with soap but I use my own cream. It is smooth on the inside and perfect for what it is for. A little large for my hand but still functional. It is attractive and looks good next to my safety razor shaver set.</li>
            <li> Good quality but with lighter colors. Not as dark as advertised albeit seller did mention that the colors will vary. Overall pleased with purchase though.</li>
            <li> This is a great bowl.  It looks really nice and I like the fact that it was hand made in the US.  Does a real nice job of keeping lather inside.  Fits in my hand perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try out the shaving soap that came with it but that&#x27;s a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Have gone through a few shaving bowls.  They all seem to be cheaply made even though they weren&#x27;t cheap.  Sterling Silver rusted and left marks on the sink.  This one can&#x27;t do that, ever.  Heavy, nicely built and the color is as pictured, matches perfect.</li>
            <li> An absolutely great peice, it is beautiful to look at and functions excellently. If you are on the fence about buying this product don&#x27;t be; do yourself a favor and buy it</li>
            <li> This is a nicely made bowl.  It is very attractive as far as the colors and design are.  I was surprised at the smallness of the bowl itself. It fits nicely in my hand but does not allow much room to work the shave cream around with a badger brush.  I have not tried it with the included shaving soap and I am assuming it will work better with shaving soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an older stainless steel bowl I was using previously for my shaving cream and will probably return to using that for the creams.  Give the soap a try and see it works better for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice my brush &amp;#34;clanking&amp;#34; on the edges as I try to whip up the shaving cream.  I don&#x27;t seem to have that issue with my stainless steel bowl as the rim is lower and the stainless steel bowl seems to have more of an open base and is more accessible.  Overall it is a nice bowl but didn&#x27;t quite measure up to what I wanted for the shaving cream mixing.</li>
            <li> This is a great bowl for wet shaving! If you warm it up it holds heat well. I wish it had a little more texture on the inside.</li>
            <li> Attractive piece that is functional. I use it to mix my shaving cream and as a make shift scuttle. Could use a rim to catch shaving cream as you mix but all in all great product.</li>
            <li> I love this heavy, attractive - I call it a bowl - for shaving soap, using the old fashioned brush method.  I sit it in HOT water drawn in my sink to keep the lather on the warm side.  It wipes clean and shiny after finishing.  I believe it&#x27;s hand made and made in AMERICA, which I just LOVE!  I love it when China is spelled &amp;#34;Made in AMERICA!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It comes with a shaving soap, but I only ordered the product for the cup and haven&#x27;t used the soap.  Instead I use a high-glycerin content soft shaving soap with a badger hair brush.  My brush has standard length bristles and the depth of the bowl is just perfect for your hand holding the brush to remain above the rim while soaping it.  The upper lip is rounded in just slightly, but the bottom of the bowl is mostly flat so it&#x27;s very easy to get a good lather going in the bowl before applying.  Since the entire thing is solid and ceramic, cleaning is a breeze, just running it under water until all the excess soap washes out and dry it off with a towel.  It is slightly slippery if it gets wet on the outside, and I wouldn&#x27;t want to drop it, but it feels good in the palm of the hand when using it.</li>
            <li> I have used this shaving bowl for about 6 months.  It&#x27;s very attractive, but I find the base too wide.  Once soap has been used for awhile, it tends to slide around and is difficult to lather.  Since my wife has coveted this from day one, I&#x27;ve given it to her to use for peanuts and other appetizers.</li>
            <li> I like it, i wouldn&#x27;t mind it being a little bit taller. Lovely colors. I like that it came with exactly the soap i used. I was worried it would come with one i wouldn&#x27;t want. I don&#x27;t know if they all come with the amber glycerin one. Mine did.</li>
            <li> Excellent, perfect size for making lather and looks great on the counter, too. I especially like how the top edges curl in-- not too much, but just enough to make it harder to launch your lather across the room.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this Shave Cup, its attractive, masculine and of an appropriate size for its purpose. The material, once heated with warm water nicely holds heat providing a warm lather even into a second or third pass. The interior of the Shave Cup has just enough texture to assist in more easily building a good lather quickly, however, the inner walls are sloped inward too much (towards the top) given the depth of the Cup to allow efficient movement without constantly hitting the sides (if your a cream user) with the brush handle, this would not be an issue if you use the hard (puck sized) soaps such as is supplied with the Shave Cup-not recommended for cream users. Sadly, I returned mine.</li>
            <li> Nice bowl, and I like that it is concave around the lip to hold in the lather. Kept its heat very nicely as well, and was easy to clean, and the bowl is attractive to look at.  I guess I wish it was just a bit wider in diameter, hence the 4 star instead of five.</li>
            <li> This is a decent bowl.  It has a decent heft and quality feel.  It looks handsome and will blend nicely with any decor. If fits my small palm well.  It is a little shallow and I was worried that the lather would climb out, but there is somewhat of an internal roundness to the bowl that keeps the lather contained.  There was not any &amp;#34;made in&amp;#34; marks or stickers.  Pros; Looks, size, quality. Cons; Price.</li>
            <li> Fits well in my hand and works effectively.&lt;br /&gt;Initially using the soap that came with the cup but planning go go with shave gel next to get full capacity of bowl.</li>
            <li> This bowl is attractive and functional.  The bayrum soap is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Great shaving cup that performs exactly as described. It&#x27;s perfect in every respect. Proraso shaving soap containers fit perfectly inside after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how each is unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a very attractive bowl for shave soap.  It is a bit larger than soap diameter and the extra water can be easily poured out if needed.  I would very much recommend it to others.  It comes with glycerin soap i have not yet tried.</li>
            <li> It looks good and I like the idea of a ceramic cup, but I did find one little thing.  It&#x27;s not really a problem, just an observation.  It&#x27;s fairly wide compared to the cake of soap.  Now while the bowl fits comfortably in the palm of my hand, the soap tends to spin around inside the bowl.  I tried to &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; it to the bottom by letting the lather dry underneath it.  It worked for a short while before breaking loose and spinning again.  Like I said, it&#x27;s not really a problem since my brush still gets lathered up even with the spinning. I still like it over the traditional &amp;#34;mug&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Colonel conk  Model 111 Santa Fe Shave Cup was never as the picture color luck like at Amazon., it is actually green.</li>
            <li> Good weight and nice color. The soap was a nice add on as well. Works very well when I use it to shave!!</li>
            <li> What can I say, its holds soap</li>
            <li> Just used it for the first time tonight. Love the size and shape of it. Perfect for your brush so it doesn&#x27;t hit the edges of the cup and curls in at the top to keep the lather in. Not glazed underneath so it doesn&#x27;t slip around in your hand or on the counter. Came with the larger 3.75 oz. soap (even though it says it comes with the 2.25, just a heads up). Not sure if that was a mistake, but I&#x27;m not complaining! Overall, great product!!</li>
            <li> Bought for son... He loved it.  Very nice that it came with the soap.</li>
            <li> This is a good, and nice looking shave bowl. It seems durable as well. Cant complain!</li>
            <li> Looks beautiful.  Good size and feels durable.  Does its job well.</li>
            <li> This works really well with the colonel conk soap bar things. It has a nice texture on the inside that helps build lather pretty quickly. However, I worry about dropping it in the bathroom...but then again its a nice piece to have around too. Se la vie...</li>
            <li> The bowl is very nice.  Perfect to use a lathering bowl. The soap that came with it, &amp;#34;Amber,&amp;#34; is OK but has sort of a soft powdery scent.  The soap selection is random so I wouldn&#x27;t by the bowl and expect to get a decent shave soap with it.</li>
            <li> Very nice bowl. It&#x27;s as advertised. My little nitpick is a handle would be nice, but I&#x27;m really just nitpicking. By luck it matches well with our bathroom decor. Solid bowl, material not cheap or cheesy.</li>
            <li> I orderd this for the cup.... the soap came with it.  I really do NOT like the soap.  Very hard to lather...... doesn&#x27;t have a good&lt;br /&gt;feel on my face...&lt;br /&gt;The cup is great... nice size.. nice look...  so I&#x27;m pleased with the item I was most interested in.  Stick with Taylor of Old Bond or Proraso shave cream.  IMO</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through 4-5 shave bowls over the past several years and this has been my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has thick walls, solidly constructed. I&#x27;ve actually dropped it twice and not even a nick is missing from the ceramic. Each is unique in the patterns and the size is optimal for getting a nice thick rich lather.</li>
            <li> I didnt even get a chance to use this bowl before I dropped it and broke into little pieces. I still think this is a great bowl compared to the buffalo horn shave bowl that I currently have. Will save to buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I decided since I switched to Harry&#x27;s razors that I wanted to go back to brush shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use a cheap artificial bristle shaving brush, and cheap soap cup back in my 20&#x27;s.  For the last 20+ years I have just been using a bar of soap put on by hand. Just down and dirty shaving. Now that I am in my 50&#x27;s I want to pamper myself a bit more and go back to the brush, but do it with a real bristle.  I picked the Spitalfields 100% Pure Premium Badger Bristle with long handle since it holds water better and is softer and to go along with that i go the Colonel Conk Model 111 Santa Fe Shave Cup with Soap.  I shave my head as well as the face, so I wanted to also get something soft and a bit longer with a little &amp;#34;heft&amp;#34; to it.  I wanted a nice heavy bowl, that would hold the heat, and give me room to really whip up a good head of foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say the first time I used the brush and bowl I fell in love with them.  I shave in the shower, so it was a little tricky at first. I filled the bowl with hot water, and let the brush soak, while I washed my body.  I soaped up my head and faced and rinsed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then took the brush and dipped and swirled it a little into the soap block, to apply soap to the brush.  I emptied nearly all the water from the bowl leaving just a touch in, then brush whipped my head of foam in the bowl...  It looked YUMMY! ;)  I then applied and shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, there is a nice difference, between using the brush method vs. applying soap from your hand.  I got a better, closer shave.  There is something rather cathartic and meditative doing a brush shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Colonel Conk Model 111 Santa Fe Shave Cup with Soap is a really nice tool for my shaving. It looks really classy! I would call it a shaving bowl vs a cup as you will read later on. The soap whipped up real nice.  I am not too keen on the fragrance of the soap they sent, but oh well that is not a deal breaker.  I can always get something else.  The weight of the bowl is nice.  It has a good heft to it.  it is not super deep, but it has a wide mouth so you can build a great head of foam vs the deep narrow mouth cups.  Some people may not like the wide/shallow of the  Sante Fe, I however do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars!ething else.  The weight of the bowl is nice.

            <li> good solid bowl,serves it purpose nice colors and it is used daily</li>
            <li> I would love to rate this five stars but it has one flaw that can be a big one to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The look of the bowl is beautiful, inside and out.  Its smooth, great to look at and touch, works great, etc, etc.  The Amber shave soap I got was great as well.  Like I said, I&#x27;d love to give it five stars but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom of the bowl (where you would cup and hold it - not the inside) is rough as sandpaper, completely unfinished.  It will scratch your hand and worse yet, can scratch your shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a really nice glass shelf that holds all of my shaving stuff.  The bottom of this bowl would have scratched it countless times.  I had to buy these base slider things to keep from scratching my shelf.  I was going to use felt but since it will always be wet, the felt might get nasty or moldy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you don&#x27;t care about that or are prepared to rig something, its beautiful.  If not, find something else.</li>
            <li> This mug very quickly replaced my shaving cup.  It has a nice feel and allow plenty of room for the lather to collect.  The only thing that I think would make it nicer would be to put some silicone on the bottom so as not to scratch the sink top.  I did that myself to fix the problem.</li>
            <li> Awesome soap bowl! Heavy weight, sturdy. Although the soap that comes with it is not all that great! I did buy the bowl not the soap</li>
            <li> I fill it with the hottest water I can get from the tap and let it sit while I&#x27;m getting ready to shave.  Load the brush, dump the water out, drop in a splash of new hot water, and start lathering.  The clay holds the heat well and makes for nice, warm lather.  The shape of the bowl is just right for whipping up lather without spilling over the sides.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Don&#x27;t be stingy with the amount of water you add before you start lathering.  If the bubbles are big and, well, &#x27;bubbly&#x27;, just keep working it-they&#x27;ll break down and you&#x27;ll get a nice, creamy product.</li>
            <li> I love this cup, well made, nice looking and very sturdy.  The soap was an added bonus because when I bought the cup I did not realize the soap came with it.  I have not used the soap yet, bet it smell great.</li>
            <li> Stays hot for nice hot lather. curved lip keeps lather in bowl while whipping-up.  Nice weight, size, and looks manly.  Arrived quickly  and was packed so no chips.</li>
            <li> A pretty good bowl.  Nice colors. Does the job.  I haven&#x27;t had many other ones other than an old mug that is an antique from my Grandfather that I err on not using anymore.</li>
            <li> Really nice but a bit slippery when wet. But it does the job</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for; perfect size and it looks great. The only issue I have with it which is just a side-effect of it being curved in at the top (which is great for keeping the lather in) is my metal handled brush clunks against the rim, but I bought it expecting that. All-in-all I am more than satisfied with this shave cup.</li>
            <li> The bowl itself is nothing special. It is a ceramic bowl that was made on a wheel and glazed. My bowl was not smooth in the bottom and has a long ridge running across the bottom. I can see that it would be very slippery when wet and it has no handles for grip. If you drop it it will break. That being said, it is still a nice bowl with nice colors. The shaving soap is what I really like. Mine has a very pleasant, light scent and it worked up to a decent lather. What I&#x27;m really pleased with, is that when I was done shaving, my face felt nice and cool and smooth. My other shaving soap that I bought from a well known retailer always leaves my face raw and burning; it was like dry shaving. I gave this a 5 star rating, not for the bowl, but for the bowl and soap combination. Together, it is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Its a bowl. its pretty, easy to hold, enough space./size. Not all that big on soap... I needed a bow.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is but this bowl has made me want to shave more. It&#x27;s weird but it looks really classic and awesome which makes me feel pretty classic and awesome when I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking about it, do it!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son who has decided to shave the old-fashioned way (double-edge razor).  I collect small pieces of pottery and I really liked this little bowl.  He&#x27;s using it as purposed so I assume all&#x27;s well and enjoyed.</li>
            <li> Great shaving bowl!  Very easy to build a nice lather in this bowl. It also retains heat pretty well.  It also looks nice, and the Col. Conk Bayrum shave soap it came with is probably my second favorite soap next to Proraso</li>
            <li> I only wish this thing came in different designs and colors! Other than that, it works great, and looks good in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> For me it&#x27;s to narrow and shallow. My brush hits the edges all the time and a lot of foam come out..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll cut to the point: I don&#x27;t like the shape of this bowl.  I think I read another review some time ago that said it was too deep, and the [brush] handle kept hitting the sides.  That&#x27;s not really the problem.  The problem is the top is too narrow.  The best bowl (in terms of practicality) that I&#x27;ve used was a simple plastic cereal bowl.  A good lather was no problem at all in that thing.  Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t look the part, so I decided to upgrade.  What I got was form over function.  Again, this a beautiful bowl.  Getting the brush around however is a bit of a pain.  Trying to reach around the bottom the handle does indeed tend to knock about on the sides.  I&#x27;m not too worried about the sound but it makes me think I&#x27;ll end up chipping this one day.  Also, it gets a bit messy with the lather ending up around the handle and knocking my knuckles on the the sides isn&#x27;t too fun either.  I&#x27;ll still use it but I wish they made a model with a wider mouth.</li>
            <li> nice stone bowl, holds heat well.  slight texture to the inside.</li>
            <li> What a great little bowl.  I would have never guessed I&#x27;d be so happy with a bowl.  This bowl has a nice weight in your hand and is well made.  Another reviewer was worried about durability since this is ceramic.  There&#x27;s no need to worry.  This is a quality ceramic and it&#x27;s probably more durable than the coffee mugs you use every day.  It&#x27;s the perfect size to fit your hand and the shape is just right for building a lather.  In my experience, it builds a lather about twice as fast as other bowls or mugs.  It also looks great on the counter top.</li>
            <li> Great quality and beautiful finish.</li>
            <li> Shallow cup with wide top makes it easy to whip up a thick batch of lather. Looks nice on the bathroom counter top.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap bowl I own as well as the first.  I would have to say it has a good weight to it so I&#x27;m not worried about tipping it if I want to just use one hand to later up the soap, and rinsing it off with warm water leaves the same glossy sheen that it came with.  So i have no concerns about clean-up.  The bottom of the bowl is a little coarse giving it plenty of friction so there is also little worry about it sliding around even if the counter top is wet. I will not rate the soap since the using it will provide each person their own experience and they will likely varie, some drastically others may hardly notice.  First and only bowl with a satisfied customer I see no reason to go above average as I have not owned anything to compare this too, and a bad rating would mean I was displeased, which I was not.</li>
            <li> Like the bowl, like the design, but it is bigger than most shaving soaps other that the Colonel Conk soap, so it moves around in the bowl while you are trying to lather.</li>
            <li> As one other said the bowl does not really have any dark grey color. More of a Maroon to brown to white in appearance. the bottom is unpainted and allows the palm of your hand to grip well while mixing your soap. Great weight and a nice curved lip to help prevent spillage and also aids in grip of the bowl from the bottom. If your looking for something to set more on a granite or marble counter or just want that look you might look for the Colonel Conk Models #117B and 175MB over at colconkproducts dot com.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect depth, and it lets you get a great lather. I really enjoy shaving with this bowl and it really just is a solid, no frills shave cup. The soap it comes with is alright, but I don&#x27;t really like it, so that&#x27;s why I dinged it a star. Maybe I&#x27;m being harsh, I just wish I could have bought it without the soap.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my SO, and she loves it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I gifted it I removed the soap and placed it in the bowl in the microwave for about 25 seconds, then let it harden at room temperature. The almond smell it put off was very pleasant and now there&#x27;s no gaps between the soap and edges of the bowl.</li>
            <li> This bowl is shaped perfectly and helps you create the perfect lather for your face.  I&#x27;m definitely glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> Bought this item around 4 months back from amazon and I am absolutely in love with it. Produces a rich lather in a few seconds and is a delight to use. No more messing around with all the foam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - is fragile and is to be used carefully.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as advertised for the small 2.25 ounce Col. Conk shaving soap bar.  It&#x27;s actually for the large 3.75 ounce bar.  As I didn&#x27;t want a soap dish for the large bar, it&#x27;s disappointing that though the product is fine, the fact that it&#x27;s the wrong size and not as advertised is not.  That&#x27;s the reason for the &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; rating.</li>
            <li> Made well.  Good shape for shaving cream use with brush</li>
            <li> Looks good, feels good. Haven&#x27;t used the bowl itself just yet but I&#x27;m pleased with its construction and aesthetics.</li>
            <li> Hard to get a good lather going, but the bowl looks pretty good.</li>
            <li> I love this bowl bought 3 two as gifts no 2 are the same also comes with Soap!</li>
            <li> It works great for what it is intended. It builds loads of shaving cream with a good boar brush.</li>
            <li> Meets all expectations. Good looking cup, heavy feel. Works well.</li>
            <li> Nice bowl, looks sharp, wish it had some texture applied to the bottom to aid in lather. Holds heat decently. My wife likes it on our counter better than my old chipped Army unit mug.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just really great. It arrives exactly the way it looks in the picture. Beautiful craftsmanship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let the cup sit in hot water before I use it, and it holds the heat really well, giving me a nice, warm lather. Oh the luxury! It has a wider opening than a traditional shaving mug, so I find it easier to whip my brush around in it to work up a lather. Not sure there&#x27;s much more to say about it, but after 8 months or so of using it, I can&#x27;t even conceive of a single complaint. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> A beautiful ceramic creation. Fits perfectly in my hand to work a great lather.</li>
            <li> I agree with some previous reviews that it could be a little shallower.  It is wide enough that it begins to be a little uncomfortable without a handle.  Good heft &amp; thickness to it &amp; quality pottery.</li>
            <li> Seems to be made really nice. Husband was excited when he recv&#x27;d it</li>
            <li> This is a nice stoneware bowl. I like that it is slightly larger than most to allow the collection of the foam produced.&lt;br /&gt;I am however very disappointed that the color of the bowl is drastically different from the bowl pictured, being the only reason I gave four stars not five. I knew ahead of time there would be some color variation being a hand made product but I did not expect light tan and light BLUE, I was attempting to match the bowl to my vanity countertop. It just would be nice if the bowls maintained the same color groupings as pictured on the product purchase page. The bowl pictured when I ordered did not have the lighter side pictured at the time of writing this  review, as I remember it might just be my memory or the computer I was using.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to include a photo here but was unable so I will put it on the description page if possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the soap it will stay in the cupboard as a back-up. my favorite is [[ASIN:B0077E776W Van Der Hagen Glycerin Shave Soap]] used along with  [[ASIN:B0059QF5RS 100 Silver Blue Double Edge Razor Blades Made in Russia]] I buy the packs of 100 for convince they are available in 25,50,100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review is helpful.</li>
            <li> I had a stainless steel shave cup before this one that started rusting so it was time for a replacement.  I like my foam to be hot and with the stainless mug it wouldn&#x27;t retain the heat and would cool off by the time I mixed it up and applied.  This cup does a much better job at keeping the heat.</li>
            <li> very satisfied with this purchase</li>
            <li> It is just the right size and fits nicely in the palm of my hand.</li>
            <li> There are several points of view on a shaving bowl or mug, handle or no handle, just use an old mug or bowl you have sitting around...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the look of this bowl, and the size - not to big, not to small, made HERE, in the good old U.S. of A - and damn proud of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one arm and one hand so a handle on a mug or bowl is not a consideration, this one sits flat on the counter and allows me to whip my shaving brush around without moving the bowl all over the place, I could place a moist towel or rubber mat on the granite counter top and the bowl on that if necessary but it has not been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plenty of space to work the brush without hitting the sides, and enough space to build a mound of lather - for me it was a great combination having the soap included.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than what I had before which had a slightly smaller diameter. The size of this one really helps. I also think the texture on the inside helps foam up the lather quicker, but that could be my imagination. I&#x27;ve noticed that I make less of a mess at the lip. It could be because I was used to a smaller bowl, or it could be the shape of the bowl around the edge (probably a combination of both).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I have nothing to complain about. But I do feel the cost is about $5 too high.</li>
            <li> Started using the shave cup to be more environmentally friendly, turns out that I like it much better than the pressurized cans and its cheaper too!</li>
            <li> So this is my 2nd &amp;#34;frother bowl&amp;#34; since switchign to wet shaving the last 2 months (it&#x27;s been an INTENSE 2 months as I&#x27;ve studied, practiced, experienced, and pursued the &amp;#34;perfect shave for me&amp;#34;).  At first I didn&#x27;t think a cup, mug, bowl, etc. would be a big deal and it really isn&#x27;t a huge deal - but it definitely does have some quirks that could make your shaving experience easier, harder, better/worse eperienced.  Here is what I think i&#x27;ve learned so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  You want something easy to handle.  I exclusively looked for somethign with a handle on it and as it turns out.. that isn&#x27;t that important. you can just as easily (actually MORE easily) hold a bowl in the palm of your hands for this then grab a skinny handle and use that to hold the weight of the cup up.  So.. bowls are just as easy to handle over mugs or cups with handles.  i can&#x27;t see a bowl being easier to hold/handle with a handle over just holding this in the palm of your hands (it&#x27;s tiny actually.. perfect for your palm)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  depth vs width.  My initial instinct was that deep was better, wide didn&#x27;t seem to make sense for &amp;#34;frothing&amp;#34; and iwas comlpetely wrong.  Deep is atually harder. Wider is easier. Shallow is better (as long as it&#x27;s deep enough to hodl the amount of froth you want to create).  If your &amp;#34;frother&amp;#34; is deep and skinny.. it means your froth is going to ride up your brush and onto the handle and above (not so useful).  Shallower and wider is much better and easier to get to the froth. Also for those using soaps, i figured out my mug w/handle would probably not accommodate all soap sizes to drop into the mug (if you want to do it that way.. which i get the impression most people do).  With this bowl, wide means any soap can fit itno it just fine.  pretty convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  ceramic vs metallic vs other.  IMportance here is retention of warmth.  For that i think its obvious that cermic beats metallic.  But secondary concern (or maybe primary for you.. ceramic is breakable while metallic is not).  As wet shaving is a practice of patience and being careful not to slice up your face- i figure i&#x27;m alread in &amp;#34;careful enough&amp;#34; mode that cermic bowls are fine and now i can enjoy the heat of the lather too (sorry.. been calling it &amp;#34;froth&amp;#34; to this point).  Is there another material out there?  There are some that have reservoirs to keep stuff warm. I say skip this.  The heat only holds for so long and if you shave oru head like i do. it&#x27;ll cool off faster and well before you&#x27;re done anyway.  I&#x27;d rather re-heat the bowl quickly between passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Other things to look for:  I like that this bowl has a slight &amp;#34;curl-in&amp;#34; on top to keep lather in (it will escape mind you b/c it&#x27;s shallow enough that when you&#x27;re lathering up some can go over the sides.. but the &amp;#34;curl in&amp;#34; (very subtle) keeps most of it in.  Shallow I&#x27;ve heard is good in that you aren&#x27;t constantly &amp;#34;clanking&amp;#34; the bowl with the handle of yoru brush and potentially chipping the bowl.  So all around.. this bowl is the right size i think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some have mntioned there is no &amp;#34;texture&amp;#34; in this bowl to assist with lathering up.  NOt to worry.. lathering is easy wiht this bowl (i just switched to soap which is harder to lather.. or longer to lather).. had plenty of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Functionally i like this bowl.  It was a lot smaller than i expected but that turned into an advantage in that it is so easy/light to just rest in the palm of yoru hand as you use it.. and that also means for me easier to froth in that there&#x27;s less circumference to &amp;#34;whip&amp;#34; for lathering up.  It&#x27;s definitely stylish and a nice touch to your collection as well.  The &amp;#34;unique&amp;#34; also is good as ... well.. how much chrome, stainless steal, and ebony/ivory can one take?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why isn&#x27;t this a 5?  Not quite sure.  I&#x27;m guessing that some might want somethign bigger.  Some might want a handle.  Some might want the water thing (skettle?) to keep things more warm.  Some might want more texturing for aggressive/easier lathering.  All small factors but enough that maybe 1 star is fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do&#x27;nt oftn write somethign with no real downsider but this one really doesn&#x27;t have any.  And not that expensive either to boot.  You won&#x27;t be instantly thiking of your &amp;#34;next&amp;#34; bowl if you get this or thinking of returning/upgrading.  This one kinda hits a few sweet spots :)</li>
            <li> Well made, fits great in my hand.  It also is the perfect size if you like to use shaving soaps but if you use shaving cream it works well too!</li>
            <li> its more like a bowl, not a cup, it has a classic look, like the material, and can fit shaving soaps no problem. i keep my shaving soap inside it and use it to build a lather as well.</li>
            <li> Nice bowl and soap combination. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Can you simply use a mug?  Yes.  Do I still like this shave cup?  Oh yeah.. It seems to be the perfect height to mix cream or soap to a lather without clinking the brush handle or my fingers.  Looks nice too.</li>
            <li> The rim is too curved so the brush bangs off the sides of the top.  Wish it wasn&#x27;t so deep.  I just use it when I grate a puck of soap in it so it makes it easier to get a lather.</li>
            <li> I like it, it holds the heat when I soak in in hot water so I can have a good lather.  I have yet to use the soap.  One down side, is when building a lather it comes up an over the edges, so I have to keep forcing the excess down, I would like it to be a little wider and taller (no by much) but I like it and will continue to use until I get butter fingers and drop it.</li>
            <li> The shave cup color was better than I expected... It fits perfectly in my hand and has a good grip in the shower. I got the amber soap which has a great smell. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice bowl, the complaints that it isn&#x27;t perfectly formed are missing the point, it is supposed to be kind of free form, but I was very disappointed that mine came with no soap, I was looking forward to trying their product out before I committed to a larger order, if you order hope you get what&#x27;s promised.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Nice size, looks great.</li>
            <li> Good at first. The bowl shattered when placing it on the counter. The broken parts were too small to glue together.</li>
            <li> i bought 2 about 3 months ago... i bought 2 [20oz] mugs from a local dollar store... i keep soap pucks in the dollar store mugs .... i whip up lather/cream and transfer it to my santa fe shave cup and whip up lather in the santa fe cup...every day....i love the way they look on my vanity....i keep my vanity clean and looking sharp when im not at the sink...these shave cups give a curtain class to my sink area....im thinking about maybe buying 2 more.... the shaving soap is very good seeing my face gets an allergic reaction if i use shaving creams... ive had no problems with colonel conks soaps....  i highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> This bowl is stylish and perfect size, fits right in your hand to make your shaving cream. This bowl and Taconic shave eucalyptus &amp; mint shaving cream makes my shave perfect each morning.</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect. While this bowl is intended to hold shaving soap, I have repurposed it to be a scuttle. It fits squarely in the palm of my hand, and I can grip it so that I have complete control of it. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it isn&#x27;t really small. It can hold a bar of shaving soap no problem, but like I said, I use it as a scuttle for the lather. Either way, a great cup made with excellent craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> Great shave soap bowl, love the size and soap that came with.  I highly recommend this shave bowl, excellent buy!</li>
            <li> It is curved nicely. it allows for a really nice lather to be build up along the edges. I don&#x27;t actually recommend storing your soap puck in it though.&lt;br /&gt;the soap that comes with it is simple, both in smell and in use. Slightly thirsty. But it leaves the skin feeling fine. Not the best, but not bad for a starter soap.</li>
            <li> Great lather bowl... Holds heat well.. And fits compfortly in palm of hand.</li>
            <li> Not too big or small.  Just right.  Works well and does the job.  No complaints.  I&#x27;ve been looking for awhile and came close to pulling the trigger on a few and I&#x27;m glad I bought this.  I would by again.</li>
            <li> Nice handmade bowl Native American style from New Mexico; comes with large puck of Col. Conk shaving soap. I just bought a second one. Great value.</li>
            <li> When i make my cream too much of it just comes flying out if i mix vigorously ( which you should be doing). It would be perfect if it were just a half an inch deeper. It does look nice and i have dropped it once or twice in the sink and it has not broken.</li>
            <li> This bowl is perfect for shaving.  It is thick ceramic so it keeps warm once you heat it up with hot water, and it is a great size.  The only think I don&#x27;t like is the bottom is rough not smooth like the rest of the bowl.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is my first bowl and I like it so far. The opening is wide enough to lather comfortably. The bowl retains heat well from soaking my brush in warm water for a few minutes. It came with Colonel Conk Bayrum soap which I also like. This was a good buy getting a nice bowl and good soap in one.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> An excellent product. Previously I used a wooden cup but it developed a crack so I spent a few more dollars and bought this beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is great, but I already knew that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am always amazed at the richness of the lather even using a miniscule amount of soap.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving cup or bowl so I have no comparison but it does it&#x27;s job well. It has a nice finish just like the picture and fits in my hand well. I do wish it wasn&#x27;t so heavy, and also wish it was just a bit wider. My shaving brush hits the sides of the bowl pretty consistently when I&#x27;m working up a lather</li>
            <li> I have tried several shave different shave bowls and this is by far my favorite.  It is big without being too big and it stays warm there by keeping your lather warm long enough for your down stroke, cross stroke, and up stroke.  This one is a keeper and the one that I will use from here on out.  I also like the fact that each one is unique.</li>
            <li> I love the look of this shave cup. It&#x27;s got that nice handmade look to it without the pretentious price tag to accompany it. It&#x27;s a nice heavy shave cup with a slightly texturized, ceramic base so it doesn&#x27;t slide all over the counter when it&#x27;s wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for the slightly small opening. I tend to smack the handle of my shave brush on the sides of the cup while lathering up. By no means a deal breaker, but a slightly larger opening would&#x27;ve made it perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this bowl....it says cup but i think its a small bowl. the bowl is hand made in mexico and seems to retain heat very well and is the perfect size for the amount of shaving cream you need for 3-4 passes. also the soap that comes with the bowl is very nice as well. although i am not a fan of shave soap. i will uses it ocassionally with the cream to make a super lather when im doing ATG passes for added comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, this bowl is amazing and relatively small for easy storage on your sink.</li>
            <li> I love using this cup. Very easy to hold in my hand and work up a lather. I also like the fact that it holds heat well.</li>
            <li> This shave cup/bowl is great, the hand crafted pottery and glazed bowl is a wonderful addition to my shaving equipment.</li>
            <li> Nice, I don&#x27;t know why some think it is too deep, I have used with and without a puck.&lt;br /&gt;Love the way it fits in your hand I am 5&#x27;6&amp;#34; so I don&#x27;t have giant hands, easy to hold when wet.. Oh, It looks nice too!</li>
            <li> Nice bowl, well made, too small though. My Silvertip seems too &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; for the bowl. It&#x27;s marring up the finish of my brush when I&#x27;m trying to whip up a lather in the bowl.</li>
            <li> Very well made, and it&#x27;s an American product. This bowl might be just right for someone else, but I like to use a larger bowl to create leather with. Someone else might rate this a five star, in fact, if you were only using this bowl to hold a round bar of shaving soap, I would have rated this bowl a ten.</li>
            <li> Read the most critical review listed!  It says it all.  Love the look. Functionality is lacking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too crazy about the color, but in terms of using as a shave cup, it&#x27;s pretty awesome. I haven&#x27;t gotten the chance to use the soap, but as far as the cup goes I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, the whole ceramic bowl goes with my asian background.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...or so that&#x27;s what my friend have said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...that&#x27;s kinda racist...</li>
            <li> This bowl is both wide and very easy to make a rich luxurious lather with your shaving brush and favorite shaving soap.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very well made, and has some great earth tones in the bowl. It&#x27;s handmade, and is my go to bowl when wet shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Col Conk makes some really great stuff. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it just for making lather and it is great. I can move my brush and make a good lather in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also It feels and fits nice in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is made in the good old USA and that is a plus.</li>
            <li> Great solid dish. It holds the round shaving soaps perfectly and looks amazing on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> works fine. can generate foam well. though now i just apply directly to face w/o trying to create more foam to save on time.</li>
            <li> This is a really great bowl for lathering.</li>
            <li> Very attractive bowl/jar that I use for building lather.  It works great and doesn&#x27;t take long to whip up a nice cream.  Excellent quality and the coloring is unique and attractive.</li>
            <li> Lathers up the shave cream real nice!</li>
            <li> Great cup! Beautifully made and very sturdy. Bought as a lather bowl, but abandoned that after a few nights of the brush handle / my knuckles banging the side. Still makes a neck of a lather bowl, if you can look past that, as the lip keeps the lather from migrating out the top / sides. Ended up putting the Colonel Conk soap it came with, mine being almond (which has broken on me - being more of a Bay Rum / Sandalwood / Barbershop guy) in the metal bowl I had first bought add a lather bowl (and found way too small), where it&#x27;s a perfect fit. Great product. Great price (especially with the soap included). Just working past the knuckle/brush bang on the side, as it holds the lather in the bowl (not spilling out of the sides like with the latte mug). Good deal on a well made bowl.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossibly hard to find shave cups for puck-type shave soaps.  This one looked pretty nice and I thought it would go great in the shower.  It even came with Colonel Conk&#x27;s Almond soap which spelled pretty good initially.  But quite frankly, the bowl is too big.  Too big for the soap it came with and way to big for my husband&#x27;s Williams shave soap.  I struggled with it for an entire week.  The soap doesn&#x27;t seal to the bottom, so it just moves around and even up the sides when lathering up your brush.  After giving it my best effort for a week, I gave up.  Then tonight I made nachos for a light dinner and found a good use for it as a condiment cup for sour cream and guacamole.</li>
            <li> The product I received had more greens and purples. I was expecting something darker like in the picture. I&#x27;m disappointed. It feels solid and will probably be functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit: Although I originally was disappointed with the color of the product, I must admit that it has grown on me over time. The actual bowl is of great quality, and it really helps make a nice lather. It&#x27;s so functional that I had to change my review to prevent people from being deterred from this product. I would recommend this shaving bowl to others.</li>
            <li> Handmade and very high quality.  I&#x27;ve dropped it in the sink numerous times already and it has not even chipped or scratched.</li>
            <li> Nice substantial bowel but returned item. Did not sit level, otherwise would have kept it.</li>
            <li> I use this with the Ecotools kabuki brush, either The Body Shoppe&#x27;s shaving cream for men or Kiss My Face&#x27;s shaving cream, and a Muhle R89.  I really like all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bowl was a little lighter than the picture, whitish on half and purplish on the other half.  It definitely has a Southwestern feel to it.  The bottom is indeed unglazed and a little rough, which is fine on my standard counter.  I find the size, depth, and lip work very well (I do spill a little lather).  It definitely works much better than a ceramic kitchen cereal bowl I was using, and I like the width more than a shaving mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again, unless I saw a differently styled bowl that was the same size and shape that I happened to like the aesthetics more.</li>
            <li> My husband LOVED his Christmas present. Well made and beautiful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice bowl,.  It looks nice, is sized well and has a hefty feel to it.  It holds large and small soap cakes.  It retains heat to ensure warm lather.  It&#x27;s a bit slippery when wet.  It was a bit expensive compared to others I considered, but since I cut the cord to costly 5-blade disposables, I felt justified in splurging a bit.  I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
            <li> This is a very attractive mug. The colors are nice. My husband has said he misses a handle but really hasn&#x27;t complained loudly about not having one.</li>
