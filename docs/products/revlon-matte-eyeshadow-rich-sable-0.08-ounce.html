            <li> Rich Sable is the only color that accurately matches my eyebrows. I can fill them in with it,without looking like I filled them in. I bought an extra one of these as a spare, since they&#x27;ve been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this! It&#x27;s no longer in the stores. But I won&#x27;t pay $31.99 for something I paid $3.50 for. I&#x27;ll stop wearing make-up first. I&#x27;ll just keep looking for a good hilighter.</li>
            <li> Great price and quick delivery.  I love this product for eyebrow fill in, it doesn&#x27;t flake and goes on smoothly and has just the right amount of darkness, looks natural on the brows.</li>

            <li> I go out of my way to purchase this discontinued product. I don&#x27;t use it for my lids, but rather for filling in my brows. The color works perfect for me, it stays put, and obviously matte is needed for my purpose.</li>
            <li> Colour is beautiful and glides right on. I use it for my eyebrows and nights out and love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased several of these because I can no longer find it in local stores.  I think it has been discontinued. I hope to have enough of them to last for the remainder of my life!  I love the product.</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow is a great product. It goes on smoothly, blends well and the color is flattering. Overall, I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I use this as a eyebrow powder. I love the fact that it&#x27;s matte and it&#x27;s perfect. I would definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> Although the color is dark, it seems to require quite a lot to achieve the density I was hoping to find.</li>

            <li> The eyeshadow arrived damaged. It was not wrapped at all. Unable to use it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to use as eye liner and it works as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I use this matte shadow as eye liner. I wet an eye liner brush and I can go as thick or thin as I want. It doesn&#x27;t smear, it lasts, and I think Revlon has a really good product here.</li>
            <li> I loved it. I was looking for it for long time I actually used as an eyebrow color is perfect....</li>
