            <li>It&#x27;s amazing at controlling frizz.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell fantastic but works great on my hair.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try this product on myself because I have very fine hair and now because of aging...thinning hair.</li>

            <li>I love the product, but the sprayers do not work.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product</li>
            <li>There are better products for that on the market.</li>
            <li>It will not combat split ends or protect as one might want, but it&#x27;s much better than drying out hair with shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It works OK.</li>
            <li>I spray it on before i blowdry my hair, and after before i straighten and it made it silky and frizz free!</li>
            <li>I notice a difference in breakage and it&#x27;s more shiney now.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really cute design, just not practical.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>its simply the best.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I do not review many items...</li>
            <li>My hair is bouncy, full, and looks amazing all day....</li>
            <li>Having said that, this is a pretty good smoother.</li>
            <li>I bought this product primarily for static control.  </li>
            <li>but it was at such a good price here!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for keeping the flyaways down and makes my hair look sleek.</li>
            <li>It probably isn&#x27;t so impressive to me because I didn&#x27;t need my hair to be smoothed down like I thought I did.</li>
            <li>I have super curly hair and when I use this product I can straighten it with ease and it lasts all day!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy feeling, just super smooth and it keeps frizz at bay!  </li>
            <li>It is light weight and holds well.</li>
            <li>That being said, this product makes a great second day restyler.</li>
            <li>It helps with tangles and to smooth hair.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t smooth my hair.</li>
            <li>When I use this, my hair feels softer, natural, and lovely!</li>
            <li>I have 7 full bottles that I can&#x27;t use, and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>Can was full and intact</li>
            <li>I live in a very high humidity state (Kansas) and this is a really good product for my curly and often out of control, hair.</li>
            <li>It works if you like super flakes descending from your head all day though as well as inflames your scalp bright red.</li>
            <li>They quickly sent me replacement product and there were no issues.  </li>
            <li>Great product for smoothing dry hair before using a hot iron.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s an amazing product - especially for a day after look.</li>
            <li>Worth the $$</li>
            <li>I live the driest climates in Montana and this product really help smooth frizzies and keep my hair from getting staticy!</li>
            <li>The only thing that defrizzes my hair so easily!</li>
            <li>It works for part of the day, but don&#x27;t touch your hair or brush it, because the static comes right back.</li>
            <li>First found it when I worked at a hair salon</li>
            <li>though - I recommend cleaning the spray nozzle after you use it each time with extremely hot water or once every week, depending how often you use it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ve heard that issue with this product a million times - but they will definitely compensate you for it.</li>
            <li>This product works really well!  </li>
            <li>Really works to control damaged or frizzy hair!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the first product to be applied, then I use TIGI Sugar Shock to pump up the volume.  </li>
            <li>BUT... I can&#x27;t tell you how many bottles seem to get clogged, stop spraying, or just flat out</li>
            <li>Also, once hair is dry, it styles better.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky or hard but has a good hold.</li>
            <li>very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This leaves no residue and makes my hair very shinny.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Product arrived on time and in was packaged very well.</li>
            <li>Very toxic product-can interrupt hormones.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t do much for my hair, so I gave it to my daughter.</li>
            <li>I then flat iron lightly and spray again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to spray in long, towel dried hair, then brush hair.  </li>
            <li>I use this mainly on damp hair before blow drying.</li>
            <li>One bottle - the most recent I purchased - quit working at the second use.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li>This may seem like little more than scented water - but I don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the cheap pink plastic sprayer-cap just breaks and won&#x27;t make connection to the nozzle anymore -</li>
            <li>I normally buy it in stores</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s readily available at Target and other stores at a decent price point.  </li>
            <li>I have very long hair that I heat style regularly - this is great for keeping split ends calmed down, frizzies, smoothing, etc.  </li>
            <li>love the product, but the spray stopped working after a couple days, not sure why.</li>
            <li>Even after a full day of rain, I can get away with just a quick little mist before heading out for the night or even the next morning if I&#x27;m in a hurry and that&#x27;s all I need!  </li>
            <li>This stuff helps keep the frizz and static down, but the sprayer stopped working when it felt like there was still plenty of product left in the bottle.</li>
            <li>It smoothes down fly-aways and smells clean.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Bed Head products, and this is one of the few products I take with me everywhere.</li>
            <li>I believe that the tapered design at the top of the can partnered with a really huge and cumbersome nozzle make it difficult to actually SPRAY the product into my hair.</li>
            <li>Thru Natural Hold Design and Finishing Mist, 10-Ounce Bottle]].</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and silky after blow drying.</li>
            <li>And the actual product works very well.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly wavy hair</li>
            <li>I bought this because i have naturally frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>wow...</li>
            <li>One only needs a tiny bit of this stuff to get the right look.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little sticky compared to Spoil Me, but I put up with it because it isn&#x27;t sticky after it dries, and it does dry pretty quick.</li>
            <li>I am a licensed cosmetologist (not currently working in the industry)California &amp; North Carolina and I have extremely high expectations from hair products.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure what it is supposed to do, but when I used it, it was like spritzing a light fragrant water on my hair.</li>
            <li>the trick is to wash and condition with good products and then spray liberally all over but remember to use this product by itself or it simply will weigh down your head into a flat crunchy mess, i promise you, but if you use it alone, well, the results are dreamy and leave you feeling just</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d tried this because the price was pretty good, but was disappointed.</li>
            <li>I find that, on my hair, it&#x27;s overly oily if I&#x27;m not careful with the application.</li>
            <li>This happened on an earlier shipment from Amazon and I contacted TIGI directly about the problem.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone back to my old staple, [</li>
            <li>but others never left my house and just stopped spraying when the bottle was awfully heavy and full.  </li>
            <li>i have very very curly hair and nothing else works to tame it like this product.</li>
            <li>Although serums do smooth things down, they make my hair feel either sticky, greasy, or like it just plain</li>
            <li>I purchased this because it&#x27;s WC approved (she has a similiar hair style and also has thin, fine hair).</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t have a problem with frizzy hair. I have a few fly-aways, and this doesn&#x27;t help, really. I would need something thicker to tame them. Having said that, this is a pretty good smoother. This tames my hair, makes it manageable, and keeps it smoothed down during the day. I am not a big fan of serums. Although serums do smooth things down, they make my hair feel either sticky, greasy, or like it just plain has product in it. When I use this, my hair feels softer, natural, and lovely! No stickiness. It doesn&#x27;t feel like it is there. I can use it when my hair is wet, damp, or dry, and it always has the same effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the smells of the Bed Head products, but this one doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long and is definitely not as strong as some of their other sprays (like \\&quot;Headrush\\&quot;). Even so, I don&#x27;t care for the smell very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a star away because I&#x27;m not in love with this product. Lately, I&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:B000GFWIOU Nexxus Comb Thru Natural Hold Design and Finishing Mist, 10-Ounce Bottle]]. It smoothes down fly-aways and smells clean. It&#x27;s a little sticky compared to Spoil Me, but I put up with it because it isn&#x27;t sticky after it dries, and it does dry pretty quick.</li>
            <li> Great product for smoothing dry hair before using a hot iron. I will buy another when I&#x27;m almost out of it</li>
            <li> This stuff works so good! The only thing that defrizzes my hair so easily! Love it!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it&#x27;s WC approved (she has a similiar hair style and also has thin, fine hair). I find that, on my hair, it&#x27;s overly oily if I&#x27;m not careful with the application. I generally only use it as a second (or third, or fourth) day spritz when managing a left-over &#x27;do.</li>
            <li> Living in a humid climate, this item is a must! Truly combats the frizz even on the most humid of days.</li>
            <li> Best hair product I&#x27;ve ever bought. Doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky or hard but has a good hold.</li>
            <li> I use this mainly on damp hair before blow drying. It serves as a hair protectant as well. My hair is soft and silky after blow drying. Also you can use this on dry hair to tame frizz. Smell is fruity which I think is awesome. Must buy!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased 7 bottles of this product. Not one of the srayers works on any of the 7 bottles. I love the product, but the sprayers do not work. I have 7 full bottles that I can&#x27;t use, and frizzy hair. I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> One only needs a tiny bit of this stuff to get the right look.  It smells good (a hint of grapefruit). It is light weight and holds well. I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product BUT I&#x27;m having mechanical difficulties with it.  Once I get about 1/4 used, the spray nozzle starts to malfunction.  This happened on an earlier shipment from Amazon and I contacted TIGI directly about the problem.  They quickly sent me replacement product and there were no issues.  Now I&#x27;m using another Amazon shipment and I&#x27;m back to having spray malfunctions.  Not sure if the supplier got a bad batch or what, but it&#x27;s pretty darn frustrating!</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of \\&quot;hair polish\\&quot; for years until I met Spoil Me. After I blowdry to a smemi-dry state (as my thick hair takes nearly a day to dry if I do nothing to it) I spray a little on. I then flat iron lightly and spray again. It feels silky and soft - swingy and bouncy and for once I don&#x27;t have weird frizzballs sticking up at the end of the day. This may seem like little more than scented water - but I don&#x27;t care. It works wonderfully for me.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with lots of other comments on here.  I&#x27;ve used (or tried to use) this product for years - it&#x27;s readily available at Target and other stores at a decent price point.  And the actual product works very well.  I have very long hair that I heat style regularly - this is great for keeping split ends calmed down, frizzies, smoothing, etc.  BUT... I can&#x27;t tell you how many bottles seem to get clogged, stop spraying, or just flat out won&#x27;t work at random times.  Sometimes I thought it was because I took the bottle with me on a trip (maybe the altitude of the plane ride is bad for it?) but others never left my house and just stopped spraying when the bottle was awfully heavy and full.  Sometimes the cheap pink plastic sprayer-cap just breaks and won&#x27;t make connection to the nozzle anymore - which means you can never use the product again.  One bottle - the most recent I purchased - quit working at the second use.  Just the second, simply stopped spraying!  Continually feel ripped off by this product, and refusing to buy another until the bottle changes.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Bed Head products, and this is one of the few products I take with me everywhere. I definitely don&#x27;t use this as a defrizzer as it&#x27;s advertised though. There are better products for that on the market. That being said, this product makes a great second day restyler. I will spray it all through my hair then use a blow dryer to reset the hair. It combats greasiness for a day or two and can freshen hair with a pleasant, very light scent. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it works very well for people who are hesitant to wash and dry and style hair every day. It will not combat split ends or protect as one might want, but it&#x27;s much better than drying out hair with shampoo.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! Bedhead is so great. This is one product that is good for those rainy days where your hair gets curly and frizzy? Then this is what you get! I have naturally curly wavy hair and I straighten it all the time...on rainy days or in the hot heat in the summer my hair gets curly and alittle drizzy and this product protects your hair from all of that..its great!</li>
            <li> So shinny! This leaves no residue and makes my hair very shinny. It also smells great. I use it like a dry conditioner on my 2nd day hair. Also, amazon has the cheapest price that I can find</li>
            <li> Love this product. First found it when I worked at a hair salon and it&#x27;s an amazing product - especially for a day after look. It essentially works like a dry shampoo and say goodbye to frizz. Overall, I would definitely recommend it, especially for the price and it being a bed head product. I&#x27;ve owned a few bottles and some of them stop spraying after awhile though - I recommend cleaning the spray nozzle after you use it each time with extremely hot water or once every week, depending how often you use it. If that still doesn&#x27;t work - email or write bed head - they have amazing customer service and I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ve heard that issue with this product a million times - but they will definitely compensate you for it.</li>
            <li> A must have for my hair for years. Used to wash my hair every day. Have learned I can go 2-3 days, and if I&#x27;m really depressed or ill, even a week, of not washing my hair, as long as I use this to keep the frizzies down. I&#x27;ve learned it&#x27;s good for making split ends look temporarily repaired. It makes my roots look greasy so I just use it on the ends.</li>
            <li> This re-styler works as described. Love it.</li>
            <li> 5 stars! This arrived on time and works perfectly. I normally buy it in stores but it was at such a good price here! I&#x27;ve used Spoil Me for almost 3 years. It&#x27;s amazing at controlling frizz.</li>
            <li> It works OK. The aerosol can is bit funky. Does not live up to the hype. Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this because i have naturally frizzy hair. I spray it on before i blowdry my hair, and after before i straighten and it made it silky and frizz free! definitely reccomend it!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell fantastic but works great on my hair. I notice a difference in breakage and it&#x27;s more shiney now.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It was just what I was expecting. I would highly recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> This product may have been great if it had not leaked everywhere. I don&#x27;t know how it is possible for product to escape this bottle, but it did. Can was completely empty in a matter of days and I had only used it twice</li>
            <li> I live the driest climates in Montana and this product really help smooth frizzies and keep my hair from getting staticy!</li>
            <li> I bought this product primarily for static control.  It works for part of the day, but don&#x27;t touch your hair or brush it, because the static comes right back.</li>
            <li> I had this years ago, and cant seem to find it on the shelf anymore. I have mid length, curly, thick hair, and It keeps my curls intact while chilling out the frizz.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Arrived on time and as described.  It&#x27;s great to spray in long, towel dried hair, then brush hair.  It helps with tangles and to smooth hair.  Also, once hair is dry, it styles better.  Additionally, it works great as a morning hair refresher.</li>
            <li> This product works really well!  It&#x27;s perfect for keeping the flyaways down and makes my hair look sleek. Would recommend</li>
            <li> I live in a very high humidity state (Kansas) and this is a really good product for my curly and often out of control, hair. Product arrived on time and in was packaged very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d recommend it for what it&#x27;s labeled for...</li>
            <li> I think the contents of the product itself are decent, but the actual design of the container is hard to use. I believe that the tapered design at the top of the can partnered with a really huge and cumbersome nozzle make it difficult to actually SPRAY the product into my hair. I need to use two hands- one to hold the can, one to push the nozzle. It&#x27;s a really cute design, just not practical.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! Spray a little on your hair to instantly tame friz and getaways!</li>
            <li> great produt of TIGI arrived in ecelent conditions</li>
            <li> Best restyling product that I&#x27;ve ever used.  Good control and no frizz.  Doesn&#x27;t give your hair a bad texture.</li>
            <li> This stuff helps keep the frizz and static down, but the sprayer stopped working when it felt like there was still plenty of product left in the bottle. Also, I felt like I had to spray a lot of it to get good coverage. I&#x27;ve gone back to my old staple, [[ASIN:B002N5MIBE Paul Mitchell The Conditioner, 33.8-Ounce Bottle]]. I&#x27;d tried this because the price was pretty good, but was disappointed.</li>
            <li> It smooths your hair but it&#x27;s not a product that is so impressive... It probably isn&#x27;t so impressive to me because I didn&#x27;t need my hair to be smoothed down like I thought I did.</li>
            <li> love the product, but the spray stopped working after a couple days, not sure why. Disappointed as now the product is just wasted.</li>
            <li> This product works well and smells great. I usually use it on my hair when wet to detangle and add shine.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to give my hair a break and not wash it every single day. I heard that this product would be great for the days that I don&#x27;t wash it. I am not sure what it is supposed to do, but when I used it, it was like spritzing a light fragrant water on my hair. I dont see the point of this product. It didn&#x27;t defrizz my hair. It didn&#x27;t smooth my hair. It just made it flat and wet. Waste of money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Really works to control damaged or frizzy hair! Smells delicious too! Worth the $$</li>
            <li> Wish shipping was faster but otherwise perfect.  Love this product. Can was full and intact</li>
            <li> Love the product, but I ordered 2 and the spray nozzle on one of them was broke off!!!</li>
            <li> (:  i have very very curly hair and nothing else works to tame it like this product. its simply the best. the trick is to wash and condition with good products and then spray liberally all over but remember to use this product by itself or it simply will weigh down your head into a flat crunchy mess, i promise you, but if you use it alone, well, the results are dreamy and leave you feeling just wow... you&#x27;ll love it. remember to trim a quarter inch for hair maintenance every 3 to 4 months for ultimate results.</li>
            <li> LOVE&amp;#60; LOVE&amp;#60;LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!  I have super curly hair and when I use this product I can straighten it with ease and it lasts all day!  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy feeling, just super smooth and it keeps frizz at bay!  Even after a full day of rain, I can get away with just a quick little mist before heading out for the night or even the next morning if I&#x27;m in a hurry and that&#x27;s all I need!  FABULOUS PRODUCT!!  It&#x27;s too bad I can never find this product in stores anymore, but thank goodness amazon sellers still carry it!!!!  :)</li>
            <li> I do not review many items... maybe one every five years and it has to be a really great product.  I am a licensed cosmetologist (not currently working in the industry)California &amp; North Carolina and I have extremely high expectations from hair products.  I was hesitant to try this product on myself because I have very fine hair and now because of aging...thinning hair. The hair at the temple area never gets beyond 4-5 inches long because of the thinning due to age issue and the tips always look fried (even though they are well pampered &amp; protected.  Well, this product changed all that, I use it all over when my hair is damp and it&#x27;s the first product to be applied, then I use TIGI Sugar Shock to pump up the volume.  Spoil Me is a game changer, I have had the best hair days I have had in years thanks to this amazing product! I use a little to finish before I walk out the door.  I have had more compliments in the past week, than the past 5 years. My hair is bouncy, full, and looks amazing all day.... I could never say that before, it was always flat after 5 minutes, limp and it lost all styling the moment I stepped outside.  Not with Spoil Me....I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This broke out my scalp with the worst redness and irritation imaginable. It works if you like super flakes descending from your head all day though as well as inflames your scalp bright red. I am allergic to sulfates and this has every imaginable sulfate. Very toxic product-can interrupt hormones. Do not use</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do much for my hair, so I gave it to my daughter.</li>
