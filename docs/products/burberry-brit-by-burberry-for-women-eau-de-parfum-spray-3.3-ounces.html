            <li>AWESOME!</li>
            <li>Smells great!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect scam, too, because the product is not returnable.  </li>
            <li>The best perfume I have ever received as a gift.  </li>
            <li>This is a delightful perfume.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been with her serveral times when she&#x27;s been stopped and asked what she was wearing or had someone comment on the wonderful scent!</li>
            <li>it was perfect when i got it!</li>
            <li>The perfume is perfect.</li>
            <li>But whenever I go out wearing it 98% of the time ppl stop me and ask what I&#x27;m wearing because its incredible!!</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s getting wonderful comments from her friends and co-workers..</li>
            <li>It is perfect for teens  </li>
            <li>Perfect size as well.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s perfect for wearing during the day or in the office.</li>
            <li>so I find it to be the perfect scent to wear to work if you&#x27;re in an office setting and don&#x27;t want to offend anyone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the perfect scent for me.</li>

            <li>amazon is the best site ever......</li>
            <li>Says she is very happy that I sent it to her.</li>
            <li>I find for daywear that the Eau de Toilette is best - the scent lingers, but is never overpowering.</li>
            <li>Good Deal!!</li>

            <li>This perfume is absolutely amazing.</li>

            <li>It arrived fast, in perfect condition</li>
            <li>This fullsize bottle of Burberry Brit is a nice mix of sugar cookies and spice.</li>
            <li>Nice mix of vanilla and citrus that works well for day or night.</li>

            <li>Came very quickly!</li>

            <li>truthfully wonder how the men&#x27;s cologne smells, because this could very easily  be a unisex scent.</li>
            <li>i will tell people about it that is the best stuff in the world no other like it</li>
            <li>It is a very light to medium scent</li>
            <li>many compliments when wearing this perfume.</li>
            <li>So glad I took the chance of the product being authenic</li>
            <li>My favorite fragrance forever.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 3 years, get so many compliments in the office, on the street, elevator...everywhere.</li>
            <li>I was really satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>The top is citrus with lots and lots of sugar.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a scent age appropriate across the spectrum.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful scent, and one of my overall favorites.</li>
            <li>I love this product and this was the cheapest i have seen it.  </li>
            <li>I used to wear Touch and switched to Brit which I like better.  </li>
            <li>Plus I love that it&#x27;s parfum, not eau de toillete, because it lasts longer...</li>
            <li>* :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments :)</li>
            <li>i love it...</li>
            <li>and I receive many compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>I love this scent  </li>
            <li>Went with the parfum as opposed to the eu de toilette thinking it would be better.</li>
            <li>And when you do receive your order, don&#x27;t hesitate to take it into a store to compare it with an authentic one.</li>
            <li>I believe it is a winter scent more than a summer scent.</li>
            <li>It has the touch of citrus I love and the spice to make it a grown up scent for sure.</li>
            <li>I really love this perfum.</li>
            <li>I love seeing the bottle in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li>Not overpowering, just leaves you wanting for more.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>lots of folks love this scent.</li>
            <li>My favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I am more than satisfied with product and with price.</li>
            <li>I just love this perfume.  </li>
            <li>&quot; They all love the scent.</li>
            <li>seems to be the real deal and a great price!&lt;br</li>
            <li>whoever smell it ibalways get compliment:)</li>
            <li>I plsn to purchase more from thiss site</li>
            <li>This is such a beautiful scent!</li>
            <li>This is one of my girlfriends favorite scents.  </li>
            <li>I do a lot of Amazon shopping and this particular purchase was a great experience.</li>
            <li>I was so excited ordering my first fragrance online, thought the price was great and had smell this scent many times in stores</li>
            <li>I gave the first bottle to my fiance who LOVED it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a warm smell, but not overly sweet.</li>
            <li>This perfume is perfect for all occasions and remains with you for a long time.  </li>
            <li>But when I got the perfume 2 days after my order, I was very pleased to know it was NOT a fake.</li>
            <li>It is a light oriental, underlined with warm, sweet notes (vanilla, almond).</li>
            <li>, just right!!  </li>
            <li>i was taking a risk since I&#x27;ve never smelled it before, but it was well worth it! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this purfume for many years and this isn&#x27;t worth the money buy from a department store!Very Disapointed!</li>
            <li>It is joined very quickly by candied pear and almond.</li>
            <li>I just couldn&#x27;t wear it..to strong for me.  </li>
            <li>(Maybe just spray it in the air and walk into it if it is just too strong for you...)</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t smell strongly of alcohol, which some perfumes do.</li>
            <li>When I first got a whiff of Burberry Brit, it smelled warm and inviting.  </li>
            <li>Everyone says the same: the smell is beautiful without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>Burberry makes a fine selection of colognes.  </li>
            <li>but it was just fine.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t love this the first time I smelled it, but now I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure that is a compliment :)  </li>
            <li>Even my hubby who has perfume favorites, felt this was extraordinary!</li>
            <li>I purchased this product assuming that the title was accurate and that it was in fact eau de parfum.  </li>
            <li>In my huge collection of perfumes this is my go to winter scent.</li>
            <li>Got a free sample vial.</li>
            <li>What a fantastic scent.</li>
            <li>The Parfum is light and wafts as you walk by.</li>
            <li>Overall it is a great smelling perfume.</li>
            <li>This is such a great fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This is a fresh, clean scent and lasts all day, I rarely have to use more than my morning dose!</li>
            <li>I am 90% sure that it is not fake, it has sweet smell and all that; but for some reason I felt that this is not close to the very sweet smell of burberry brit I sampled at the mall...</li>
            <li>Smell kind of faded during the end of the day but was pretty good overall.</li>
            <li>It smells light and clean, with fruity smells also.....</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this scent the first time I tried it, but the $80</li>
            <li>Did not keep packaging as was excited  and now stuck with it and out 46.03</li>
            <li>I have had numerous compliments from both men and women alike with this fragrance, I first purchased it from a department store and loved it!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure it was tampered with because it doesn&#x27;t smell like any perfume I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>It is a little strong, but it smells so good that I don&#x27;t care!</li>
            <li>This is my all-time favorite scent and it arrived a week early!!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It soon warms up to a soft vanilla woods scent with a bit of amber; the citrus and fruit notes for the most part disappear with the top notes.</li>
            <li>Does not smell like the real stuff more importantly</li>
            <li>Every time I wear it, one of the men I work with comments how nice I smell and said the only scent better on a woman would be bacon.  </li>
            <li>Strong scent but not musky or too overly powerful</li>
            <li>This was a true counterfeit of Burberry Brit Eau de Parfum.</li>
            <li>Honestly, don&#x27;t by perfume online unless it&#x27;s directly from Macy&#x27;s, Sephora etc.</li>
            <li>I find the opening stages almost unbearably sweet when my wife wears it in summer months.</li>
            <li>I love how it smells on me, its absolutely mouth watering.</li>
            <li>Been wanting this scent for quite some time and finally found a good price here.  </li>
            <li>I do like the sweet smell of this fragrance</li>
            <li>This perfume smells so good and it shipped in only 3 days!</li>
            <li>a woman wants to find love...</li>
            <li>&quot; they will issue me a full refund.</li>
            <li>:) Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and the quality was as promised in the advertisement.</li>
            <li>Amazon shipped it quickly</li>
            <li>your quick and timely delivery was spot on ....</li>
            <li>order came quite quickly, and came as a kit with body wash and lotion which I wasn&#x27;t expecting.</li>
            <li>I really liked that I got the product as I expected, I love Burberry fragances.</li>
            <li>Overall, very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It is a soft, clean scent and my favorite...</li>
            <li>It is crisp and clean without being overly floral or sweet.  </li>
            <li>Intriguing in an intriguing way, multi-layered, not too sweet, not too floral, not too unsubtle.  </li>
            <li>It could be classified as a warm or cool scent - it blends especially well with my vanilla scented lotions.</li>
            <li>This is the last time I&#x27;ll buy a fragrance from Amazon, that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li>just fresh, crisp and clean.</li>
            <li>BIG MISTAKE that I didn&#x27;t see the note underneath the picture on Amazon&#x27;s page that this can&#x27;t be returned because it&#x27;s hazardous material.</li>
            <li>Get it if your searching for a present for your mom because I honestly didn&#x27;t know what to get my moms</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s wayyy worth it.  </li>
            <li>I think its always better to spend some extra amount on Genuine perfumes at shopping malls rather then buying</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just such a light and lovely scent to wear to work, church, and a picnic type of event.</li>
            <li>It has a deep warm scent with a flowery finish.</li>
            <li>So well worth the price.</li>
            <li>When I first smelled it on the bottle, I thought It&#x27;s too sweet, but then I gave It a try by spraying on my wrist, and hair</li>
            <li>Pricey of course, but worth it.</li>
            <li>This perfume smells good but some of the other ones from burberry are far better than this one.</li>
            <li>I was so excited because it was so much cheaper on Amazon than it is anywhere else</li>
            <li>It is fresh and strong at first, then soft and sweet.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t smell right to begin with.</li>
            <li>you enjoy Light Blue by Dolce &amp; Gabbana, or Very Irresistible by Givenchy, you&#x27;ll most likely love this scent.</li>
            <li>Has just the right scent.</li>
            <li>Very mellow and clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also purchased Burberry Brit Sheer and regular Burberry perfume before and this is by far the best one.</li>
            <li>I bought it the same day and received it very quickly!</li>
            <li>How wonderful to find the exact same item at amazon for almost half the cost.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased a few bottles of this perfume and you cannot go wrong, it&#x27;s one of the best and most favorite scents I wear.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe this is original or if it is it&#x27;s very old.</li>
            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>BTW: this Burberry Brit perfume was not fake.</li>
            <li>She first tried it in colder weather</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s someone else out there in the same situation.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the prompt shipment of this item Amazon!</li>
            <li>I love perfume and have been consuming perfume for decades on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>This is NOT fake.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for and it seems to be untampered with so that was a plus</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still sitting on my shelf 2 years later and the bottle is so cute I&#x27;ll keep it there.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it highly to every woman!!</li>
            <li>I received this item when it was promised and it was exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>I went to a brick and mortar store that sells Burberry Brit, and they showed me all the details that were different between the authentic perfume and the one that I purchased.  </li>
            <li>When it came it was wrapped with bubble wrap, the perfume box seal was opened, but the first spray took a couple pumps</li>
            <li>I ALWAYS buy Burberry Brit, however this is the first time I bought it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>, he&#x27;s very picky and doesn&#x27;t want to smell \\&quot;feminine\\&quot;, so I had to purchase another one!  </li>
            <li>Actually I compare with amzone price is more than $16.00.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real thing!</li>
            <li>but I had been using it prior to it being gifted to me.  </li>
            <li>Good product ,It has a soft scent lasts long.</li>
            <li>The scent is quite nice but it fades quickly and I have to re-apply a few times.  </li>
            <li>My hubby bought this for me as an early Christmas present &amp; I was kind of concerned because he ordered it and what if it was a knock off.</li>
            <li>Mostly, people say it is so fresh and clean, it is not strong, but you feel it the whole day.</li>
            <li>for fragrance, to me it smells mostly like clean soap, almonds, lime, and maybe a little bit of vanilla.</li>
            <li>, it is far too sweet to be called \\&quot;fresh\\&quot;, and it is not predominantly a floral.</li>
            <li>It can be a little strong when sprayed on directly, but I find that the intense scent fades fast and becomes a lingering warm and sultry scent.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite scents (Addict by Christian Dior is my other favorite -</li>
            <li>Use it sparingly because it does last and can be kinda strong.</li>
            <li>I am bit skeptical ordering perfume online, but this turned out to be very good.  </li>
            <li>I got mine from Amazon, so it&#x27;s real.</li>
            <li>The sugar remains, but it does calm considerably.</li>
            <li>I got real concerned and took it to Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>and I should have, the stuff I got I do not believe is real</li>
            <li>It is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be deceived by the description, you are not getting the real thing.</li>
            <li>she absolutely loves it...</li>
            <li>So be careful, it might be safer to buy the perfume elsewhere , even if it costs more.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Burberry Brit is a gentle scent.</li>
            <li>and it hugs gently to your skin and doesn&#x27;t fill the whole room,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a pleasing fragrance</li>
            <li>that I have to use twice as much.</li>
            <li>If you want the real thing go to a brick and mortor store.</li>
            <li>She really enjoys it.</li>
            <li>it really has been said that I smell like berrys..so get that burberry.</li>
            <li>thanks.......</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It is intense, but gentle.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than a department store</li>
            <li>This scent is masculine and lovely at the same time.  </li>
            <li>and I thought this would be a nice gift at a little better price than perfumania or other retailers like Macys.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but it smells a little cheap and somebody didn&#x27;t put a lot of effort into making this perfume.</li>
            <li>, it arrived very carefully packaged, and they have a phenomenal price.  </li>
            <li>Out of all the Burberry perfumes, this scent is Classic, and the price on Amazon.com is very affordable - beats retail stores AND discount perfume stores.      </li>
            <li>I love this fragrance, it is warn but yet soft and seems to be long wearing.  </li>
            <li>I later received a full refund from Amazon without returning the product.]</li>
            <li>The wife and I was at JC Pennys looking at some new perfume for her, and she really like the smell of this one, but the price was alot, so I told her to wait to see if Amazon had it</li>
            <li>I really love the price I get with Amazon, nearly half what the department store charges.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this scent and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is an original product (only bought direct from amazon).    </li>
            <li>It is strong at first, but after an hour or so it then mellows down to a soft vanilla.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that this isn&#x27;t an everyday perfume because it is pretty strong, and can easily be overwhelming to the sense of smell if it is put on too heavily.</li>
            <li>The inside packaging included the bottle being wrapped with a picture of a girl, which isn&#x27;t normal.</li>
            <li>I purchased after smelling a sample on a plane trip and it smelled completely different right out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Cap doen&#x27;t fit nicely as compared to our previous purchases for the same item from other retailers.</li>
            <li>so it must have been brand new.</li>
            <li>Product just as described and perfectly new condition.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is all wrong, and most importantly the perfume isn&#x27;t burberry brit either.  </li>
            <li>As this is the policy, the product is much cheaper here than in stores, and i&#x27;m not ordering in a last minute rush for Christmas or something, it seems like a reasonable chance to take.</li>
            <li>Brit has been my favorite for the past four years.</li>
            <li>I have owned Burberry Brit before and was excited to get it for such a low price on amazon.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re getting the exact same product.</li>
            <li>Ordered this item today and then saw the 1-star reviews saying that it was fake, even when \\&quot;shipped and sold by Amazon.\\&quot; Just to be sure, I contacted Amazon who, aside from assuring me it would be authentic (which I will verify when I receive the order), told me that although I cannot ship them back the item/return the item, if it is not authentic/\\&quot;I don&#x27;t like it\\</li>
            <li>The nice thing about this fragrance is you don&#x27;t need a lot, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Light, not over-powering, and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>I love Burberry Brit,I bought mine at macy&#x27;s bout 2 yrs ago and still have half a bottle left.</li>
            <li>To my senses, it seems more floral than anything and not a musk type - my only qualm is that the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>After that, it is completely gone.</li>
            <li>To me they smell \\&quot;old lady\\&quot;ish.  </li>
            <li>I received thisroduct extremely fast, even before items I had shipped at the same time.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t find this too mature a scent or too young of a scent.</li>
            <li>I imagine a classy lady in her twenties/thirties wearing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do have a sensitive nose.</li>
            <li>It has a soft scent,</li>
            <li>classy</li>
            <li>The spout smells like body odor, and the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I did not read the one-star reviews because I already knew I loved Burberry Brit</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be able to return it because it&#x27;s considered \\&quot;hazardous\\&quot; by Amazon, and I don&#x27;t think they mean</li>
            <li>Really strong when just sprayed, but after a little while it gets soft, but at the same time not too soft.</li>
            <li>3.3oz lasts for a long time, because it is very strong and needs to be sprayed no more than twice [not to make anyone dizzy].</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a snob, and I usually don&#x27;t go for Eau de Anything, but this is surprisingly lovely, and, quite simply, I&#x27;ll buy it again.  </li>
            <li>I receive more compliments when I wear this than any other of my other parfum.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend and I would purchase from this seller again in the future.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended and would buy again for this low price</li>
            <li>It is a sharp flowery vanilla + tangerine at first, then it changes to spicy and nutty, and finally - to soft flowery.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing worse than having to work with someone wearing gaggingly strong scent!</li>
            <li>The perfume bottle and the perfume were definitely fraudulant which is very upsetting since this was supposed to be a christmas present.</li>
            <li>spayed it and the sent went right away almost as if its watered down or eau de toilette</li>
            <li>Will shop here again for all my perfumes because I have no regrets.</li>
            <li>I really like this perfume&#x27;s scent, however it doesn\\&quot;t last very long.</li>
            <li>Spend a little extra money to get the full worth of your hard earned $$.</li>
            <li>It may be an old bottle of Burberry, but either way the scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all</li>

            <li> This is a wonderful scent, and one of my overall favorites.</li>
            <li> I love this product and this was the cheapest i have seen it.  </li>
            <li> I used to wear Touch and switched to Brit which I like better.  </li>
            <li> Plus I love that it&#x27;s parfum, not eau de toillete, because it lasts longer...</li>
            <li> * :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments :)</li>
            <li> i love it...</li>
            <li> and I receive many compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.</li>
            <li> I love this scent  </li>
            <li> Went with the parfum as opposed to the eu de toilette thinking it would be better.</li>
            <li> And when you do receive your order, don&#x27;t hesitate to take it into a store to compare it with an authentic one.</li>
            <li> I believe it is a winter scent more than a summer scent.</li>
            <li> It has the touch of citrus I love and the spice to make it a grown up scent for sure.</li>
            <li> I really love this perfum.</li>
            <li> I love seeing the bottle in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Not overpowering, just leaves you wanting for more.</li>

            <li> &quot; They all love the scent.</li>
            <li> seems to be the real deal and a great price!&lt;br</li>
            <li> whoever smell it ibalways get compliment:)</li>
            <li> I plsn to purchase more from thiss site</li>
            <li> This is such a beautiful scent!</li>
            <li> This is one of my girlfriends favorite scents.  </li>
            <li> I do a lot of Amazon shopping and this particular purchase was a great experience.</li>
            <li> I was so excited ordering my first fragrance online, thought the price was great and had smell this scent many times in stores</li>
            <li> I gave the first bottle to my fiance who LOVED it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a warm smell, but not overly sweet.</li>
            <li> This perfume is perfect for all occasions and remains with you for a long time.  </li>
            <li> But when I got the perfume 2 days after my order, I was very pleased to know it was NOT a fake.</li>
            <li> It is a light oriental, underlined with warm, sweet notes (vanilla, almond).</li>
            <li> , just right!!  </li>
            <li> i was taking a risk since I&#x27;ve never smelled it before, but it was well worth it! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this purfume for many years and this isn&#x27;t worth the money buy from a department store!Very Disapointed!</li>
            <li> It is joined very quickly by candied pear and almond.</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t wear it..to strong for me.  </li>
            <li> (Maybe just spray it in the air and walk into it if it is just too strong for you...)</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t smell strongly of alcohol, which some perfumes do.</li>
            <li> When I first got a whiff of Burberry Brit, it smelled warm and inviting.  </li>
            <li> Everyone says the same: the smell is beautiful without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> Burberry makes a fine selection of colognes.  </li>
            <li> but it was just fine.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love this the first time I smelled it, but now I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure that is a compliment :)  </li>
            <li> Even my hubby who has perfume favorites, felt this was extraordinary!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product assuming that the title was accurate and that it was in fact eau de parfum.  </li>
            <li> In my huge collection of perfumes this is my go to winter scent.</li>
            <li> Got a free sample vial.</li>
            <li> What a fantastic scent.</li>
            <li> The Parfum is light and wafts as you walk by.</li>
            <li> Overall it is a great smelling perfume.</li>
            <li> This is such a great fragrance.  </li>
            <li> This is a fresh, clean scent and lasts all day, I rarely have to use more than my morning dose!</li>
            <li> I am 90% sure that it is not fake, it has sweet smell and all that; but for some reason I felt that this is not close to the very sweet smell of burberry brit I sampled at the mall...</li>
            <li> Smell kind of faded during the end of the day but was pretty good overall.</li>
            <li> It smells light and clean, with fruity smells also.....</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this scent the first time I tried it, but the $80</li>
            <li> Did not keep packaging as was excited  and now stuck with it and out 46.03</li>
            <li> I have had numerous compliments from both men and women alike with this fragrance, I first purchased it from a department store and loved it!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty sure it was tampered with because it doesn&#x27;t smell like any perfume I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> It is a little strong, but it smells so good that I don&#x27;t care!</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite scent and it arrived a week early!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It soon warms up to a soft vanilla woods scent with a bit of amber; the citrus and fruit notes for the most part disappear with the top notes.</li>
            <li> Does not smell like the real stuff more importantly</li>
            <li> Every time I wear it, one of the men I work with comments how nice I smell and said the only scent better on a woman would be bacon.  </li>
            <li> Strong scent but not musky or too overly powerful</li>
            <li> This was a true counterfeit of Burberry Brit Eau de Parfum.</li>
            <li> Honestly, don&#x27;t by perfume online unless it&#x27;s directly from Macy&#x27;s, Sephora etc.</li>
            <li> I find the opening stages almost unbearably sweet when my wife wears it in summer months.</li>
            <li> I love how it smells on me, its absolutely mouth watering.</li>
            <li> Been wanting this scent for quite some time and finally found a good price here.  </li>
            <li> I do like the sweet smell of this fragrance</li>
            <li> This perfume smells so good and it shipped in only 3 days!</li>
            <li> a woman wants to find love...</li>
            <li> &quot; they will issue me a full refund.</li>
            <li> :) Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and the quality was as promised in the advertisement.</li>
            <li> Amazon shipped it quickly</li>
            <li> your quick and timely delivery was spot on ....</li>
            <li> order came quite quickly, and came as a kit with body wash and lotion which I wasn&#x27;t expecting.</li>
            <li> I really liked that I got the product as I expected, I love Burberry fragances.</li>
            <li> Overall, very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It is a soft, clean scent and my favorite...</li>
            <li> It is crisp and clean without being overly floral or sweet.  </li>
            <li> Intriguing in an intriguing way, multi-layered, not too sweet, not too floral, not too unsubtle.  </li>
            <li> It could be classified as a warm or cool scent - it blends especially well with my vanilla scented lotions.</li>
            <li> This is the last time I&#x27;ll buy a fragrance from Amazon, that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li> just fresh, crisp and clean.</li>
            <li> BIG MISTAKE that I didn&#x27;t see the note underneath the picture on Amazon&#x27;s page that this can&#x27;t be returned because it&#x27;s hazardous material.</li>
            <li> Get it if your searching for a present for your mom because I honestly didn&#x27;t know what to get my moms</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s wayyy worth it.  </li>
            <li> I think its always better to spend some extra amount on Genuine perfumes at shopping malls rather then buying</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just such a light and lovely scent to wear to work, church, and a picnic type of event.</li>
            <li> It has a deep warm scent with a flowery finish.</li>
            <li> So well worth the price.</li>
            <li> When I first smelled it on the bottle, I thought It&#x27;s too sweet, but then I gave It a try by spraying on my wrist, and hair</li>
            <li> Pricey of course, but worth it.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells good but some of the other ones from burberry are far better than this one.</li>
            <li> I was so excited because it was so much cheaper on Amazon than it is anywhere else</li>
            <li> It is fresh and strong at first, then soft and sweet.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t smell right to begin with.</li>
            <li> you enjoy Light Blue by Dolce &amp; Gabbana, or Very Irresistible by Givenchy, you&#x27;ll most likely love this scent.</li>
            <li> Has just the right scent.</li>
            <li> Very mellow and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also purchased Burberry Brit Sheer and regular Burberry perfume before and this is by far the best one.</li>
            <li> I bought it the same day and received it very quickly!</li>
            <li> How wonderful to find the exact same item at amazon for almost half the cost.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased a few bottles of this perfume and you cannot go wrong, it&#x27;s one of the best and most favorite scents I wear.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this is original or if it is it&#x27;s very old.</li>
            <li> Thanks!  </li>
            <li> BTW: this Burberry Brit perfume was not fake.</li>
            <li> She first tried it in colder weather</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s someone else out there in the same situation.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the prompt shipment of this item Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love perfume and have been consuming perfume for decades on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> This is NOT fake.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and it seems to be untampered with so that was a plus</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still sitting on my shelf 2 years later and the bottle is so cute I&#x27;ll keep it there.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it highly to every woman!!</li>
            <li> I received this item when it was promised and it was exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I went to a brick and mortar store that sells Burberry Brit, and they showed me all the details that were different between the authentic perfume and the one that I purchased.  </li>
            <li> When it came it was wrapped with bubble wrap, the perfume box seal was opened, but the first spray took a couple pumps</li>
            <li> I ALWAYS buy Burberry Brit, however this is the first time I bought it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> , he&#x27;s very picky and doesn&#x27;t want to smell \\&quot;feminine\\&quot;, so I had to purchase another one!  </li>
            <li> Actually I compare with amzone price is more than $16.00.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real thing!</li>
            <li> but I had been using it prior to it being gifted to me.  </li>
            <li> Good product ,It has a soft scent lasts long.</li>
            <li> The scent is quite nice but it fades quickly and I have to re-apply a few times.  </li>
            <li> My hubby bought this for me as an early Christmas present &amp; I was kind of concerned because he ordered it and what if it was a knock off.</li>
            <li> Mostly, people say it is so fresh and clean, it is not strong, but you feel it the whole day.</li>
            <li> for fragrance, to me it smells mostly like clean soap, almonds, lime, and maybe a little bit of vanilla.</li>
            <li> , it is far too sweet to be called \\&quot;fresh\\&quot;, and it is not predominantly a floral.</li>
            <li> It can be a little strong when sprayed on directly, but I find that the intense scent fades fast and becomes a lingering warm and sultry scent.  </li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents (Addict by Christian Dior is my other favorite -</li>
            <li> Use it sparingly because it does last and can be kinda strong.</li>
            <li> I am bit skeptical ordering perfume online, but this turned out to be very good.  </li>
            <li> I got mine from Amazon, so it&#x27;s real.</li>
            <li> The sugar remains, but it does calm considerably.</li>
            <li> I got real concerned and took it to Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> and I should have, the stuff I got I do not believe is real</li>
            <li> It is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be deceived by the description, you are not getting the real thing.</li>
            <li> she absolutely loves it...</li>
            <li> So be careful, it might be safer to buy the perfume elsewhere , even if it costs more.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Burberry Brit is a gentle scent.</li>
            <li> and it hugs gently to your skin and doesn&#x27;t fill the whole room,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a pleasing fragrance</li>
            <li> that I have to use twice as much.</li>
            <li> If you want the real thing go to a brick and mortor store.</li>
            <li> She really enjoys it.</li>
            <li> it really has been said that I smell like berrys..so get that burberry.</li>
            <li> thanks.......</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It is intense, but gentle.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than a department store</li>
            <li> This scent is masculine and lovely at the same time.  </li>
            <li> and I thought this would be a nice gift at a little better price than perfumania or other retailers like Macys.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but it smells a little cheap and somebody didn&#x27;t put a lot of effort into making this perfume.</li>
            <li> , it arrived very carefully packaged, and they have a phenomenal price.  </li>
            <li> Out of all the Burberry perfumes, this scent is Classic, and the price on Amazon.com is very affordable - beats retail stores AND discount perfume stores.      </li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, it is warn but yet soft and seems to be long wearing.  </li>
            <li> I later received a full refund from Amazon without returning the product.]</li>
            <li> The wife and I was at JC Pennys looking at some new perfume for her, and she really like the smell of this one, but the price was alot, so I told her to wait to see if Amazon had it</li>
            <li> I really love the price I get with Amazon, nearly half what the department store charges.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this scent and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is an original product (only bought direct from amazon).    </li>
            <li> It is strong at first, but after an hour or so it then mellows down to a soft vanilla.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that this isn&#x27;t an everyday perfume because it is pretty strong, and can easily be overwhelming to the sense of smell if it is put on too heavily.</li>
            <li> The inside packaging included the bottle being wrapped with a picture of a girl, which isn&#x27;t normal.</li>
            <li> I purchased after smelling a sample on a plane trip and it smelled completely different right out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Cap doen&#x27;t fit nicely as compared to our previous purchases for the same item from other retailers.</li>
            <li> so it must have been brand new.</li>
            <li> Product just as described and perfectly new condition.  </li>
            <li> The packaging is all wrong, and most importantly the perfume isn&#x27;t burberry brit either.  </li>
            <li> As this is the policy, the product is much cheaper here than in stores, and i&#x27;m not ordering in a last minute rush for Christmas or something, it seems like a reasonable chance to take.</li>
            <li> Brit has been my favorite for the past four years.</li>
            <li> I have owned Burberry Brit before and was excited to get it for such a low price on amazon.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re getting the exact same product.</li>
            <li> Ordered this item today and then saw the 1-star reviews saying that it was fake, even when \\&quot;shipped and sold by Amazon.\\&quot; Just to be sure, I contacted Amazon who, aside from assuring me it would be authentic (which I will verify when I receive the order), told me that although I cannot ship them back the item/return the item, if it is not authentic/\\&quot;I don&#x27;t like it\\</li>
            <li> The nice thing about this fragrance is you don&#x27;t need a lot, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Light, not over-powering, and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> I love Burberry Brit,I bought mine at macy&#x27;s bout 2 yrs ago and still have half a bottle left.</li>
            <li> To my senses, it seems more floral than anything and not a musk type - my only qualm is that the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> After that, it is completely gone.</li>
            <li> To me they smell \\&quot;old lady\\&quot;ish.  </li>
            <li> I received thisroduct extremely fast, even before items I had shipped at the same time.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t find this too mature a scent or too young of a scent.</li>
            <li> I imagine a classy lady in her twenties/thirties wearing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do have a sensitive nose.</li>
            <li> It has a soft scent,</li>
            <li> classy</li>
            <li> The spout smells like body odor, and the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not read the one-star reviews because I already knew I loved Burberry Brit</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be able to return it because it&#x27;s considered \\&quot;hazardous\\&quot; by Amazon, and I don&#x27;t think they mean</li>
            <li> Really strong when just sprayed, but after a little while it gets soft, but at the same time not too soft.</li>
            <li> 3.3oz lasts for a long time, because it is very strong and needs to be sprayed no more than twice [not to make anyone dizzy].</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a snob, and I usually don&#x27;t go for Eau de Anything, but this is surprisingly lovely, and, quite simply, I&#x27;ll buy it again.  </li>
            <li> I receive more compliments when I wear this than any other of my other parfum.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend and I would purchase from this seller again in the future.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended and would buy again for this low price</li>
            <li> It is a sharp flowery vanilla + tangerine at first, then it changes to spicy and nutty, and finally - to soft flowery.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing worse than having to work with someone wearing gaggingly strong scent!</li>
            <li> The perfume bottle and the perfume were definitely fraudulant which is very upsetting since this was supposed to be a christmas present.</li>
            <li> spayed it and the sent went right away almost as if its watered down or eau de toilette</li>
            <li> Will shop here again for all my perfumes because I have no regrets.</li>
            <li> I really like this perfume&#x27;s scent, however it doesn\\&quot;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Spend a little extra money to get the full worth of your hard earned $$.</li>
            <li> It may be an old bottle of Burberry, but either way the scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all</li>
            <li> The lime and cardamom compliment each other unexpectedly well.</li>
            <li> So be warned, if you&#x27;re sensitive to migraines or headaches, just be aware that this may be irritating to you.</li>
            <li> all night long in a stinky and smokey bar I could still smell it on her after we left.  </li>
            <li> Also, the perfume smell wouldn&#x27;t last even couple hours which tells me that Amazon receives a different shipment from Manufacturers which is not the same as what Macys or any other retailers would receive for Fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was described as \\&quot;fresh green floral\\&quot; when it was released, but I do not find it particularly green</li>
            <li> This scent is subtle and unique; calms me down during a long day stressful day sitting in front of the computer at work.  </li>
            <li> Other than some additional Arabic letters on the bottom, everything was the same embossing, same quality etc.</li>
            <li> i just wonna hold her close do something strange to her....</li>
            <li> It stays for long time as well.</li>
            <li> I had decided to pay the extra for the eau de parfum because I was under the impression that you could use less and it would last longer, not the case.</li>
            <li> The only problem with this scent is that it only last a few hours on the skin (if you spray it on clothes, the smell stays forever!)</li>
            <li> , a few minutes later, It&#x27;s smelled sooo niceee, also It lasts for a long time, which I prayed at night, in the morning when I woke up, It&#x27;s still there.</li>
            <li> Its is total waste of your money.</li>
            <li> The price was not much lower, but the product seems to be inferior.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product is not returnable to Amazon, so I have now spent over $41 for a musky stench</li>
            <li> It took only a few days to receive it.</li>
            <li> Burberry Brit has notes of lime, icy pear, green almond, white peony, sugared almond, mahogany wood, amber, vanilla beans and tonka beans.</li>
            <li> Even at the end of a long day I can sniff my wrist and still catch a little of the Burberry Brit.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this bottle</li>
            <li> I never had a problem with Amazon with any other products I must say.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read other&#x27;s reviews before I ordered this product</li>
            <li> When I told seller, she answeres the wrong item&#x27;s price is just less $4.40 than the right one.</li>
            <li> Amazon should really stop selling fake stuff unless they want to be straight with consumers and tell them they are not getting the real deal...should have known for the price I guess :(</li>
            <li> It is, however, one of those scents that seems to blend with your body chemistry after a few moments of wear moreso than the average perfume</li>
            <li> it does not smell the same as my other Burberry Brit, I&#x27;m not happy I wasted my money on this!  </li>
            <li> I SPENT $40!!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when I bought it and tried it on (in addition to the sample from the mag), I began to smell like an old woman.  </li>
            <li> Been wearing this fragrance a few years now.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it everyday ever since.</li>
            <li> It got to my house a few days ago.</li>
            <li> Previously, I bought Burberry on eBay and it was counterfeit, but at least the seller issued a refund after I contacted eBay.</li>
            <li> My oder came a little late</li>
            <li> After I ordered the Burberry Brit, I read several reviews that said it was fake.</li>
            <li> Not only was the perfume packaging fake, but the bottle was also fake, and the scent was similar to men&#x27;s cologne.  </li>
            <li> not sure what is in the bottle</li>
            <li> i had a difficult time trying to locate any locally.</li>
            <li> I like to mix up my perfumes seasonally, but this one is used year round!</li>
            <li> I had bought the small bottle in dept. store and returned to buy on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Half the price that you would pay at any retail store!!</li>
            <li> Its subtle fragrance is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Not too overpowering, but not too dull.</li>
            <li> The bottle design looks weird and I could confirm my suspicions when I sprayed it and the smell lasted less than 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who prefers a subtle scent.</li>
            <li> After seeing a few reviews claiming this product was a fake, I was apprehensive ordering it.</li>
            <li> The perfume lasts for few hours, by the time I go to bed, the scent would still be there faintly, and I fall asleep to it.</li>
            <li> So dissapointed I spent that money, I will never buy fragrances online anymore, maybe it was bad luck.</li>
            <li> sellers who promote false advertising and believe they will be getting a \\&quot;one up\\&quot; on their customers deserve not to profit from deceptive business practices.</li>
            <li> Also you can buy it here rather than the expensive department stores.</li>
            <li> and since I opened it I noticed it was weirdly wrapped, like re-sealed and the front tag was falling apart.</li>
            <li> Read a lot of reviews saying this item was fake</li>
            <li> I received a fake Burberry Brit Eau De Parfum (3.3 oz) from Amazon LLC.  </li>
            <li> How do I know it was fake?  </li>
            <li> This seller delivered a fake perfume to me, some people may not realize that perfumes are fake</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, the bottle to begin with looks fake.</li>
            <li> As soon as i sprayed it i knew it was fake.</li>
            <li> However, this perfume gives me a horrible migraine every single time I use it.</li>
            <li> Expensive perfume is expensive for a reason!</li>
            <li> It is a MUST-HAVE year round!!!!!</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t really go wrong with it!</li>
            <li> SO MAD</li>
            <li> so I guess it isn&#x27;t so bad  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Too bad I can&#x27;t return it!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the worst Burberry perfume I ever got.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this fragrance, it is warn but yet soft and seems to be long wearing.  The service was speedy and the price was outsranding.</li>
            <li> I got mine from Amazon, so it&#x27;s real. I love this smell! The lime and cardamom compliment each other unexpectedly well. It&#x27;s not overly sweet, or flowery, but very warm and inviting.&lt;br /&gt;I truthfully wonder how the men&#x27;s cologne smells, because this could very easily  be a unisex scent.</li>
            <li> What can I say BUT AWESOME! many compliments when wearing this perfume. Also you can buy it here rather than the expensive department stores.So glad I took the chance of the product being authenic</li>
            <li> Great price for this product and it shipped very quickly. Overall, very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Great packaging, good price, with fast delivery. Would highly recommend and I would purchase from this seller again in the future. Thanks!  BTW: this Burberry Brit perfume was not fake.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance forever. I have been using it for 3 years, get so many compliments in the office, on the street, elevator...everywhere. Mostly, people say it is so fresh and clean, it is not strong, but you feel it the whole day.</li>
            <li> There are reviews that warn this is a counterfeit product, but I trusted Amazon. This was a true counterfeit of Burberry Brit Eau de Parfum. The inside packaging included the bottle being wrapped with a picture of a girl, which isn&#x27;t normal. The spout smells like body odor, and the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to last more than a few minutes. BIG MISTAKE that I didn&#x27;t see the note underneath the picture on Amazon&#x27;s page that this can&#x27;t be returned because it&#x27;s hazardous material. They have no problem mailing fragrance to customers, but can&#x27;t receive it in return? Can I sue Amazon for selling a counterfeit product in which they refuse returns? Time and money lost. Previously, I bought Burberry on eBay and it was counterfeit, but at least the seller issued a refund after I contacted eBay. Expensive perfume is expensive for a reason! [UPDATE: I later received a full refund from Amazon without returning the product.]</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a good deal.  The fragrance doesn&#x27;t even last an hour!!! Beware. GO ahead and get your perfume from the department stores.  THe fine print on this is that you can&#x27;t return it!!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not read the one-star reviews because I already knew I loved Burberry Brit and I figured why do I need to read about how people don&#x27;t like the scent. But if I had read the reviews I would have found out that the perfume is not legit. It may be an old bottle of Burberry, but either way the scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all and it doesn&#x27;t smell right to begin with. And as I have been reading after the fact, returning is not possible, even though it doesn&#x27;t say that anywhere on the ad.  So don&#x27;t buy this product. Honestly, don&#x27;t by perfume online unless it&#x27;s directly from Macy&#x27;s, Sephora etc. Just pay the big bucks for it.</li>
            <li> I was really satisfied with this product. it came in all the original packaging and smells just as wonderful as i remembered. I do a lot of Amazon shopping and this particular purchase was a great experience.</li>
            <li> Smells great!!  Ordered this because I smelled it on my friend and absolutely loved it and was impressed I smelled it in the beginning of the night on her and all night long in a stinky and smokey bar I could still smell it on her after we left.  Strong scent but not musky or too overly powerful, just right!!  Shipped on time and arrived sooner then predicted!</li>
            <li> I have been using this perfume for 4+ years. I would never use anything else. Product arrived quickly and the quality was as promised in the advertisement. I would definitely order from here again!</li>
            <li> Burberry Brit has notes of lime, icy pear, green almond, white peony, sugared almond, mahogany wood, amber, vanilla beans and tonka beans. It was described as \\&quot;fresh green floral\\&quot; when it was released, but I do not find it particularly green, it is far too sweet to be called \\&quot;fresh\\&quot;, and it is not predominantly a floral. The top is citrus with lots and lots of sugar. It is joined very quickly by candied pear and almond. I find the opening stages almost unbearably sweet when my wife wears it in summer months. She first tried it in colder weather and I didn&#x27;t find it quite so overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It soon warms up to a soft vanilla woods scent with a bit of amber; the citrus and fruit notes for the most part disappear with the top notes. The sugar remains, but it does calm considerably. I have seen this described as spicy, but I find it rather bland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a scent age appropriate across the spectrum.  If it were a movie, a thumbs up and an 8 out of 10</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom and she loved it, a great gift for any women because mostly all women want to smell good and this delivers that. I think it smells really good myself and so does my pops. Get it if your searching for a present for your mom because I honestly didn&#x27;t know what to get my moms I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s someone else out there in the same situation.</li>
            <li> The price is too good to be true for a reason!  The packaging is all wrong, and most importantly the perfume isn&#x27;t burberry brit either.  It&#x27;s the perfect scam, too, because the product is not returnable.  AMAZON.COM PLEASE BAN THIS VENDOR!</li>
            <li> I was so excited ordering my first fragrance online, thought the price was great and had smell this scent many times in stores so I decided to buy it. I got it 2 days later and since I opened it I noticed it was weirdly wrapped, like re-sealed and the front tag was falling apart. The bottle design looks weird and I could confirm my suspicions when I sprayed it and the smell lasted less than 20 minutes. After that, it is completely gone. I tried to send it back but you cannot since it is considered \\&quot;hazardous material\\&quot;. So dissapointed I spent that money, I will never buy fragrances online anymore, maybe it was bad luck. I never had a problem with Amazon with any other products I must say.</li>
            <li> The best perfume I have ever received as a gift.  That is why I keep this perfume on hand at all times!  Also, it could not have gotten here any quicker!  Thanks for the prompt shipment of this item Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful scent, and one of my overall favorites. All scents are a matter of opinion, but if you like warm amber and vanilla, you should try this! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This is a delightful perfume. Stays with you without being overpowering. I have received many compliments on its wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> I despise floral scents.  To me they smell \\&quot;old lady\\&quot;ish.  When I first got a whiff of Burberry Brit, it smelled warm and inviting.  It has notes of vanilla and musk and . . . is that butterscotch maybe?  It can be a little strong when sprayed on directly, but I find that the intense scent fades fast and becomes a lingering warm and sultry scent.  Even at the end of a long day I can sniff my wrist and still catch a little of the Burberry Brit.  A little goes a long way with this bottle - I have had the same bottle for a year!  Amazon shipped it quickly, it arrived very carefully packaged, and they have a phenomenal price.  I would recommend this perfume to anyone who prefers sultry and warm scented perfumes.</li>
            <li> Brit is one of my all time favorites!  I love perfume and have been consuming perfume for decades on a daily basis.  Brit has been my favorite for the past four years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a snob, and I usually don&#x27;t go for Eau de Anything, but this is surprisingly lovely, and, quite simply, I&#x27;ll buy it again.  Intriguing in an intriguing way, multi-layered, not too sweet, not too floral, not too unsubtle.  Nice.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume! It has this sweet and spicy smell that just makes me feel beautiful.</li>
            <li> After I ordered the Burberry Brit, I read several reviews that said it was fake. I got real concerned and took it to Macy&#x27;s. We compared both the packaging and the bottle in detail. Other than some additional Arabic letters on the bottom, everything was the same embossing, same quality etc. We of course also compared the smell and it was the same. This is NOT fake.</li>
            <li> Burberry Brit smells wonderful, like a spicy, sophisticated vanilla. However, this perfume gives me a horrible migraine every single time I use it. So be warned, if you&#x27;re sensitive to migraines or headaches, just be aware that this may be irritating to you.</li>
            <li> The item shipped is not \\&quot;3.4 fl.oz\\&quot; - the size of the item shipped is \\&quot;3.3 fl.oz\\&quot; - still a good deal I hope</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and it seems to be untampered with so that was a plus</li>
            <li> Gorgeous!!!! I purchased Burberry Brit as a gift for my mom and I find myself spraying it on everytime I&#x27;m at her house. I&#x27;ve been with her serveral times when she&#x27;s been stopped and asked what she was wearing or had someone comment on the wonderful scent!</li>
            <li> I like all the Burberry perfumes but this one.  I just couldn&#x27;t wear it..to strong for me.  It&#x27;s still sitting on my shelf 2 years later and the bottle is so cute I&#x27;ll keep it there.  I purchased after smelling a sample on a plane trip and it smelled completely different right out of the bottle.  Beware of those magazine samples...that&#x27;s happened to me before.</li>
            <li> I love this product and this was the cheapest i have seen it.  it was perfect when i got it!</li>
            <li> I have been using Burberry Brit for many years, and I love it!!  I would recommend it highly to every woman!!</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite scent and it arrived a week early!!!! It is a little strong, but it smells so good that I don&#x27;t care! (Maybe just spray it in the air and walk into it if it is just too strong for you...)</li>
            <li> Burberry makes a fine selection of colognes.  I used to wear Touch and switched to Brit which I like better.  It is a soft, clean scent and my favorite...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read other&#x27;s reviews before I ordered this product and I should have, the stuff I got I do not believe is real it does not smell the same as my other Burberry Brit, I&#x27;m not happy I wasted my money on this!  Amazon should really stop selling fake stuff unless they want to be straight with consumers and tell them they are not getting the real deal...should have known for the price I guess :(</li>
            <li> Read a lot of reviews saying this item was fake but it was just fine. I loved the smell and the packaging came in just like the one sold at the store for more! It is the real deal. Smell kind of faded during the end of the day but was pretty good overall. I recommend it..</li>
            <li> I received this item when it was promised and it was exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> THIS PERFUME SMELLS SO GOOD/YUMMY. and you&#x27;re not going to find it cheaper anywhere else. Plus I love that it&#x27;s parfum, not eau de toillete, because it lasts longer...it&#x27;s wayyy worth it.  If you like this scent, buy it here.</li>
            <li> The perfume is perfect. I compare it to Burberry perfume from the branch , It was the same. The scent and quality. I recomend it to eveyone.</li>
            <li> Since I began wearing Burberry Brit my daughter always asked me what I was wearing and she liked it so I&#x27;ve purchased it for her also.  Now we both smell great.</li>
            <li> I love that product, it is the best gift for a woman who knows of good perfumes and knows that everyone will notice that this a Burberry.     (The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)</li>
            <li> I purchased this product assuming that the title was accurate and that it was in fact eau de parfum.  However, upon receipt it was toilette spray -- there is quite a difference between the two.  Don&#x27;t be deceived by the description, you are not getting the real thing.</li>
            <li> After seeing a few reviews claiming this product was a fake, I was apprehensive ordering it. But when I got the perfume 2 days after my order, I was very pleased to know it was NOT a fake. I even compared it to the samples I got in store. Great price, great scent!</li>
            <li> Smelled this perfume as a sample in a magazine and liked it.  Unfortunately, when I bought it and tried it on (in addition to the sample from the mag), I began to smell like an old woman.  Too bad I can&#x27;t return it!</li>
            <li> My wife likes this perfume a lot, so it goes without saying I have to agree with the wife. Great product at a nice price.</li>
            <li> I love Burberry Brit,I bought mine at macy&#x27;s bout 2 yrs ago and still have half a bottle left.Use it sparingly because it does last and can be kinda strong.But whenever I go out wearing it 98% of the time ppl stop me and ask what I&#x27;m wearing because its incredible!! *2 thumbs up* :)</li>
            <li> Been wearing this fragrance a few years now. It&#x27;s my favorite and I feel like there isn&#x27;t anything like it out there. I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments :)</li>
            <li> I ordedred this perfume Burberry Brit By Burberry For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 3.3 Ounces&lt;br /&gt;But to my surprize whenever my wife would use this perume its fragrance will just vanish in two hours. This is the worst Burberry perfume I ever got.I think its always better to spend some extra amount on Genuine perfumes at shopping malls rather then buying FAKE/DUPLICATE perfumes from vendors at Amazon.com. Its is total waste of your money.</li>
            <li> I have been buying Burberry Brit for about 2 years- I get tons of compliments</li>
            <li> Came very quickly! Giving as a gift, so very glad for the timely delivery! Received as described!</li>
            <li> Bought it a a Christmas gift for my fiance...she absolutely loves it...she&#x27;s getting wonderful comments from her friends and co-workers..i love it...every time i smell it from her i just wonna hold her close do something strange to her....mmhhh BUY IT&lt; BUY IT!!!!!!</li>
            <li> If you want the aroma to last all day and until you take a shower, this perfume is for you.  It is a very light to medium scent and I receive many compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells absolutely good.  I am a big fan of designer frangrances, and this tops them all. I love how it smells on me, its absolutely mouth watering.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. It makes me feel like its spring time when it&#x27;s -3 and there is now on the ground.  It&#x27;s just such a light and lovely scent to wear to work, church, and a picnic type of event. The only problem with this scent is that it only last a few hours on the skin (if you spray it on clothes, the smell stays forever!) before the smell dissipates.</li>
            <li> I received thisroduct extremely fast, even before items I had shipped at the same time. It smells light and clean, with fruity smells also.....would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> O MG  I love this scent  It is perfect for teens  I tested it at my cousins house and i loved it</li>
            <li> Really strong when just sprayed, but after a little while it gets soft, but at the same time not too soft. The perfume lasts for few hours, by the time I go to bed, the scent would still be there faintly, and I fall asleep to it. It is fresh and strong at first, then soft and sweet. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This is first time I am using Burberry and it has superb fragrance. It stays for long time as well.</li>
            <li> I really like this perfume&#x27;s scent, however it doesn\\&quot;t last very long. Went with the parfum as opposed to the eu de toilette thinking it would be better.</li>
            <li> The wife and I was at JC Pennys looking at some new perfume for her, and she really like the smell of this one, but the price was alot, so I told her to wait to see if Amazon had it, they did for a price alot cheaper then JC Pennys so I bought it.</li>
            <li> Burberry Brit is one of my favorites. It has a deep warm scent with a flowery finish. It is a sharp flowery vanilla + tangerine at first, then it changes to spicy and nutty, and finally - to soft flowery. I find those smells to be a great combination, because they fit almost any event - work or going out. I also got a lot of compliments on this perfume. I recommend Burberry Brit if you like aromatic sweeter scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 3.3oz lasts for a long time, because it is very strong and needs to be sprayed no more than twice [not to make anyone dizzy].</li>
            <li> Got a free sample vial. Every time I wore it, I received beautiful compliments.  Even my hubby who has perfume favorites, felt this was extraordinary!</li>
            <li> This perfume is absolutely amazing. i was taking a risk since I&#x27;ve never smelled it before, but it was well worth it! :)</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this!  The nice thing about this fragrance is you don&#x27;t need a lot, a little goes a long way.  So well worth the price.</li>
            <li> What a fantastic scent. It could be classified as a warm or cool scent - it blends especially well with my vanilla scented lotions. To my senses, it seems more floral than anything and not a musk type - my only qualm is that the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long. It is, however, one of those scents that seems to blend with your body chemistry after a few moments of wear moreso than the average perfume&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you enjoy Light Blue by Dolce &amp; Gabbana, or Very Irresistible by Givenchy, you&#x27;ll most likely love this scent.</li>
            <li> I received a fake Burberry Brit Eau De Parfum (3.3 oz) from Amazon LLC.  How do I know it was fake?  I went to a brick and mortar store that sells Burberry Brit, and they showed me all the details that were different between the authentic perfume and the one that I purchased.  Not only was the perfume packaging fake, but the bottle was also fake, and the scent was similar to men&#x27;s cologne.  So be careful, it might be safer to buy the perfume elsewhere , even if it costs more.  And when you do receive your order, don&#x27;t hesitate to take it into a store to compare it with an authentic one.</li>
            <li> I bought this on Amazon back in January and I&#x27;ve been using it everyday ever since. I have already used 1/4 of the bottle! One spray is good to go. It is strong at first, but after an hour or so it then mellows down to a soft vanilla. I think it smells really good! I believe it is a winter scent more than a summer scent. One of my favorites! Go Burberry! :) Super fast shipping. When it came it was wrapped with bubble wrap, the perfume box seal was opened, but the first spray took a couple pumps so it must have been brand new. In the end, it didn&#x27;t matter, I got what I ordered in good condition, so it was all good!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this scent the first time I tried it, but the $80+ price tag was out of my range. How wonderful to find the exact same item at amazon for almost half the cost.  It arrived fast, in perfect condition and I couldnt be happier. It has the touch of citrus I love and the spice to make it a grown up scent for sure.</li>
            <li> not sure what is in the bottle but there is a smell that last 30 minutes only and not the perfume,I have bought before and  it is great bought from Macys.Did not keep packaging as was excited  and now stuck with it and out 46.03</li>
            <li> This is an original product (only bought direct from amazon).    I really love this perfum.</li>
            <li> This is my signature parfum. I just can&#x27;t be without it.  I receive more compliments when I wear this than any other of my other parfum.  When I need some attention I always reach for this parfum bottle.  In fact, I keep it in my purse.  Love, Love, Love this parfum!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have had numerous compliments from both men and women alike with this fragrance, I first purchased it from a department store and loved it! I really love the price I get with Amazon, nearly half what the department store charges. This is a fresh, clean scent and lasts all day, I rarely have to use more than my morning dose! I highly recommend this scent and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I ALWAYS buy Burberry Brit, however this is the first time I bought it on Amazon.  I was so excited because it was so much cheaper on Amazon than it is anywhere else...well there&#x27;s a reason...the perfume I received did NOT smell like Burberry Brit at all and I&#x27;m pretty sure it was tampered with because it doesn&#x27;t smell like any perfume I&#x27;ve ever used.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> she loves it i will tell people about it that is the best stuff in the world no other like it</li>
            <li> Been wanting this scent for quite some time and finally found a good price here.  I love seeing the bottle in my bathroom.  So cute!</li>
            <li> This product was delivered with my Clinique Happy Perfume together. Again, they both met my expectations and will buy them again when I need them.</li>
            <li> It smells great and at a great price.  A great gift for any woman.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume, have been wearing it for years and was sold for a great price. Perfect size as well.</li>
            <li> only buerberry  perfume that last longer and smells  royal.&lt;br /&gt; I tried all the burberry &#x27;s ..but i must say this one is the only that i would recommend for women.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells good but some of the other ones from burberry are far better than this one. Try the Brit Sheer.</li>
            <li> On my skin, this reminds me of &#x27;80&#x27;s pop sensation Debbie Gibson&#x27;s Electric Youth. It&#x27;s not bad, but it smells a little cheap and somebody didn&#x27;t put a lot of effort into making this perfume. I think that I will stick to my Chanel Cuir de Russie and Frapin 1920.</li>
            <li> Product just as described and perfectly new condition.  This scent is subtle and unique; calms me down during a long day stressful day sitting in front of the computer at work.  The scent sticks if you spray it on your clothes, which BTW smells just like walking in to the Burberry retail store.  This is one of my favorite scents (Addict by Christian Dior is my other favorite - I get A LOT of compliments on this one!).      This is my second time buying this scent from Amazon.com.  I gave the first bottle to my fiance who LOVED it, he&#x27;s very picky and doesn&#x27;t want to smell \\&quot;feminine\\&quot;, so I had to purchase another one!  Out of all the Burberry perfumes, this scent is Classic, and the price on Amazon.com is very affordable - beats retail stores AND discount perfume stores.      You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This seller delivered a fake perfume to me, some people may not realize that perfumes are fake but I could tell the minute I opened the packaging. The perfume bottle and the perfume were definitely fraudulant which is very upsetting since this was supposed to be a christmas present. sellers who promote false advertising and believe they will be getting a \\&quot;one up\\&quot; on their customers deserve not to profit from deceptive business practices.

            <li> I didn&#x27;t love this the first time I smelled it, but now I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burberry Brit is a gentle scent. It&#x27;s not a pow, in your face scent and it hugs gently to your skin and doesn&#x27;t fill the whole room, so it&#x27;s perfect for wearing during the day or in the office. It&#x27;s also not an offending scent by any means so I find it to be the perfect scent to wear to work if you&#x27;re in an office setting and don&#x27;t want to offend anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for fragrance, to me it smells mostly like clean soap, almonds, lime, and maybe a little bit of vanilla. It&#x27;s a warm smell, but not overly sweet. It also doesn&#x27;t smell strongly of alcohol, which some perfumes do. I&#x27;m in my mid twenties and I don&#x27;t find this too mature a scent or too young of a scent. I imagine a classy lady in her twenties/thirties wearing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try. It&#x27;s really a pleasing fragrance and you can&#x27;t really go wrong with it!</li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon for providing a great price (plus free shipping) on this very lovely Burberry scent. Saved over $30.00 by purchasing here instead of retail store.</li>
            <li> This fullsize bottle of Burberry Brit is a nice mix of sugar cookies and spice. The Parfum is light and wafts as you walk by. Not overpowering, just leaves you wanting for more.</li>
            <li> When I first smelled it on the bottle, I thought It&#x27;s too sweet, but then I gave It a try by spraying on my wrist, and hair, a few minutes later, It&#x27;s smelled sooo niceee, also It lasts for a long time, which I prayed at night, in the morning when I woke up, It&#x27;s still there. Love it.</li>
            <li> Good product ,It has a soft scent lasts long. Great price for this item .can be worn all day or at special occasions. This is the perfect scent for me.</li>
            <li> I am 90% sure that it is not fake, it has sweet smell and all that; but for some reason I felt that this is not close to the very sweet smell of burberry brit I sampled at the mall...But that could just be my ability to not match up the smell..I do like the sweet smell of this fragrance</li>
            <li> The scent is quite nice but it fades quickly and I have to re-apply a few times.  It sells at a local department store for twice the price so I guess it isn&#x27;t so bad  that I have to use twice as much.</li>
            <li> Product does not contain burberry brit perfume. If you want the real thing go to a brick and mortor store.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this is original or if it is it&#x27;s very old. Does not smell like the real stuff more importantly it fades in minutes I&#x27;ve been using this purfume for many years and this isn&#x27;t worth the money buy from a department store!Very Disapointed!</li>
            <li> This is great smelling perfume that adds a bit of sophistication to her wardrobe. I bought this for my girl friend because it suits her business attire. She really enjoys it. Keep in mind that this isn&#x27;t an everyday perfume because it is pretty strong, and can easily be overwhelming to the sense of smell if it is put on too heavily. Overall it is a great smelling perfume.</li>
            <li> I had decided to pay the extra for the eau de parfum because I was under the impression that you could use less and it would last longer, not the case. Still has a good smell but I will no longer pay the up charge for the eau de parfum.</li>
            <li> My hubby bought this for me as an early Christmas present &amp; I was kind of concerned because he ordered it and what if it was a knock off. Have to say he knew what he was doing. The smell is great &amp; lasts for hour &amp; hours. Will shop here again for all my perfumes because I have no regrets. Amazing! So happy that I got the actual product, and a VERY good price...Yay for me :D</li>
            <li> lots of folks love this scent. it really has been said that I smell like berrys..so get that burberry. I never imagined that scent. it is a keeper</li>
            <li> My favorite scent. Very mellow and clean. Nice mix of vanilla and citrus that works well for day or night. I always get compliments when I wear this perfume. Not overpowering at all. I&#x27;ve also purchased Burberry Brit Sheer and regular Burberry perfume before and this is by far the best one.</li>
            <li> Burberry Brit is already my parfum of choice.....i had a difficult time trying to locate any locally. your quick and timely delivery was spot on ....thanks.......amazon is the best site ever......i can purchase just about anything or order books for my kindle.....awsome site.....</li>
            <li> Arrived on time for her Bday and she loves this product. Says she is very happy that I sent it to her.</li>
            <li> I ordered Burberry Brit but I received Burberry by burberry for women. I didn&#x27;t recognize it and sent to my cousin in Vietnam as a gift and could not get back to US to return. When I told seller, she answeres the wrong item&#x27;s price is just less $4.40 than the right one. Actually I compare with amzone price is more than $16.00. I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife. She has always used this perfume and I thought this would be a nice gift at a little better price than perfumania or other retailers like Macys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, the bottle to begin with looks fake. Cap doen&#x27;t fit nicely as compared to our previous purchases for the same item from other retailers. The price was not much lower, but the product seems to be inferior. Also, the perfume smell wouldn&#x27;t last even couple hours which tells me that Amazon receives a different shipment from Manufacturers which is not the same as what Macys or any other retailers would receive for Fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never buy perfumes from Amazon in future. Spend a little extra money to get the full worth of your hard earned $$.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS FOR OUR DAUGHTER.  WE GAVE HER ONE LAST YEAR AND SHE LOVED IT.  AGAIN - A REPEAT CHRISTMAS GIFT.</li>
            <li> I have owned Burberry Brit before and was excited to get it for such a low price on amazon. It got to my house a few days ago. I opened it up-cheap packaging. As soon as i sprayed it i knew it was fake. SO MAD I SPENT $40!!! PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS!</li>
            <li> This perfume is perfect for all occasions and remains with you for a long time.  I would recommend this to anyone who prefers a subtle scent.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.Great price.Nice fragrance.I will buy perfume in smaller bottles from now on.After being open for awhile ,fragrance changed ,this does not happen with all perfume,but did for me.</li>
            <li> I am bit skeptical ordering perfume online, but this turned out to be very good.  Will order again.  Definitely will.</li>
            <li> smell did not last. spayed it and the sent went right away almost as if its watered down or eau de toilette</li>
            <li> This scent is masculine and lovely at the same time.  Every time I wear it, one of the men I work with comments how nice I smell and said the only scent better on a woman would be bacon.  I am pretty sure that is a compliment :)  I like to mix up my perfumes seasonally, but this one is used year round!</li>
            <li> Every now and then you find a scent that resonates with your personality and just smells \\&quot;right\\&quot;. For me, \\&quot;Brit\\&quot; is one of those. It is a light oriental, underlined with warm, sweet notes (vanilla, almond). It is intense, but gentle. I find for daywear that the Eau de Toilette is best - the scent lingers, but is never overpowering. There&#x27;s nothing worse than having to work with someone wearing gaggingly strong scent! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I got coco chanel at a cruise that I went to and I also try this one.  I love it and I loved more the price at amazon.</li>
            <li> I work in health care where perfumes can trigger multiple symptoms, including asthma. No complaints since I started using this. Lots of compliments rather.</li>
            <li> My most favorite scent in the world wear it every day all day! The scent stays with you all day..</li>
            <li> Half the price that you would pay at any retail store!! Cant beat this price, even overstock is more!! Good Deal!!</li>
            <li> I always buy my Burberry perfume from amazon. Much cheaper than a department store and you&#x27;re getting the exact same product. Highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burberry Brit is my go-to scent. I always get compliments on it. Everyone says the same: the smell is beautiful without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> I had bought the small bottle in dept. store and returned to buy on Amazon.  I am more than satisfied with product and with price.</li>
            <li> girlfriend loves this stuff and says it is a great deal at that price, so I would have to recommend this as a good buy.</li>
            <li> When I asked a guy friend of mine what perfume I should get, he named this one. I bought it the same day and received it very quickly! It smells amazing! Has just the right scent. Definitely should try it. My mom even likes it!</li>
            <li> I just love this perfume.  Light, not over-powering, and long lasting.  Everyone asks me \\&quot;What is that perfume your wearing?\\&quot; They all love the scent.</li>
            <li> ITS BEEN A WHILE SINCE I HAD PERFUME THAT MADE ME FEEL SO DELICIOUS AND SEXY WHEN I WEAR IT; THANK YOU BURBERRY</li>
            <li> order came quite quickly, and came as a kit with body wash and lotion which I wasn&#x27;t expecting. my girlfriend loved it</li>
            <li> I have purchased a few bottles of this perfume and you cannot go wrong, it&#x27;s one of the best and most favorite scents I wear.  Not too overpowering, but not too dull.</li>
            <li> seems to be the real deal and a great price!&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;re considering this, it was a great buy for me!</li>
            <li> Its the only perfume I can handle my Wife wearing. Its subtle fragrance is not overwhelming. I do have a sensitive nose.</li>
            <li> The product was properly packed and arrived on time. I really liked that I got the product as I expected, I love Burberry fragances.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product! You won&#x27;t be able to return it because it&#x27;s considered \\&quot;hazardous\\&quot; by Amazon, and I don&#x27;t think they mean the smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this perfume as a gift for my daughter, who loves Burberry Brit, but when she opened the box and sprayed some on her wrist, she knew immediately that this is not the same fragrance she has used for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is not returnable to Amazon, so I have now spent over $41 for a musky stench [[ASIN:B000C1UBBU Burberry Brit By Burberry For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 3.3 Ounces]]perfume she won&#x27;t ever use. This is the last time I&#x27;ll buy a fragrance from Amazon, that&#x27;s for sure!</li>

            <li> Gift for my daughter, she loves it. It took only a few days to receive it. I plsn to purchase more from thiss site</li>
            <li> This was a gift but I had been using it prior to it being gifted to me.  I love the vanilla scent!</li>
            <li> Perfect adrogynistic scent!  for anyone wanting to tantalize both sexes!  This is my perfect frangrance, although summer is coming still a great scent</li>
            <li> This is such a great fragrance.  It is crisp and clean without being overly floral or sweet.  It is a great go to scent for any occassion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all my fiancé wears. She loved it. When she opened the package she could not believe that I knew that&#x27;s what she wanted.</li>
            <li> This is such a beautiful scent! Not flowery, not powdery, not musky....just fresh, crisp and clean. Smells unisex to me. It is a MUST-HAVE year round!!!!! I adore it!!! Pricey of course, but worth it.</li>

            <li> In my huge collection of perfumes this is my go to winter scent. It&#x27;s warm and spicy and has a feeling of understated class and elegance.</li>
            <li> Ordered this item today and then saw the 1-star reviews saying that it was fake, even when \\&quot;shipped and sold by Amazon.\\&quot; Just to be sure, I contacted Amazon who, aside from assuring me it would be authentic (which I will verify when I receive the order), told me that although I cannot ship them back the item/return the item, if it is not authentic/\\&quot;I don&#x27;t like it\\&quot; they will issue me a full refund. As this is the policy, the product is much cheaper here than in stores, and i&#x27;m not ordering in a last minute rush for Christmas or something, it seems like a reasonable chance to take.</li>
            <li> I am always happy to find large bottle of this fragrance as it has been my favorite for many years!</li>
            <li> This is one of my girlfriends favorite scents.  It smells very nice and I would recommend this to a female or to a male as a gift!</li>
