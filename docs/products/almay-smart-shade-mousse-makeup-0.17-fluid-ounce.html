            <li>and I&#x27;m happy again.</li>
            <li>Happy with this product</li>
            <li>I think this is a great product.  </li>
            <li>so I am happy with this.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>Very nice product.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look smooth and the color turned out perfect.</li>
            <li>This makeup blends well and feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li>I am fairly fair, but used the light/medium and the color looks good.  </li>
            <li>It feels good to my skin.  </li>
            <li>This product is quick to apply which is perfect for me!  </li>
            <li>Just a note to any ladies reading this, I, fortunately, have a very good skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>It came perfectly packaged, on time and just the right color.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I was always taught to moisturize my face before applying foundation - not primers, nothing fancy, just some kind of moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>So light it does not even feel like I have foundation on, yet provides very nice coverage all day.</li>
            <li>I also liked the mousse consistency, because it blends much better than liquid but also doesn&#x27;t look powdery.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite foundation ever.</li>
            <li>This shipped fast and in great condition.</li>
            <li>I have used the liquid product and have found that although the coverage is sheer, it does blend in perfectly with my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I love almay.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I recommend Lumene Time Freeze CC Cream, Medium as a better choice</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s interesting how marketing works.</li>
            <li>I love the mousse consistency</li>
            <li>so my allergies don&#x27;t kick up, and I love the finish.  </li>
            <li>I will try the medium shade to see if it will work better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I was using something from Sephora before that cost A LOT more</li>
            <li>I wanted to order it on Amazon Prime which I love love love, but will drive to Target to save $5.</li>
            <li>Love how it looks so bland and yet blends perfectly with one&#x27;s skin tone.</li>
            <li>Love Almay, love hypoallergenic, love the Smart Shade, love the coverage.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and it doesn&#x27;t feel (or look)</li>
            <li>, I love the exact color match, love the coverage, love that it&#x27;s fragrance free</li>
            <li>:  I didn&#x27;t believe for one second that it would or could work, but it did, and it&#x27;s beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Almay is a super product!  </li>
            <li>Coverage good, looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>I like how smoothly and lightly this make up applies.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and stays all day.</li>
            <li>I have light skin</li>
            <li>I bought the light shade so this review is for that, not the light-medium</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>It is light coverage that goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I dont wear alot of makeup, but love how this blends to the right color.</li>
            <li>I am surprised at the mixed reviews; this is excellent make up at a bargain price</li>
            <li>I LOVE smart shade.</li>
            <li>This makeup managed to match it very well using the light medium.  </li>
            <li>With the acne version, I use Sand as my color--which is one of the darkest that Almay offers--but it looks pasty on my golden skin tone.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need very much.</li>
            <li>I tried bare minerals and other mineral powders, but the Almay mousse is by far the best product.  </li>
            <li>If you want  or need more coverage than Nearly Naked provides, you may find that this Mousee works for you.</li>
            <li>The color really does match to your skin color!</li>
            <li>, the finish is soft and not matte, but more satiny or natural.  </li>
            <li>I have spent so many years searching for a concealer that would match my skin tone, but none of them ever came out quite right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a combination of all three makeups I use, but the Almay mousse works great for my face and upper eye lids which are also on the dark side.</li>
            <li>The color was great - as all smart shades are for me but the coverage was weak.</li>
            <li>I use a very basic unscented lotion, I have sensitive skin, so I use only Cetaphil lotion on my face, let it sink in for a minute, then this, and what I end up with is a very natural look, but better than a tinted moisturizer, but not a mask like ordinary foundation, and it matches my skin perfectly (light-neutral is my skin color).  </li>
            <li>I will try to remember to use some oil absorbing rice powder sheets tomorrow to see if that helps.</li>
            <li>I really like this foundation a lot.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of the foundation to get coverage so beware of putting on too much.</li>
            <li>I want a foundation that is EXTREMELY sheer and light.</li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t need coverage.</li>
            <li>I get compliments all the time on how rested I look and how vibrant my skin is.  </li>
            <li>I highly suggest getting something that is made for your shade of skin.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>My daughter uses this make up and since we live in a country that doesn&#x27;t sell it, we ordered online.  </li>
            <li>Just very natural.  </li>
            <li>By the time I&#x27;m done applying my makeup (5 minutes) and leaving to go to work, the makeup soaks in (that&#x27;s the concealing I&#x27;m talking about) and it all looks extremely natural.  </li>
            <li>I guess I was lured to buy this foundation because of the word &amp;#34;mousse&amp;#34;, which suggested to me a foundation which would be nearly invisible.</li>
            <li>It really did blend to match my skin tone, and covered up any red spots on my face.</li>
            <li>Oh, and one last thing, my face also feels soft.  </li>
            <li>It definitely goes on effortlessy and blends completely to your skin color.</li>
            <li>(really this CC has foundation-like coverage with SPF and other extras)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually pretty plain.</li>
            <li>This Almay Smart Shade Mousse is not NEARLY as light and sheer as I need.</li>

            <li> This Almay Smart Shade Mousse is not NEARLY as light and sheer as I need.</li>
            <li> It does have a natural looking coverage like other reviews mention and matched my skin tone well.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so sensitive that Almay is one of the few products that done cause allergic reactions.</li>
            <li> This product is very creamy and thick.</li>
            <li> As long as they continue making this stuff, I will continue buying it!</li>
            <li> The only little problem is putting the cover back on.</li>
            <li> For those who complain that it shows all the dry skin on their face, of course it does, like any foundation will, if you have dry skin or dry patches.  </li>
            <li> , so dry patches showing up through foundation has never been a problem for me.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for over 6 weeks and have no new clogged pores or breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of this makeup that claims to magically match your skin color.</li>
            <li> I sent it back after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I did not use any other products besides maybelline stay matte powder.</li>
            <li> Does have a weird smell to it (only little draw back), but I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Iw ill certainly be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to use any undereye concealer, and I do have some dark circles -</li>
            <li> I bought this for 11.39 at Target--that is over 5 dollars less than it costs on Amazon today.  </li>
            <li> and I did end up greasy with a little bit of breakout by the end of the work day.  </li>
            <li> and this was a little lacking.</li>
            <li> But I put a little on my face and blended it with my finger</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge make up person.</li>
            <li> Since I have very dark circles under my eyes (bags too), I also use smachbox primer, and Kat Von D&#x27;s tattoo concealer (I&#x27;m serious when I say I have dark circles under my eyes) from Saphora.  </li>
            <li> It gives very little coverage</li>
            <li> Doesnt make you look all fake.</li>
            <li> It looked terrible and uneven.  </li>
            <li> I was looking forward to trying the mousse but was afraid to use it because of the terrible odor.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very satisfied!!! Excellent product!!! Would order this again.</li>
            <li> It does have a natural looking coverage like other reviews mention and matched my skin tone well.  With the acne version, I use Sand as my color--which is one of the darkest that Almay offers--but it looks pasty on my golden skin tone. This makeup managed to match it very well using the light medium.  However, I have acne prone skin and I did end up greasy with a little bit of breakout by the end of the work day.  I will try to remember to use some oil absorbing rice powder sheets tomorrow to see if that helps.</li>
            <li> Perfect make up... I love it</li>
            <li> Coverage good, looks very natural.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I really like this foundation a lot. It makes my skin look smooth and the color turned out perfect. I used a brush to apply the foundation. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of the foundation to get coverage so beware of putting on too much. I buffed the color into my skin with the brush until blended. I did not use any other products besides maybelline stay matte powder.</li>
            <li> This is the best product EVER!  I tried bare minerals and other mineral powders, but the Almay mousse is by far the best product.  I&#x27;m not a huge make up person. I&#x27;m actually pretty plain. This product is quick to apply which is perfect for me!  Three finger dots on each cheek, one on the nose and chin, and two on each upper eye lid.  Since I have very dark circles under my eyes (bags too), I also use smachbox primer, and Kat Von D&#x27;s tattoo concealer (I&#x27;m serious when I say I have dark circles under my eyes) from Saphora.  That&#x27;s it!  I get compliments all the time on how rested I look and how vibrant my skin is.  It&#x27;s a combination of all three makeups I use, but the Almay mousse works great for my face and upper eye lids which are also on the dark side. By the time I&#x27;m done applying my makeup (5 minutes) and leaving to go to work, the makeup soaks in (that&#x27;s the concealing I&#x27;m talking about) and it all looks extremely natural.  Oh, and one last thing, my face also feels soft.  I use the light-medium.</li>
            <li> Just decided to order this on a whim to try it out and, since it was Almay, I knew I wouldn&#x27;t suffer consequences (i.e. rashes, breakouts, etc.).  I like how smoothly and lightly this make up applies.  Does have a weird smell to it (only little draw back), but I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite foundation ever. It goes on easy and it doesn&#x27;t feel (or look) like you have a caked face.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! I dont wear alot of makeup, but love how this blends to the right color. Doesnt make you look all fake. Will buy again!!</li>
            <li> This shipped fast and in great condition. It is like a facial mousse. Love how it looks so bland and yet blends perfectly with one&#x27;s skin tone. My skin is so sensitive that Almay is one of the few products that done cause allergic reactions. Iw ill certainly be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> I have used the liquid product and have found that although the coverage is sheer, it does blend in perfectly with my skin tone.  I was looking forward to trying the mousse but was afraid to use it because of the terrible odor.</li>
            <li> Almay is a super product!  Wonderful coverage and color.  It definitely goes on effortlessy and blends completely to your skin color.</li>
            <li> I LOVE smart shade. I love almay. I wanted to love this, but I don&#x27;t. I sent it back after a few uses. I like medium coverage and this was a little lacking. The color was great - as all smart shades are for me but the coverage was weak. I could layer I know but why use twice the product when there are ones out there you don&#x27;t need to. I recommend Lumene Time Freeze CC Cream, Medium as a better choice (really this CC has foundation-like coverage with SPF and other extras)</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this make up and since we live in a country that doesn&#x27;t sell it, we ordered online.  It came perfectly packaged, on time and just the right color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to sun-screen. This make-up has no sun-screen, which is a blessing for me. It goes on smoothly and stays all day. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product AT ALL. I guess I was lured to buy this foundation because of the word &amp;#34;mousse&amp;#34;, which suggested to me a foundation which would be nearly invisible. It&#x27;s interesting how marketing works. I want a foundation that is EXTREMELY sheer and light. I had been buying Almay Nearly Naked for years and I was very happy with that. I don&#x27;t know why I strayed off the path. This Almay Smart Shade Mousse is not NEARLY as light and sheer as I need. No matter how tiny a bit I use, it still looks cakey and seems to collect in lines. I went back to Almay Nearly Naked and I&#x27;m happy again. Just a note to any ladies reading this, I, fortunately, have a very good skin so I really don&#x27;t need coverage. If you want  or need more coverage than Nearly Naked provides, you may find that this Mousee works for you.</li>
            <li> Love it! Blends perfectly and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> for my daughter, easier to blend she loves it</li>
            <li> I like Almay, but felt I was pushing my luck ordering an unfamiliar product online.  I&#x27;m very pleased. This makeup blends well and feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> Happy with this product</li>
            <li> Love Almay, love hypoallergenic, love the Smart Shade, love the coverage.</li>
            <li> This makeup DOES NOT do what it says!!! I have light skin and I have the lightest option, and it was ORANGE on my skin!  It looked terrible and uneven.  I highly suggest getting something that is made for your shade of skin.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product.  So light it does not even feel like I have foundation on, yet provides very nice coverage all day.</li>
            <li> I have spent so many years searching for a concealer that would match my skin tone, but none of them ever came out quite right. I was very skeptical of this makeup that claims to magically match your skin color. I thought it looked especially dubious when I opened the container and saw that the makeup is actually white.  But I put a little on my face and blended it with my finger and it was perfect!  It really did blend to match my skin tone, and covered up any red spots on my face. I also liked the mousse consistency, because it blends much better than liquid but also doesn&#x27;t look powdery. As long as they continue making this stuff, I will continue buying it!</li>
            <li> I bought the light shade so this review is for that, not the light-medium:  I didn&#x27;t believe for one second that it would or could work, but it did, and it&#x27;s beautiful.  I have some redness on my cheeks but it covers it well, the finish is soft and not matte, but more satiny or natural.  Not oily or shiny either.  Just very natural.  For those who complain that it shows all the dry skin on their face, of course it does, like any foundation will, if you have dry skin or dry patches.  I was always taught to moisturize my face before applying foundation - not primers, nothing fancy, just some kind of moisturizer.  It only makes sense.  And that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve always done, so dry patches showing up through foundation has never been a problem for me.  I use a very basic unscented lotion, I have sensitive skin, so I use only Cetaphil lotion on my face, let it sink in for a minute, then this, and what I end up with is a very natural look, but better than a tinted moisturizer, but not a mask like ordinary foundation, and it matches my skin perfectly (light-neutral is my skin color).  I don&#x27;t even have to use any undereye concealer, and I do have some dark circles - this make up covers so well, it covers the circles.  I love the mousse consistency, I love the exact color match, love the coverage, love that it&#x27;s fragrance free so my allergies don&#x27;t kick up, and I love the finish.  I am surprised at the mixed reviews; this is excellent make up at a bargain price and I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Very good make up.  The only little problem is putting the cover back on.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have used this foundation in the tube.  And the pigment would separate from the cream.  I have been using this product for one week.  I bought it at a drugstore and not through Amazon.  It gives very little coverage and I need something to cover my redness.  I will try the medium shade to see if it will work better.</li>
            <li> This product is very creamy and thick. Goes on smooth. You don&#x27;t need very much. The color really does match to your skin color! Very nice product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for 11.39 at Target--that is over 5 dollars less than it costs on Amazon today.  I love this product.  It is light coverage that goes on smoothly.  I am fairly fair, but used the light/medium and the color looks good.  It feels good to my skin.  I have used it for over 6 weeks and have no new clogged pores or breakouts.  I was using something from Sephora before that cost A LOT more so I am happy with this.  I wanted to order it on Amazon Prime which I love love love, but will drive to Target to save $5.</li>
