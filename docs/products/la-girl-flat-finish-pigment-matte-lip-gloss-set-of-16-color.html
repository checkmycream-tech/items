            <li> The colors are very long wearing I would recommend putting on a lip balm or  Chapstick before applying these, put one coat on and let dry</li>
            <li> Little drying</li>
            <li> It will remove color and in turn become very uneven.</li>
            <li> As to the colors, it&#x27;s hard to match them from a computer</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about buying 16 colors for 57 but checked the website</li>
            <li> It was so painful.</li>

            <li> Ok so I&#x27;m not one to write reviews on anything I purchase online. But with this product I must. These are such amazing lip sticks all my friends and family members are always complimenting me on then and asking where I bough them. I love them. Very beautiful and very pigmented colors I would defenetly buy again! !</li>
            <li> Love. Love. Love. Well pigmented and stays on the whole day even after you&#x27;ve ate! Little drying but I can deal with it. Shipped &amp; arrived quick!</li>
            <li> As to the colors, it&#x27;s hard to match them from a computer but they were pretty close i guess.  As to the deliver fro the user, everthing was fine.</li>
            <li> The price point of these liquid lipsticks are amazing! I&#x27;m one of those people who always wants the complete collection of everything lol :) and after looking in stores and online Amazon had the best  price for them! I got next day shipping because I couldn&#x27;t wait and I swag he&#x27;s them and they are amazing! The colors are very long wearing I would recommend putting on a lip balm or  Chapstick before applying these, put one coat on and let dry And then add a second layer if desired! I&#x27;m so happy I got these they were such a great buy $54 for a 16 piece collection! If your a makeup junkie like myself you need all of these,I will be posting lip swatches on Instagram if anyone wants to see them my IG is @fashionablydesired, and I took this photo as well so happy these are apart of my collection.</li>
            <li> Love the colors but some of the lip sticks were open. It got here fast aswell</li>
            <li> This product is a little drying for my lips but colors are great.</li>
            <li> My favorite gloss !!!!</li>
            <li> Wow! At first I was skeptical because I&#x27;m not a fan of lip gloss, but after doing some tests, it is true to what&#x27;s described. They do become matte after a couple of minutes. Colors are beautiful! I will purchase in the near future when theses run out.</li>
            <li> I AM IN LOVE!!! The colors are true to what is shown and they are perfect for the Matte Lip season we are in. They are long lasting and water proof so you NEED an oil-based make up remover or basic vaseline to take off or it will NEVER come off. Lol. The proof is in the picture. #DarkSkinGirlApproved #XOXO</li>
            <li> I love these they came on time . I love to have sets of everything and this is just perfect . I love it !</li>
            <li> Oh My Gosh... I love these and the price is awesome. They came really fast. I was a bit skeptical about buying 16 colors for 57 but checked the website and they were way pricier. And I just love em.... All the colors r really gorgeous and dries matte... Like super matte... Which I wanted. The shipping was unexpectedly faster... I ordered one day ago...Its like one day shipping for free.</li>
            <li> Got here right on time and perfectly packaged.. I lI&#x27;ve the colors but the staying power wasn&#x27;t that great to me.  However, I do a lot of speaking for work and drink often so that might be the differentiating factor of my experience.  Like them very much otherwise...</li>
            <li> Love how they look And i have been mixing colors</li>
            <li> I love these matte pigment glosses! They aren&#x27;t super drying like other liquid lipsticks but they still have amazing staying power. The colors are beautiful! Some are a bit streaky but adding another layer fixes that.</li>
            <li> I bought YSL before and that lip stain made my lips chapped for over a week. It was so painful. This line has amazing colors that are long lasting and they don&#x27;t hurt your lips. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I work at a hospital and I&#x27;m on the go a lot I don&#x27;t have time to stop and check my make up or reapply but with these lip colors I don&#x27;t even have to worry about them running or fading.  Love the colors , definitely happy with my purchase.  A little drying so make sure you apply lip moisturizer before applying I use one from MAC.</li>
            <li> to view them in person watch my lip swatches ------&amp;#62;  https://youtu.be/YG7AF4t7msQ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of them where very nice to apply with no issues but the two pinky shades timeless and especially bazaar where a little bit challenging. Those two colors came off a bit splotchy and you really need a bit of time to evenly apply them. As far as the other shades they applied very evenly and i had no issues applying an even coat. When applying DO NOT press lips together at any moment before it dries !! It will remove color and in turn become very uneven. They can be a bit drying so be sure to properly moisturize prior to applying</li>
            <li> This was awesome, loved every shade...</li>
            <li> I ordered these Saturday evening and they arrived today! Shipping was much quicker than I expected which was a bonus :) Although some shades looked similar in the photo, there are NO duplicate colors! Great deal for the set because it was like paying half price for each compared to if I would have bought them all separately. Can&#x27;t wait to try each color</li>
