            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it is better, as well as a better value, than any of the others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li>lets just say they are best left in a surgeon&#x27;s hands!)</li>
            <li>It was interesting to see how they worked</li>
            <li>I gave this to my 2 finicky granddaughters to use and they love the item.</li>
            <li>Love the instruments and case they come in.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The tips I have are: wash your face thoroughly with a good cleanser and rinse with very warm water to open up the pours.</li>
            <li>Achieving Naturally Beautiful Skin With Blemish Removal Tools.&amp;#34; The booklet explains how to safely use the tools, including how to clean them before and after use, how to prepare your face for blemish removal treatment and what to do with your face immediately after treatment, and the booklet includes good tips and sound advice on how to prevent blemishes naturally, via diet and exercise, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The metal is very easy to clean before and after to make sure I am not rubbing oil or dirt on my skin.</li>
            <li>She says the handles on the tools make them easy to grip and manipulate, and I can see that that&#x27;s true from my own inspection of this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very cool.  </li>
            <li>If you hold them up to the light, you can see that they don&#x27;t fully meet all along the tips, but most drugstore tweezers don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to sanitize after each use, if you are looking at this set, I&#x27;m sure you already know that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, so I couldn&#x27;t really give the kit a fair run.  </li>
            <li>I will preface this review by saying that this is not the kind of product that is used for something fun or glamorous.</li>
            <li>This is a nice blemish kit with lots of useful and well-constructed tools.</li>
            <li>The instruments themselves are professional grade, and come very nicely presented in a zippered case.</li>
            <li>made it extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li>Some are rounded with knurling and some have square sections, so they are easy to grip and handle well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Professional tools like these make it easy to take care of blemishes with damaging the surrounding skin and causing infections and scars.  </li>
            <li>so it is easy to wash, and disinfect with alcohol or Betadine.</li>
            <li>It is easy to grab and go if you need this for traveling, as well as home use.</li>
            <li>They are easy to sterilize too and for all intents and purposes should be viewed as surgical tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are easy to sterilize too and for all intents and purposes should be viewed as surgical tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>My set was fine</li>
            <li>and I use it super often love the variation of sizes</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not as easily grossed out, you might find them useful for getting the most out of this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The zippered organizer case is well made, with a good quality zipper and a water-resistant black vinyl exterior (good for bathroom</li>
            <li>The tools take some time to become comfortable with, but there is a booklet to show you how to use them and online resources too given by the seller to help you.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than using nonsterile methods, one may use this stainless steel set, washing them between uses.</li>

            <li>every tool is large and does not seem to be precise.</li>
            <li>Great little kit.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Do not under any circumstances buy cheap stuff that&#x27;s not even stainless steel like Remington items.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate Apex including a free instructional book too.  </li>
            <li>I think a two- or three-piece kit would have been just as useful.  </li>
            <li>This seems like a similar concept but with a much more precise area of contact and pressure.</li>
            <li>This kit includes all the needed tools and e-book instructions to more sanitary clear your blemishes.</li>
            <li>Complimentary product provided for evaluation</li>
            <li>Therefore, I will ALWAYS state if I received the item complimentary from the vendor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The tools are effective- there&#x27;s several size of loops and a comedone extractor.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>She said she was going to have fun tonight.  </li>
            <li>No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned after testing.&lt;br /&gt;Views and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;ll keep a watch and have the tools handy in case it (or another) comes back!</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s a high quality kit that I can easily recommend to anyone who is in the market for a blemish removal kit.</li>
            <li>The lancet is exceptionally sharp and is good for piercing pimples with heads on them without the risk of forcing the infection into surrounding tissue.</li>
            <li>The instructional e-book(14 pages, PDF) was sent via e-mail right after purchasing at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love this kit because it come in a small zip block case, so I can take it with me when I travel and also have it nicely stored away in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>The tools are clean and appear ready to use.  </li>
            <li>The latest technology in easily clearing skin with minimal effort&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a skin blemish removal kit and is for dealing with the likes of blackheads, ingrown hairs, pimples, infected hair follicles and other similar problems - not an attractive topic but a real issue for many people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used a large loop on the zit and watched hardened zit goo rise like lava from a volcano!</li>
            <li>* PREMIUM INSTRUMENTS - 6 professional quality tools to clear blemishes of any kind and location, just like your dermatologist uses.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are all made of stainless steel so that they can be sanitized after use with rubbing alcohol or a mild bleach solution.  </li>
            <li>I would very much support others purchasing the blackhead remover kit.</li>
            <li>I very much appreciate the instructional information emailed to me also.</li>
            <li>However, having a set like this is great because you can pick the exact right tool for the job, and it helps clear things up faster and easier than just leaving them alone, which had been my previous strategy.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Contains many different sizes and shapes&lt;</li>
            <li>The only advantage I can think of in having so many is that, if you try them all, you might find that you prefer one over the others.  </li>
            <li>It has a leathery feel, and it&#x27;s lined with a soft, lightly napped fabric.  </li>
            <li>first thing to notice is that it comes in a sturdy zippered carrying case about the size of an eyeglasses case.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure how to use each tool because I couldn&#x27;t open the instructions sent thru email</li>
            <li>As described and exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>and they really work!</li>
            <li>Works Pretty</li>
            <li>I just love all the different tools included in this.</li>
            <li>I would expect them to last for many years.</li>
            <li>The tweezers work better than the ones I had prior to purchasing the kit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with acne my entire life and been to more dermatologists than I can count on one hand.</li>
            <li>I received this as a promotion for the product launch and was pleased with the overall quality of the 7 tools.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the item is infected or contaminated, but it was used by the person with real skin problems!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After trying this set, I would encourage anyone to start with this one first.</li>
            <li>using them properly couldn&#x27;t be easier, there are many video tutorials, and the Apex company also has support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have an autoclave, wash in hot soapy water and wipe with alcohol.</li>
            <li>I used a humidifier first.</li>
            <li>have looked at other kits at two, three, even four times the price, and I honestly can&#x27;t see the difference aside -</li>
            <li>These will do in a pinch, but you really should invest in higher quality tweezers.</li>
            <li>So the presentation is very appealing, not cheap at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesnt leave my pores large.</li>
            <li>I am very grateful to all the people who have trusted my reviews over the years and have voted positively on my reviews.</li>
            <li>The kit is very high quality and the ebook</li>
            <li>This is a nice little 7-piece skin care kit.</li>
            <li>A little magnification mirror would have been more useful and appropriate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>White heads take a little more prodding, but so much better than squeezing your issue.</li>
            <li>Given that you get a whole kit of seven tools, many of which are double-sided, this is a great deal and the tools have sturdy handles and seem high quality and very unlikely to break.</li>
            <li>This product is very well made.</li>
            <li>I really like how it has tools of every size</li>
            <li>The tools themselves are sturdy stainless steel.</li>
            <li>better alternative than pinching, pushing, and squeezing your face to pop your zits, which is not very sanitary.</li>
            <li>The kit is also built very well for the price.</li>
            <li>a really stubborn zit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is very informative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what each tool is used for, but I just tried whatever I thought would work for my blackhead</li>
            <li>set is stainless</li>
            <li>Each tool is very substantial and seems well made.</li>
            <li>I have seen quality stainless steel products and this is NOT.  </li>
            <li>It is a cheap basic kit for someone, like me, who has never used one.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the results.  </li>
            <li>Whole set is about size of eyeglass case.</li>
            <li>The video is very helpful.  </li>
            <li>They appear to be stainless steel, and very durable.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast as well.</li>
            <li>I can keep all of the tools in one place, which is very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>are stainless</li>
            <li>this kit seems a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but you really have to try to bend them to make that happen.</li>
            <li>but you really have to try to bend them to make that happen.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much time.</li>
            <li>well, the big one being this kit is far more economical.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The tweezers are nice to use for multiple different purposes.</li>
            <li>the openings are very large and no black head is that large.</li>
            <li>It has strong stitching that is seamless, no loose or hanging threads.</li>
            <li>BTW I didn&#x27;t expect much about this remover kit, because by looking at the photos, they look so simple and there&#x27;s nothing special about.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I don&#x27;t get much acne anymore or blackheads for that matter, but the next one I have I promise to post a video of the kit in action.</li>
            <li>Generally, you should start with the widest ones, and then continue downsizing in loop diameter until you find the right tool for the</li>
            <li>But where I&#x27;d squeeze my skin before, making an ugly mess of my face in that area, I just choose the best tool for what I&#x27;m dealing with a quickly apply and cleanly remove the blemish.</li>
            <li>High quality product that works well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>kit comes with high quality extractors, pushers, a lancet and even a pairs of tweezers.  </li>
            <li>High quality materials.</li>
            <li>It is high quality.</li>
            <li>Because I&#x27;d had this treatment done to me in the past, it was very easy to stand in front of a mirror and do it to myself.</li>
            <li>But even more damaging to my face are the little bumps that, once I feel, I can&#x27;t leave alone.</li>
            <li>There is a little instruction book that goes into more detail about how to use each item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really has a professional quality and feel.</li>
            <li>COMPLIMENTARY SAMPLE WAS PROVIDED FOR THE PURPOSE OF MY OBJECTIVE REVIEW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The kit is a nice little size that you could definitely travel with and  the tools are high quality.</li>
            <li>But, almost all of the rest of them are pimple poppers, in various degrees of wideness, so that you can pick the right tool for the job.</li>
            <li>Mercifully, the case doesn&#x27;t have a label of any kind, so it doesn&#x27;t scream to the world what its gross little contents</li>
            <li>I really like that there are different sizes and styles and the case is very compact.  </li>
            <li>Make certain that you wash each tool in hot, soapy water and dry thoroughly, then wipe the tips with rubbing alcohol before using.</li>
            <li>One can wash these with bleach but there are many other liquids one could use such as ammonia, liquid detergent and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Take the first step in improving appearances and overall health.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looks exactly the same on the description.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are 6 various blackhead tools, which look exactly like the photo.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had these long enough to know whether they will rust over time, but fit and finish</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had these long enough to know whether they will rust over time, but fit and finish</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and was everything I expected.</li>
            <li>if they ever do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a small tool that I purchased at a big box retailer, but I didn&#x27;t find it very helpful for my problems, which seem to be mostly whiteheads and blackheads  </li>
            <li>Well worth the cost - due to the high quality, you would never have to buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but they are a lot more hygenic and focus pressure closely to the area, so they work well, and are less likely to injure than using your fingers.  </li>
            <li>But being a little older and having fair skin has left a new dark purple spots on my skin that takes months to fade (</li>
            <li>While I am a woman of a certain age, I still get the occasional blemish.</li>
            <li>The extraction/compression loops are mostly similar with the exception of one which is more round, and these are useful for manipulating pimples and blackheads loose.</li>
            <li>* CLEAR SKIN -</li>
            <li>included 14-page instructional ebook will explain how to use each tool and tips on how to have a clear complexion.  </li>
            <li>The whole concept of \\&quot;blemish extraction\\&quot; (eww) really grosses me out, but I had come across a tool similar to the ones contained in this kit several years ago and had been tempted to try one (but never had), so when Apex offered to send me this kit to try, I gave it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Using the tools as recommended didn&#x27;t really work, but scraping them along the skin brought oil to the surface from several pores (eww).  </li>
            <li>27 year old daughter who can&#x27;t leave a blemish alone once it starts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying one for my über picky 27 year old daughter who can&#x27;t leave a blemish alone once it starts.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the quality.  </li>
            <li>I struggle with adult acne on and off</li>
            <li>/&gt;Each tool in this kit is made of stainless steel and is solid and durable.</li>
            <li>since then, I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for reasonably priced extractors that actually do the job.</li>
            <li>Inside the case shows off a nice red lining material with a total of 7 instruments for removing blackheads, whiteheads, and other facial blemishes.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Closed it is folded in half, so this is a very compact and easily packable kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I run them under very hot water once I&#x27;m finished using them, dry them completely, and then set them back in their kit until I need to use them again.</li>
            <li>Though I don&#x27;t think of myself as having problem skin, I think everyone gets the occasional flare up, especially around hormonal times of the month, and while I had seen single implements like this at my local drugstore for $10-$15, I wasn&#x27;t really willing to splurge that much on just one little item, which I wasn&#x27;t entirely sure I&#x27;d use.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend reviewing the included PDF manual that reviews the specific use of each of the tools.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No ugly indentations or marks are left behind, just clean pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but in few days there is blackheads again specially when we are travelling.</li>
            <li>Personally, let my fingers do the walking and found a large amount of YouTube videos, health blogs, simple instructional pages, etcetera on these kinds of tools.</li>
            <li>These professional tools are designed to clear deep into the pores for a healthier complexion a healthier you!</li>
            <li>Very professional product definitely recommend</li>
            <li>marks and puss generally comes out with ease.</li>
            <li>This kit contains various professional tools for extracting comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) and pustules (pimples), plus a pair of tweezers and a zippered storage case.  </li>
            <li>The lancing tool is INCREDIBLY sharp, and the extra width on some of the flat headed extractors make for more even pressure, and less marks on the skin.</li>
            <li>It is also more sanitary, less messy and when used properly safer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like that there is a little poker on one end</li>
            <li>The lancet or tool for opening the whitehead was too large and not sharp enough to puncture small white heads,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it is better, as well as a better value, than any of the others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li> lets just say they are best left in a surgeon&#x27;s hands!)</li>
            <li> It was interesting to see how they worked</li>
            <li> I gave this to my 2 finicky granddaughters to use and they love the item.</li>
            <li> Love the instruments and case they come in.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The tips I have are: wash your face thoroughly with a good cleanser and rinse with very warm water to open up the pours.</li>
            <li> Achieving Naturally Beautiful Skin With Blemish Removal Tools.&amp;#34; The booklet explains how to safely use the tools, including how to clean them before and after use, how to prepare your face for blemish removal treatment and what to do with your face immediately after treatment, and the booklet includes good tips and sound advice on how to prevent blemishes naturally, via diet and exercise, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The metal is very easy to clean before and after to make sure I am not rubbing oil or dirt on my skin.</li>
            <li> She says the handles on the tools make them easy to grip and manipulate, and I can see that that&#x27;s true from my own inspection of this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very cool.  </li>
            <li> If you hold them up to the light, you can see that they don&#x27;t fully meet all along the tips, but most drugstore tweezers don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to sanitize after each use, if you are looking at this set, I&#x27;m sure you already know that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , so I couldn&#x27;t really give the kit a fair run.  </li>
            <li> I will preface this review by saying that this is not the kind of product that is used for something fun or glamorous.</li>
            <li> This is a nice blemish kit with lots of useful and well-constructed tools.</li>

            <li> made it extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li> Some are rounded with knurling and some have square sections, so they are easy to grip and handle well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Professional tools like these make it easy to take care of blemishes with damaging the surrounding skin and causing infections and scars.  </li>
            <li> so it is easy to wash, and disinfect with alcohol or Betadine.</li>
            <li> It is easy to grab and go if you need this for traveling, as well as home use.</li>
            <li> They are easy to sterilize too and for all intents and purposes should be viewed as surgical tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are easy to sterilize too and for all intents and purposes should be viewed as surgical tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> The tools take some time to become comfortable with, but there is a booklet to show you how to use them and online resources too given by the seller to help you.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than using nonsterile methods, one may use this stainless steel set, washing them between uses.</li>

            <li> I really appreciate Apex including a free instructional book too.  </li>
            <li> I think a two- or three-piece kit would have been just as useful.  </li>

            <li> I would very much support others purchasing the blackhead remover kit.</li>
            <li> I very much appreciate the instructional information emailed to me also.</li>
            <li> However, having a set like this is great because you can pick the exact right tool for the job, and it helps clear things up faster and easier than just leaving them alone, which had been my previous strategy.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Contains many different sizes and shapes&lt;</li>
            <li> The only advantage I can think of in having so many is that, if you try them all, you might find that you prefer one over the others.  </li>
            <li> It has a leathery feel, and it&#x27;s lined with a soft, lightly napped fabric.  </li>
            <li> first thing to notice is that it comes in a sturdy zippered carrying case about the size of an eyeglasses case.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure how to use each tool because I couldn&#x27;t open the instructions sent thru email</li>
            <li> As described and exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> and they really work!</li>
            <li> Works Pretty</li>
            <li> I just love all the different tools included in this.</li>
            <li> I would expect them to last for many years.</li>
            <li> The tweezers work better than the ones I had prior to purchasing the kit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne my entire life and been to more dermatologists than I can count on one hand.</li>
            <li> I received this as a promotion for the product launch and was pleased with the overall quality of the 7 tools.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the item is infected or contaminated, but it was used by the person with real skin problems!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After trying this set, I would encourage anyone to start with this one first.</li>
            <li> using them properly couldn&#x27;t be easier, there are many video tutorials, and the Apex company also has support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have an autoclave, wash in hot soapy water and wipe with alcohol.</li>
            <li> I used a humidifier first.</li>
            <li> have looked at other kits at two, three, even four times the price, and I honestly can&#x27;t see the difference aside -</li>
            <li> These will do in a pinch, but you really should invest in higher quality tweezers.</li>
            <li> So the presentation is very appealing, not cheap at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesnt leave my pores large.</li>
            <li> I am very grateful to all the people who have trusted my reviews over the years and have voted positively on my reviews.</li>
            <li> The kit is very high quality and the ebook</li>
            <li> This is a nice little 7-piece skin care kit.</li>
            <li> A little magnification mirror would have been more useful and appropriate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> White heads take a little more prodding, but so much better than squeezing your issue.</li>
            <li> Given that you get a whole kit of seven tools, many of which are double-sided, this is a great deal and the tools have sturdy handles and seem high quality and very unlikely to break.</li>
            <li> This product is very well made.</li>
            <li> I really like how it has tools of every size</li>
            <li> The tools themselves are sturdy stainless steel.</li>
            <li> better alternative than pinching, pushing, and squeezing your face to pop your zits, which is not very sanitary.</li>
            <li> The kit is also built very well for the price.</li>
            <li> a really stubborn zit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is very informative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what each tool is used for, but I just tried whatever I thought would work for my blackhead</li>
            <li> set is stainless</li>
            <li> Each tool is very substantial and seems well made.</li>
            <li> I have seen quality stainless steel products and this is NOT.  </li>
            <li> It is a cheap basic kit for someone, like me, who has never used one.  </li>
            <li> and I really like the results.  </li>
            <li> Whole set is about size of eyeglass case.</li>
            <li> The video is very helpful.  </li>
            <li> They appear to be stainless steel, and very durable.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast as well.</li>
            <li> I can keep all of the tools in one place, which is very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> are stainless</li>
            <li> this kit seems a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but you really have to try to bend them to make that happen.</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much time.</li>
            <li> well, the big one being this kit is far more economical.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tweezers are nice to use for multiple different purposes.</li>
            <li> the openings are very large and no black head is that large.</li>
            <li> It has strong stitching that is seamless, no loose or hanging threads.</li>
            <li> BTW I didn&#x27;t expect much about this remover kit, because by looking at the photos, they look so simple and there&#x27;s nothing special about.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I don&#x27;t get much acne anymore or blackheads for that matter, but the next one I have I promise to post a video of the kit in action.</li>
            <li> Generally, you should start with the widest ones, and then continue downsizing in loop diameter until you find the right tool for the</li>
            <li> But where I&#x27;d squeeze my skin before, making an ugly mess of my face in that area, I just choose the best tool for what I&#x27;m dealing with a quickly apply and cleanly remove the blemish.</li>
            <li> High quality product that works well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> kit comes with high quality extractors, pushers, a lancet and even a pairs of tweezers.  </li>
            <li> High quality materials.</li>
            <li> It is high quality.</li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;d had this treatment done to me in the past, it was very easy to stand in front of a mirror and do it to myself.</li>
            <li> But even more damaging to my face are the little bumps that, once I feel, I can&#x27;t leave alone.</li>
            <li> There is a little instruction book that goes into more detail about how to use each item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really has a professional quality and feel.</li>
            <li> COMPLIMENTARY SAMPLE WAS PROVIDED FOR THE PURPOSE OF MY OBJECTIVE REVIEW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The kit is a nice little size that you could definitely travel with and  the tools are high quality.</li>
            <li> But, almost all of the rest of them are pimple poppers, in various degrees of wideness, so that you can pick the right tool for the job.</li>
            <li> Mercifully, the case doesn&#x27;t have a label of any kind, so it doesn&#x27;t scream to the world what its gross little contents</li>
            <li> I really like that there are different sizes and styles and the case is very compact.  </li>
            <li> Make certain that you wash each tool in hot, soapy water and dry thoroughly, then wipe the tips with rubbing alcohol before using.</li>
            <li> One can wash these with bleach but there are many other liquids one could use such as ammonia, liquid detergent and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Take the first step in improving appearances and overall health.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looks exactly the same on the description.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are 6 various blackhead tools, which look exactly like the photo.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had these long enough to know whether they will rust over time, but fit and finish</li>

            <li> if they ever do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a small tool that I purchased at a big box retailer, but I didn&#x27;t find it very helpful for my problems, which seem to be mostly whiteheads and blackheads  </li>
            <li> Well worth the cost - due to the high quality, you would never have to buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but they are a lot more hygenic and focus pressure closely to the area, so they work well, and are less likely to injure than using your fingers.  </li>
            <li> But being a little older and having fair skin has left a new dark purple spots on my skin that takes months to fade (</li>
            <li> While I am a woman of a certain age, I still get the occasional blemish.</li>
            <li> The extraction/compression loops are mostly similar with the exception of one which is more round, and these are useful for manipulating pimples and blackheads loose.</li>

            <li> included 14-page instructional ebook will explain how to use each tool and tips on how to have a clear complexion.  </li>
            <li> The whole concept of \\&quot;blemish extraction\\&quot; (eww) really grosses me out, but I had come across a tool similar to the ones contained in this kit several years ago and had been tempted to try one (but never had), so when Apex offered to send me this kit to try, I gave it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using the tools as recommended didn&#x27;t really work, but scraping them along the skin brought oil to the surface from several pores (eww).  </li>
            <li> 27 year old daughter who can&#x27;t leave a blemish alone once it starts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying one for my über picky 27 year old daughter who can&#x27;t leave a blemish alone once it starts.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality.  </li>
            <li> I struggle with adult acne on and off</li>
            <li> /&gt;Each tool in this kit is made of stainless steel and is solid and durable.</li>
            <li> since then, I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for reasonably priced extractors that actually do the job.</li>
            <li> Inside the case shows off a nice red lining material with a total of 7 instruments for removing blackheads, whiteheads, and other facial blemishes.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Closed it is folded in half, so this is a very compact and easily packable kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I run them under very hot water once I&#x27;m finished using them, dry them completely, and then set them back in their kit until I need to use them again.</li>
            <li> Though I don&#x27;t think of myself as having problem skin, I think everyone gets the occasional flare up, especially around hormonal times of the month, and while I had seen single implements like this at my local drugstore for $10-$15, I wasn&#x27;t really willing to splurge that much on just one little item, which I wasn&#x27;t entirely sure I&#x27;d use.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend reviewing the included PDF manual that reviews the specific use of each of the tools.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No ugly indentations or marks are left behind, just clean pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but in few days there is blackheads again specially when we are travelling.</li>
            <li> Personally, let my fingers do the walking and found a large amount of YouTube videos, health blogs, simple instructional pages, etcetera on these kinds of tools.</li>
            <li> These professional tools are designed to clear deep into the pores for a healthier complexion a healthier you!</li>
            <li> Very professional product definitely recommend</li>
            <li> marks and puss generally comes out with ease.</li>
            <li> This kit contains various professional tools for extracting comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) and pustules (pimples), plus a pair of tweezers and a zippered storage case.  </li>
            <li> The lancing tool is INCREDIBLY sharp, and the extra width on some of the flat headed extractors make for more even pressure, and less marks on the skin.</li>
            <li> It is also more sanitary, less messy and when used properly safer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like that there is a little poker on one end</li>
            <li> The lancet or tool for opening the whitehead was too large and not sharp enough to puncture small white heads,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re pretty much avoiding expensive dermatologist appointments and instead opting to face the issue at home.</li>
            <li> After purchasing assorted ones from Sephora and Sally Beauty Supply, as well as the totally useless drugstore ones, I&#x27;d pretty much given up the hunt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They work on the sizing scale, small tool to large depending on your issue.</li>
            <li> but I have had it long enough to see its usefulness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the company stood behind their product and offered me a full refund.  </li>
            <li> I really like this item although it is a little tougher to use than I had expected.</li>
            <li> The kit also works for various other things such as bug bits.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She did mention that it would be insulting to get this as a gift from someone other than her mother, so perhaps it is best bought by the person who needs</li>

            <li> I have not had it for a particularly long time</li>
            <li> I usually left a bigger mess by infecting the area.</li>
            <li> The openings are everything from extremely tiny to very wide.</li>
            <li> There are multiple extraction/compression loops, a spoon extractor, a very sharp lancet (or, a “digger” if you prefer) and a pair of tweezers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only started using this for a few days, but I&#x27;ve seen some minor results.</li>
            <li> That said, it covers a much smaller area than you would if you extracted with your fingers which causes a lot less irritation to surrounding tissue.</li>
            <li> It leaves a small red mark on the skin but it disappears in a very short time.</li>
            <li> I no longer squeeze my black or white heads.</li>

            <li> I have no affiliation with any manufacturer or distributor other than choosing to review their item.</li>
            <li> but you get what you need, including a sharp piercing tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tools are as sharp as they warn.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a small kit, when opened and laid flat measures 7&amp;#34;x5.5&amp;#34; - not large at all.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So so so good! The kit is very high quality and the ebook made it extremely easy to use. Very user friendly! Much better than my finger tips. I would highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I received this kit as a free sample trial and it is a great little kit to keep your skin looking healthy and fresh. The free eBook that is included with purchase is very helpful and explains how to use all of the tools and some other great tips for maintaining healthy looking skin. I don&#x27;t have a lot of acne or blemishes but the variety tools in this kit work great for any type of blemish. The kit is a nice little size that you could definitely travel with and  the tools are high quality. I would reccomend!</li>
            <li> Me and my husband had a hard time sometime pinching our pores to take off blackheads or whiteheads....sometimes we used blackhead pore strip but in few days there is blackheads again specially when we are travelling. Then I found out this tool kit . I got it discounted in exchange of review.&lt;br /&gt;  It was attractive 8 piece kit (7 tools plus the carry case) that is surprisingly thin at only 1&amp;#34; and measures approximately 7&amp;#34; length by 2 1/2&amp;#34; width. The case is well made with a 3/4 rounded zipper. It has strong stitching that is seamless, no loose or hanging threads. Inside the case shows off a nice red lining material with a total of 7 instruments for removing blackheads, whiteheads, and other facial blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;  The tools take some time to become comfortable with, but there is a booklet to show you how to use them and online resources too given by the seller to help you.&lt;br /&gt;  Tool workmanship seems fine. I haven&#x27;t had these long enough to know whether they will rust over time, but fit and finish feel good.&lt;br /&gt;These seem well designed and ergonomic. They&#x27;re comfortable in the hand and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love love love it! I&#x27;ve only started using this for a few days, but I&#x27;ve seen some minor results. Excellent CS, received pdf email promptly. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I saw some dramatic videos showing how doctors use tools like these. I&#x27;ve got nothing so dramatic yet can find use for these. It&#x27;s a nice set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than using nonsterile methods, one may use this stainless steel set, washing them between uses. One can wash these with bleach but there are many other liquids one could use such as ammonia, liquid detergent and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not under any circumstances buy cheap stuff that&#x27;s not even stainless steel like Remington items. At a minimum get stainless steel, and make sure to keep them in a case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item requested for sincere review.</li>
            <li> This product is very well made. I was impressed with its strength and rigidity. Overall, very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is a great kit, that will help with any blemish or blackhead. I really like how it has tools of every size, that will help with the smallest blemish to the largest, deepest blackhead. One end of one of the tools is a puncture tool, to widen the opening of the blackhead. But, almost all of the rest of them are pimple poppers, in various degrees of wideness, so that you can pick the right tool for the job. The openings are everything from extremely tiny to very wide. Generally, you should start with the widest ones, and then continue downsizing in loop diameter until you find the right tool for the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing is that the tweezers are extremely low quality. These will do in a pinch, but you really should invest in higher quality tweezers. But, overall this set is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Contains many different sizes and shapes&lt;br /&gt;+Most of the parts are very solid and sturdy&lt;br /&gt;+Comes in a nice case&lt;br /&gt;+Extremely effective&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Tweezers are extremely basic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Apex gave me these tools to review*</li>
            <li> Their products come just as advertised and I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
            <li> Not the sharpest tools. I did receive a discount code for this purchase.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> this was a descent product.</li>
            <li> This kit contains the deadliest looking set of skin tools I&#x27;ve ever seen, and they&#x27;re effective.  The company provides detailed instructions on how to use each one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time in years, my face is blackhead free, even my nose, and my skin looks wonderful.  I&#x27;d recommend using an antiseptic after using these tools, and I keep a little bottle of alcohol close at hand to wipe them after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the case, and the very high quality of these instruments.  The set should last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product received for review.</li>

The picture of the e-book provided on this page is a little misleading; the book is nowhere near that substantial.  It&#x27;s actually more like a pamphlet, 14 liberally spaced pages mostly used to describe the different instruments in the kit.  The content is very repetitive and not particular helpful.  But I did like their recommendation to reduce sugar in your diet to help with blemishes.  That&#x27;s very sound advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tools themselves seem to be well made, as is the case.  But the tools, like the booklet, are very repetitive, some almost identical.  I think a two- or three-piece kit would have been just as useful.  The only advantage I can think of in having so many is that, if you try them all, you might find that you prefer one over the others.  Then you&#x27;ll probably only use that tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers are okay.  If you hold them up to the light, you can see that they don&#x27;t fully meet all along the tips, but most drugstore tweezers don&#x27;t.  I can&#x27;t imagine what place they have in a blemish kit.  I shudder to think.  A little magnification mirror would have been more useful and appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is nice.  It has a leathery feel, and it&#x27;s lined with a soft, lightly napped fabric.  I might repurpose it for something else.  Mercifully, the case doesn&#x27;t have a label of any kind, so it doesn&#x27;t scream to the world what its gross little contents are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t currently have any blemishes, so I couldn&#x27;t really give the kit a fair run.  I do, however, have oil-clogged pores on my nose (not really blackheads).  Using the tools as recommended didn&#x27;t really work, but scraping them along the skin brought oil to the surface from several pores (eww).  So, yeah, they worked okay in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that there are videos online that shower blemish extraction, but, eww.  If you&#x27;re not as easily grossed out, you might find them useful for getting the most out of this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this seems like a quality kit with a bit of overkill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  The manufacturer sent this kit to me for review purposes.</li>
            <li> This was provided to be by the seller to review. I have to be honest the set is intimidating. It really has a professional quality and feel. My sister is an Esthetician and confirmed that these kits are used by professionals and was very impressed with the quality. Fortunately I don&#x27;t get much acne anymore or blackheads for that matter, but the next one I have I promise to post a video of the kit in action. Back in my teen years I would manually squeeze acne. That may not be what is suggested but it is what I did. I know I have a few scars form that. This seems like a similar concept but with a much more precise area of contact and pressure. My thoughts are that you would thereby avoid or minimize the skin trauma of manually &amp;#34;popping zits&amp;#34; like I used to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything comes in a velvet lined leatherette case to keep it neat and organized. The tools themselves are sturdy stainless steel. They remind me of dental equipment with the same heft and quality construction. I would highly recommend reviewing the included PDF manual that reviews the specific use of each of the tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon Disclosure Statement:&lt;br /&gt;-I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review; or&lt;br /&gt;-I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;Why the statement?

            <li> This is simply a better alternative to squeezing with your fingertips. Doesn&#x27;t matter facial or anywhere else - I recently had an infected bug bite on my arm that had hardened up. Hot shower, sanitize tools, lance if needed, and apply with the appropriate sized loop for controlled release. I can&#x27;t stress enough, however, the paramount importance of sanitizing any tool pressing into the epidermis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And ye olde &amp;#34;Back Pimples&amp;#34;? Same thing. If you would normally squeeze it, these tools are better suited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructional eBook unfortunately was sent to my main email address and got promptly buried in the hundreds of emails that account gets everyday... so I never got to read it. However, a little card included with the kit has an email address for requesting another copy. Personally, let my fingers do the walking and found a large amount of YouTube videos, health blogs, simple instructional pages, etcetera on these kinds of tools. The conceptual use is not even as remotely complex one may be lead to believe looking at these tools. As I said, they are merely better, unquestionably better alternatives to squeezing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have looked at other kits at two, three, even four times the price, and I honestly can&#x27;t see the difference aside - well, the big one being this kit is far more economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Complimentary product provided for evaluation</li>
            <li> This kit contains various professional tools for extracting comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) and pustules (pimples), plus a pair of tweezers and a zippered storage case.  Several of the tools are duplicates and can be kept be kept as spares or given away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extractors are a little over 5 in. long.  Some are rounded with knurling and some have square sections, so they are easy to grip and handle well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are all made of stainless steel so that they can be sanitized after use with rubbing alcohol or a mild bleach solution.  They could also be autoclaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Professional tools like these make it easy to take care of blemishes with damaging the surrounding skin and causing infections and scars.  To learn how to use these them, watch videos on YouTube submitted by doctors like Vikram Yadav or Sandra Lee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apex Supply Company provided a set for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> Got this product with a nice discount code. For the price I paid. This is a great product. Tools are great quality.</li>
            <li> Great customer service and great product!!!</li>
            <li> While I am a woman of a certain age, I still get the occasional blemish. But even more damaging to my face are the little bumps that, once I feel, I can&#x27;t leave alone. When I was younger, it wasn&#x27;t such a big deal, my skin snapped back from my messing about with it. But being a little older and having fair skin has left a new dark purple spots on my skin that takes months to fade (if they ever do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a small tool that I purchased at a big box retailer, but I didn&#x27;t find it very helpful for my problems, which seem to be mostly whiteheads and blackheads  and once in awhile, a raging Mt. Vesuvius that torments me for days. When the company asked if I would consider receiving a sample and trying this little kit out, I agreed. Here is a review about my experience with the 6 Piece Blackhead/Blemish Remover kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing to notice is that it comes in a sturdy zippered carrying case about the size of an eyeglasses case. The zipper smoothly opens to reveal a nice carrying case with 6 well-made steel skin care tools. Each tool is held in by a strong piece of elastic. They lie on a bed of red velvet-like material. So the presentation is very appealing, not cheap at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there are the tools. There are 6 tools in all, each with a different purpose. Some are to help with blackhead removal, some for whitehead removal, some with stubborn cyst-like blemishes, some help with the standard &amp;#34;zit&amp;#34;. But where I&#x27;d squeeze my skin before, making an ugly mess of my face in that area, I just choose the best tool for what I&#x27;m dealing with a quickly apply and cleanly remove the blemish. Tweezers are also included for bits that need to be pulled off.  There is a little instruction book that goes into more detail about how to use each item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tips I have are: wash your face thoroughly with a good cleanser and rinse with very warm water to open up the pours. Make certain that you wash each tool in hot, soapy water and dry thoroughly, then wipe the tips with rubbing alcohol before using. This is to keep from spreading bacteria throughout your face.  After use, wash your face again, then use a good astringent and moisturizer to help your skin heal. Wash the tools once more and after drying, store them back in the carrying case to keep them in top condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really a nice gift to anyone who wants to take care of their skin. Teens through any age adulthood, it seems like we&#x27;re all hit with a zit or 4,usually at the very worst possible time. With these well-made tools, dealing with an ugly blemish helps keep your skin healthier and is a lot more sanitary than picking a it with you fingers, sharp objects, etc. I&#x27;m buying one for my &amp;uuml;ber picky 27 year old daughter who can&#x27;t leave a blemish alone once it starts.

            <li> The perfect fix for my problem areas. Blackheads, pimples, ingrown hairs... you name it, this set can extract it! The lancing tool is INCREDIBLY sharp, and the extra width on some of the flat headed extractors make for more even pressure, and less marks on the skin. There are a couple of duplicate tools, however I appreciate it knowing that if I ever happen to misplace one I have a backup I can use. The case is pretty cheaply made, but I am really impressed with the quality of the tools, and how well they&#x27;ve helped me eliminate problem areas!</li>
            <li> I gave this to a friend who was still going through his awkward phase, and he couldn&#x27;t thank me enough. Years of using his fingers to pop his zits have rewarded his face full of craters and scars. Now, with these instruments, he has much better options to effectively deal with my problem. When you use these instead of your fingers, they don&#x27;t cut into your skin as sharp, so they are less likely to leave permanent marks, especially if you have thin skin and/or a really stubborn zit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always rate the item with the price in mind, because nowadays that is a key factor in deciding what you buy and whether you buy that one, or something else. With its quality and functionality, I feel this charger is a 5-star product at $15-25, so at less than $15, it is a great value and I whole-heartedly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A COMPLIMENTARY SAMPLE WAS PROVIDED FOR THE PURPOSE OF MY OBJECTIVE REVIEW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I have worked very hard to achieve the ranking I have now. I am very grateful to all the people who have trusted my reviews over the years and have voted positively on my reviews. Therefore, I will ALWAYS state if I received the item complimentary from the vendor. Thank you, everyone, and have an awesome 2015!**</li>
            <li> Gave as a present to my sister as she loves removing these things. She was overjoyed! Works well, different tools for different sizes, etc. Most people would probably be grossed out but she loved it.</li>
            <li> This is a great set of tools to have at home! They are very professional and come in a handy case for storage. I love the assortment, I can pick and choose which tool will be best to remove blemishes.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure how to use each tool because I couldn&#x27;t open the instructions sent thru email</li>
            <li> Awesome set!  My wife and I have enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid forties and now I seem to be suffering from breakouts!  Before I would pick at the with my nails and that would leave behind ugly scabs, dried blood spots and scars.  Now with the Apex blackhead and blemish removal kit hopefully those days will be a thing of the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes with high quality extractors, pushers, a lancet and even a pairs of tweezers.  All made of stainless steel and in an easy to store and carry zippered case.  Just apply a little pressure and the tool does the work.  No ugly indentations or marks are left behind, just clean pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included 14-page instructional ebook will explain how to use each tool and tips on how to have a clear complexion.  It is very informative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product sample.</li>
            <li> I received this item for free in return for leaving a review of the product. Very fast shipping! I was impressed with the quality of the product and it even comes in a nice leather case. I would very much support others purchasing the blackhead remover kit.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what each tool is used for, but I just tried whatever I thought would work for my blackhead and it was able to get the job done versus me using my fingers to squeeze it out. It doesn&#x27;t leave a scar either if you use it right :)</li>
            <li> Great quality, strong packaging.</li>
            <li> Free product provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set comes in a very nice, compact zippered kit. There&#x27;s a total of 7pieces in this kit - 6 double ended tools for lancing, draining pimples and also for removing blackheads.  There&#x27;s also a nice set of tweezers included.  The tweezers in my kit were excellent- quite easy to use with a good grasp of even the finest hairs.  These tools will reach inconvenient places, such as down in the ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tools are effective- there&#x27;s several size of loops and a comedone extractor.  Don&#x27;t expect them not to hurt- according to my son they hurt worse than fingers- but they are a lot more hygenic and focus pressure closely to the area, so they work well, and are less likely to injure than using your fingers.  Also, the loops are very effective for getting close in to creases, such as at the side of your nose where it meets your face/cheek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set is stainless so it is easy to wash, and disinfect with alcohol or Betadine.</li>
            <li> Great little kit.  High quality materials. Has a variety of sizes for every need. I contacted customer service about the book and received a reply and the book within an hour. Arrived quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> Very impressed! Looks exactly the same on the description.Also easy to use and clean.My only problem is they dont include a instruction manual on how to properly use and how to properly clean it.overall its a good investment.I am fortunate to get these in a discounted price.</li>
            <li> Not as low quality as I thought they&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality.  Each tool is very substantial and seems well made.</li>
            <li> I love this product. If you are like me you skip the 5 stars and read the reviews from unhappy people. I have had zero issues with these. I have been happy with the size variety that is given which is why I picked this set. The metal doesn&#x27;t bend or break which I was very glad to see. The metal is very easy to clean before and after to make sure I am not rubbing oil or dirt on my skin. I really like that there is a little poker on one end so you can break the skin with a tiny tiny hole before you start popping. This has everything you could need, just remember to clean your tools, I use rubbing alcohol without any issues.</li>
            <li> Seems like a nice set of tools but for the life of me I can&#x27;t figure out how to make any of them work.</li>
            <li> This was poor quality.  I have seen quality stainless steel products and this is NOT.  I contacted the company after they emailed me asking me if I was satisfied.  The tweezers are cheap and useless due to poor quality design.  Instruments were dirty along with rust spots and very sharp, rough places on the metal.  I would have given this 1 star but the company stood behind their product and offered me a full refund.  Yet I still told them I could not give them a good review because the quality is horrible.  Since Amazon refunded me for this, I gave it an extra star.  Instructions should have been included rather than emailed.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome set!!  I love them &amp; they don&#x27;t leave a mark.</li>
            <li> This company bugged the s*** out of me to submit a review. Here it is. QUIT EMAILING |ME.  It is a cheap basic kit for someone, like me, who has never used one.  GREAT.  Give me 3 months to try it out.</li>
            <li> These are excellent quality tools.  I very much appreciate the instructional information emailed to me also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the products to remove blackheads and I really like the results.  I rather use a tool than my nails.  I recommend this kit.  There is definitely more tools than what I need but I&#x27;ll just save them for the future.  Make sure to disinfect the tools after each use. The handy sturdy case makes it easy to store product.  Apex Supply Co. will quickly respond emails with any questions regarding the kit.  Great customer service!</li>
            <li> Whole set is about size of eyeglass case. Seems sturdy</li>
            <li> As described and exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing kit.. I love it it can on handy this weekend when packing. A quick handy mini facial kit..</li>
            <li> i bought this but am not sure how to use as there are no instructions. every tool is large and does not seem to be precise. i have tried it and it doesnt seem to do what it is advertised to do. the openings are very large and no black head is that large.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried these as soon as I got them and they really work! Great product!</li>
            <li> Good quality product, just what I hoped for and an awesome price.</li>
            <li> handles have sharp edges where blackhead extractors are inserted into them</li>
            <li> Works Pretty Well.  Have to follow the instructions.  I&#x27;m not a pro and this doesn&#x27;t entirely eliminate the need to see an aesthetician but definitely helpful between visits!</li>
            <li> Great Value!  Compact size perfect for traveling and easy storage.  These tools are effective at removing blackheads without causing irritation or redness.  I really appreciate Apex including a free instructional book too.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> This kit has everything you need to deal with blackheads and other blemishes.  The video is very helpful.  I&#x27;m glad I made this picture.</li>
            <li> It is a very nice set of utensils and exactly as described.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This kit contains a good variety of high quality blackhead/blemish removal tools, and the zippered case is high quality as well. If well-cared for and properly used, I think these tools should last a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My adult daughter&#x27;s been using it and is very impressed with it. She says the handles on the tools make them easy to grip and manipulate, and I can see that that&#x27;s true from my own inspection of this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchasers of this kit receive via email a 14 page PDF booklet titled, &amp;#34;Banish the Blemishes: Achieving Naturally Beautiful Skin With Blemish Removal Tools.&amp;#34; The booklet explains how to safely use the tools, including how to clean them before and after use, how to prepare your face for blemish removal treatment and what to do with your face immediately after treatment, and the booklet includes good tips and sound advice on how to prevent blemishes naturally, via diet and exercise, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this kit for review purposes and I think it&#x27;s a high quality kit that I can easily recommend to anyone who is in the market for a blemish removal kit.</li>
            <li> I just love all the different tools included in this. I haven&#x27;t found a reason to use them all, but I love having them all at my finger tips, just in case. The case holding all of these was of nice quality and the zipper is a nice one too. Makes me feel all sophisticated when I whip this out and unzip it (even if I&#x27;m prepping to attack a pimple).</li>
            <li> While I personally am not plagued by bad skin, I have a teenage daughter, and you know how that goes. She seemed to be the perfect candidate to try out the blemish kit. She did mention that it would be insulting to get this as a gift from someone other than her mother, so perhaps it is best bought by the person who needs it.&lt;br /&gt;With 6 instruments of torture, this kit will certainly be able to tackle the most ferocious of pimples. The instruments themselves are professional grade, and come very nicely presented in a zippered case. They appear to be stainless steel, and very durable. I would expect them to last for many years. Included also is a free set of tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit comes with a 100% guarantee and explains that you can get a free instructional ebook once you have placed your order. The book explains the use of each tool, plus important sanitation instructions. They ask you to read the entire book before using the tools for removing blemishes. They also have a website that shows sample videos, but when I pulled it up, it is being redesigned, so I was not able to get any more information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, an excellent and useful kit for those in need. Well worth the cost - due to the high quality, you would never have to buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase.  Thank you for reading.</li>
            <li> I really like this item although it is a little tougher to use than I had expected. I guess I should say that it is not as effective as I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> Outstanding series amazing</li>
            <li> There is a perfect tool in this case for any type of acne you have. They work on the sizing scale, small tool to large depending on your issue. Blackheads come out with ease. White heads take a little more prodding, but so much better than squeezing your issue. None of them leave marks and puss generally comes out with ease. These tools will cover all your needs.</li>
            <li> The case on these is really nice and the products are well made. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because the consistency across the tools seems to be off. Some felt easier to use than others.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price.  Shipping was fast as well.</li>
            <li> Very professional product definitely recommend</li>
            <li> This kit has everything needed for blemishes.  My husband and I have both used it for a variety of blemishes. The tweezers work better than the ones I had prior to purchasing the kit. It comes with an ebook that is helpful. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product to have. I love everything about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne my entire life and been to more dermatologists than I can count on one hand. Needless to say- I know how these &#x27;blemish removers&#x27; work- because almost all dermatologists use them in cases of severe acne. You find the tool with the correctly sized head (matching the size of the pimple you hope to eliminate). You then use the tool to apply pressure to the area, popping the pimple and immediately cleaning away all of the discharge that comes from it. You use the tool to fully push out all of the discharge from your pimple- which helps cleanse the pore and prevents another pimple from showing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So- I got this kit. Instead of paying hundreds of dollars for a doctor to do this to me, I may as well pay the price of the kit and do it myself. Because I&#x27;d had this treatment done to me in the past, it was very easy to stand in front of a mirror and do it to myself. When I got a particularly bad break-out (during my period or because of stress), I&#x27;d pull this kit out and help nip my zits in the butt before they got too bad. I love this kit because it come in a small zip block case, so I can take it with me when I travel and also have it nicely stored away in my bathroom. I can keep all of the tools in one place, which is very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tools are made from stainless steel and are very easy to wash. I run them under very hot water once I&#x27;m finished using them, dry them completely, and then set them back in their kit until I need to use them again. I do suggest washing the tools after every use to prevent them from carrying over bacteria and dirt that may cause you to break-out again the next time you use them. Keep them clean and they&#x27;ll do their job perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you struggle with acne, or have a teen who struggles with acne, this kit can be a great investment. You&#x27;re pretty much avoiding expensive dermatologist appointments and instead opting to face the issue at home. I struggle with adult acne on and off and it&#x27;s such a relief to have this little handle blackhead and blemish buster tucked away in my bathroom drawer. I use it more than I wish I had to, but I&#x27;m glad to have it around when I need it.&#x27;s such a relief to have this little handle blackhead and blemish buster tucked away in my bathroom drawer.

            <li> Excellent&lt;br /&gt;Item was delivered on time, was as described, works great. Awesome product</li>
            <li> This kit is wonderful. It is the best and cleanest way to eliminate acne on your face. When using my hands I usually left a bigger mess by infecting the area. I had a white head, used the lancet and small loop to remove it. It cleared up by the evening because everything was clean. Also it helps fully remove any gunk in the pore. I love this. I have already recommended to friends.</li>
            <li> I received this as a promotion for the product launch and was pleased with the overall quality of the 7 tools. The tweezers are nice to use for multiple different purposes. The case is nice and compact and seems to be made well. It is easy to grab and go if you need this for traveling, as well as home use.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little 7-piece skin care kit. The zippered organizer case is well made, with a good quality zipper and a water-resistant black vinyl exterior (good for bathroom counters).&lt;br /&gt;The case is approximately the size of an eyeglasses case, and would not take up much space in a travel bag ( the current Amazon photo makes it appear larger than it is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 6 various blackhead tools, which look exactly like the photo. There&#x27;s also a pair of slanted tweezers, so 7 pieces in all.&lt;br /&gt;All are stainless steel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tool workmanship seems fine. I haven&#x27;t had these long enough to know whether they will rust over time, but fit and finish feel good.&lt;br /&gt;These seem well designed and ergonomic. They&#x27;re comfortable in the hand and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kits like these seem hard to find in local stores. Individual tools in local shops cost $4 to $7 for each tool, if you can find them.&lt;br /&gt;So at $20 delivered for 7 tools plus case this kit seems a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample sent for testing and impartial consumer review. I genuinely like this kit, it feels well made and it gives good results. I wish I&#x27;d had a set like this when I was going through my &#x27;adolescent skin&#x27; years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review is helpful to you as you research and comparison shop online.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and got a huge discount through Elite deal club</li>
            <li> have not used yet but&lt;br /&gt;well made tools</li>
            <li> My husband has had an enormous zit on his back for years. Notice I used past tense? It was the reason I bought this blemish removal tool kit and it worked amazingly well! I used a large loop on the zit and watched hardened zit goo rise like lava from a volcano! If I never use the tool kit again, it was worth the money!</li>
            <li> I received the item in a very bad condition, it was used and wasn&#x27;t even cleaned after! The pus from extraction, made on someone&#x27;s face, was on the extractors. And the bag was dirty from inside. It is unresponsible to sell this kind of items in that condition! I don&#x27;t know if the item is infected or contaminated, but it was used by the person with real skin problems! And no book or any bonus item came with it!</li>
            <li> I will preface this review by saying that this is not the kind of product that is used for something fun or glamorous. This is a skin blemish removal kit and is for dealing with the likes of blackheads, ingrown hairs, pimples, infected hair follicles and other similar problems - not an attractive topic but a real issue for many people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I am well beyond my puberty years I still deal with skin issues, usually ingrown hairs but sometimes other types of blemishes. It is traumatic to the skin to squeeze or pinch these blemishes so a kit like this is a gentler way to address such blemishes. I have not had it for a particularly long time but I have had it long enough to see its usefulness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a small kit, when opened and laid flat measures 7&amp;#34;x5.5&amp;#34; - not large at all. Closed it is folded in half, so this is a very compact and easily packable kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit comes with seven individual tools. There are multiple extraction/compression loops, a spoon extractor, a very sharp lancet (or, a “digger” if you prefer) and a pair of tweezers. The extraction/compression loops are mostly similar with the exception of one which is more round, and these are useful for manipulating pimples and blackheads loose. The spoon extractor is good for smaller blemishes. The lancet is exceptionally sharp and is good for piercing pimples with heads on them without the risk of forcing the infection into surrounding tissue. The tweezers of course are ideal for grabbing and pulling which is useful when dealing with ingrown hairs or infected follicles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no magic in this kit, it is essentially a tool kit for pinching and extracting like you might do with your fingers. That said, it covers a much smaller area than you would if you extracted with your fingers which causes a lot less irritation to surrounding tissue. It is also more sanitary, less messy and when used properly safer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each tool in this kit is made of stainless steel and is solid and durable. They can be bent but you really have to try to bend them to make that happen. They are easy to sterilize too and for all intents and purposes should be viewed as surgical tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this kit I was sent via email a PDF book on how to use this kit. Each tool in the kit with the exception of the tweezers is explained, and there are suggestions for reducing the occurrence of blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you deal with skin blemishes like blackheads, ingrown hairs and the like, this is a good kit that makes correcting the issue safer, easier and less messy (and usually less painful). It’s certainly a little less convenient than just pinching with your fingers but the benefits of cleanliness and reduced skin irritation outweigh that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.steel and is solid and durable.

            <li> This is an awesome kit. The only downside is the tweezers maybe it&#x27;s just mine but they don&#x27;t line up good and so it basically doesn&#x27;t grab any hair. But I bought this for the removers so it&#x27;s perfect and I use it super often love the variation of sizes</li>
            <li> Got these in the mail today and I am so happy to have one.  I purchased 2 for my daughters because they are always needing one.  I gave my oldest daughter hers today and she loves it.  She said she was going to have fun tonight.  I really like that there are different sizes and styles and the case is very compact.  Perfect for anyone who does facials.</li>
            <li> I received this at a promotional price for my review nice carrying cases tools are made well sturdy thankful for the instructions as I did not know there are so many tools to remove pimples but great to have</li>
            <li> I chose this for my niece she just hit teenager. I thought it was a great gift. It came in a beautiful case. The pieces are well mad and strong. It is high quality. I received this with a discount. But admit it turns out I was impressed.</li>
            <li> Two big pieces to comment on.  1.  The seller sent me info on use of the tools.  Very cool.  They even followed up after receipt of the kit, a very nice touch.  2.  The kit was in good condition.  The tools are clean and appear ready to use.  My kids ran off with my kit.  I might have to buy another set.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:fa2a01048ee155634b0cfda42261b83b]] I was first introduced to comedone extractors by an esthetician many years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since then, I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for reasonably priced extractors that actually do the job. After purchasing assorted ones from Sephora and Sally Beauty Supply, as well as the totally useless drugstore ones, I&#x27;d pretty much given up the hunt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying this set, I would encourage anyone to start with this one first. In my opinion, it is better, as well as a better value, than any of the others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;Unless you&#x27;re looking for a surgical lance (had one of those, too...lets just say they are best left in a surgeon&#x27;s hands!), this set will provide excellent results when used properly.&lt;br /&gt;And using them properly couldn&#x27;t be easier, there are many video tutorials, and the Apex company also has support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one extractor with a fenestrated cup...a tiny cup with a hole. As it pushes down, the debris is caught in the cup. The rest are the loop and wire types. A tweezers rounds out the set of seven tools.&lt;br /&gt;All is kept tidy in a compact zip around case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tools are not sterile when they arrive, of course. If you don&#x27;t have an autoclave, wash in hot soapy water and wipe with alcohol. It&#x27;s important to sanitize after each use, if you are looking at this set, I&#x27;m sure you already know that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For home use or in a spa setting, this set is quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE: Product received to test, with the option to review. No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned after testing.&lt;br /&gt;Views and opinions are my own. I have no affiliation with any manufacturer or distributor other than choosing to review their item.</li>
            <li> This is a nice blemish kit with lots of useful and well-constructed tools. The tools are very strong and will not bend under normal use. You&#x27;d have to apply A LOT of pressure to make these bend. Some tools are very similar to others or just slightly different but you get what you need, including a sharp piercing tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied pressure and glided some of these tools over my skin and... well, what can I say but it worked. Junk, gunk and oil came out... and with less (but not zero) side effects then using your fingers and finger nails to squeeze your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the chemical strips/extractions and will not be buying them again. It was interesting to see how they worked but I don&#x27;t want to use chemicals like that on my skin on a regular basis, not pay those kind of prices, nor deal with the limitations of where you can easily apply them... plus I did not think they worked all that well, only somewhat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s important to read the instructions. A &amp;#34;Banish the Blemishes!&amp;#34; PDF was emailed to me. It&#x27;s got some good information and tips, including instructions about using the tools in the kit and sanitation information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a couple of bad reviews... if you get a set like those described in the review, then definitely return it. My set was fine and I did not have those issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I was sent a free product sample for review. I was not paid or told what to write.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at a reduced price because I was willing to give my honest opinion. I gave this to my 2 finicky granddaughters to use and they love the item. They have tried each item in the case and all worked perfectly. It leaves a small red mark on the skin but it disappears in a very short time. I give this product a thumbs up for teenagers for all their belmishes and blackheads</li>
            <li> Pimple popping bliss! Love the instruments and case they come in.</li>
            <li> Well made kit. Sturdy with lots of good options.</li>
            <li> Though I don&#x27;t think of myself as having problem skin, I think everyone gets the occasional flare up, especially around hormonal times of the month, and while I had seen single implements like this at my local drugstore for $10-$15, I wasn&#x27;t really willing to splurge that much on just one little item, which I wasn&#x27;t entirely sure I&#x27;d use. However, having a set like this is great because you can pick the exact right tool for the job, and it helps clear things up faster and easier than just leaving them alone, which had been my previous strategy. Given that you get a whole kit of seven tools, many of which are double-sided, this is a great deal and the tools have sturdy handles and seem high quality and very unlikely to break. Though I received a sample for review, the opinion is my own.</li>
            <li> Overall a great kit.  The pieces are made of a durable steel, the ends don&#x27;t bend easily (which is good). All of the pieces seem to do the job they are intended to do. The pieces don&#x27;t fit very snug in the case, but that&#x27;s okay with me.  The case has a fairly strong zipper.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This kit is awesome. I no longer squeeze my black or white heads. It doesnt leave my pores large. PLease read manual. The tweezer is the bomb. I use it on my brows and it grips the hair like nobodies business.</li>
            <li> The lancet or tool for opening the whitehead was too large and not sharp enough to puncture small white heads,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not use</li>
            <li> Good quality product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was a wonderful gift for my mom she loves it</li>
            <li> I used pore strips and pore cleansers before, but they never worked, not even once. So why not? I had no experience with such tools, so I gave it a shot. BTW I didn&#x27;t expect much about this remover kit, because by looking at the photos, they look so simple and there&#x27;s nothing special about. But they actually did work. Very easy to use. Doesn&#x27;t take much time. I just removed three blackheads on my nose in 30 seconds. The free tweezers, also work well. Those extractors are sturdy, not flimsy. Don&#x27;t look that cheap. Anyway, be careful when using the lancet. It is very sharp like an awl.  The instructional e-book(14 pages, PDF) was sent via e-mail right after purchasing at Amazon. It tells us how to properly use each extractor, sanitary practices, and ways to prevent blemishes.</li>
            <li> This set blew me away, it&#x27;s very nice and so far works great. I got this during a 2pm deals on the elite club</li>
            <li> Everything you need in one package. I love it. When using it don&#x27;t press too hard it will leave a mark. I used a humidifier first.</li>
            <li> The tools are as sharp as they warn. Great kit though.&lt;br /&gt;*Got a discount for review *</li>
            <li> Great tools.  Removed a deeply embedded black head from my back that returned after an earlier visit to a dermatologist.  Now I&#x27;ll keep a watch and have the tools handy in case it (or another) comes back!</li>
