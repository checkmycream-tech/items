            <li>For the price this was perfect.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li>All good things to say.</li>
            <li>It does shrink but is still a good size to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great when used with a bath gel, like EO&#x27;s Rose and Chamomile.</li>
            <li>Love this, great for exfoliating.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;) lol</li>
            <li>Excellent replacement for my first cloth</li>
            <li>, effective, doesn&#x27;t smell or get mildew, what more can you ask for!</li>
            <li>Still a nice item.</li>
            <li>To be honest I threw mine in the can</li>
            <li>I love that it lathers up so well and holds soap fantastically.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I use dr.broners soap, the soap runs threw it and it takes forever to soak the water up to become use able.  </li>
            <li>These are fabulous washclothes!</li>
            <li>it makes my skin feel nice and smooth and they dont grow mold like body puffs do.</li>
            <li>this brand is great quality for a decent price and will buy from them for now on.</li>
            <li>Now, right before I jump in the shower, I just drop it in warm water to soften the plant fibers.</li>
            <li>Perfect for those who don&#x27;t like to put tons of harsh chemicals all over their skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth.</li>
            <li>This was my first ayate and love how this product works.</li>
            <li>Maybe a man could use it.&lt;br /&gt;I am using it in the kitchen sink to scrub it clean with AJAX powder.</li>
            <li>The size was perfect but the weave did not tighten up at all, and near the center of the cloth it quickly got looser and started to disintegrate.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of exfoliating cloth because it&#x27;s great for the skin, but often times, they fall apart or get worn quite fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks and have found it to provide a good balance of exfoliation and softness when wet.</li>
            <li>fresh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just right to exfoliate without the harshness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>has a nice scrubbing action that does not hurt the skin (and I have very sensitive skin.)</li>
            <li>Great cloth and came with a small sample of soap.</li>
            <li>DOES shrink a bit, but I found it works best and maintains the soap if you fold it in half after you wet</li>
            <li>Has good texture for general exfoliation but shrinks more than a little and curls up, refusing to flatten out completely.</li>
            <li>Very porous.</li>
            <li>And it looks and feels like it&#x27;s made of good quality, so I think it will definitely last longer than other exfoliating cloths.</li>
            <li>was using nylon scubber before which was causing irritation and didnt clean my skin near as good as this ayate scrub did and without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li>Bass has just replaced their awesome ayate wash cloth made in Mexico with a cheap, thick, woven sisal fluff cloth edged in canvas and made in China.  </li>
            <li>When I first got it, I left it in hot water to soak overnight to soften it.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a replacement for my plastic shower scrubbie and had high hopes for this.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t enough to make me return the item, but for those who care how their product looks, you may wish to check it before using for the first time.</li>
            <li>This new one I received is just like I remember my old one when it was new.</li>
            <li>I took a chance with this...  especially because in the photo and in real life</li>
            <li>all natural which is the reason # 1</li>
            <li>I have an old worn out one from years ago.</li>
            <li>The product is something I have ordered before from the distributor directly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and not made in China.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m giving it 4 starts because they should make it bigger as it shrinks to less than half its original  size once you wet it in warm water.</li>
            <li>You will be hooked and they do not sour or ever smell.</li>
            <li>but, now that they&#x27;ve replaced it with a cheap imitation from China, I&#x27;ve found other resources like this one.  </li>
            <li>It may last longer than those cheapo nylon scrubbers, but the lack of sudsing makes it way less useful to me than I&#x27;d hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>if it&#x27;s good for us who find ourselves in the most awful environments, it should be good for those of you who don&#x27;t have it as bad as we do.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need as much soap, in other words.  </li>
            <li>NO other way to describe such a product as this.</li>

            <li> NO other way to describe such a product as this.</li>
            <li> I purchase, which desperately needed to be discarded..too many holes.</li>
            <li> Nothing is better than coming back after 5-20 days with NO shower and using this bad boy to get all the filth and nastiness off of me.</li>
            <li> Buy ayate wash cloths from Mexico and avoid the Chinese sisal by Bass.</li>
            <li> After first use the weave shrunk unevenly and created hard ridges every inch.</li>
            <li> I placed this order via Amazon expecting (for the price) the cloth to be larger than those previously ordered cloths I purchased through the distributor directly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, but after using this for several months now, my skin feels properly scrubbed without the harshness you get from some nylon scrubbers.  </li>
            <li> It works especially well for the back shoulders which are hard to exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once it gets wet, the fibers expand and the weave gets tighter.  </li>
            <li> dunno , rough maybe...</li>
            <li> TOOOOOOOO rough for my skin.</li>
            <li> no better than a regular wash cloth would not buy again as others have noted it shrinks substantially after it gets wet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super soft, but it&#x27;s not super hard either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Ayate wash cloths from Bass for years</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the item I received has a single thick black and white synthetic-looking thread woven into the natural fibers that does not detract from the function.</li>
            <li> So much better than cloth or any little nylon puff that&#x27;s worthless.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, even after dousing it with about four times the amount of Dr. Bronners I normally use with my plastic scrubbie, it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;suds up&amp;#34; at all.</li>
            <li> I get exfoliation and bubbles, which was missing from the bar-soap pouch.</li>
            <li> They may get thin eventually, but it&#x27;s going to take a long time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to wring out...</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this was a dud or representative of the brand.  </li>
            <li> when you open the package it looks like it will be useless.  </li>
            <li> Got really small.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry that fast, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to get nasty just because it&#x27;s damp.  </li>
            <li> The wash cloth looks hard when you get it</li>
            <li> shocked I was to see the cloth was the same size, was still in the distributor&#x27;s packaging with the price noted as being $6.50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this cloth was of very poor quality compared to previously purchased ayate cloths.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a deployed Marine and the sad reality for us when deployed is that we&#x27;ll &amp;#34;never be clean.&amp;#34; Well, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Nothing bad.</li>

            <li> Unfortunately, this cloth was of very poor quality compared to previously purchased ayate cloths.  The size was perfect but the weave did not tighten up at all, and near the center of the cloth it quickly got looser and started to disintegrate.  I am not sure if this was a dud or representative of the brand.  I&#x27;ll be looking for a different brand next time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks and have found it to provide a good balance of exfoliation and softness when wet. Unfortunately, the item I received has a single thick black and white synthetic-looking thread woven into the natural fibers that does not detract from the function. It wasn&#x27;t enough to make me return the item, but for those who care how their product looks, you may wish to check it before using for the first time.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, but after using this for several months now, my skin feels properly scrubbed without the harshness you get from some nylon scrubbers.  It works especially well for the back shoulders which are hard to exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soft, effective, doesn&#x27;t smell or get mildew, what more can you ask for!</li>
            <li> no better than a regular wash cloth would not buy again as others have noted it shrinks substantially after it gets wet</li>
            <li> I took a chance with this...  especially because in the photo and in real life when you open the package it looks like it will be useless.  Once it gets wet, the fibers expand and the weave gets tighter.  I love that it lathers up so well and holds soap fantastically.  You don&#x27;t need as much soap, in other words.  It doesn&#x27;t dry that fast, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to get nasty just because it&#x27;s damp.  It&#x27;s a little hard to wring out... it holds the moisture a bit longer.  I love it though- has a nice scrubbing action that does not hurt the skin (and I have very sensitive skin.)</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as, I dunno , rough maybe... as I wanted it. I wanted something that almost takes off a layer of hide when I use it. This is not quite what I was hoping it to be. Still a nice item.</li>
            <li> all natural which is the reason # 1 i bought this product. was using nylon scubber before which was causing irritation and didnt clean my skin near as good as this ayate scrub did and without irritating my skin. i&#x27;m giving it 4 starts because they should make it bigger as it shrinks to less than half its original  size once you wet it in warm water.</li>
            <li> TOOOOOOOO rough for my skin. NO other way to describe such a product as this. Maybe a man could use it.&lt;br /&gt;I am using it in the kitchen sink to scrub it clean with AJAX powder.</li>
            <li> The price is cheaper on iherb.com but the results cannot be denied.  I get exfoliation and bubbles, which was missing from the bar-soap pouch. LOVE IT!!! Excellent replacement for my first cloth I purchase, which desperately needed to be discarded..too many holes.</li>
            <li> I use dr.broners soap, the soap runs threw it and it takes forever to soak the water up to become use able.  I take 10 min showers not hour baths. To be honest I threw mine in the can</li>
            <li> Love this, great for exfoliating. Perfect for those who don&#x27;t like to put tons of harsh chemicals all over their skin.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a replacement for my plastic shower scrubbie and had high hopes for this. Unfortunately, even after dousing it with about four times the amount of Dr. Bronners I normally use with my plastic scrubbie, it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;suds up&amp;#34; at all. It seems to just absorb all the soap and prevent sudsing somehow. It may last longer than those cheapo nylon scrubbers, but the lack of sudsing makes it way less useful to me than I&#x27;d hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may work with regular bodywash products (I haven&#x27;t tried) but it doesn&#x27;t work well at all with Dr. Bronners liquid soap.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking Sisal wash cloths or scrubbers can even compete with Ayate (agave fibers).  Bass has just replaced their awesome ayate wash cloth made in Mexico with a cheap, thick, woven sisal fluff cloth edged in canvas and made in China.  They&#x27;re the same price!  Ayate doesn&#x27;t mildew and lasts forever.  I&#x27;ve been buying Ayate wash cloths from Bass for years but, now that they&#x27;ve replaced it with a cheap imitation from China, I&#x27;ve found other resources like this one.  The wash cloth looks hard when you get it but, as soon as it hits water, it shrinks up and gets thicker.  Everyone I&#x27;ve purchased these for have been using them for years.  They simply don&#x27;t wear out.  They may get thin eventually, but it&#x27;s going to take a long time.  Do yourself a favor.  Buy ayate wash cloths from Mexico and avoid the Chinese sisal by Bass.</li>
            <li> Has good texture for general exfoliation but shrinks more than a little and curls up, refusing to flatten out completely.</li>
            <li> I have an old worn out one from years ago. It dawned on me to check Amazon,  of course! This new one I received is just like I remember my old one when it was new. These are fabulous washclothes! So much better than cloth or any little nylon puff that&#x27;s worthless. These are NOTHING like those. You will be hooked and they do not sour or ever smell. Wash in washer with regular towels. All good things to say. Nothing bad. Your skin will thank you.</li>
            <li> i have been using this for years. i change mine out about every year or so when it gets worn out. this brand is great quality for a decent price and will buy from them for now on. it makes my skin feel nice and smooth and they dont grow mold like body puffs do. the cost also equals about what you would spend on body puffs in a year so get one now! &#x3D;) lol</li>
            <li> Great cloth and came with a small sample of soap. This was my first ayate and love how this product works. My skin is so smooth. For the price this was perfect.</li>
            <li> No, it didn&#x27;t meet expectations. After first use the weave shrunk unevenly and created hard ridges every inch. The second one just shrunk up a lot. Got really small.</li>
            <li> Shrinks up to approx. a 5X5 square. Very porous. The only way I have found to use it is to wrap a bar of soap in it. Not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a deployed Marine and the sad reality for us when deployed is that we&#x27;ll &amp;#34;never be clean.&amp;#34; Well, I was wrong. I had this thing shipped to me and my oh my! Nothing is better than coming back after 5-20 days with NO shower and using this bad boy to get all the filth and nastiness off of me. I feel rejuvenated...fresh. It&#x27;s not super soft, but it&#x27;s not super hard either. It&#x27;s just right to exfoliate without the harshness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It DOES shrink a bit, but I found it works best and maintains the soap if you fold it in half after you wet it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if it&#x27;s good for us who find ourselves in the most awful environments, it should be good for those of you who don&#x27;t have it as bad as we do. Try it out...you&#x27;ll never want to use a regular towel again.</li>
            <li> The product is something I have ordered before from the distributor directly.  I placed this order via Amazon expecting (for the price) the cloth to be larger than those previously ordered cloths I purchased through the distributor directly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How shocked I was to see the cloth was the same size, was still in the distributor&#x27;s packaging with the price noted as being $6.50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon charged me $9.99 for the very same size cloth!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of exfoliating cloth because it&#x27;s great for the skin, but often times, they fall apart or get worn quite fast. This cloth differs. It&#x27;s all natural and not made in China. And it looks and feels like it&#x27;s made of good quality, so I think it will definitely last longer than other exfoliating cloths. When I first got it, I left it in hot water to soak overnight to soften it. It does shrink but is still a good size to use. Now, right before I jump in the shower, I just drop it in warm water to soften the plant fibers. It&#x27;s great when used with a bath gel, like EO&#x27;s Rose and Chamomile.</li>
