            <li>Loved it so much that I called the resort and asked them where they purchase the blowdryers, lol!</li>
            <li>I just got this dryer for Christmas, and I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>I am SO glad that I did!  </li>

            <li>I love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li>It does a great job, is easy to use and dependable.  </li>
            <li>Great buy, easy on the hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is hands down the best hair dryer for the best price on the Internet.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful, very good for straightening, and the high/low heat and air settings are handy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>but the result after use is amazing.</li>
            <li>Fantastic blow dryer and the price was great.</li>
            <li>this blow dryer is amazing.</li>
            <li>but I am thrilled with this dryer.  </li>
            <li>It always has a good shine and never leaves that static cling effect.  </li>
            <li>D&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never been particularly handy with the attachments, but they&#x27;re there.  </li>
            <li>was a nice dryer while it lasted.  </li>
            <li>she has her own shop .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice dryer, but it&#x27;s nothing too snazy.</li>
            <li>Adds nice volume to my hair.</li>
            <li>I wanted my own hair dryer instead of having to use my mothers.</li>
            <li>so it wouldn&#x27;t be good for someone with gripping or strength concerns.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair nice and curly.  </li>
            <li>I would indeed tell others that this is the dryer to own.</li>
            <li>brilliant product, excellent delivery service, love the finish of the haridrier, I didn&#x27;t realised that it was American plug</li>
            <li>Nice, but doesn&#x27;t make your hair look any nicer)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice variety of attachments that stay attached nicely!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>Take a while to warm up.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After owning this for most of a month I am still very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Is most better than Solano,and we know that solano i good...</li>

            <li>And no, I&#x27;m not the one to sit and write reviews unless I feel very strongly about something.</li>

            <li>but so far it is excellent.  </li>
            <li>2014 Review: Great dryer, good price, good overall!</li>
            <li>I liked the range in heat and speed of airflow much better than what I replaced this with.  </li>
            <li>Awesome does the job like a professional</li>
            <li>but honestly I don&#x27;t think it works any better than a $20 or $30 dryer would.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all this is an awesome machine that gets the job done in way less time and with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes hair so silky and dries very quickly!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this dryer!</li>
            <li>For the first couple of months, it took a great deal of effort and force to get the concentrator nozzle attached.  </li>
            <li>It dries fast and beautifully.</li>
            <li>The report on this one was very accurate.  </li>
            <li>and they replaced both items free of charge, even though I&#x27;d had the dryer for more than a year!</li>
            <li>I LOVED how fast it was to blowdry my hair !!</li>
            <li>Very good for my granddaughter&#x27;s thick,course,and natural  hair without putting a perm in it.</li>
            <li>I love the blowdryer</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very happy with its performance.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if the dryer would work wonders with my hair type.  </li>

            <li>On top of that the directional nossel is metal</li>
            <li>I just keep having more and more issues the longer</li>
            <li>I LOVE (and am STILL using) this product.</li>
            <li>I am glad that she loves it.</li>

            <li>Great product and fast delivery</li>
            <li>I decided to make sure it worked before I threw away all the packaging.  </li>
            <li>I almost didn&#x27;t purchase it because of the price, but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>

            <li>ANDIS BLOW DRYERS ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THE ONES YOU BUY IN CHAIN STORES.  </li>

            <li>I also love the sleek chrome color.</li>
            <li>I purchased the same one 7 years ago and it worked perfectly until I plugged it into a hotel plug and it blew.</li>
            <li>I love the look and the power of the dryer but something about the Ion makes my hair greasy.</li>
            <li>I generally love the Andis product when I travel</li>
            <li>Love this blowdryer.</li>
            <li>it does everything I need it to do and more.</li>
            <li>Why can&#x27;t they design something sleeker and more convenient?</li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li>says &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; but most are practically disposable, they are so cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I wish I could give it more stars.</li>
            <li>LOVE this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I stayed at a hotel that had an Andis dryer in it, and immediately fell in love.</li>
            <li>It is more appropriate for the salon.</li>
            <li>This blow dryer is most def.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>so my hair dries fast, which is great.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve purchased an adaptor from amazon and all sorted! :)</li>
            <li>much more than others.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love all the attachments and the fact they don&#x27;t fall off when you use them.</li>
            <li>It did not smell like burnt, the safety plug was OK, I disconnected and reconnected- nothing.</li>
            <li>She uses it most days.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I did love the blowdryer when it function.</li>
            <li>I love this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>and it is more powerfull than the Conair even though they are 1875 Watt.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I chose the Andis instead of another Conair.  </li>
            <li>I would be glad to recommend this Andis 82005 to my family and friends.</li>
            <li>Glad I was able to find it on here, and I am back in love again!!!</li>
            <li>This appliance is just what I needed and I love it so much I bought an appliance holder for my counter to keep it handy at all times!</li>
            <li>This dryer works great with high rate of usage.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this dryer for my sister and she loved it, it was exactly as the page and picture described</li>
            <li>I prefer my blow dryers to be able to blow very hot air rather than just luke warm.</li>
            <li>An article of top quality and utility... and easy to use with quality materials for life and 100% recommended ...</li>
            <li>Not like toasty warm - HOT!    </li>
            <li>That alone is amazing and worth the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be happy with this if you&#x27;re looking for a professional grade dryer.</li>
            <li>Great hairdryer, probably the closest thing to a professional grade product that I&#x27;ll ever get.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t fit, however I could just be mixing them up because I&#x27;ve had so many blow dryers throughout the years.</li>
            <li>My hair feels salon smooth now without all the frizz when I&#x27;m outdoors :)</li>
            <li>and she said so far, it is a great hair dryer.</li>
            <li>but I purchased this product I was surprised that makes my hair not so fly away.</li>
            <li>good, fast drier.  </li>
            <li>ultra good Dryer thanks</li>
            <li>I needed a dryer with a very long cord and this one fit the bill perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Very Good hair dryer, very professional with nice controls and a nice long cord.</li>
            <li>I got this dryer for Christmas last year, and I absolutley loved it!</li>
            <li>Drys hair very quickly and does not damage hair.</li>
            <li>The buttons on the handle are easily avoided once you use the dryer a couple of times.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully, Amazon makes returns easy.  </li>
            <li>Even when I managed to get it on, it was easy to knock it off during the course of drying my hair.  </li>
            <li>Easy to handle and use.  </li>
            <li>It dries my hair very quickly.</li>
            <li>Hangs up easily when not in use.</li>
            <li>The warm and hot temps are spot on.  </li>
            <li>I love that it has the Ionic  capability and the cool air, to help decrease the frizzie&#x27;s and keep my hair style set.</li>
            <li>I like that you can have it on hot or warm air.</li>
            <li>it makes the hair look like you left the salon beautiful.</li>
            <li>Although I liked it when it worked, the handle became extremely hot while holding it longer than a minute.</li>
            <li>This was a fine dryer, but I returned it.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer works fine.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy until it just died, mid way, through my first use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine...</li>
            <li>Straighten out my hair just fine.</li>
            <li>I purchased this hair dryer to replace my Super Solano that died after more than a decade.  </li>
            <li>Dries hair quickly and is light weight!  </li>
            <li>I am happy to receive this dryer so quickly since my old one died.</li>
            <li>I RECOMMEND THIS DRYER TO ANYONE WHO WANTS GREAT LOOKING HAIR FAST AND EASY</li>
            <li>i have to say i was a never a hair/ blowdryer person, but i see a huge difference using this.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer does a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li>It was quiet, and my hair felt great after drying it.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s bought cheap hair dryers for years and ends up burning them up after 6 months to a year.  </li>
            <li>It is still a fabulous asset in my morning routine.</li>
            <li>Dryer needs a place where you can secure the attachments in place</li>
            <li>I 1st used an Andis hair dryer in a hotel in Arizona where the heat frizzed out my hair, this dryer provides a smooth blow out that lasts.</li>
            <li>2 out of the 3 attachments don&#x27;t fit the dryer;</li>
            <li>After drying the hair it looked fabulous it just blew with the wind bouncy.  </li>
            <li>It motivated me to go out and purchase another blow dryer to replace the cheap Walmart brand that I had bought before.</li>
            <li>my hair was smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>This is a great blow dryer, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>Overall a great dryer</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t mind the sound quality,</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth and silky with no product.</li>
            <li>From reading the specs and reviews on this Andis 82005 dryer, I felt this one fit the bill.</li>
            <li>Nice wattage and fast drying.</li>
            <li>I was so happy initially with this dryer, but after the straightening pick attachment broke</li>
            <li>My hair has come out fantastic every time with this.</li>
            <li>Everything else about it is --- so far, so good.</li>
            <li>The Hair Dryer it is an excelen product, it works properly, so far so good</li>
            <li>i bought this for a christmas present and my wife love it good attacment that she use all the time.</li>
            <li>The product is very powerful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very powerful</li>
            <li>This a great dryer, dries hair fast, no frizz main reason I bought.</li>
            <li>awesome hair dryer,this is not a cheap one from your local variety store,well built works great worth every pennie</li>
            <li>Light weight, powerful and easy to use.</li>
            <li>But using the Andis is like a breath of fresh air!</li>
            <li>In August I noticed that it just didn&#x27;t feel hot any more.</li>
            <li>Dropped my wife&#x27;s original one on a tile floor and it shattered.</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>the first days love it....</li>
            <li>Wish it had better attachments; tooth if the comb attachment broke on first use.</li>
            <li>Long cord and great power drying.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;&#x27;s too noisy and powerful !</li>
            <li>It was worth every penny, I wish I had heard about this sooner!</li>
            <li>I realize that it is not the fault of the retailer but am more than willing to send pics and the dryer and my hand.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Quick dry time, bouncy, beautiful hair</li>
            <li>Amazing I love this blow dryer, I had the red one when I was in hair school</li>
            <li>The more natural and/or organic the better.</li>
            <li>On the flip side, it&#x27;s strong and powerful.</li>
            <li>I still get a nice soft pressed look!</li>
            <li>very cheap end of what I know Andis is capable of.  </li>
            <li>Just as the other reviews said, this dryer is great- drys your hair very fast and somehow manages to eliminate static which is always a problem for me in the winter.</li>
            <li>Nothing special here.</li>
            <li>I originally rated this a 4 star but am now changing it to a 1 star because this dryer broke quickly.  </li>
            <li>but it makes it feel much sturdier than most of the plastic ones.  </li>
            <li>My hair has more volume with no frizz, and it looks much smoother.</li>
            <li>My hair has zero static, which is unusual during the winter.  </li>
            <li>The heat and wattage combined helps keep my hair shiny, healthy and straight.</li>
            <li>It has several settings that are good as well.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice professional hair dryer, so far its working nicely.</li>
            <li>(the cool shot button truly does help)and use a non-buildup non-oily heat treatment.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d prefer having a cool temp setting</li>
            <li>Works very well for many uses, we used it to remove vinyl letters from  our trailer.  </li>
            <li>Overall the unit is good.  </li>
            <li>My mom used daily, good quality, and fulfills the functions for which it is made.</li>
            <li>in all, not a bad dryer...</li>
            <li>other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Other than that this dryer is great</li>
            <li>Other then that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>Dries my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>It dries my hair quickly and it does not leave my hair frizzy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer works extremely quickly.</li>
            <li>dries quickly is always a process.  </li>
            <li>It dries your hair quickly.</li>
            <li>This is ok, I don&#x27;t think that it gets as hot as the gold n hot series</li>
            <li>Dries hair fairly quickly (with Ion technology)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Drys hair quickly and without allot of noise</li>
            <li>It warms up quickly and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer dries my hair quickly and gives me the smoothness that I want.  </li>
            <li>The positive reviews were true!</li>
            <li>The ratings were high, so I decided to get the latest edition and try it out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cute dryer, but when I turned it on high and shut it off it would smoke.</li>
            <li>Love it and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It still work as it did the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li>It does get very, very hot on the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; setting, but</li>
            <li>But based on her smile and shouting things like \\&quot;cool blast\\&quot;, I&#x27;m assuming she loves it.  </li>
            <li>This is a beautiful chrome/gun metal looking dryer with an extra long cord that I love.</li>
            <li>Awesome blow dryer, and flash of cold heat, Love the way my hair feels Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
            <li>, the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is, it doesn&#x27;t have a cool button it has warm</li>
            <li>The attachments don&#x27;t really snap on, you just place them on and they can easily pop off&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>Her comments included, worked great and was fast without overdrying her long hair.</li>
            <li>The attachment is very hot after using it, so maybe prepare a cloth when you want to take it off or let it cool off first.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant to purchase since it was rather cheap for a good ionic dryer</li>
            <li>I only use the warm setting-- hot is too hot for me, and I appreciate the cool burst though I wish it had a cool setting.</li>
            <li>I am happy with my purchase of this hair dryer, although I do not really notice much of a difference that it is an ionic dryer.  </li>
            <li>Works great, a bit heavy.</li>
            <li>It blows cool air on the hot setting.</li>
            <li>Powerful and totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>It also connects to my diffuser well, and it made my hair curly way better than my old hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>It IS a bit heavier than what I am used to, but the results are well worth it.</li>
            <li>I had a T3 that I spent a lot of $ on, and it only lasted 2 years......not great in my book!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled that drying my hair is not a ten to fifteen minute ordeal, closer to five.</li>
            <li>I do a lot of natural hair and it smooth out that cuticle allowing me to Flatiron the hair smooth</li>
            <li>This dryer has good power &amp; my hair comes out good (thin straight hair).</li>
            <li>The first day I got it,  I accidentally dropped it in a sink full of water-</li>
            <li>worth the price</li>
            <li>Extremely powerful</li>
            <li>After our old dryer bit the dust, I wanted to replace it with one that worked just as well, but also quieter, lighter, and had more features.  </li>
            <li>Ordered this after checking the great reviews to replace my 5-year old dryer that&#x27;s starting to diminish in performance.</li>
            <li>While drying my hair, and I have short hair, the handle became warm, then smoked then burned my hand.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m giving it a star because when I turned it on and placed it on the highest setting it got warm enough for my intended uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but some things are just worth it.</li>
            <li>When mine bites the dust I will replace it with the same kind</li>
            <li>It gets super hot, has good settings you can adjust if you don&#x27;t want the hot feature, and it really is professional quality (even though I feel like ALL blow dryers say &#x27;professional&#x27;).  </li>
            <li>wife loved it and has a similar but older model drier that still works ( for 5 years,</li>
            <li>Other than that I loved this hair dryer.   </li>
            <li>They are right where I grip the dryer</li>
            <li>The power &amp; heat buttons are right where your hand goes, so</li>
            <li>Also, every once in a while I accidentally turn it off because the setting switches are right about where my hand goes, but I guess that&#x27;s the tradeoff for them being in a convenient place.  </li>
            <li>I am right handed, andthe way I hold this dryer, allows me to  </li>
            <li>It does get very hot but thats a good thing for me at least :) I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had great customer service experience with Andis in the past as well.</li>
            <li>A really nice long cord.</li>
            <li>I really thought the \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; drying system was just tech hype, but this thing really dries quickly!  </li>
            <li>I love it and will get one for my niece with very thick hair, who borrowed it and loved it also.</li>
            <li>&amp; I like it super straight &amp; swingy)...&amp;</li>
            <li>Not only is this product worth every penny, but I love the resin pick, the color of the product and the comb</li>
            <li>This dries my hair quickly without an intense level of heat.</li>
            <li>The motor is loud, but again these are the trade offs to gain more time while getting ready.</li>
            <li>I bought this hair dryer after using the travel size at a Towne Place Suites thinking that if the small one was great, the big one would be better.</li>
            <li>Other than that she loves it very much and is very glad she got it.</li>
            <li>What a rip off, i have another \\&quot;professional\\&quot; dryer that is 15 years old, still blowing hot and strong.  </li>
            <li>My dog preferred the low warm or hot while I preferred fast and hot.  </li>
            <li>Very fast and rightly hot.</li>
            <li>She accidently dropped the hot blow dryer between her legs.  </li>
            <li>I bought an Andis many years ago and it was wonderful, so I bought this model in June 2009, and sadly today in December 2011 it finally fizzled</li>
            <li>so it gets really hot</li>
            <li>It leaves my soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>its like hot.  </li>
            <li>At first, it was difficult for me to figure out the best way to hold it because of it&#x27;s size and placement of the controls.</li>
            <li>I had to wait a minute or two to reattach it because the nozzle was too hot to handle.  </li>
            <li>It could have just been the dryer that I got, just be aware if you purchase one.</li>
            <li>We noticed that although it was turned off (but plugged in) it was extremely hot to the touch.  </li>
            <li>I love the hair dryer but the comb attachment starting breaking on our first use.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair that is almost to the bottom of my lower back (or top of my bottom, lol).</li>
            <li>As soon as I turned it on there was a funny burning smell.  </li>
            <li>no luck, it just stopped blowing hot air.  </li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>2 weeks after I ordered this hairdryer it stopped blowing hot air.</li>
            <li>This is my first ceramic blow dryer and it did wonders to my hair.</li>
            <li>but when I first bought it, it was $35.</li>
            <li>It blow drys my hair pretty well.</li>
            <li>I have worked in a salon for ten years, and I love this blow-dryer.</li>
            <li>recieved hair dryer in timely matter and tried it the first day i got it.</li>
            <li>You know, hot air blows out.</li>
            <li>It really works well!</li>
            <li>First time I tried it out was at a resort in Napa.</li>
            <li>This is the first hair dryer I have ever owned that did not leave my hair smelling like smoke.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a sturdy, hot dryer.</li>
            <li>The hand grip gets too hot to hold after about 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>This dryer is constructed to be a first class item.  </li>
            <li>This is my first Ceramic Ionic hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I have thick wavy hair and it does a great job is fixing the frizzies</li>
            <li>I downgraded from a Chi (that burnt out after about two years) and a higher priced dryer from a beauty supply store, and I would recommend this mid-priced dryer as well as any of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I first reviewed this product in the winter of 2013</li>
            <li>Dries my hair fast!</li>
            <li>The dryer, which has a lot of power, does not seem to ever get hot.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This was a good but heavy dryer while it lasted.  </li>
            <li>it leaves your hair feeling nice and soft not dry and brittle !</li>
            <li>The only thing that keeps it from being 5 star is the fact that there are only two temperatures, hot and warm, and the hot is REALLY hot, so I use the cool shot button a lot.</li>
            <li>This blow dryer gets my hair straight without the extra hassle plus the comb attachment makes it super easy.</li>
            <li>The high speed setting is perfect for blow drying my short hair, and the ionic characteristic makes hair soft.  </li>
            <li>I plan on buying another one soon and if you have hair that is thick or you are of mixed race, this comb is great!  </li>
            <li>The only con is that the dryer is kind of loud but trust me, you won&#x27;t care once you put it to your hair.</li>
            <li>This is the most pretty dryer that I have seen in a long time.  </li>
            <li>Does a great job drying but it is loud and heavy compared to what I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>When my inexpensive, but reliable blow dryer died after 4 years I purchased this one based on the number of positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I love this, it has a long cord</li>
            <li>Not only is it slick and great to look at; it is light weight, has attachments and is more than I expected.</li>
            <li>I love the nozzle attachments included with it and its long cord.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to it when we stayed at a very upscale hotel.</li>
            <li>It seems to do a good job drying my hair even though, its hard to tell because I do not have very much hair</li>
            <li>i have to put in more work to blow dry.</li>
            <li>Protects your hair, the hair dryer is very neat, and it gas a long cord, I love it.  </li>
            <li>(I use the low setting every day), and it dries my hair very quickly.</li>
            <li>Unlike some of the reviews I do not feel it is heavy ,but I have always used a full sized dryer as opposed to some of the more compact ones out there in the market.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly large for operating</li>
            <li>how large it is.  </li>
            <li>I have used several blow dryers and this one has help protect breakage, it&#x27;s easy to use and to store, and eliminates me from oiling or heating my hair as much without it&#x27;s Ionic Ceramic Support.</li>
            <li>Low setting is to strong and to fast also</li>
            <li>This is a very good hair dryer, especially if you are less accustomed to professional dryers.</li>
            <li>its super loud and kind of heavy.</li>
            <li>Also, even on the high setting, the hair dyer doesn&#x27;t get really hot.</li>
            <li>She has very thick hair and hair dryer worked great for her.</li>
            <li>So far it is worth the money.  </li>

            <li>Works fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>This drier is the cheapest ceramic ionic drier I have found, and it truly works fast.  </li>
            <li>it dries my hair so fast without any damage.  </li>
            <li>I can definitely tell that my hair is healthier than when I used a cheap hair dryer.      </li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t really help me with mine.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair, but I have frizz within 20 minutes of doing my hair....</li>
            <li>It is light weight, has plenty of power and yet is incredibly quiet.  </li>
            <li>I dont really know if i like it.</li>
            <li>This dryer drys my hair extremely fast.</li>
            <li>I really really like this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>The one I purchased was also ionic, but much quieter owing to the fact that it had three speeds and two heat settings.</li>
            <li>The look is modern...</li>
            <li>The attachments don&#x27;t seem to fit the dryer and fall off or simply can not be secured to the dryer.</li>
            <li>Dries my hair fast and makes it shiny.  </li>
            <li>Every minute counts when your getting ready.</li>
            <li>The blow dryer got my hair straighter and fast.</li>
            <li>I really did.</li>
            <li>so I have options for how much heat I put on my hair.</li>
            <li>is really sleek.</li>
            <li>but I dont mind it much.</li>
            <li>Really like the hair blower.</li>
            <li>fast do its no problem</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price, but even at the Friday sale price this feels overpriced.</li>
            <li>Lots of power and the ionic features leaves my hair really shiny.</li>
            <li>WORKS GREAT,DRYS HAIR FAST LIKE</li>
            <li>she never complained about it being to hot or the comb pulling her hair.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>the dryer heats up fast and the straightening pick that come with it really works.</li>
            <li>It dries fast yet gently.</li>
            <li>Lots of heat and power, real pro dryer.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight.  </li>
            <li>It dries your hair really fast and allows it to be as straight or as curly as you want.</li>
            <li>I also really like the nozzles that come with the dyer.  </li>
            <li>Drys fast and styles with attachments that came with it.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer has a very sleek design and has a lot of power.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to hold the button so much.</li>
            <li>The dryer work really well...</li>
            <li>I guess I expected more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s surprisingly reasonably priced considering the quality.</li>
            <li>She has been very please.  </li>
            <li>This dryer gets my hair straight</li>
            <li>It works really well so far and its Ionic function makes my hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>really wanted to like it</li>
            <li>Dries fast and leaves my hair shiny and straight.</li>
            <li>Price of the item was reasonable as was the shipping cost.</li>
            <li>Really like this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Well not so much.</li>
            <li>Very windy.</li>
            <li>Thanks, And is.</li>
            <li>have very course 4a hair type</li>
            <li>I do believe it is just a bit heavier than the Conair dryer but not so much that causes me a problem.  </li>
            <li>It was packaged very well and arrived two days after I placed my order.  </li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li>I initially liked this dryer but it is heavy and</li>
            <li>It did come with attachments that I have no idea what their purpose is, so those are kind of a waste.    </li>
            <li>After my expensive blow dryer bit the dust, I was looking for a more affordable but just as effective replacement.</li>
            <li>Its also cumbersome &amp; heavy &amp; too large  &amp; the warm setting is far too hot...</li>
            <li>so you need to have a strong hand to hold it up for a long time if you have a lot of hair.  </li>
            <li>, other then that I love it</li>
            <li>The cord is really long, which is great because the only outlet I have in my bathroom has ruined several blow dryers by melting the plug.</li>
            <li>Every diff-user accessory comes with the hairdryer is better than the other.</li>
            <li>Nice long cord, drys much faster than my last 2 dryers.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it is great, very hot, very high-powered, but doesn&#x27;t cut off a LOT of time off using my old dryer.</li>
            <li>Definitely for a strong professional.</li>
            <li>It dries your hair quickly, and leaves it feeling soft not dried out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly heavier than other hair dryers but is also more visually appealing.</li>
            <li>I have straight, fine hair that normally takes forever to dry</li>
            <li>I was primarily looking for something with a long cord.  </li>
            <li>Outside stays cool to touch</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, design of switches and location cause my wife and I both to shut the unit down while in use when moving it around and changing hands.</li>
            <li>My hair is noticeably straighter and very soft since starting to use this dryer, I don&#x27;t necessarily feel it dries my hair any quicker than my old one  did, but the end results are definitely  better!</li>
            <li>Unlike most non-commercial hair dryers, it gets hot enough to quickly dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>It looks great and dries my long hair in about 5 mins (half the time it took with my old Conair dryer).  </li>
            <li>I decided to spend a little extra and get her a good one.  </li>
            <li>love it, powerful, it doesn&#x27;t get hot, it doesn&#x27;t smell like burning, it dries my hair leaving it soft and shiny, no frizzy and also it dries my hair in no time, I have sorta thick hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid a lot more money for a lot less.</li>
            <li>Much better than a previous version that had the power but also the added weight.  </li>
            <li>I love this blow dryer,because it get the job done,for less the price.</li>
            <li>(or so it feel like it weights more than a typical dryer)</li>
            <li>my hair holds better is shinier, and less damaged looking.</li>
            <li>I am so entirely pleased with this hair dryer that I&#x27;m coming back for another one... 2 1/2 years later.</li>
            <li>It would work great for someone with regular hair, not too thick.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice a weight difference between this and my older Conair.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure, but either way it works great and has lasted for a long time.</li>
            <li>I bought it mainly because of the comb attachment.</li>
            <li>Therefore, it is extremely important for me to be extra sensitive and mindful to the type of products I use on my hair.</li>
            <li>so I have to hold the dryer farther away than with my older dryer.</li>
            <li>Amazon was quick about sending me a second blow dryer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and the attachments come in hamdy, especially the comb one.</li>
            <li>Works great only complaint is that when using the attachment it doesn&#x27;t always stay on when trying to change the diretion.</li>
            <li>VERY LOUD!  </li>
            <li>My hair is really thick after I wash it and this dryer makes my hair feel softer (because it&#x27;s an ionic dryer) and more manageable!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended...</li>
            <li>I ran it for about 30 seconds on high and turned it off and smoke came out of the barrel.  </li>
            <li>and it is in high end hotel rooms.  </li>
            <li>i would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Too loud !!</li>
            <li>This product does justice to those who have thick, full hair to even silky fine hair.</li>
            <li>It is very powerful and  dries my long hair (complete with styling it) in under 10 minutes!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem heavier than any other powerful dryer, and it dries hair twice as quick as others we&#x27;ve had that are marketed as professional strength.</li>
            <li>the reviews were not as fabulous as I expected....</li>
            <li>My hair looks really shiny after using and soft.</li>
            <li>It drys my hair twice as fast as my old one.</li>
            <li>This has really been a staple, espically since trying to transition from relaxed to natural hair.  </li>
            <li>Dries my hair so much faster than my old dryer.</li>
            <li>I cant believe that Hair dryer fast than old hair dryer ..  </li>
            <li>I had an Andis hair dryer before and this one is just as good if not better than the last one I owned.  </li>
            <li>Before purchasing this hair dryer I read pretty much all of the reviews on the earlier edition.  </li>
            <li>Not this one, it is powerful enough,</li>
            <li>I loved all the different settings because I could use it on my small dod with no problems.  </li>
            <li>and what would normally take about 30 minutes</li>
            <li>please cool your hair down first</li>
            <li>The dryer appears to be very heavy duty and good enough to be used at the hair salons.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Few reviewers have mentioned the extra-long cord, which is a major positive selling point for me.  </li>
            <li>Do not get cross minded when choosing this hair dryer because it get the job done right.</li>
            <li>i dont think is great dryer because it dont dry my hair the way i expected it to dry.</li>
            <li>Great long cord and dries my thick hair faster than my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Only when you have it on high setting does hot air blow out</li>
            <li>I was in a hurry for a new dryer</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone looking for a new dryer.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without this</li>
            <li>Also, I ordered for a new item.</li>
            <li>She can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I needed a new hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>My wife loves this new hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>bought this product for my mom for christmas, she needs a new one every year, i dont know what she does</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to last so much longer.</li>
            <li>my other ionic hair dryer just quite, so took a chance on this brand and not sorry what so ever!!</li>
            <li>I decided to give this a try and was very surprised.</li>
            <li>If you switch attachments while you dry your hair this isn&#x27;t or you, they get very hot.</li>
            <li>It is super heavy and doesn&#x27;t even blow hot air.</li>
            <li>said her hair felt different the first morning she used it.  </li>
            <li>Only thing I didn&#x27;t care for was how hot the attachments got after using.</li>
            <li>So far, the Andis 82005 is holding up well!</li>
            <li>The first one I purchased had to be returned the same week.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>BUT it did die out exactly a year later.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as light as it looks but about average weight.</li>
            <li>fairly quiet and love the optional speeds and temp&#x27;s that my other one didn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Heavier than the last two dryers we&#x27;ve had (Hot Tools Tourmaline Lite 1043</li>
            <li>only concern after a year is the handle gets extremely hot now</li>
            <li>I also have two different textures wavy and coarse in the back, fine and straight in the front.</li>
            <li>On my way to return it now, but this time asked for a refund, and will try to find a new version of my old dryer.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this hair dryer because it gets the job done in less time.  </li>
            <li>and I can only tell you that any professional hair dryer is going to pretty close to this weight.</li>
            <li>Also, with cheaper dryers, if you turn it off after several minutes of use, you have to wait for it to cool before it will come back on.</li>
            <li>Here is a tip I learned, when planning on using hot curlers, flat irons etc.</li>
            <li>When you are holding a dryer to dry your entire head, you want it to be light.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair less frizzy and staticy and leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>A LONG TIME AGO ,HAD MANY OTHER HAIR DRYERS</li>
            <li>I have very wavy hair and using a large round boar brush and now much easier to straighten.</li>
            <li>I expected at this price for it to last longer than a cheap dryer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a far shorter task with this dryer, and neither of us end up sweating.     </li>
            <li>It looks and feels professional.    </li>
            <li>It has the professional look and feel you&#x27;d expect from Andis.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a professional hair dryer...</li>
            <li>All natural.  </li>
            <li>It looks classy, still after 6 months of use every day it looks new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am a professional</li>
            <li>makes my hair feel soft and silky..</li>
            <li>it was completely submerged.</li>
            <li>It is too loud.  </li>
            <li>Well made, but this baby is loud.</li>
            <li>I do wish it wasn&#x27;t as loud though.</li>
            <li>I had a professional hair dryer which died</li>
            <li>It does seem like a professional hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I thought my old dryer was loud and wanted something quieter this time around.</li>
            <li>It blows her old hair dryer away.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to give to my wife to replace her old hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>but I have stopped and gone natural</li>
            <li>Actually does reduce frizz and dries extremely fast.  </li>
            <li>The thing that pushed me over the edge to buy this specific hairdryer was the claims that it dries hair faster...even the product reviews claimed as much.  </li>
            <li>My daughter is a professional hair stylist and this was given to her as a gift.</li>
            <li>Not only was it much much cheaper</li>
            <li>but it would leave my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Every dollar i spent for this hairdryer was worth it.</li>
            <li>it does not show \\&quot;ceramic ionic\\&quot; function, but it dry very fast.</li>
            <li>This dryer not only drys my thick hair very fast, but it is so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>If you are only using one attachment this is not a big deal, but I go between straight and curly hair pretty regularly</li>
            <li>As far as details go, I&#x27;m not sure as I am a bald male :)</li>
            <li>I am a black woman with natural hair (absolutely no chemicals nor weave) and my hair is more susceptible to dryness and breakage.  </li>
            <li>It was basically the exact same dryer in a different color, and it lasted 5 years.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for something a little more professional, but still wanted something relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Low blows my hair all over--it&#x27;s too high.  </li>
            <li>Not that hair that long has much style.    </li>
            <li>I didnt give it 5 stars because it is a little heavy to operate and the attachment comb that it comes with is a little long for me but still works great!</li>
            <li>So you may have to double check a few times as I did to make certain you are using the right temperature on your hair.  </li>
            <li>Since the dryer is somewhat heavy, a full grasp is required to use it.</li>
            <li>This hairdryer is lightweight, quiet (I can hear someone talking to me while I dry my hair, even on high), and works fast without frizz.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard to turn back on, so</li>
            <li>my hair was soft straight and dry!</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the switches on the handle are kind of in a bad place, I eventually got used to it and rarely do I accidentally turn it off.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;Powerful and dry hear fast.</li>
            <li>THEY DRY YOUR HAIR MUCH FASTER AND MAKE WAVY HAIR EASIER TO STYLE.</li>
            <li>Some hair dryers really make my color treated hair look dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li>Hair was dry and straight in just minutes using the comb attachment.</li>
            <li>I still use hair dryer and fast dry my hair 10 mins.</li>
            <li>Plus it looks much more expensive than it really was.</li>
            <li>I am African American and have very kinky hair.</li>
            <li>However it is not that heavy, and it dries my hair so quickly.</li>
            <li>the only problem is when turn on it very loud...</li>
            <li>but it does not get quite as hot as my other dryer.</li>
            <li>She has loose curly hair and it gets her hair silky straight.</li>
            <li>When this happened numerous times during one attempt to dry my hair, it got pretty</li>
            <li>I have 3c type hair and it dried my hair rather quickly and straight, with minimal frizz</li>
            <li>Better yet much less noise and a longer cord than my previous dryers.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and this dryer has enough power to dry my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>Only 2 speeds, low &amp; high.  </li>
            <li>I also really like that the cord is extra long.  </li>
            <li>I am quite dissapointed in this hair dryer -- its making a loud noise, &amp; I have only used it 3 times.</li>
            <li>I hope that Amazon fixed their search suggestions after I had to return this one with the related</li>
            <li>The switches for power/speed and air temp are directly on the handle (not recessed), so that I&#x27;m constantly inadvertently switching the unit off, or changing the air temp.  </li>
            <li>So I went back to my old dryer to finish the job, and checked the dryer afterward, and still did not turn on.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t care because I&#x27;d finally found a PROFESSIONAL grade, affordable, and durable hair dryer.</li>
            <li>If this has the staying power, and doesn&#x27;t burn out faster than more expensive ones we&#x27;ve had, it will rank as one of my best buys from Amazon.</li>
            <li>cons: the other attachments that came with the dryer come off easily, so I just hammer it a bit against a hard surface while its turned off to have it fit tightly.</li>
            <li>This dryer is works really well on my thick (African American and Mexican American) hair and very quickly.</li>
            <li>I usually buy the cheap dryers, to find they don&#x27;t last very long and don&#x27;t dry very fast.</li>
            <li>and so when it fly off like it always does it is impossible to get back on with out burning yourself.</li>
            <li>The only reason why I gave it 2 star instead of 1 is because it get hair dry really fast</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the location of the on/off switch as it&#x27;s easy to accidentally turn it off while using it.</li>
            <li>The only negative I have is that the buttons can easily be depressed while blow drying your hair.  </li>
            <li>It also is much heavier than most hairdryers, and, when it was working,  I really didn&#x27;t notice a big difference between this hairdryer and regular(non-ionic), less expensive dryers.</li>
            <li>so it dries much faster than other hair dryers</li>
            <li>Feels very scratchy, due to squared ends of the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;6.</li>
            <li>It does shut off from time to time due to the position of buttons but again, really a non issue.  </li>
            <li>It works well and has low and high settings which help not to dry out the hair when used often.  </li>
            <li>The blower dryer gets extremely hot and damages your hair if used blow wet hair dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 2 heat settings, plus cool blast button enable me to round brush my hair even when it&#x27;s almost dry.  </li>
            <li>Based on all the positive reviews, I thought I would love it, but I was VERY wrong.</li>
            <li>As an African American female with natural hair, finding a blow dryer that straightens as well as</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend I am African American and my hair is natural.</li>
            <li>I really believe it cut down my drying time.</li>
            <li>One concentrator is wider but shorter and the other is longer and thinner giving you an option depending on hair texture while other hair dryers only give you one and if your lucky a diffuser.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it&#x27;s very noisy, and as other customers commented, the attachments get very hot</li>
            <li>The dryer arrived promptly and as I started to use it, it seemed to dry my hair quicker than my old one.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it gets extremely hot and can burn the bristles on a round brush.</li>
            <li>I have long thick hair and this hair dryer is fantastic.</li>
            <li>The long power cord is really useful for chasing kids around the house when they won&#x27;t hold still for getting their hair dried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a BIG dryer, and not as quiet as we&#x27;d hoped - still scared the dog a little at first.</li>
            <li>I loved the Solano, but I wanted to see if a significantly less expensive dryer would work as well.  </li>
            <li>Quality, color, and operation are commendable, but unit is too large and heavy.</li>
            <li>max capacity that cost more took at least double the time to get my hair from wet to dry.</li>
            <li>and I would definitely recommend this dryer to anyone that wants their hair to dry faster and be silkier than with other dyers.</li>
            <li>I figured that with the good reviews, perhaps it was my unit that was bad...</li>

            <li> Great buy, easy on the hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is hands down the best hair dryer for the best price on the Internet.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful, very good for straightening, and the high/low heat and air settings are handy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> but the result after use is amazing.</li>
            <li> Fantastic blow dryer and the price was great.</li>
            <li> this blow dryer is amazing.</li>
            <li> but I am thrilled with this dryer.  </li>
            <li> It always has a good shine and never leaves that static cling effect.  </li>
            <li> D&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never been particularly handy with the attachments, but they&#x27;re there.  </li>
            <li> was a nice dryer while it lasted.  </li>
            <li> she has her own shop .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice dryer, but it&#x27;s nothing too snazy.</li>
            <li> Adds nice volume to my hair.</li>
            <li> I wanted my own hair dryer instead of having to use my mothers.</li>
            <li> so it wouldn&#x27;t be good for someone with gripping or strength concerns.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair nice and curly.  </li>
            <li> I would indeed tell others that this is the dryer to own.</li>
            <li> brilliant product, excellent delivery service, love the finish of the haridrier, I didn&#x27;t realised that it was American plug</li>
            <li> Nice, but doesn&#x27;t make your hair look any nicer)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice variety of attachments that stay attached nicely!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Take a while to warm up.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After owning this for most of a month I am still very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Is most better than Solano,and we know that solano i good...</li>

            <li> And no, I&#x27;m not the one to sit and write reviews unless I feel very strongly about something.</li>

            <li> I think it is very easy to use.</li>

            <li> The good news is, it dries just fine.  </li>
            <li> Good, light weight dryer.</li>
            <li> but so far it is excellent.  </li>
            <li> 2014 Review: Great dryer, good price, good overall!</li>
            <li> I liked the range in heat and speed of airflow much better than what I replaced this with.  </li>
            <li> Awesome does the job like a professional</li>
            <li> but honestly I don&#x27;t think it works any better than a $20 or $30 dryer would.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all this is an awesome machine that gets the job done in way less time and with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes hair so silky and dries very quickly!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this dryer!</li>
            <li> For the first couple of months, it took a great deal of effort and force to get the concentrator nozzle attached.  </li>
            <li> It dries fast and beautifully.</li>
            <li> The report on this one was very accurate.  </li>
            <li> and they replaced both items free of charge, even though I&#x27;d had the dryer for more than a year!</li>
            <li> I LOVED how fast it was to blowdry my hair !!</li>
            <li> Very good for my granddaughter&#x27;s thick,course,and natural  hair without putting a perm in it.</li>

            <li> ANDIS BLOW DRYERS ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THE ONES YOU BUY IN CHAIN STORES.  </li>

            <li> I Love it..</li>
            <li> Love the product..</li>
            <li> I also love the sleek chrome color.</li>
            <li> I purchased the same one 7 years ago and it worked perfectly until I plugged it into a hotel plug and it blew.</li>
            <li> I love the look and the power of the dryer but something about the Ion makes my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> I generally love the Andis product when I travel</li>
            <li> Love this blowdryer.</li>
            <li> it does everything I need it to do and more.</li>
            <li> Why can&#x27;t they design something sleeker and more convenient?</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> says &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; but most are practically disposable, they are so cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I wish I could give it more stars.</li>
            <li> LOVE this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I stayed at a hotel that had an Andis dryer in it, and immediately fell in love.</li>
            <li> It is more appropriate for the salon.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is most def.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> so my hair dries fast, which is great.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve purchased an adaptor from amazon and all sorted! :)</li>
            <li> much more than others.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love all the attachments and the fact they don&#x27;t fall off when you use them.</li>
            <li> It did not smell like burnt, the safety plug was OK, I disconnected and reconnected- nothing.</li>
            <li> She uses it most days.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I did love the blowdryer when it function.</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> and it is more powerfull than the Conair even though they are 1875 Watt.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I chose the Andis instead of another Conair.  </li>
            <li> I would be glad to recommend this Andis 82005 to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> Glad I was able to find it on here, and I am back in love again!!!</li>
            <li> This appliance is just what I needed and I love it so much I bought an appliance holder for my counter to keep it handy at all times!</li>
            <li> This dryer works great with high rate of usage.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this dryer for my sister and she loved it, it was exactly as the page and picture described</li>
            <li> I prefer my blow dryers to be able to blow very hot air rather than just luke warm.</li>
            <li> An article of top quality and utility... and easy to use with quality materials for life and 100% recommended ...</li>
            <li> Not like toasty warm - HOT!    </li>
            <li> That alone is amazing and worth the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be happy with this if you&#x27;re looking for a professional grade dryer.</li>
            <li> Great hairdryer, probably the closest thing to a professional grade product that I&#x27;ll ever get.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t fit, however I could just be mixing them up because I&#x27;ve had so many blow dryers throughout the years.</li>
            <li> My hair feels salon smooth now without all the frizz when I&#x27;m outdoors :)</li>
            <li> and she said so far, it is a great hair dryer.</li>
            <li> but I purchased this product I was surprised that makes my hair not so fly away.</li>
            <li> good, fast drier.  </li>
            <li> ultra good Dryer thanks</li>
            <li> I needed a dryer with a very long cord and this one fit the bill perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Very Good hair dryer, very professional with nice controls and a nice long cord.</li>
            <li> I got this dryer for Christmas last year, and I absolutley loved it!</li>
            <li> Drys hair very quickly and does not damage hair.</li>
            <li> The buttons on the handle are easily avoided once you use the dryer a couple of times.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully, Amazon makes returns easy.  </li>
            <li> Even when I managed to get it on, it was easy to knock it off during the course of drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> Easy to handle and use.  </li>
            <li> It dries my hair very quickly.</li>
            <li> Hangs up easily when not in use.</li>
            <li> The warm and hot temps are spot on.  </li>
            <li> I love that it has the Ionic  capability and the cool air, to help decrease the frizzie&#x27;s and keep my hair style set.</li>
            <li> I like that you can have it on hot or warm air.</li>
            <li> it makes the hair look like you left the salon beautiful.</li>
            <li> Although I liked it when it worked, the handle became extremely hot while holding it longer than a minute.</li>
            <li> This was a fine dryer, but I returned it.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works fine.  </li>
            <li> I was very happy until it just died, mid way, through my first use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine...</li>
            <li> Straighten out my hair just fine.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer to replace my Super Solano that died after more than a decade.  </li>
            <li> Dries hair quickly and is light weight!  </li>
            <li> I am happy to receive this dryer so quickly since my old one died.</li>
            <li> I RECOMMEND THIS DRYER TO ANYONE WHO WANTS GREAT LOOKING HAIR FAST AND EASY</li>
            <li> i have to say i was a never a hair/ blowdryer person, but i see a huge difference using this.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer does a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li> It was quiet, and my hair felt great after drying it.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s bought cheap hair dryers for years and ends up burning them up after 6 months to a year.  </li>
            <li> It is still a fabulous asset in my morning routine.</li>
            <li> Dryer needs a place where you can secure the attachments in place</li>
            <li> I 1st used an Andis hair dryer in a hotel in Arizona where the heat frizzed out my hair, this dryer provides a smooth blow out that lasts.</li>
            <li> 2 out of the 3 attachments don&#x27;t fit the dryer;</li>
            <li> After drying the hair it looked fabulous it just blew with the wind bouncy.  </li>
            <li> It motivated me to go out and purchase another blow dryer to replace the cheap Walmart brand that I had bought before.</li>
            <li> my hair was smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> This is a great blow dryer, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> Overall a great dryer</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t mind the sound quality,</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth and silky with no product.</li>
            <li> From reading the specs and reviews on this Andis 82005 dryer, I felt this one fit the bill.</li>
            <li> Nice wattage and fast drying.</li>
            <li> I was so happy initially with this dryer, but after the straightening pick attachment broke</li>
            <li> My hair has come out fantastic every time with this.</li>
            <li> Everything else about it is --- so far, so good.</li>
            <li> The Hair Dryer it is an excelen product, it works properly, so far so good</li>
            <li> i bought this for a christmas present and my wife love it good attacment that she use all the time.</li>
            <li> The product is very powerful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very powerful</li>
            <li> This a great dryer, dries hair fast, no frizz main reason I bought.</li>
            <li> awesome hair dryer,this is not a cheap one from your local variety store,well built works great worth every pennie</li>
            <li> Light weight, powerful and easy to use.</li>
            <li> But using the Andis is like a breath of fresh air!</li>
            <li> In August I noticed that it just didn&#x27;t feel hot any more.</li>
            <li> Dropped my wife&#x27;s original one on a tile floor and it shattered.</li>
            <li> Worth the price!</li>
            <li> the first days love it....</li>
            <li> Wish it had better attachments; tooth if the comb attachment broke on first use.</li>
            <li> Long cord and great power drying.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;&#x27;s too noisy and powerful !</li>
            <li> It was worth every penny, I wish I had heard about this sooner!</li>
            <li> I realize that it is not the fault of the retailer but am more than willing to send pics and the dryer and my hand.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Quick dry time, bouncy, beautiful hair</li>
            <li> Amazing I love this blow dryer, I had the red one when I was in hair school</li>
            <li> The more natural and/or organic the better.</li>
            <li> On the flip side, it&#x27;s strong and powerful.</li>
            <li> I still get a nice soft pressed look!</li>
            <li> very cheap end of what I know Andis is capable of.  </li>
            <li> Just as the other reviews said, this dryer is great- drys your hair very fast and somehow manages to eliminate static which is always a problem for me in the winter.</li>
            <li> Nothing special here.</li>
            <li> I originally rated this a 4 star but am now changing it to a 1 star because this dryer broke quickly.  </li>
            <li> but it makes it feel much sturdier than most of the plastic ones.  </li>
            <li> My hair has more volume with no frizz, and it looks much smoother.</li>
            <li> My hair has zero static, which is unusual during the winter.  </li>
            <li> The heat and wattage combined helps keep my hair shiny, healthy and straight.</li>
            <li> It has several settings that are good as well.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice professional hair dryer, so far its working nicely.</li>
            <li> (the cool shot button truly does help)and use a non-buildup non-oily heat treatment.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer having a cool temp setting</li>
            <li> Works very well for many uses, we used it to remove vinyl letters from  our trailer.  </li>
            <li> Overall the unit is good.  </li>
            <li> My mom used daily, good quality, and fulfills the functions for which it is made.</li>
            <li> in all, not a bad dryer...</li>
            <li> other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Other than that this dryer is great</li>
            <li> Other then that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> It dries my hair quickly and it does not leave my hair frizzy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer works extremely quickly.</li>
            <li> dries quickly is always a process.  </li>
            <li> It dries your hair quickly.</li>
            <li> This is ok, I don&#x27;t think that it gets as hot as the gold n hot series</li>
            <li> Dries hair fairly quickly (with Ion technology)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Drys hair quickly and without allot of noise</li>
            <li> It warms up quickly and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer dries my hair quickly and gives me the smoothness that I want.  </li>
            <li> The positive reviews were true!</li>
            <li> The ratings were high, so I decided to get the latest edition and try it out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cute dryer, but when I turned it on high and shut it off it would smoke.</li>
            <li> Love it and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It still work as it did the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li> It does get very, very hot on the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; setting, but</li>
            <li> But based on her smile and shouting things like \\&quot;cool blast\\&quot;, I&#x27;m assuming she loves it.  </li>
            <li> This is a beautiful chrome/gun metal looking dryer with an extra long cord that I love.</li>
            <li> Awesome blow dryer, and flash of cold heat, Love the way my hair feels Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new favorite.</li>
            <li> , the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is, it doesn&#x27;t have a cool button it has warm</li>
            <li> The attachments don&#x27;t really snap on, you just place them on and they can easily pop off&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> Her comments included, worked great and was fast without overdrying her long hair.</li>
            <li> The attachment is very hot after using it, so maybe prepare a cloth when you want to take it off or let it cool off first.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase since it was rather cheap for a good ionic dryer</li>
            <li> I only use the warm setting-- hot is too hot for me, and I appreciate the cool burst though I wish it had a cool setting.</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase of this hair dryer, although I do not really notice much of a difference that it is an ionic dryer.  </li>
            <li> Works great, a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> It blows cool air on the hot setting.</li>
            <li> Powerful and totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> It also connects to my diffuser well, and it made my hair curly way better than my old hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> It IS a bit heavier than what I am used to, but the results are well worth it.</li>
            <li> I had a T3 that I spent a lot of $ on, and it only lasted 2 years......not great in my book!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled that drying my hair is not a ten to fifteen minute ordeal, closer to five.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of natural hair and it smooth out that cuticle allowing me to Flatiron the hair smooth</li>
            <li> This dryer has good power &amp; my hair comes out good (thin straight hair).</li>
            <li> The first day I got it,  I accidentally dropped it in a sink full of water-</li>
            <li> worth the price</li>
            <li> Extremely powerful</li>
            <li> After our old dryer bit the dust, I wanted to replace it with one that worked just as well, but also quieter, lighter, and had more features.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this after checking the great reviews to replace my 5-year old dryer that&#x27;s starting to diminish in performance.</li>
            <li> While drying my hair, and I have short hair, the handle became warm, then smoked then burned my hand.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it a star because when I turned it on and placed it on the highest setting it got warm enough for my intended uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but some things are just worth it.</li>
            <li> When mine bites the dust I will replace it with the same kind</li>
            <li> It gets super hot, has good settings you can adjust if you don&#x27;t want the hot feature, and it really is professional quality (even though I feel like ALL blow dryers say &#x27;professional&#x27;).  </li>
            <li> wife loved it and has a similar but older model drier that still works ( for 5 years,</li>
            <li> Other than that I loved this hair dryer.   </li>
            <li> They are right where I grip the dryer</li>
            <li> The power &amp; heat buttons are right where your hand goes, so</li>
            <li> Also, every once in a while I accidentally turn it off because the setting switches are right about where my hand goes, but I guess that&#x27;s the tradeoff for them being in a convenient place.  </li>
            <li> I am right handed, andthe way I hold this dryer, allows me to  </li>
            <li> It does get very hot but thats a good thing for me at least :) I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had great customer service experience with Andis in the past as well.</li>
            <li> A really nice long cord.</li>
            <li> I really thought the \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; drying system was just tech hype, but this thing really dries quickly!  </li>
            <li> I love it and will get one for my niece with very thick hair, who borrowed it and loved it also.</li>
            <li> &amp; I like it super straight &amp; swingy)...&amp;</li>
            <li> Not only is this product worth every penny, but I love the resin pick, the color of the product and the comb</li>
            <li> This dries my hair quickly without an intense level of heat.</li>
            <li> The motor is loud, but again these are the trade offs to gain more time while getting ready.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer after using the travel size at a Towne Place Suites thinking that if the small one was great, the big one would be better.</li>
            <li> Other than that she loves it very much and is very glad she got it.</li>
            <li> What a rip off, i have another \\&quot;professional\\&quot; dryer that is 15 years old, still blowing hot and strong.  </li>
            <li> My dog preferred the low warm or hot while I preferred fast and hot.  </li>
            <li> Very fast and rightly hot.</li>
            <li> She accidently dropped the hot blow dryer between her legs.  </li>
            <li> I bought an Andis many years ago and it was wonderful, so I bought this model in June 2009, and sadly today in December 2011 it finally fizzled</li>
            <li> so it gets really hot</li>
            <li> It leaves my soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> its like hot.  </li>
            <li> At first, it was difficult for me to figure out the best way to hold it because of it&#x27;s size and placement of the controls.</li>
            <li> I had to wait a minute or two to reattach it because the nozzle was too hot to handle.  </li>
            <li> It could have just been the dryer that I got, just be aware if you purchase one.</li>
            <li> We noticed that although it was turned off (but plugged in) it was extremely hot to the touch.  </li>
            <li> I love the hair dryer but the comb attachment starting breaking on our first use.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that is almost to the bottom of my lower back (or top of my bottom, lol).</li>
            <li> As soon as I turned it on there was a funny burning smell.  </li>
            <li> no luck, it just stopped blowing hot air.  </li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> 2 weeks after I ordered this hairdryer it stopped blowing hot air.</li>
            <li> This is my first ceramic blow dryer and it did wonders to my hair.</li>
            <li> but when I first bought it, it was $35.</li>
            <li> It blow drys my hair pretty well.</li>
            <li> I have worked in a salon for ten years, and I love this blow-dryer.</li>
            <li> recieved hair dryer in timely matter and tried it the first day i got it.</li>
            <li> You know, hot air blows out.</li>
            <li> It really works well!</li>
            <li> First time I tried it out was at a resort in Napa.</li>
            <li> This is the first hair dryer I have ever owned that did not leave my hair smelling like smoke.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a sturdy, hot dryer.</li>
            <li> The hand grip gets too hot to hold after about 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> This dryer is constructed to be a first class item.  </li>
            <li> This is my first Ceramic Ionic hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and it does a great job is fixing the frizzies</li>
            <li> I downgraded from a Chi (that burnt out after about two years) and a higher priced dryer from a beauty supply store, and I would recommend this mid-priced dryer as well as any of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first reviewed this product in the winter of 2013</li>
            <li> Dries my hair fast!</li>
            <li> The dryer, which has a lot of power, does not seem to ever get hot.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This was a good but heavy dryer while it lasted.  </li>
            <li> it leaves your hair feeling nice and soft not dry and brittle !</li>
            <li> The only thing that keeps it from being 5 star is the fact that there are only two temperatures, hot and warm, and the hot is REALLY hot, so I use the cool shot button a lot.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer gets my hair straight without the extra hassle plus the comb attachment makes it super easy.</li>
            <li> The high speed setting is perfect for blow drying my short hair, and the ionic characteristic makes hair soft.  </li>
            <li> I plan on buying another one soon and if you have hair that is thick or you are of mixed race, this comb is great!  </li>
            <li> The only con is that the dryer is kind of loud but trust me, you won&#x27;t care once you put it to your hair.</li>
            <li> This is the most pretty dryer that I have seen in a long time.  </li>
            <li> Does a great job drying but it is loud and heavy compared to what I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> When my inexpensive, but reliable blow dryer died after 4 years I purchased this one based on the number of positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I love this, it has a long cord</li>
            <li> Not only is it slick and great to look at; it is light weight, has attachments and is more than I expected.</li>
            <li> I love the nozzle attachments included with it and its long cord.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to it when we stayed at a very upscale hotel.</li>
            <li> It seems to do a good job drying my hair even though, its hard to tell because I do not have very much hair</li>
            <li> i have to put in more work to blow dry.</li>
            <li> Protects your hair, the hair dryer is very neat, and it gas a long cord, I love it.  </li>
            <li> (I use the low setting every day), and it dries my hair very quickly.</li>
            <li> Unlike some of the reviews I do not feel it is heavy ,but I have always used a full sized dryer as opposed to some of the more compact ones out there in the market.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly large for operating</li>
            <li> how large it is.  </li>
            <li> I have used several blow dryers and this one has help protect breakage, it&#x27;s easy to use and to store, and eliminates me from oiling or heating my hair as much without it&#x27;s Ionic Ceramic Support.</li>
            <li> Low setting is to strong and to fast also</li>
            <li> This is a very good hair dryer, especially if you are less accustomed to professional dryers.</li>
            <li> its super loud and kind of heavy.</li>
            <li> Also, even on the high setting, the hair dyer doesn&#x27;t get really hot.</li>
            <li> She has very thick hair and hair dryer worked great for her.</li>
            <li> So far it is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I just bought this dryer a couple weeks ago, I really like it.</li>
            <li> Works fast.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This drier is the cheapest ceramic ionic drier I have found, and it truly works fast.  </li>
            <li> it dries my hair so fast without any damage.  </li>
            <li> I can definitely tell that my hair is healthier than when I used a cheap hair dryer.      </li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t really help me with mine.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair, but I have frizz within 20 minutes of doing my hair....</li>
            <li> It is light weight, has plenty of power and yet is incredibly quiet.  </li>
            <li> I dont really know if i like it.</li>
            <li> This dryer drys my hair extremely fast.</li>
            <li> I really really like this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> The one I purchased was also ionic, but much quieter owing to the fact that it had three speeds and two heat settings.</li>
            <li> The look is modern...</li>
            <li> The attachments don&#x27;t seem to fit the dryer and fall off or simply can not be secured to the dryer.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair fast and makes it shiny.  </li>
            <li> Every minute counts when your getting ready.</li>
            <li> The blow dryer got my hair straighter and fast.</li>
            <li> I really did.</li>
            <li> so I have options for how much heat I put on my hair.</li>
            <li> is really sleek.</li>
            <li> but I dont mind it much.</li>
            <li> Really like the hair blower.</li>
            <li> fast do its no problem</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price, but even at the Friday sale price this feels overpriced.</li>
            <li> Lots of power and the ionic features leaves my hair really shiny.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT,DRYS HAIR FAST LIKE</li>
            <li> she never complained about it being to hot or the comb pulling her hair.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> the dryer heats up fast and the straightening pick that come with it really works.</li>
            <li> It dries fast yet gently.</li>
            <li> Lots of heat and power, real pro dryer.</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight.  </li>
            <li> It dries your hair really fast and allows it to be as straight or as curly as you want.</li>
            <li> I also really like the nozzles that come with the dyer.  </li>
            <li> Drys fast and styles with attachments that came with it.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer has a very sleek design and has a lot of power.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to hold the button so much.</li>
            <li> The dryer work really well...</li>
            <li> I guess I expected more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s surprisingly reasonably priced considering the quality.</li>
            <li> She has been very please.  </li>
            <li> This dryer gets my hair straight</li>
            <li> It works really well so far and its Ionic function makes my hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> really wanted to like it</li>
            <li> Dries fast and leaves my hair shiny and straight.</li>
            <li> Price of the item was reasonable as was the shipping cost.</li>
            <li> Really like this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Well not so much.</li>
            <li> Very windy.</li>
            <li> Thanks, And is.</li>
            <li> have very course 4a hair type</li>
            <li> I do believe it is just a bit heavier than the Conair dryer but not so much that causes me a problem.  </li>
            <li> It was packaged very well and arrived two days after I placed my order.  </li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li> I initially liked this dryer but it is heavy and</li>
            <li> It did come with attachments that I have no idea what their purpose is, so those are kind of a waste.    </li>
            <li> After my expensive blow dryer bit the dust, I was looking for a more affordable but just as effective replacement.</li>
            <li> Its also cumbersome &amp; heavy &amp; too large  &amp; the warm setting is far too hot...</li>
            <li> so you need to have a strong hand to hold it up for a long time if you have a lot of hair.  </li>
            <li> , other then that I love it</li>
            <li> The cord is really long, which is great because the only outlet I have in my bathroom has ruined several blow dryers by melting the plug.</li>
            <li> Every diff-user accessory comes with the hairdryer is better than the other.</li>
            <li> Nice long cord, drys much faster than my last 2 dryers.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it is great, very hot, very high-powered, but doesn&#x27;t cut off a LOT of time off using my old dryer.</li>
            <li> Definitely for a strong professional.</li>
            <li> It dries your hair quickly, and leaves it feeling soft not dried out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly heavier than other hair dryers but is also more visually appealing.</li>
            <li> I have straight, fine hair that normally takes forever to dry</li>
            <li> I was primarily looking for something with a long cord.  </li>
            <li> Outside stays cool to touch</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, design of switches and location cause my wife and I both to shut the unit down while in use when moving it around and changing hands.</li>
            <li> My hair is noticeably straighter and very soft since starting to use this dryer, I don&#x27;t necessarily feel it dries my hair any quicker than my old one  did, but the end results are definitely  better!</li>
            <li> Unlike most non-commercial hair dryers, it gets hot enough to quickly dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> It looks great and dries my long hair in about 5 mins (half the time it took with my old Conair dryer).  </li>
            <li> I decided to spend a little extra and get her a good one.  </li>
            <li> love it, powerful, it doesn&#x27;t get hot, it doesn&#x27;t smell like burning, it dries my hair leaving it soft and shiny, no frizzy and also it dries my hair in no time, I have sorta thick hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid a lot more money for a lot less.</li>
            <li> Much better than a previous version that had the power but also the added weight.  </li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer,because it get the job done,for less the price.</li>
            <li> (or so it feel like it weights more than a typical dryer)</li>
            <li> my hair holds better is shinier, and less damaged looking.</li>
            <li> I am so entirely pleased with this hair dryer that I&#x27;m coming back for another one... 2 1/2 years later.</li>
            <li> It would work great for someone with regular hair, not too thick.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice a weight difference between this and my older Conair.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure, but either way it works great and has lasted for a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought it mainly because of the comb attachment.</li>
            <li> Therefore, it is extremely important for me to be extra sensitive and mindful to the type of products I use on my hair.</li>
            <li> so I have to hold the dryer farther away than with my older dryer.</li>
            <li> Amazon was quick about sending me a second blow dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and the attachments come in hamdy, especially the comb one.</li>
            <li> Works great only complaint is that when using the attachment it doesn&#x27;t always stay on when trying to change the diretion.</li>
            <li> VERY LOUD!  </li>
            <li> My hair is really thick after I wash it and this dryer makes my hair feel softer (because it&#x27;s an ionic dryer) and more manageable!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended...</li>
            <li> I ran it for about 30 seconds on high and turned it off and smoke came out of the barrel.  </li>
            <li> and it is in high end hotel rooms.  </li>
            <li> i would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Too loud !!</li>
            <li> This product does justice to those who have thick, full hair to even silky fine hair.</li>
            <li> It is very powerful and  dries my long hair (complete with styling it) in under 10 minutes!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem heavier than any other powerful dryer, and it dries hair twice as quick as others we&#x27;ve had that are marketed as professional strength.</li>
            <li> the reviews were not as fabulous as I expected....</li>
            <li> My hair looks really shiny after using and soft.</li>
            <li> It drys my hair twice as fast as my old one.</li>
            <li> This has really been a staple, espically since trying to transition from relaxed to natural hair.  </li>
            <li> Dries my hair so much faster than my old dryer.</li>
            <li> I cant believe that Hair dryer fast than old hair dryer ..  </li>
            <li> I had an Andis hair dryer before and this one is just as good if not better than the last one I owned.  </li>
            <li> Before purchasing this hair dryer I read pretty much all of the reviews on the earlier edition.  </li>
            <li> Not this one, it is powerful enough,</li>
            <li> I loved all the different settings because I could use it on my small dod with no problems.  </li>
            <li> and what would normally take about 30 minutes</li>
            <li> please cool your hair down first</li>
            <li> The dryer appears to be very heavy duty and good enough to be used at the hair salons.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Few reviewers have mentioned the extra-long cord, which is a major positive selling point for me.  </li>
            <li> Do not get cross minded when choosing this hair dryer because it get the job done right.</li>
            <li> i dont think is great dryer because it dont dry my hair the way i expected it to dry.</li>
            <li> Great long cord and dries my thick hair faster than my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Only when you have it on high setting does hot air blow out</li>
            <li> I was in a hurry for a new dryer</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone looking for a new dryer.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without this</li>
            <li> Also, I ordered for a new item.</li>
            <li> She can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I needed a new hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> My wife loves this new hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> bought this product for my mom for christmas, she needs a new one every year, i dont know what she does</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to last so much longer.</li>
            <li> my other ionic hair dryer just quite, so took a chance on this brand and not sorry what so ever!!</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try and was very surprised.</li>
            <li> If you switch attachments while you dry your hair this isn&#x27;t or you, they get very hot.</li>
            <li> It is super heavy and doesn&#x27;t even blow hot air.</li>
            <li> said her hair felt different the first morning she used it.  </li>
            <li> Only thing I didn&#x27;t care for was how hot the attachments got after using.</li>
            <li> So far, the Andis 82005 is holding up well!</li>
            <li> The first one I purchased had to be returned the same week.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> BUT it did die out exactly a year later.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as light as it looks but about average weight.</li>
            <li> fairly quiet and love the optional speeds and temp&#x27;s that my other one didn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Heavier than the last two dryers we&#x27;ve had (Hot Tools Tourmaline Lite 1043</li>
            <li> only concern after a year is the handle gets extremely hot now</li>
            <li> I also have two different textures wavy and coarse in the back, fine and straight in the front.</li>
            <li> On my way to return it now, but this time asked for a refund, and will try to find a new version of my old dryer.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this hair dryer because it gets the job done in less time.  </li>
            <li> and I can only tell you that any professional hair dryer is going to pretty close to this weight.</li>
            <li> Also, with cheaper dryers, if you turn it off after several minutes of use, you have to wait for it to cool before it will come back on.</li>
            <li> Here is a tip I learned, when planning on using hot curlers, flat irons etc.</li>
            <li> When you are holding a dryer to dry your entire head, you want it to be light.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair less frizzy and staticy and leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> A LONG TIME AGO ,HAD MANY OTHER HAIR DRYERS</li>
            <li> I have very wavy hair and using a large round boar brush and now much easier to straighten.</li>
            <li> I expected at this price for it to last longer than a cheap dryer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a far shorter task with this dryer, and neither of us end up sweating.     </li>
            <li> It looks and feels professional.    </li>
            <li> It has the professional look and feel you&#x27;d expect from Andis.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a professional hair dryer...</li>
            <li> All natural.  </li>
            <li> It looks classy, still after 6 months of use every day it looks new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am a professional</li>
            <li> makes my hair feel soft and silky..</li>
            <li> it was completely submerged.</li>
            <li> It is too loud.  </li>
            <li> Well made, but this baby is loud.</li>
            <li> I do wish it wasn&#x27;t as loud though.</li>
            <li> I had a professional hair dryer which died</li>
            <li> It does seem like a professional hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I thought my old dryer was loud and wanted something quieter this time around.</li>
            <li> It blows her old hair dryer away.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to give to my wife to replace her old hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> but I have stopped and gone natural</li>
            <li> Actually does reduce frizz and dries extremely fast.  </li>
            <li> The thing that pushed me over the edge to buy this specific hairdryer was the claims that it dries hair faster...even the product reviews claimed as much.  </li>
            <li> My daughter is a professional hair stylist and this was given to her as a gift.</li>
            <li> Not only was it much much cheaper</li>
            <li> but it would leave my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Every dollar i spent for this hairdryer was worth it.</li>
            <li> it does not show \\&quot;ceramic ionic\\&quot; function, but it dry very fast.</li>
            <li> This dryer not only drys my thick hair very fast, but it is so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> If you are only using one attachment this is not a big deal, but I go between straight and curly hair pretty regularly</li>
            <li> As far as details go, I&#x27;m not sure as I am a bald male :)</li>
            <li> I am a black woman with natural hair (absolutely no chemicals nor weave) and my hair is more susceptible to dryness and breakage.  </li>
            <li> It was basically the exact same dryer in a different color, and it lasted 5 years.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for something a little more professional, but still wanted something relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Low blows my hair all over--it&#x27;s too high.  </li>
            <li> Not that hair that long has much style.    </li>
            <li> I didnt give it 5 stars because it is a little heavy to operate and the attachment comb that it comes with is a little long for me but still works great!</li>
            <li> So you may have to double check a few times as I did to make certain you are using the right temperature on your hair.  </li>
            <li> Since the dryer is somewhat heavy, a full grasp is required to use it.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is lightweight, quiet (I can hear someone talking to me while I dry my hair, even on high), and works fast without frizz.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard to turn back on, so</li>
            <li> my hair was soft straight and dry!</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the switches on the handle are kind of in a bad place, I eventually got used to it and rarely do I accidentally turn it off.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;Powerful and dry hear fast.</li>
            <li> THEY DRY YOUR HAIR MUCH FASTER AND MAKE WAVY HAIR EASIER TO STYLE.</li>
            <li> Some hair dryers really make my color treated hair look dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Hair was dry and straight in just minutes using the comb attachment.</li>
            <li> I still use hair dryer and fast dry my hair 10 mins.</li>
            <li> Plus it looks much more expensive than it really was.</li>
            <li> I am African American and have very kinky hair.</li>
            <li> However it is not that heavy, and it dries my hair so quickly.</li>
            <li> the only problem is when turn on it very loud...</li>
            <li> but it does not get quite as hot as my other dryer.</li>
            <li> She has loose curly hair and it gets her hair silky straight.</li>
            <li> When this happened numerous times during one attempt to dry my hair, it got pretty</li>
            <li> I have 3c type hair and it dried my hair rather quickly and straight, with minimal frizz</li>
            <li> Better yet much less noise and a longer cord than my previous dryers.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and this dryer has enough power to dry my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> Only 2 speeds, low &amp; high.  </li>
            <li> I also really like that the cord is extra long.  </li>
            <li> I am quite dissapointed in this hair dryer -- its making a loud noise, &amp; I have only used it 3 times.</li>
            <li> I hope that Amazon fixed their search suggestions after I had to return this one with the related</li>
            <li> The switches for power/speed and air temp are directly on the handle (not recessed), so that I&#x27;m constantly inadvertently switching the unit off, or changing the air temp.  </li>
            <li> So I went back to my old dryer to finish the job, and checked the dryer afterward, and still did not turn on.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t care because I&#x27;d finally found a PROFESSIONAL grade, affordable, and durable hair dryer.</li>
            <li> If this has the staying power, and doesn&#x27;t burn out faster than more expensive ones we&#x27;ve had, it will rank as one of my best buys from Amazon.</li>
            <li> cons: the other attachments that came with the dryer come off easily, so I just hammer it a bit against a hard surface while its turned off to have it fit tightly.</li>
            <li> This dryer is works really well on my thick (African American and Mexican American) hair and very quickly.</li>
            <li> I usually buy the cheap dryers, to find they don&#x27;t last very long and don&#x27;t dry very fast.</li>
            <li> and so when it fly off like it always does it is impossible to get back on with out burning yourself.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I gave it 2 star instead of 1 is because it get hair dry really fast</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the location of the on/off switch as it&#x27;s easy to accidentally turn it off while using it.</li>
            <li> The only negative I have is that the buttons can easily be depressed while blow drying your hair.  </li>
            <li> It also is much heavier than most hairdryers, and, when it was working,  I really didn&#x27;t notice a big difference between this hairdryer and regular(non-ionic), less expensive dryers.</li>
            <li> so it dries much faster than other hair dryers</li>
            <li> Feels very scratchy, due to squared ends of the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;6.</li>
            <li> It does shut off from time to time due to the position of buttons but again, really a non issue.  </li>
            <li> It works well and has low and high settings which help not to dry out the hair when used often.  </li>
            <li> The blower dryer gets extremely hot and damages your hair if used blow wet hair dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 2 heat settings, plus cool blast button enable me to round brush my hair even when it&#x27;s almost dry.  </li>
            <li> Based on all the positive reviews, I thought I would love it, but I was VERY wrong.</li>
            <li> As an African American female with natural hair, finding a blow dryer that straightens as well as</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend I am African American and my hair is natural.</li>
            <li> I really believe it cut down my drying time.</li>
            <li> One concentrator is wider but shorter and the other is longer and thinner giving you an option depending on hair texture while other hair dryers only give you one and if your lucky a diffuser.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s very noisy, and as other customers commented, the attachments get very hot</li>
            <li> The dryer arrived promptly and as I started to use it, it seemed to dry my hair quicker than my old one.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it gets extremely hot and can burn the bristles on a round brush.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and this hair dryer is fantastic.</li>
            <li> The long power cord is really useful for chasing kids around the house when they won&#x27;t hold still for getting their hair dried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a BIG dryer, and not as quiet as we&#x27;d hoped - still scared the dog a little at first.</li>
            <li> I loved the Solano, but I wanted to see if a significantly less expensive dryer would work as well.  </li>
            <li> Quality, color, and operation are commendable, but unit is too large and heavy.</li>
            <li> max capacity that cost more took at least double the time to get my hair from wet to dry.</li>
            <li> and I would definitely recommend this dryer to anyone that wants their hair to dry faster and be silkier than with other dyers.</li>
            <li> I figured that with the good reviews, perhaps it was my unit that was bad...</li>
            <li> I put a Hot Sock Ultralight Diffuser on the end (instead of the included attachments) and dry my hair everyday with</li>
            <li> It does dry my hair much faster than other blow dyers!  </li>
            <li> It is so long that my arm is almost not long enough to keep from hitting myself in the head when drying my hair.</li>
            <li> Heat from the dryer with immediate usage of other heat sources can cause stress and unnecessary damage (or more damage) to your scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> For my natural African American hair I was using it on low heat high speed after parting my hair in very small sections, but it still broke.</li>
            <li> and then I only have to run through my hair with the flat iron one time.</li>
            <li> I had hoped that new dryers (my last one is at least 7 years old) might have quiter motors in them.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I accidentally turn the dryer off several times while I&#x27;m drying my hair, but that is only a minor inconvenience.</li>
            <li> , despite what I wrote earlier, this blow dryer did not last as long as I&#x27;d hoped it would.</li>
            <li> Andis products are good in general but the resin comb is crap.</li>
            <li> I left it to dry and the next day I plugged it in and it WORKED.  </li>
            <li> Not worth buying, product started overheating after using it to blow dry my very short hair - please do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> I usually section my hair off to get it as straight as I can before flat ironing it.</li>
            <li> Glitter isn&#x27;t the end of the world, and I don&#x27;t care what my dryer looks like so long as it works properly.  </li>
            <li> Use Solano flat iron with this dryer and your hair will thank you.</li>
            <li> Long 10 ft. cord (if you need that, however I don&#x27;t, and it really only gets in the way)&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(I am spanish with curly hair, I use to relax my hair a long time ago</li>
            <li> My hair seems to dry in the same amount of time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet and seems to dry her hair quicker than others she&#x27;s used.  </li>
            <li> After having owned this for about two months, the chrome is completely chipped off (the dryer has a matte black finish underneath the chrome) where the concentrator attaches.  </li>
            <li> I have tried different hair dyers and all of the comb attachments would break or come off while I am trying to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> 82005 1875 Watt Professional Ceramic Ionic Hair Dryer, Black Chrome]]</li>
            <li> I have naturally loose-curly hair, and I use this dryer daily to straighten my hair with a round brush.</li>
            <li> I was initially concerned the first few days because the temp. seemed to be fluctuating, however after a few uses it smoothed out.</li>
            <li> Not sure that I am buying a 3rd as I don&#x27;t feel like buying a new hair dryer every 2 years.</li>
            <li> It feels a bit light and flimsy, The cord is long and hard to manage (no easy way to roll it up).</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll chance this particular one again though.</li>
            <li> I have not used the attachments because I have short, straight, thick hair that I blow dry</li>
            <li> It is a little on the loud side, but...</li>
            <li> Is a little heavier than my old dryer</li>
            <li> Its a little loud, but it puts out a lot of air</li>
            <li> I just blow dry then flat iron now!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the model I used is no longer available, so I ordered this one.  </li>
            <li> When her primary dryer failed, this dryer was provided to her while staying at a Ritz Carlton Hotel this summer</li>
            <li> This dryer is heavy and loud, I would not recommend it to anybody.  </li>
            <li> I have use Andies products for a long time and they always seem to be what I expect.</li>
            <li> (&amp; my hair is seriously long</li>
            <li> the cord is REALLY long.</li>
            <li> The long cord is convenient too.  </li>
            <li> THE LONG CORD.SHOULD OF PURCHASED THIS DRYER</li>
            <li> The long cord is helpful at home too.</li>
            <li> I plan to have this a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not unbearably loud or heavy, but it I do not think it lives up to those expectations.  </li>
            <li> buttons get in your way on the handle, the cord is long and not retractable, and there&#x27;s no &amp;#34;cool blast&amp;#34; setting.</li>
            <li> Also, I thought the nozzle on it was long</li>
            <li> Has really long cord which helps.  </li>
            <li> and there was also a strange, high-pitched rattling noise...</li>
            <li> I have a bad right arm and can&#x27;t use curlers so this really helped me look presentable!</li>
            <li> The cold air button is easy to push (unlike most of my old blow dryers, your thumb would go numb after a few minutes).</li>
            <li> I think it should automatically come with an extra comb instead of one of those other attachments.</li>
            <li> It dries the hair in about 3-4 minutes including long hair!</li>
            <li> Especially the one that has o comb in front is extremely convenient for hair-straitening.</li>
            <li> I only use one nozzle for it though, I feel like the other nozzles it came with</li>
            <li> And leaves it feeling softer and smoother than other blow dryers that have left my hair frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I do mean sweating, other dryers are so hot to use.</li>
            <li> I will go back to buying the $20 Conair dryers because other than the price I don&#x27;t find a difference.</li>
            <li> I have very long curly hair and need to dry my hair every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe I would get a faster blow dry if I wasn&#x27;t turning the darn thing off 5 or 6 times</li>
            <li> everytime I dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> It takes me about 10-15 to dry my hair with the comb extension.  </li>
            <li> It does dry my hair</li>
            <li> I get out of the shower; blow dry for 2-3 minutes, start applying my makeup, blow dry again for another 2-3 minutes until it is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We use it mainly to dry the dog; just point it at a spot on his fur, and it&#x27;s dry within seconds.  </li>
            <li> so I can dry my hair without heat.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it is from the water in my hair when i blow dry?</li>
            <li> Dry my hair in 1 2 3.</li>
            <li> It did dry hair faster.  </li>
            <li> , I wanted to have a dryer that would help me blow dry my hair when I want it straight)&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I did not see a difference in dry time though.  </li>
            <li> The Andis 82005 closes the gap between merely a consumer product and a professional dryer, but retains a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This particular &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; product is clumsy and the heads do not stay on the dryer.  </li>
            <li> I did have to get used to the switch placement the first couple of times I used it, and the nozzles can be difficult to turn if they are put  on too tight, but these are minor adjustments one has to make while getting used to a new product.     </li>
            <li> First off I have VERY thick hair</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and it takes forever to dry but not with the Andis 82005 Professional 1875 Watt Ceramic Ionic Hair Dryer!!</li>
            <li> the past week, it&#x27;s gotten much easier to get the concentrator attached, and it&#x27;s less prone to fall off.  </li>
            <li> Some people have said that the cool shot button is in a difficult place.</li>
            <li> I pushed all the switches and button up and down, in and out several times to see if something was stuck but</li>
            <li> The only down side for me is the placement of the buttons.</li>
            <li> I have long, curly hair and even on the slow speed, it dries my hair fast with less frizz.</li>
            <li> Only problem too big for my small hands, so taking some getting used to.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend and am super sad because I threw the box away and cannot return it.</li>
            <li> A little heavier and louder than expected, but otherwise dries hair in half the time my old blow dryer did.</li>
            <li> It takes only a few minutes to dry the hair.</li>
            <li> With this blow dryer I tend to just blow dry a entire section because it&#x27;s so heavy.</li>
            <li> The only issue is the overweight, but it compensates with faster hair drying(even half the time than used to be with other brands).</li>
            <li> anyone whining about this hairdryer being abnormally heavy needs to stop having their personal shoppers carry everything for them all the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to try out different brushes that stand up to the heat and a tourmaline ceramic round brush</li>
            <li> It is a bit heavy, but not a big deal to me.</li>
            <li> so when my hair gets wet it is literally a fro.</li>
            <li> I have no real complains about it.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I want to go back to using her hair dryer because it isn&#x27;t as heavy.</li>
            <li> It performes as expected.  </li>
            <li> just stop working and letting me hair wet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely broken and now I have to throw the whole thing away.</li>
            <li> Using this together with a round ionic brush and a regular ionic brush that I bring everywhere I go.</li>
            <li> Not much difference in heat settings, although speed settings are adequate.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> so I guess that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> but the fan speed is too fast for thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have A LOT of LONG very THICK hair, and it takes me about 6 minutes to completely blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Usually it takes about 15 minutes, at the minimum, to dry my hair, but with this dryer, it only took 5 minutes!  </li>
            <li> Usually I blow dry my hair in about 3 different time fragments though.</li>
            <li> But the cord is super crazy long.  </li>
            <li> So it took me half the time to blow dry it and less time to flat iron it.</li>
            <li> it is a hair dryer, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer cuts my dry time down by ALOT!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i mean very loud..if you have a thick hair and used it in a long period.  </li>
            <li> and it does dry my hair faster and results in less frizz.</li>
            <li> others have noted, the thin chrome finish of the dryer chips off very easily, particularly when using the attachments.  </li>
            <li> I can dry my thick, curly (though short) hair in 5-10 minutes, and it does not get frizzy.  </li>
            <li> My hair is course and thick and it dries my hair in half the time it took my old dryer.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair that I blow dry 2-3 times a week and</li>
            <li> AND, the air is not hot at all.  </li>
            <li> Too heavy to hold for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> Well I was not sure, thinking it would be too bulky and big and</li>
            <li> but I am not sure what I would do if I had to style it regularly.</li>
            <li> Granted, I&#x27;ve had it for a few years, but nothing should catch fire like that as long as you take care of it.</li>
            <li> The weight is not too heavy and the long cord works well for me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it every day, just 1 day every other week...</li>
            <li> Other than that, it seems like any other hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I have 2 other blow dryers, and I will be selling them.  </li>
            <li> I sure hope not because I already threw it away  :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only small</li>
            <li> I saw the other reviews and thought this was the dryer for me.</li>
            <li> But my main disappointment is that it doesn&#x27;t have enough power nor did it dry my hair quicker.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a replacement since the button on my other dryer broke off.  </li>
            <li> I like the safety feature...not extremely loud...good attachments</li>
            <li> so it takes a little time to dry.</li>
            <li> That means I can keep the middle speed and the cold heat setting, and it&#x27;s much quieter than other dryers I tried.</li>
            <li> I guess i&#x27;ve been stupid over many years, and not really was picky about dryers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The only reason I gave it a four was because two of the teeth on the comb have already broken and I&#x27;ve only had it about two months.</li>
            <li> in less than 2 years with minimal usage by just one person, this blow dryer no longer works.  </li>
            <li> Poor quality while looking very professional.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair which can tend to take a long time to dry but not with this baby.</li>
            <li> It needs to be a hard unbreakable plastic instead because it won&#x27;t last for use in the salon.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the attachments are hard to get on...</li>
            <li> Sooooo not worth it.  </li>
            <li> But to say the least I will not be buying this model for my next blow dryer purchase.</li>
            <li> This one works well with my hair type to keep it looking smoother than the average dryer.</li>
            <li> worked well on my thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that is kinky in the back and wavy in the front.</li>
            <li> When it cooled down sufficiently, the twisting and turning began anew.  </li>
            <li> I wrote down the information and ordered on on Amazon when I returned home.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and overall it dried it quicker than any other blow dryer i ever had.</li>
            <li> Dries hair much faster than previous less expensive dryers which stop working after a year.  </li>
            <li> so it takes a while to dry usually but after purchasing this Andis, I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not seem overly heavy to me, as other reviewers have noticed, nor have I had issues with accidentally hitting the temperature or off switches because of their placement.  </li>
            <li> A little heavy (but I&#x27;m in my sixties) but its weight not a real problem.  </li>
            <li> Dries my hair in half the time.</li>
            <li> none the less.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weight is typical for dryers this size.  </li>
            <li> Slightly heavier than cheaper hair dryers, but doesn&#x27;t seem to bother her.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair smoother and less flyaways.  </li>

            <li> She shared her previous use of this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I have received a replacement in the mail; however, I am a little afraid to use it and will be very certain to unplug it after usage.</li>

            <li> It was a little pricey</li>

            <li> and it just falls into place requiring little brushing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavy, but it&#x27;s not the manufacturing</li>

            <li> My hair dried to styling point within 3 minutes instead of 8.  </li>
            <li> I was drying my hair and the side exploded and the motor came flying out, narrowly missing my face.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Heavy and unwieldy.  </li>
            <li> never used the attachments; i ended up throwing them away a few days ago.</li>
            <li> A bit heavy though</li>
            <li> the review I read on this dryer warned me that it was heavy.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about a blow dryer making any difference, but I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Some people complain about how heavy this thing is</li>
            <li> THE ONLY PROBLEM I FIND IS THAT THEY ARE HEAVIER THAN THE STORE STANDARDS AND YOUR ARMS GET TIRED.</li>
            <li> Shoulders are tired know since my second use a week ago.</li>
            <li> Sort of heavy,</li>
            <li> However, it is heavy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too loud, and the shiny gun-metal color looks expensive.</li>
            <li> I have had this hair dryer for a few years now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavy</li>
            <li> Its a bit on the heavy side.</li>
            <li> It is heavy</li>
            <li> For those who have said that it&#x27;s a bit heavy for them, they are correct.</li>
            <li> The comb attachment is heavy duty and durable.</li>
            <li> I will say the dryer is on the heavy side</li>
            <li> It was a waste of hard-earned and an embarrassment as a gift.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m missing something</li>
            <li> the dryer is too heavy</li>
            <li> the color start to wears out after a few days</li>
            <li> unfortunately, it went from loud, to louder, to ear-piercing in a matter of minutes</li>
            <li> Less use of flat-iron and pressing comb!  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer cuts your drying time in half!</li>
            <li> Too heavy and switches are small.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s crazy to spend up to $150 or even $75 on a dryer when this ~$40 one works just as well if not better and has the extra long cord.</li>
            <li> It has cut my drying time down to 20 minutes, i have shoulder length thick hair that is prone to frizz.</li>
            <li> A lot of people complained about it being too heavy, but it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all to me.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as the other Andis with the retractable cord</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another reviewer mentioned that this was heavy, making it hard to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve burned through cheaper, store-bought hair dryers in the past.</li>
            <li> I remember comparing it to the past model I had, and the reason I&#x27;ve stuck with Andis since because of their efficiency (and longevity).</li>
            <li> But the difference in ounces seemed small...</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Makes a bit of noise and heavier than usual.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers complained that the unit is heavy</li>
            <li> Usually I buy Conair hair dryers but chose the Andis</li>
            <li> It is a very, very heavy dryer and probably the noises blow dryer I have ever herd in my life.</li>
            <li> That said, it is very, very heavy.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the buttons are in a weird place</li>
            <li> and I hate using my mother&#x27;s hairdryer because mine is so much better than her expensive, bulky one.</li>
            <li> Not suitable for home use.  </li>
            <li> I was having a hard time drying my hair and one of my daughter&#x27;s hair because it&#x27;s so thick.</li>
            <li> My frizzies were reduced by at least 75% without the use of any syling products or leave-in conditioners.  </li>
            <li> Only blow cold air.  </li>
            <li> at all ergonomic; extremely clumsy to hold and unwieldy.</li>
            <li> Her only complaint is that the comb attachment seems to be flimsy and is afraid that the teeth will break off.</li>
            <li> Wait at least 10 minutes or longer before proceeding to styling.</li>
            <li> I had an Andis Hair Dryer for at least 8 years until it died on me recently.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and needed a blow dryer that can do the job this dryer straigthens my hair</li>
            <li> I would try to work it through my hair ( explains how thick it is)</li>
            <li> and I have thick hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair</li>
            <li> I usually have blow dryers for years!  </li>
            <li> a solution.&lt;br /&gt;The cons are that this dryer is heavy!!</li>
            <li> so it is very heavy!</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that the comb attachment has a hard time staying on.</li>
            <li> something kinda serious..</li>
            <li> You seriously won&#x27;t regret buying it.</li>
            <li> Not a good scene.</li>
            <li> I am very slightly disappointed because the finish is already starting to chip off around the nozzle.  </li>
            <li> However, I find this very hard to use because of the location of the power and heat switches.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that requires a lot of heat.</li>
            <li> No more frizz!!  </li>
            <li> My hair has broken off.  </li>
            <li> I believe mine died because of a short in the cable, so I am choosing NOT to hang this one by the opening at the end of the base, even though it looks like it should be hung that way.  </li>
            <li> I am not a happy customer...</li>
            <li> Not happy anymore.</li>
            <li> you have to hold the barrel where it attaches which is a bit frustrating.</li>
            <li> The design is poor.  </li>
            <li> It can be quite frustrating.</li>
            <li> Not happy customer.</li>
            <li> My biggest problem is that the comb teeth have broken and I can&#x27;t seem to find a replacement piece for the comb attachment.  </li>
            <li> and I am not being dramatic.</li>
            <li> It is heavy and the buttons are located in a bad spot.  </li>
            <li> The bad news is that the concentrator attachment (there are three attachments - I use the narrow concentrator every day for straightening) is unnecessarily difficult to attach.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry but 9 months (maybe 3 days</li>
            <li> Sad day.</li>
            <li> However, it arrived with the totally wrong attachments.  </li>
            <li> #34;buttons wrong location&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;too loud&amp;#34;, etc...</li>
            <li> i was totally wrong.  </li>
            <li> but sadly I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Just mediocre hair dryer could&#x27;ve bought one at Walmart</li>
            <li> what was wrong with it - it looked like i got it off of the store shelf.</li>
            <li> They were put in an awkward spot.  </li>
            <li> You can also hold and press a cold button and it will blow cold air.</li>
            <li> I also like the cold shot button</li>
            <li> so that was a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> Yes, as mentioned, the power and heat control buttons are awkwardly placed on the handle.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> well, wrong!</li>
            <li> Also, the switches are badly located.</li>
            <li> But this time I was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have never been so disappointed on any online purchase like this one.  </li>
            <li> that they might re-ship this dangerously defective one to you!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> The attachments are a pain in the butt to put on and off :(</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this product and would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that 2 years have gone by and it died.  </li>
            <li> I had to tape it on. :(</li>
            <li> But what I find annoying about this dryer are the controls.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reducing the rating to two stars, because without the attachment, this dryer is worthless to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s annoying</li>
            <li> I used to hate Saturday hair days, now no problem.  </li>
            <li> It is not a deal breaker, but a bit annoying.</li>
            <li> it is very dangerous!</li>
            <li> HATE IT!  </li>
            <li> This is probably the worst hairdryer I have purchased in my 31 years of living.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed to say that the hair-dryer I received is defective!</li>
            <li> the moment I turned it on, smoke and a horrible burning smell started to come out of it!</li>
            <li> Annoying!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Amazing I love this blow dryer, I had the red one when I was in hair school, the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is, it doesn&#x27;t have a cool button it has warm and it doesn&#x27;t have a retractable Cord, other then that I love it</li>
            <li> girlfriend can&#x27;t stop raving about it.  said her hair felt different the first morning she used it.  cut her drying time by 1/3.  anyone whining about this hairdryer being abnormally heavy needs to stop having their personal shoppers carry everything for them all the time.</li>
            <li> The blower dryer gets extremely hot and damages your hair if used blow wet hair dry. My hair has broken off.  My co-worker sets to blow her hair out. She accidently dropped the hot blow dryer between her legs.  She has 3rd degree burns. She said her skin melted from the heat of the dryer. Imagine if the blow dryer touched her face and melted the skin off! I would not recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> I love the blowdryer, the only thing is the color was not what you see in the picture, it was a shade of a greenish gold color. other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I used a similar product at a hotel in Boston.  That night, I went online to purchase.  Overall, I am very happy with its performance.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this about 3 weeks.  So far it is worth the money.  Dries my hair quickly.  I have short hair, but my daughter has longer, very thick hair and it works well for her too.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer after using the travel size at a Towne Place Suites thinking that if the small one was great, the big one would be better. Not so. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it is great, very hot, very high-powered, but doesn&#x27;t cut off a LOT of time off using my old dryer. However, I do like it a lot and it is styling my hair quicker. I think I probably would have been happier with the travel size one, which is why I can only give it four stars. However, for the price, definitely good.</li>
            <li> I just bought this dryer a couple weeks ago, I really like it. It dries my hair quickly and it does not leave my hair frizzy.  The only thing I would change is the on/off button. I hit that often causing it to shut off.</li>
            <li> This dryer is heavy and loud, I would not recommend it to anybody.  I was in a hurry for a new dryer so I bought it at retail store for 59.00.  Sooooo not worth it.  AND, the air is not hot at all.  It blows cool air on the hot setting. Also, the buttons on the side turn the dryer off while drying.  They were put in an awkward spot.  HATE IT!  And no, I&#x27;m not the one to sit and write reviews unless I feel very strongly about something. And this, I feel that everyone should know so they don&#x27;t waste their money like I did.</li>
            <li> Love it. Powerful and totally worth the price. Dries my hair in half the time.</li>
            <li> Great blow dryer...leaves hair silky with lost of shine. Works fast. Only problem too big for my small hands, so taking some getting used to. Great product none the less. Excellent dryer.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell a big difference between this Blow Dryer and my cheaper dryer I purchased at Target. My hair seems to dry in the same amount of time.  But what I find annoying about this dryer are the controls.  They are right where I grip the dryer and I am always turning it off. Maybe I would get a faster blow dry if I wasn&#x27;t turning the darn thing off 5 or 6 times everytime I dry my hair.  After 3 months of using this dryer I am now holding it with my fingers sticking out and dropping it once in awhile because of the grip.  But it must be made well because it still works after all the drops.</li>
            <li> Some have commented that this blow dryer is heavy. It doesn&#x27;t seem heavier than any other powerful dryer, and it dries hair twice as quick as others we&#x27;ve had that are marketed as professional strength. My daughter&#x27;s hair is thick and very long. I&#x27;m sometimes asked to start drying it while she puts on her makeup. It&#x27;s a request I welcome: any moments w/my daughter who goes away to college are stolen. It&#x27;s a far shorter task with this dryer, and neither of us end up sweating.     Re comments about the attachments not staying on the nozzle. I duly noted that, and therefore it did not frustrate me when I found that was sometimes the case. We&#x27;re not big attachment users, and I know where the duct tape is! Given its overall performance, it isn&#x27;t a deal breaker. I&#x27;ve paid a lot more money for a lot less. If this has the staying power, and doesn&#x27;t burn out faster than more expensive ones we&#x27;ve had, it will rank as one of my best buys from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is probably the worst hairdryer I have purchased in my 31 years of living. It is super heavy and doesn&#x27;t even blow hot air. I would not recommend and am super sad because I threw the box away and cannot return it. Based on all the positive reviews, I thought I would love it, but I was VERY wrong.</li>
            <li> I am so entirely pleased with this hair dryer that I&#x27;m coming back for another one... 2 1/2 years later. I&#x27;ve burned through cheaper, store-bought hair dryers in the past. I bought an Andis many years ago and it was wonderful, so I bought this model in June 2009, and sadly today in December 2011 it finally fizzled out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer works extremely quickly. I remember comparing it to the past model I had, and the reason I&#x27;ve stuck with Andis since because of their efficiency (and longevity). I have naturally loose-curly hair, and I use this dryer daily to straighten my hair with a round brush. It allows my hair to retain a lot of body, come out super-soft, and avoid frizz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the switches on the handle are kind of in a bad place, I eventually got used to it and rarely do I accidentally turn it off. It&#x27;s not hard to turn back on, so I don&#x27;t see it as that big of an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had great customer service experience with Andis in the past as well. The plastic piece that holds the filter on the back of the dryer (at the air intake) broke and no longer functioned. I also broke one of the attachments. I called their customer service number and they replaced both items free of charge, even though I&#x27;d had the dryer for more than a year!</li>
            <li> I had an Andis hair dryer before and this one is just as good if not better than the last one I owned.  It has some weight to it but it makes it feel much sturdier than most of the plastic ones.  Plus it looks much more expensive than it really was.</li>
            <li> Drys hair very quickly and does not damage hair. My hair has more volume with no frizz, and it looks much smoother. I would recommend to anyone looking for a new dryer.</li>
            <li> I just got this dryer for Christmas, and I absolutely love it!  My hair has zero static, which is unusual during the winter.  Usually it takes about 15 minutes, at the minimum, to dry my hair, but with this dryer, it only took 5 minutes!  I would buy this dryer for everyone I know!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this dryer.  All the settings and attachments let me do almost anything with my hair.  I have a bad right arm and can&#x27;t use curlers so this really helped me look presentable!</li>
            <li> I really like this hair dryer. It&#x27;s a little heavy, but it&#x27;s not the manufacturing it&#x27;s my medical condition. I was having a hard time drying my hair and one of my daughter&#x27;s hair because it&#x27;s so thick. This one is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it a four was because two of the teeth on the comb have already broken and I&#x27;ve only had it about two months. I think it should automatically come with an extra comb instead of one of those other attachments.</li>
            <li> I bought this hairdryer because the one I had died.  It was basically the exact same dryer in a different color, and it lasted 5 years.  I believe mine died because of a short in the cable, so I am choosing NOT to hang this one by the opening at the end of the base, even though it looks like it should be hung that way.  This drier is the cheapest ceramic ionic drier I have found, and it truly works fast.  I can dry my thick, curly (though short) hair in 5-10 minutes, and it does not get frizzy.  I only use the warm setting-- hot is too hot for me, and I appreciate the cool burst though I wish it had a cool setting. It also is a standard size, so can take a diffuser without a problem-- I use it this way every day.  I couldn&#x27;t live without this dryer-- it dries my hair so fast without any damage.  Also, I do not find it too heavy.</li>
            <li> Quality, color, and operation are commendable, but unit is too large and heavy. Definitely for a strong professional.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer.  Unlike most non-commercial hair dryers, it gets hot enough to quickly dry my hair.  It&#x27;s weight is typical for dryers this size.  The buttons on the handle are easily avoided once you use the dryer a couple of times.  I also like the color.  I would buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> There were a lot of mixed reviews about this Andis Ceramic Hair Dryer, but I decided to give it a try anyway.  I am SO glad that I did!  This hair dryer does a fantastic job.  I can definitely tell that my hair is healthier than when I used a cheap hair dryer.      A lot of people complained about it being too heavy, but it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all to me. It looks and feels professional.    It also connects to my diffuser well, and it made my hair curly way better than my old hair dryer.  I would definitely recommend this hair dryer to anyone!</li>
            <li> I got this dryer for Christmas last year, and I absolutley loved it! I didn&#x27;t find it too heavy. It was quiet, and my hair felt great after drying it. Only thing I didn&#x27;t care for was how hot the attachments got after using. Other than that I loved this hair dryer.   But dang it, in October I took it with me to Tahoe for a wedding, and the dang thing just quit working. I was soooo dissappointed. I had to use those cheapo hair dryers that the hotels put in. I&#x27;m sorry but 9 months (maybe 3 days a week)of use and it dies!!!! What&#x27;s up with that? If it had not died in such a critical moment, I would have given 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this hair dryer I read pretty much all of the reviews on the earlier edition.  The ratings were high, so I decided to get the latest edition and try it out.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if the dryer would work wonders with my hair type.  As an African American female with natural hair, finding a blow dryer that straightens as well as dries quickly is always a process.  But using the Andis is like a breath of fresh air! It takes me about 10-15 to dry my hair with the comb extension.  And Yay for the comb extension! I am so happy with my purchase I have been telling everyone I know to get it:)</li>
            <li> My fiance love this thing. It has the professional look and feel you&#x27;d expect from Andis. As far as details go, I&#x27;m not sure as I am a bald male :) But based on her smile and shouting things like \\&quot;cool blast\\&quot;, I&#x27;m assuming she loves it.  She did use it a few days ago, and again no complaints.</li>
            <li> It would work great for someone with regular hair, not too thick. But it doesn&#x27;t really help me with mine. Too heavy to hold for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> excelente vendedor, cumplio con los tiempos establecidos y el porducto se llego a su destino en perfectas condiciones, recomendado 100%</li>
            <li> Well I was not sure, thinking it would be too bulky and big and the reviews were not as fabulous as I expected....but I am thrilled with this dryer.  The warm and hot temps are spot on.  I have straight hair, but I have frizz within 20 minutes of doing my hair....not anymore.  This appliance is just what I needed and I love it so much I bought an appliance holder for my counter to keep it handy at all times!</li>
            <li> I have use Andies products for a long time and they always seem to be what I expect. (Really good) But this time I was extremely disappointed. It is a very, very heavy dryer and probably the noises blow dryer I have ever herd in my life. On top of that the directional nossel is metal so it gets really hot and so when it fly off like it always does it is impossible to get back on with out burning yourself. I have only had it for about 3 months and now the handle is starting to burn me about 5 minutes into the style. I just keep having more and more issues the longer I have it. The only reason why I gave it 2 star instead of 1 is because it get hair dry really fast and it has been the best for straightening my salon guests hair. But to say the least I will not be buying this model for my next blow dryer purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the second one of this model my wife owned.  The blower fan severed off the spindal on the last one we had.  Hopefully, it won&#x27;t happen again.  Regardless, we were very happy with the price on Amazon.  The items was over $80 dollars in the salon when she bought it about a year ago.  The dryer appears to be very heavy duty and good enough to be used at the hair salons.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer i&#x27;ve ever purchased!!! It has cut my drying time down to 20 minutes, i have shoulder length thick hair that is prone to frizz. It leaves my soft and smooth. The only downside is that it gets extremely hot and can burn the bristles on a round brush. I&#x27;ve had to try out different brushes that stand up to the heat and a tourmaline ceramic round brush is the best. Overall, i would recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed to say that the hair-dryer I received is defective! the moment I turned it on, smoke and a horrible burning smell started to come out of it! it is very dangerous! Also, I ordered for a new item. The one I received was NOT. When the package arrived, I noticed there was tearing on the box. Obviously someone else returned it and probably reported as defective merchandise before. How could the seller ship this item out again and deliberately in danger costumers?! I have never been so disappointed on any online purchase like this one.  Do not order this hair-dryer. Giving the behavior pattern, it&#x27;s very possible that they might re-ship this dangerously defective one to you!</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer! Unlike some of the reviews I do not feel it is heavy ,but I have always used a full sized dryer as opposed to some of the more compact ones out there in the market. I did have to get used to the switch placement the first couple of times I used it, and the nozzles can be difficult to turn if they are put  on too tight, but these are minor adjustments one has to make while getting used to a new product.     My hair is noticeably straighter and very soft since starting to use this dryer, I don&#x27;t necessarily feel it dries my hair any quicker than my old one  did, but the end results are definitely  better!</li>
            <li> When my inexpensive, but reliable blow dryer died after 4 years I purchased this one based on the number of positive reviews.  But, as with any appliance, there&#x27;s bound to be a dud here and there and I guess I got it.    After only a couple of uses, it would make a muffled rattling noise and shut off. Thankfully, Amazon makes returns easy.  Not sure if I&#x27;ll chance this particular one again though.</li>
            <li> This is a very good qaulity hair dryer.  It is light weight, has plenty of power and yet is incredibly quiet.  Much better than a previous version that had the power but also the added weight.  The Andis 82005 closes the gap between merely a consumer product and a professional dryer, but retains a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I originally rated this a 4 star but am now changing it to a 1 star because this dryer broke quickly.  I would re-done the review sooner but didn&#x27;t think of it.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE (and am STILL using) this product. Great hair dryer.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this hair dryer.  It&#x27;s quiet and seems to dry her hair quicker than others she&#x27;s used.  Slightly heavier than cheaper hair dryers, but doesn&#x27;t seem to bother her.  She&#x27;s bought cheap hair dryers for years and ends up burning them up after 6 months to a year.  I decided to spend a little extra and get her a good one.  So far, the Andis 82005 is holding up well!</li>
            <li> I am quite dissapointed in this hair dryer -- its making a loud noise, &amp; I have only used it 3 times. Its also cumbersome &amp; heavy &amp; too large  &amp; the warm setting is far too hot... its like hot.  I am not a happy customer...</li>
            <li> its super loud and kind of heavy. I dont really know if i like it. Dont recommend</li>
            <li> This dryer drys my hair extremely fast. It IS a bit heavier than what I am used to, but the results are well worth it. At first, it was difficult for me to figure out the best way to hold it because of it&#x27;s size and placement of the controls. Once I figured out what worked for me, it worked like a dream.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife for Christmas and she has been using it on daily basis. I am glad that she loves it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, design of switches and location cause my wife and I both to shut the unit down while in use when moving it around and changing hands.</li>
            <li> it does not show \\&quot;ceramic ionic\\&quot; function, but it dry very fast. ok product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it didn&#x27;t work on my hair type.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer to replace my Super Solano that died after more than a decade.  I loved the Solano, but I wanted to see if a significantly less expensive dryer would work as well.  The good news is, it dries just fine.  The bad news is that the concentrator attachment (there are three attachments - I use the narrow concentrator every day for straightening) is unnecessarily difficult to attach.  For the first couple of months, it took a great deal of effort and force to get the concentrator nozzle attached.  I had to twist and turn and manuever it every which way.  Even when I managed to get it on, it was easy to knock it off during the course of drying my hair.  I had to wait a minute or two to reattach it because the nozzle was too hot to handle.  When it cooled down sufficiently, the twisting and turning began anew.  When this happened numerous times during one attempt to dry my hair, it got pretty frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;As others have noted, the thin chrome finish of the dryer chips off very easily, particularly when using the attachments.  After having owned this for about two months, the chrome is completely chipped off (the dryer has a matte black finish underneath the chrome) where the concentrator attaches.  It doesn&#x27;t look great, but I don&#x27;t have to worry anymore about brushing chrome flakes off my clothes every morning.&lt;br /&gt;Over the past week, it&#x27;s gotten much easier to get the concentrator attached, and it&#x27;s less prone to fall off.  I assume it just took a couple of months to \\&quot;stretch.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 11/9/10: The attachment no longer will stay on the dryer.  I&#x27;m reducing the rating to two stars, because without the attachment, this dryer is worthless to me.</li>
            <li> I really really like this blow dryer. worked well on my thick coarse hair. I really believe it cut down my drying time. I would definately recommend this to others. Seller was great and the price was reasonable...cannot give it 5 stars because its still heat....which is damaging :)</li>
            <li> I got this blow dryer and returned it within a week. It&#x27;s a cute dryer, but when I turned it on high and shut it off it would smoke. It wouldn&#x27;t do it on low, but I still felt it was unsafe. It could have just been the dryer that I got, just be aware if you purchase one.</li>
            <li> This was a fine dryer, but I returned it. It simply wasn&#x27;t as quiet as I hoped. i ended up going to a drugstore in town and plugging in all the dryers. The one I purchased was also ionic, but much quieter owing to the fact that it had three speeds and two heat settings. That means I can keep the middle speed and the cold heat setting, and it&#x27;s much quieter than other dryers I tried.</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase of this hair dryer, although I do not really notice much of a difference that it is an ionic dryer.  The look is modern...it appears to be a quality product.</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer!  I have gone through about five now, and of all of them this is the best one.  It gets my hair straighter and silky.  It always has a good shine and never leaves that static cling effect.  Also all of the attachments are great!!</li>
            <li> I initially liked this dryer but it is heavy and all the teeth in my comb broke. Now I cannot find a replacement comb. If anyone knows where I can get one, I would appreciate it</li>
            <li> The first one I purchased had to be returned the same week.  We noticed that although it was turned off (but plugged in) it was extremely hot to the touch.  We had no problems whatsoever returning the product to Amazon.  I have received a replacement in the mail; however, I am a little afraid to use it and will be very certain to unplug it after usage.</li>
            <li> I love the hair dryer but the comb attachment starting breaking on our first use.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer works great. My hair looks really shiny after using and soft. The blow dryer is a little heavy. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> This product does justice to those who have thick, full hair to even silky fine hair. I have used several blow dryers and this one has help protect breakage, it&#x27;s easy to use and to store, and eliminates me from oiling or heating my hair as much without it&#x27;s Ionic Ceramic Support. The heat and wattage combined helps keep my hair shiny, healthy and straight. Less use of flat-iron and pressing comb!  I&#x27;m a Satisfied Customer! : )</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a professional hair dryer... Andis 82005 is the one...dries your hair in no time (&amp; my hair is seriously long &amp; I like it super straight &amp; swingy)...&amp; the dryer itself is so sleek looking...it&#x27;s a beautiful thing! Highly recommended...</li>
            <li> I have had this blow dryer for about 2 months now, and love it! I had a T3 that I spent a lot of $ on, and it only lasted 2 years......not great in my book! It is a bit heavy, but not a big deal to me.</li>
            <li> HAS EVERITHING I WAS WAITING FOR. IT&#x27;S A VALUABLE ITEM. SINCERELY I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Best hair dryer. I have long hair and this dryer has enough power to dry my hair quickly. Feels substantial and has some power.</li>
            <li> This dryer is the dryer of all hair dryers!  I have long thick hair (african-american) and I have never had a perm.  All natural.  I have tried different hair dyers and all of the comb attachments would break or come off while I am trying to dry my hair.  Not only is this product worth every penny, but I love the resin pick, the color of the product and the comb hasn&#x27;t slid off yet!!!!!!  I plan on buying another one soon and if you have hair that is thick or you are of mixed race, this comb is great!  The only con is that the dryer is kind of loud but trust me, you won&#x27;t care once you put it to your hair. The price is great from this seller and I received the product in a week!  Very happy.</li>
            <li> I also have trouble finding tools and products for my hair. I have thick hair that is kinky in the back and wavy in the front. This blow dryer helps to elminate the use of my pressing comb. I just blow dry then flat iron now! I still get a nice soft pressed look!</li>
            <li> I think I bought this around 3 or 4 years ago. It is still a fabulous asset in my morning routine. Great quality, great hair dryer</li>
            <li> it does what it supposed to do. don&#x27;t know what else to say than that.</li>
            <li> I am really very happy with this hair dryer.  I bought it after reading about what a dream ceramic/ionic dryers are and researching here on Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 is for noise.  I had hoped that new dryers (my last one is at least 7 years old) might have quiter motors in them.&lt;br /&gt;This does what it says.  My hair dried to styling point within 3 minutes instead of 8.  My frizzies were reduced by at least 75% without the use of any syling products or leave-in conditioners.  That alone is amazing and worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer mentioned that this was heavy, making it hard to use.  I don&#x27;t notice a weight difference between this and my older Conair.  I do notice that the nozzle is about an inch longer, so every now and again I&#x27;ll bump myself on the head, but that&#x27;s simply user error.  :D&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never been particularly handy with the attachments, but they&#x27;re there.  It has two directional nozzles (one plastic, one metal that scratches the dryers finish) and one directional with 1 1/2\\&quot; picks coming off of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all this is an awesome machine that gets the job done in way less time and with great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;After owning this for most of a month I am still very satisfied.  My rating would stay the same.  I am very slightly disappointed because the finish is already starting to chip off around the nozzle.  I wondered how I had gotten glitter all over my hair and face... it is the shiny finish flaking away.  Glitter isn&#x27;t the end of the world, and I don&#x27;t care what my dryer looks like so long as it works properly.  Just a note in case others consider looks/finish when purchasing hair dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE*** lowered score to a two.&lt;br /&gt;This was a nice dryer while it lasted.  It literally blew up in 2011.  I was drying my hair and the side exploded and the motor came flying out, narrowly missing my face.  My ears rang from the \\&quot;pop\\&quot; noise.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this product. It is not the sturdy,sleek device I thought I was getting. It feels a bit light and flimsy, The cord is long and hard to manage (no easy way to roll it up). The attachments don&#x27;t seem to fit the dryer and fall off or simply can not be secured to the dryer. It does dry my hair but I am not sure what I would do if I had to style it regularly. I am considering another dryer now ....</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as the other Andis with the retractable cord and it is double the price. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Good, light weight dryer. Would be perfect if the attachment would stay in place. Dryer needs a place where you can secure the attachments in place</li>
            <li> Heavy and unwieldy.  Only 2 speeds, low &amp; high.  Low blows my hair all over--it&#x27;s too high.  Don&#x27;t want to think about what \\&quot;high\\&quot; speed would do.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works fine.  It has several settings that are good as well.  The only problem that I see with the hairdryer is that the switches are located on the handle and as your hand wraps around to hold the dryer, you inadvertently shut it off.  It&#x27;s annoying but I feel as though it&#x27;s just something I will get used to in time.  Everything else about it is --- so far, so good.</li>
            <li> No more frizz!!  Dries my hair fast and makes it shiny.  Easy to handle and use.  Love the attachments too.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product. I have thick hair and overall it dried it quicker than any other blow dryer i ever had. i received it on time and just as shown in the picture thats how i got my product.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that is almost to the bottom of my lower back (or top of my bottom, lol). Standard hair dryers max capacity that cost more took at least double the time to get my hair from wet to dry. It&#x27;s amazing. I love that it has the Ionic  capability and the cool air, to help decrease the frizzie&#x27;s and keep my hair style set. Not that hair that long has much style.    It did come with attachments that I have no idea what their purpose is, so those are kind of a waste.    I was initially concerned the first few days because the temp. seemed to be fluctuating, however after a few uses it smoothed out. The cord is really long, which is great because the only outlet I have in my bathroom has ruined several blow dryers by melting the plug. So I&#x27;m easily able to plug in else where an still reach the bathroom.  I&#x27;m thrilled that drying my hair is not a ten to fifteen minute ordeal, closer to five. Every minute counts when your getting ready.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery</li>
            <li> I have had this blow dryer for about 6 months now and it works great. I have A LOT of LONG very THICK hair, and it takes me about 6 minutes to completely blow dry my hair. Usually I blow dry my hair in about 3 different time fragments though. I get out of the shower; blow dry for 2-3 minutes, start applying my makeup, blow dry again for another 2-3 minutes until it is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never used the attachments; i ended up throwing them away a few days ago. I feel like it has good power. I like that you can have it on hot or warm air. You can also hold and press a cold button and it will blow cold air. The cold air button is easy to push (unlike most of my old blow dryers, your thumb would go numb after a few minutes). It looks classy, still after 6 months of use every day it looks new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this blow dryer to anyone. I paid $35.83 for it and would spend it again if needed.</li>
            <li> I got this blower dryer for Christmas after I had picked it out and had it on my wish list.  I decided to make sure it worked before I threw away all the packaging.  As soon as I turned it on there was a funny burning smell.  I ran it for about 30 seconds on high and turned it off and smoke came out of the barrel.  I waited about five minutes and tried it again, same thing happened.</li>
            <li> I think that this dryer works well, but I have 2 complaints. 1) the cord is REALLY long. 2) I accidentally hit the \\&quot;off\\&quot; button constantly while using it. The power &amp; heat buttons are right where your hand goes, so while holding the brush &amp; hair dryer I am constantly turning it off accidentally.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best blow dryers I&#x27;ve ever owned. It dries your hair quickly, and leaves it feeling soft not dried out. I almost didn&#x27;t purchase it because of the price, but I&#x27;m glad I did. You get what you pay for, and this is a great blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I 1st used an Andis hair dryer in a hotel in Arizona where the heat frizzed out my hair, this dryer provides a smooth blow out that lasts.</li>
            <li> I just received my dryer 7-19-2013 luv it.. I have thick hair and needed a blow dryer that can do the job this dryer straigthens my hair something kinda serious.. I would recommend it..</li>
            <li> WOW! I searched and searched for a good blow dryer and decided upon this one. It was the best decision. I am a professional so I have to have a sturdy blow dryer and this one is that and more! It dries the hair in about 3-4 minutes including long hair! With no frizz! I love it and would buy another one in a heartbeat!</li>
            <li> I really thought the \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; drying system was just tech hype, but this thing really dries quickly!  We use it mainly to dry the dog; just point it at a spot on his fur, and it&#x27;s dry within seconds.  It&#x27;s a BIG dryer, and not as quiet as we&#x27;d hoped - still scared the dog a little at first.</li>
            <li> This WAS a great hair dryer for a couple of months. I received the dryer in May and used it regularly for several months. In August I noticed that it just didn&#x27;t feel hot any more. I pushed all the switches and button up and down, in and out several times to see if something was stuck but no luck, it just stopped blowing hot air.  I immediately contacted Andis via email and asked what I should do about the malfunctioning dryer but as of now, 3 weeks later, no response from Andis. Bummer!</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a gift for my daughter.  This dryer works great with high rate of usage.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and this hair dryer is fantastic. Dries my hair faster than ever without torching it. When the time comes, I would buy another one.</li>
            <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Powerful and dry hear fast. A bit heavy though but once you get used to it, it is doing its job perfectly</li>
            <li> Excellent dryer leaves hair puffy and doesnt feel damaged best dryer I have ever used!</li>
            <li> this product it&#x27;s one of the best that my girlfried likes she uses every weekend saturday and sunday and even on weekdays</li>
            <li> the review I read on this dryer warned me that it was heavy. But the difference in ounces seemed small...They are not. When you are holding a dryer to dry your entire head, you want it to be light. I regret this purchase. On the flip side, it&#x27;s strong and powerful.</li>
            <li> Update: 7/7/16 I still have the hairdryer after almost 3 years ago. I love it. It still work as it did the very first time I used it. You seriously won&#x27;t regret buying it. love it, powerful, it doesn&#x27;t get hot, it doesn&#x27;t smell like burning, it dries my hair leaving it soft and shiny, no frizzy and also it dries my hair in no time, I have sorta thick hair. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair dryer! It takes only a few minutes to dry the hair. My only negative comment is its a little heavy...</li>
            <li> Love this dryer, works so great and fast too. Bought it for my mom as a gift and she absolutely loves it! She has very thick hair and hair dryer worked great for her.</li>
            <li> 2 weeks after I ordered this hairdryer it stopped blowing hot air. It also is much heavier than most hairdryers, and, when it was working,  I really didn&#x27;t notice a big difference between this hairdryer and regular(non-ionic), less expensive dryers.</li>
            <li> I had been using a $15 dryer for a couple years, but thought it was time to upgrade. I was a bit skeptical about a blow dryer making any difference, but I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised. I&#x27;ve had it for about a month now and it does dry my hair faster and results in less frizz. It is noticeably heavier than my last dryer, but not enough that it would prohibit me from recommending it. Great dryer for the money!</li>
            <li> I recommend this dryer 100%. Really a good product. I dried my hair in only 20 minutes and the appearance was shinny and straight.</li>
            <li> Functionally, this blow dryer is great.  It&#x27;s powerful, very good for straightening, and the high/low heat and air settings are handy.  The long cord is convenient too.  It is a little on the loud side, but... it&#x27;s a blowdryer, so it&#x27;s not something I would necessarily expect to be quiet.  Also, every once in a while I accidentally turn it off because the setting switches are right about where my hand goes, but I guess that&#x27;s the tradeoff for them being in a convenient place.  Other than that this dryer is great and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this hair dryer about a month but so far it is excellent.  It is very powerful and  dries my long hair (complete with styling it) in under 10 minutes!  My only complaint is the location of the on/off switch as it&#x27;s easy to accidentally turn it off while using it.</li>
            <li> awesome hair dryer,this is not a cheap one from your local variety store,well built works great worth every pennie and then some,GREAT BUY.</li>
            <li> After the reviews, I thought I&#x27;d give this brand a try, and I love it. I usually buy the cheap dryers, to find they don&#x27;t last very long and don&#x27;t dry very fast. This dryer not only drys my thick hair very fast, but it is so soft and smooth. I never thought hairdryers could do all that! I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for something a little more professional, but still wanted something relatively inexpensive. Great product!</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer that styles my hair well and reduces frizz/flyaways.  It&#x27;s 2 heat settings, plus cool blast button enable me to round brush my hair even when it&#x27;s almost dry.  My only complaint is that the buttons are in a weird place so I accidently hit the hot/warm switch or turn it off while drying my hair.</li>
            <li> This is my first ceramic blow dryer and it did wonders to my hair. First off I have VERY thick hair and I am not being dramatic. I am African American (ethnic hair) and I don&#x27;t get relaxers so when my hair gets wet it is literally a fro. Therefore I Hav to use the comb attachment. Well The comb attachment would not stay on the drier everytime I would try to work it through my hair ( explains how thick it is) so i ended up duck taping the comb head on which worked perfectly. I must admit it was a little heavy becase i have to put in more work to blow dry. The blow dryer got my hair straighter and fast. So it took me half the time to blow dry it and less time to flat iron it. Over all the blow dryer  is great, just duck tape the comb head on if that is what you use for your hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend as a gift she  loves it she has her own shop .</li>
            <li> This is an excellent hair dryer that out-performs the cheezy and inexpensive brands out there. Do not get cross minded when choosing this hair dryer because it get the job done right. Some people complain about how heavy this thing is and I can only tell you that any professional hair dryer is going to pretty close to this weight. Overall, this hair dryer is the best you can get for the money and it will perform as described.</li>
            <li> 2 out of the 3 attachments don&#x27;t fit the dryer; very cheap end of what I know Andis is capable of.  You won&#x27;t be happy with this if you&#x27;re looking for a professional grade dryer.</li>
            <li> The last blow dryer we bought cost almost $100.00  when it broke I headed my wife off and purchased this one from amazon and my wife said it was as good as the $100.00 one we had.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I loved this hair dryer. I really did. But this morning, it caught fire while I was drying my hair. Granted, I&#x27;ve had it for a few years, but nothing should catch fire like that as long as you take care of it. I was going to buy another one but when I first bought it, it was $35. Now its $84? Rip off central if you ask me! Not happy anymore. Sad day.</li>
            <li> ANDIS BLOW DRYERS ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THE ONES YOU BUY IN CHAIN STORES.  THEY DRY YOUR HAIR MUCH FASTER AND MAKE WAVY HAIR EASIER TO STYLE. THE ONLY PROBLEM I FIND IS THAT THEY ARE HEAVIER THAN THE STORE STANDARDS AND YOUR ARMS GET TIRED. I RECOMMEND THIS DRYER TO ANYONE WHO WANTS GREAT LOOKING HAIR FAST AND EASY</li>
            <li> This is the most pretty dryer that I have seen in a long time.  We haven&#x27;t used it yet,b ut it looks very nice and was a t a great price.</li>
            <li> Loved it.Every dollar i spent for this hairdryer was worth it.Every diff-user accessory comes with the hairdryer is better than the other.Especially the one that has o comb in front is extremely convenient for hair-straitening.</li>
            <li> It is alot heavier than I anticipated.  Shoulders are tired know since my second use a week ago. Drys well.</li>
            <li> This is a nice professional hair dryer, so far its working nicely. The only issue is the overweight, but it compensates with faster hair drying(even half the time than used to be with other brands). Me and my wife would recommend this if you want a faster hair dryer and stronger arm muscles...</li>
            <li> I love this, it has a long cord and I have thick hair so it dries much faster than other hair dryers</li>
            <li> in less than 2 years with minimal usage by just one person, this blow dryer no longer works.  Only blow cold air.  What a rip off, i have another \\&quot;professional\\&quot; dryer that is 15 years old, still blowing hot and strong.  DO not buy this one.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer. I like the settings so I have options for how much heat I put on my hair. I also like the cold shot button so I can dry my hair without heat. I like the attachments with give me styling options and the metallic design is really sleek.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice dryer, but it&#x27;s nothing too snazy. A really nice long cord. Sort of heavy, but I dont mind it much. Adds nice volume to my hair. I have no real complains about it.</li>
            <li> Great product that works as advertised. Dropped my wife&#x27;s original one on a tile floor and it shattered. Not a good scene. She can&#x27;t live without it. Great for curly hair-No frizz</li>
            <li> I had always wanted a Ceramic Blow Dryer.  Leaves my hair smoother and less flyaways.  Great product for the money.</li>
            <li> Really like the hair blower. makes my hair feel soft and silky..its a little heavy but it dries your hair fast do its no problem</li>
            <li> Not only is it slick and great to look at; it is light weight, has attachments and is more than I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed that people described this product as \\&quot;heavy\\&quot;. I find it incredibly light-weight and cheap. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price, but even at the Friday sale price this feels overpriced. I&#x27;d be stunned if it held up any time at all.</li>
            <li> So disappointing if you have it on medium setting just warm air blows out. Only when you have it on high setting does hot air blow out</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase since it was rather cheap for a good ionic dryer but it worked great. I have 3c type hair and it dried my hair rather quickly and straight, with minimal frizz BUT it did die out exactly a year later. So I guess you get what you pay for....but it was good while it lasted.</li>
            <li> Lots of power and the ionic features leaves my hair really shiny. The weight is not too heavy and the long cord works well for me.</li>
            <li> The product is very powerful. My hair dries in 3 min and shiny. It&#x27;s slightly large for operating but it just takes time to get used to</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT,DRYS HAIR FAST LIKE THE LONG CORD.SHOULD OF PURCHASED THIS DRYER A LONG TIME AGO ,HAD MANY OTHER HAIR DRYERS THIS ONE IS THE BEST FOR THE MONEY.</li>
            <li> Andis hair dryer is very good product.  Protects your hair, the hair dryer is very neat, and it gas a long cord, I love it.  Also, very good price.  I  recommend it.</li>
            <li> It blow drys my hair pretty well. However, it is heavy. I usually section my hair off to get it as straight as I can before flat ironing it. With this blow dryer I tend to just blow dry a entire section because it&#x27;s so heavy. I wanted my own hair dryer instead of having to use my mothers. Sometimes I want to go back to using her hair dryer because it isn&#x27;t as heavy.</li>
            <li> I have worked in a salon for ten years, and I love this blow-dryer. It&#x27;s my new favorite. The long cord is helpful at home too. It&#x27;s not too loud, and the shiny gun-metal color looks expensive. It drys my hair twice as fast as my old one. I plan to have this a long time. Worth the price!</li>
            <li> I have had this hair dryer for a few years now. It works great! The only setback is that the point started chipping after a year around the nozzle blower. Perhaps it is from the water in my hair when i blow dry? I am not sure, but either way it works great and has lasted for a long time. The attachments are a pain in the butt to put on and off :(</li>
            <li> This dryer is works really well on my thick (African American and Mexican American) hair and very quickly. I bought it mainly because of the comb attachment. It&#x27;s slightly heavier than other hair dryers but is also more visually appealing. If you switch attachments while you dry your hair this isn&#x27;t or you, they get very hot. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Good hairdryer for the price. Some hair dryers really make my color treated hair look dry and frizzy. This one works well with my hair type to keep it looking smoother than the average dryer.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer has exceeded my standards.  I love it when doing my daughter hair she never complained about it being to hot or the comb pulling her hair. After drying the hair it looked fabulous it just blew with the wind bouncy.  My daughter loved it.. it makes the hair look like you left the salon beautiful. .. I love it...</li>
            <li> Great product.  Dries hair much faster than previous less expensive dryers which stop working after a year.  Attachments weren&#x27;t in box and merchant had excellent customer service.  Would buy again product from merchant again.  Very happy.  Healthier hair.</li>
            <li> Great hairdryer, probably the closest thing to a professional grade product that I&#x27;ll ever get.  It looks great and dries my long hair in about 5 mins (half the time it took with my old Conair dryer).  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s very noisy, and as other customers commented, the attachments get very hot and I&#x27;ve burnt myself a couple of times when accidentally brushing against them.</li>
            <li> the first days love it.... I didn&#x27;t use it every day, just 1 day every other week... after 2 months, it started to smell burned and didn&#x27;t turn on.... it is trash!!!</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer,because it get the job done,for less the price. I do a lot of natural hair and it smooth out that cuticle allowing me to Flatiron the hair smooth and straight.this it&#x27;s the second one I bought.  One For Home And One For word. Love it.</li>
            <li> This a great dryer, dries hair fast, no frizz main reason I bought., yes I would recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t found anything I dislike.</li>
            <li> Very Good hair dryer, very professional with nice controls and a nice long cord.</li>
            <li> I like this blow dryer a lot. It leaves my hair less frizzy and staticy and leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth. It does get very hot but thats a good thing for me at least :) I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast. This dryer dries my thick long hair quite a bit qucker than the dryer it replaced. I also really like that the cord is extra long.  I don&#x27;t plan to use the attachmens so I cannot comment on those.</li>
            <li> Its a great hairdryer. Its much less noisy than some of the  others. It motivated me to go out and purchase another blow dryer to replace the cheap Walmart brand that I had bought before. It seems to do a good job drying my hair even though, its hard to tell because I do not have very much hair</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift and was what my daughter asked for. It meets her expectations and was just what she wanted.</li>
            <li> I Love this blower.. Needed a good blower that won&#x27;t burn out and this blower is good.. I Love it.. The delivery was especially quick too.. Thank you.. Love the product..</li>
            <li> This is a good product in a sense that it provides good performance for the money. I have no complaints whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! It cuts drying time in half. The only bad thing is that the comb attachment has a hard time staying on.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer works great. My hair is course and thick and it dries my hair in half the time it took my old dryer. It&#x27;s not as light as it looks but about average weight. I also love the sleek chrome color. A very good buy.</li>
            <li> This dryer has good power &amp; my hair comes out good (thin straight hair). It&#x27;s a bit heavy so it wouldn&#x27;t be good for someone with gripping or strength concerns. The on/off and heat buttons are not placed well. I accidentally turn the dryer off several times while I&#x27;m drying my hair, but that is only a minor inconvenience.</li>
            <li> recieved hair dryer in timely matter and tried it the first day i got it. the dryer heats up fast and the straightening pick that come with it really works. for the price it was a good buy. recommend product to buy.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful chrome/gun metal looking dryer with an extra long cord that I love. The first day I got it,  I accidentally dropped it in a sink full of water- it was completely submerged. It immediately shut off as soon as it hit the water.  I left it to dry and the next day I plugged it in and it WORKED.  I was pretty impressed.</li>
            <li> Works great and gets the job done with ease.  Wish it had better attachments; tooth if the comb attachment broke on first use. Great otherwise.</li>
            <li> Best blow dryer. I purchased the same one 7 years ago and it worked perfectly until I plugged it into a hotel plug and it blew. Glad I was able to find it on here, and I am back in love again!!!</li>
            <li> This has been a great tool.  The temp control, tools, looks have all been as claimed from the site.</li>
            <li> The long power cord is really useful for chasing kids around the house when they won&#x27;t hold still for getting their hair dried. Other than that, it seems like any other hair dryer. You know, hot air blows out.</li>
            <li> It performes as expected.  My problem with it is it&#x27;s size.  I would never have purchased it if I had any idea how large it is.  It is so long that my arm is almost not long enough to keep from hitting myself in the head when drying my hair.</li>
            <li> I needed a new hairdryer.  The report on this one was very accurate.  It does a great job, is easy to use and dependable.  I can also take it to shows and vacations</li>
            <li> Have no problems with the performance, durability. Works as it should. That said, it is very, very heavy. Is like blow-drying your hair with a brick. Also, the switches are badly located. Often find myself accidentally shutting it off.</li>
            <li> I love my Andis blow dryer!! This thing is great! It gets super hot, has good settings you can adjust if you don&#x27;t want the hot feature, and it really is professional quality (even though I feel like ALL blow dryers say &#x27;professional&#x27;).  This has really been a staple, espically since trying to transition from relaxed to natural hair.  The cord could be a tad longer, but I would have a 30 foot cord on all my gadgets if possible so it may just be me.  I would recommend this dryer. I only use one nozzle for it though, I feel like the other nozzles it came with don&#x27;t fit, however I could just be mixing them up because I&#x27;ve had so many blow dryers throughout the years.</li>
            <li> I love the look and the power of the dryer but something about the Ion makes my hair greasy. Other then that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I like the hair dryer but it is definitely louder than my last dryer.  Also, even on the high setting, the hair dyer doesn&#x27;t get really hot.</li>
            <li> Used this when I stayed in a hotel in Phonex.&lt;br /&gt;Loved it and decided to find it to purchase online.  It dries your hair quickly.</li>
            <li> It is just what I was looking for.  I have frizzy hair and with this ionic hair dryer my hair was smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Used this hair dryer at a spa and loved it so bought one for home. It dries fast yet gently.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Dries my hair so much faster than my old dryer. Is a little heavier than my old dryer but I would not go back.</li>
            <li> It is too loud.  I googled quiet hair dryers and it came up.</li>
            <li> This is ok, I don&#x27;t think that it gets as hot as the gold n hot series so that was a bit disappointing. The comb attachment (which is the reason I purchased this model) does not stay on you have to hold the barrel where it attaches which is a bit frustrating.</li>
            <li> good, fast drier.  Would have gotten 5 stars if it came with a diffuser.</li>
            <li> I generally love the Andis product when I travel and it is in high end hotel rooms.  This particular &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; product is clumsy and the heads do not stay on the dryer.  I am disappointed in this product and would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Lots of heat and power, real pro dryer.</li>
            <li> my other ionic hair dryer just quite, so took a chance on this brand and not sorry what so ever!! fairly quiet and love the optional speeds and temp&#x27;s that my other one didn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer I have ever had.  However, it arrived with the totally wrong attachments.  I called Andis and they very kindly send me the correct fitting attachments.  This was ordered through Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Well made, but this baby is loud.</li>
            <li> Love this blow dryer a lot! It really works well!</li>
            <li> Love this blowdryer. First time I tried it out was at a resort in Napa. Loved it so much that I called the resort and asked them where they purchase the blowdryers, lol! Its a bit on the heavy side. But what a great blowdryer.</li>
            <li> Great hairdryer. I do wish it wasn&#x27;t as loud though.</li>
            <li> I have very long curly hair and need to dry my hair every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is hands down the best hair dryer for the best price on the Internet.  PERIOD.  I have had 3 of them already.  Yes, the temperature control does break after a couple of years, but for the price... give it away and buy another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is Ionic.  It is Quiet.  And the price is amaaaaaaaazing!  The settings are on the perfect place on the handle so you don&#x27;t inadvertently turn it off while drying your hair.  (A problem with a lot of hair dryers.)  It is very lightweight.  It makes my hair nice and curly.  I put a Hot Sock Ultralight Diffuser on the end (instead of the included attachments) and dry my hair everyday with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t look anywhere else for a Hair Dryer.  You will not be disappointed.  Buy it.  You have found the best hairdryer on the internet.</li>
            <li> its been a month and the hair dryer stop working, dont know what happen it just stop working and letting me hair wet</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It dries your hair really fast and allows it to be as straight or as curly as you want. This is one of the best hair dryers I have ever had, and I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I work in a beauty shop and it is wonderful it does everything I need it to do and more.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Dries efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;Settings work well.&lt;br /&gt;Priced well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Very heavy.&lt;br /&gt;Very loud.&lt;br /&gt;Not at all ergonomic; extremely clumsy to hold and unwieldy. Why can&#x27;t they design something sleeker and more convenient? Tends to topple when you place it at the edge of the sink.</li>
            <li> I am happy to receive this dryer so quickly since my old one died. No Hair emergency here. Haven&#x27;t you the attachments yet. I will update if the four stars change to a 1.</li>
            <li> I have 2 other blow dryers, and I will be selling them.  This dryer is without a doubt the best I have ever had. It is really awesome this is why I gave it a 5. I would indeed tell others that this is the dryer to own.</li>
            <li> This is a great blow dryer, especially for the price.  It does dry my hair much faster than other blow dyers!  And leaves it feeling softer and smoother than other blow dryers that have left my hair frizzy.  I also really like the nozzles that come with the dyer.  I am giving his dryer a 4 our of 5 because it is not what I would consider quiet or lightweight, both of which are highlighted as key features on the box.  It&#x27;s not unbearably loud or heavy, but it I do not think it lives up to those expectations.  Overall a great dryer and I would definitely recommend this dryer to anyone that wants their hair to dry faster and be silkier than with other dyers.</li>
            <li> Not suitable for home use.  Too heavy and switches are small.  Though it is durable.</li>
            <li> I hope that Amazon fixed their search suggestions after I had to return this one with the related comments.&lt;br /&gt;My wife loved it and has a similar but older model drier that still works ( for 5 years, I think).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I was looking for 220 Volt drier and had to return this one in the end</li>
            <li> My daughter says this dryer is amazing! She loves it. Her only complaint is that the comb attachment seems to be flimsy and is afraid that the teeth will break off. Other than that she loves it very much and is very glad she got it.</li>
            <li> Quick dry time, bouncy, beautiful hair</li>
            <li> This is the first hair dryer I have ever owned that did not leave my hair smelling like smoke.  I am a black woman with natural hair (absolutely no chemicals nor weave) and my hair is more susceptible to dryness and breakage.  Therefore, it is extremely important for me to be extra sensitive and mindful to the type of products I use on my hair. This dryer did not pull my hair out, no burnt smell and I didn&#x27;t mind the sound quality, afterall it is a hair dryer not a fan. The only negative I have is that the buttons can easily be depressed while blow drying your hair.  So you may have to double check a few times as I did to make certain you are using the right temperature on your hair.  Here is a tip I learned, when planning on using hot curlers, flat irons etc. please cool your hair down first (the cool shot button truly does help)and use a non-buildup non-oily heat treatment.  The more natural and/or organic the better. Wait at least 10 minutes or longer before proceeding to styling. Heat from the dryer with immediate usage of other heat sources can cause stress and unnecessary damage (or more damage) to your scalp and hair. Also, when using the pik, if you come in contact with a tangle, PLEASE do not force the pik thru.  You will tear your hair apart.  Use your fingers or a detangler comb to separate the tangle, then proceed in continuing drying.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.  Long cord and great power drying. Drys fast and styles with attachments that came with it. Hair looks great after.</li>
            <li> LOOOOVE this dryer.  It does not cost a fortune, yet works like it cost a fortune.  Great buy, easy on the hair.</li>
            <li> este secador es pequeño liviano muy ligero es bueno. ojo no es par mi, es para mi esposa y a ella le gusto mucho y mas le gusto porque fue un regalo de mi parte...  comprenlo con los hojos serrados</li>
            <li> I used an Andis hairdryer at a hotel and loved it.  Unfortunately, the model I used is no longer available, so I ordered this one.  The design is poor.  The switches for power/speed and air temp are directly on the handle (not recessed), so that I&#x27;m constantly inadvertently switching the unit off, or changing the air temp.  Annoying!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer I have ever owned.[[ASIN:B00092M2VO Andis 82005 1875 Watt Professional Ceramic Ionic Hair Dryer, Black Chrome]]</li>
            <li> This dryer is the best. I guess i&#x27;ve been stupid over many years, and not really was picky about dryers.  This one is awesome.  It dries fast and beautifully. My hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I have now owned this hair dryer for about 2 years.  It is very good. I had a professional hair dryer which died and I couldn&#x27;t find the same one to replace it. Every hair dryer out there says &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; but most are practically disposable, they are so cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a sturdy, hot dryer. The cord is long and thick. It is heavy but I think all the really good ones are. I don&#x27;t have a problem with where the switches are located, all my dryers have had the switches there. I have thick hair which can tend to take a long time to dry but not with this baby. Also, with cheaper dryers, if you turn it off after several minutes of use, you have to wait for it to cool before it will come back on. Not this one, it is powerful enough, it doesn&#x27;t overheat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again and I do recommend it. It does seem like a professional hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I wanted the best hair dryer and got it!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer has a very sleek design and has a lot of power. I love the nozzle attachments included with it and its long cord. However, I find this very hard to use because of the location of the power and heat switches. Since the dryer is somewhat heavy, a full grasp is required to use it. This placement and the required handling means I am constantly turning it off or switching heat settings mid use. It can be quite frustrating.</li>
            <li> The hand grip gets too hot to hold after about 2 minutes.  Not like toasty warm - HOT!    It is heavy and the buttons are located in a bad spot.  Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> The Hair Dryer it is an excelen product, it works properly, so far so good i recommend the Andis 82005.</li>
            <li> I thought this blow dryer worked great and I wish I could give it more stars. I was using it today and the power switch broke. It&#x27;s completely broken and now I have to throw the whole thing away. What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Excellent 100% (satisfecho por la compra de este producto, sobre todo lo rapido que fue la transaccion de la compra a traves de amazon)  Trank you!</li>
            <li> Not worth buying, product started overheating after using it to blow dry my very short hair - please do not waste your money! I had to finish blowing my hair with the £5 travel hair dryer I bought from Thailand four years ago!</li>
            <li> Este secador fue un regalo para mi esposa y le encanto. Cumple con las condiciones de un buen secador de cabello, potente, rápido y no daña. Lo recomiendo.</li>
            <li> Andis products are good in general but the resin comb is crap. It needs to be a hard unbreakable plastic instead because it won&#x27;t last for use in the salon. Also the picture for the product shows 3 attachments and I only received a nozzle and the resin comb.</li>
            <li> Shiny and looks good. But also works the best!!!</li>
            <li> Great power and easy to use!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I needed a dryer with a very long cord and this one fit the bill perfectly.  Light weight, powerful and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very good for my granddaughter&#x27;s thick,course,and natural  hair without putting a perm in it.</li>
            <li> The best blow dryer ever.  Used on 4a/b hair. Hair was dry and straight in just minutes using the comb attachment. I used to hate Saturday hair days, now no problem.  Use Solano flat iron with this dryer and your hair will thank you.</li>
            <li> LOVE this hair dryer. I stayed at a hotel that had an Andis dryer in it, and immediately fell in love. It&#x27;s very powerful (I use the low setting every day), and it dries my hair very quickly. I have thick, long hair, and it takes about 8 minutes.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;&#x27;s too noisy and powerful ! it does not work the way I expect . It is more appropriate for the salon.</li>
            <li> From my wife&#x27;s account of the product...&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;The buttons get in your way on the handle, the cord is long and not retractable, and there&#x27;s no &amp;#34;cool blast&amp;#34; setting.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and quality product.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend I am African American and my hair is natural. This blow dryer gets my hair straight without the extra hassle plus the comb attachment makes it super easy.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is most def. worth the price it leaves your hair feeling nice and soft not dry and brittle ! it still leaves in the moisture and leaves your hair with shine, there is nothing to complain about this blow dryer!</li>
            <li> I used to have a Keune hairdryer which I regularly use, but I wanted to switch to one with an ionic hairpick since it can help condition the hair as well. I bought the Andis here at Amazon after reading all the great reviews, and I love to pieces! Since the dryer is a bit big for my asian hands, I detached the pick and use it like a regular comb instead while drying my hair. Using this together with a round ionic brush and a regular ionic brush that I bring everywhere I go. My hair feels salon smooth now without all the frizz when I&#x27;m outdoors :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;minor cons: the other attachments that came with the dryer come off easily, so I just hammer it a bit against a hard surface while its turned off to have it fit tightly. The attachment is very hot after using it, so maybe prepare a cloth when you want to take it off or let it cool off first.</li>
            <li> Very nice dryer. Love it</li>
            <li> Does a great job drying but it is loud and heavy compared to what I&#x27;m used to. I thought my old dryer was loud and wanted something quieter this time around. Believe me when I say this is louder than most dryers! Also, I thought the nozzle on it was long so I have to hold the dryer farther away than with my older dryer. It takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> Extremely powerful so my hair dries fast, which is great. The only thing that keeps it from being 5 star is the fact that there are only two temperatures, hot and warm, and the hot is REALLY hot, so I use the cool shot button a lot. I&#x27;d prefer having a cool temp setting so I don&#x27;t have to hold the button so much.</li>
            <li> This dryer is constructed to be a first class item.  Works very well for many uses, we used it to remove vinyl letters from  our trailer.  Did a great job.</li>
            <li> The dryer work really well...the only problem is when turn on it very loud...i mean very loud..if you have a thick hair and used it in a long period.  it&#x27;s can hurt your ear.</li>
            <li> brilliant product, excellent delivery service, love the finish of the haridrier, I didn&#x27;t realised that it was American plug so I&#x27;ve purchased an adaptor from amazon and all sorted! :)</li>
            <li> WOW! I am so impressed with this dryer. I am a Caucasian woman with very long thick hair. I also have two different textures wavy and coarse in the back, fine and straight in the front. I used the comb attachment and in only 10 mind blowing minutes my hair was soft straight and dry! TEN minutes! I used to sweat it out for 25 minutes.. I do mean sweating, other dryers are so hot to use. My hair is smooth and silky with no product. So happy to have splurged on myself!</li>
            <li> Just recently gave this to my daughter for her birthday and she said so far, it is a great hair dryer.</li>
            <li> After our old dryer bit the dust, I wanted to replace it with one that worked just as well, but also quieter, lighter, and had more features.  From reading the specs and reviews on this Andis 82005 dryer, I felt this one fit the bill. But after using it for a week, I have mixed feelings. Here is why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Sleek looking (so what? Nice, but doesn&#x27;t make your hair look any nicer)&lt;br /&gt;2. Nice variety of attachments that stay attached nicely!&lt;br /&gt;3. Long 10 ft. cord (if you need that, however I don&#x27;t, and it really only gets in the way)&lt;br /&gt;4. Hang loop&lt;br /&gt;5. Dries hair fairly quickly (with Ion technology)&lt;br /&gt;6. Outside stays cool to touch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Heavier than the last two dryers we&#x27;ve had (Hot Tools Tourmaline Lite 1043 --- see my review on that one, and CHI low-EMF dryer).&lt;br /&gt;2. Dries hair no faster than the two abovementioned ionic dryers&lt;br /&gt;3. NOT quiet (in fact, louder than the two abovementioned dryers!)&lt;br /&gt;4. Not enough speed/heat settings. Not much difference in heat settings, although speed settings are adequate.&lt;br /&gt;5. Comb attachment actually hurts your scalp! Feels very scratchy, due to squared ends of the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;6. Shiny silver-colored exterior shows prints, etc. much more than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, not a bad dryer... I guess I expected more. But I would probably go with another one next time.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer! My hair is really thick after I wash it and this dryer makes my hair feel softer (because it&#x27;s an ionic dryer) and more manageable! I didnt give it 5 stars because it is a little heavy to operate and the attachment comb that it comes with is a little long for me but still works great! It was worth every penny, I wish I had heard about this sooner!</li>
            <li> December 2015 Review:&lt;br /&gt;Well, despite what I wrote earlier, this blow dryer did not last as long as I&#x27;d hoped it would. Although I liked it when it worked, the handle became extremely hot while holding it longer than a minute. And then yesterday when I turned it on, it sounded like it was going to explode. I really wanted this to last so much longer. Guess it&#x27;s going in the electronic recycling bin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sept 2015 Review: I&#x27;ve had this dryer for a year now and it&#x27;s held up amazingly! The attachment I use is still attached and works great, and has never fallen off.&lt;br /&gt;My only concern after a year is the handle gets extremely hot now and I have to set it down after a few minutes. I have thick, wavy hair so it takes a little time to dry. Also, the handle (where my thumb holds the dryer) is starting the wear and there&#x27;s a worn section. I&#x27;m still using this dryer, despite the handle getting over heated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aug 2014 Review: Great dryer, good price, good overall! Nice long cord, drys much faster than my last 2 dryers. I love all the attachments and the fact they don&#x27;t fall off when you use them. I have very wavy hair and using a large round boar brush and now much easier to straighten. Don&#x27;t rely on all the reviews of &amp;#34;too heavy&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;buttons wrong location&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;too loud&amp;#34;, etc... Purchase and use, judge for yourself. You do have 30 days to return, although I will not be returning mine.</li>
            <li> Too loud !! Not enough heat!!</li>
            <li> Ordered this after checking the great reviews to replace my 5-year old dryer that&#x27;s starting to diminish in performance. The dryer arrived promptly and as I started to use it, it seemed to dry my hair quicker than my old one. I was very happy until it just died, mid way, through my first use. It did not smell like burnt, the safety plug was OK, I disconnected and reconnected- nothing. So I went back to my old dryer to finish the job, and checked the dryer afterward, and still did not turn on. Amazon was quick about sending me a second blow dryer. I figured that with the good reviews, perhaps it was my unit that was bad...well, wrong! same thing happened. On my way to return it now, but this time asked for a refund, and will try to find a new version of my old dryer.</li>
            <li> Dries hair quickly and is light weight!  This is my first Ceramic Ionic hair dryer.  It&#x27;s surprisingly reasonably priced considering the quality.</li>
            <li> Very strong heat and durable product. I use it every day with clients and It works great! Looks good too!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this new hair dryer.  It blows her old hair dryer away.  She has been very please.  We have not issues with the product at this time.  She uses it most days.</li>
            <li> This is a great hairdryer.  I am thrilled with this purchase.  I would recommend this hairdryer to anyone.  It dries my hair very quickly.</li>
            <li> The best $40&lt;br /&gt;I ever spent♡♡♡♡</li>
            <li> The product was good. I like it</li>
            <li> I never thought that having a different type of hair dryer would make a difference.  i was totally wrong.  my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz with this and now I have to take it with me because it is wonderful.</li>
            <li> The positive reviews were true! A little heavy yes but the result after use is amazing. Hair feels wonderful!</li>
            <li> VERY LOUD!  I bought this to give to my wife to replace her old hair dryer.  This one is so noisy it sounds like she is drying her hair with a jet engine!</li>
            <li> Awesome blow dryer, and flash of cold heat, Love the way my hair feels Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is EVERYTHING!! I absolutely love it!! I am African American and have very kinky hair. This dryer gets my hair straight and then I only have to run through my hair with the flat iron one time. I also use it for my daughter. She has loose curly hair and it gets her hair silky straight. LOVE LOVE LOVE this dryer!</li>
            <li> A little heavier and louder than expected, but otherwise dries hair in half the time my old blow dryer did.</li>
            <li> bought this product for my mom for christmas, she needs a new one every year, i dont know what she does but they all end up going out. this Andis 8200 hair dryer has hung in there and it still works great. i would highly recommend it. its also very pretty in person, the color is great.</li>
            <li> I used the one much more expensive than this before but it broke and I bought this. It works really well so far and its Ionic function makes my hair smooth and soft. I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> i dont think is great dryer because it dont dry my hair the way i expected it to dry. it leave my hair freezy.</li>
            <li> An article of top quality and utility... and easy to use with quality materials for life and 100% recommended ...</li>
            <li> producto excelente me llego en buenísimas condiciones sin nada malo que agregar. Estoy fascinada y ya lo probe excelente lo recomiendo</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is lightweight, quiet (I can hear someone talking to me while I dry my hair, even on high), and works fast without frizz.  I have straight, fine hair that normally takes forever to dry and this has cut my drying time to less than 5 minutes. I love it and will get one for my niece with very thick hair, who borrowed it and loved it also.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since January.  I usually have blow dryers for years!  Loved the power and it worked well until today, April 10.  While drying my hair, and I have short hair, the handle became warm, then smoked then burned my hand.  I realize that it is not the fault of the retailer but am more than willing to send pics and the dryer and my hand.  I am also looking to contact Andis regarding this defective dryer.  Grateful it did not burn my hair!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love it. Dry my hair in 1 2 3. Se los recomiendo. Is most better than Solano,and we know that solano i good...</li>
            <li> This was a great dryer while it lasted.  I loved all the different settings because I could use it on my small dod with no problems.  It did dry hair faster.  After 2 years the electric safety plug blew and the hairdryer is bricked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just bought another cheaper Andis and see it has a 5 year warranty.  If this one had a 5 year warranty too I wish someone had said or posted something or wish I saw it if it was listed on the box if it was offered.  If you notice this ad makes no mention of warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a good but heavy dryer while it lasted.  2 lbs I think.  I liked the range in heat and speed of airflow much better than what I replaced this with.  The variety in heat and speed worked out perfect for the dog and me.  My dog preferred the low warm or hot while I preferred fast and hot.  The weight of the dryer didn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I gyp myself out of warranty on this dryer?  I sure hope not because I already threw it away  :(</li>
            <li> Fantastic blow dryer and the price was great.</li>
            <li> ultra good Dryer thanks</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer. Drys hair quickly and without allot of noise</li>
            <li> its a very attractive blow dryer. It does the trick.</li>
            <li> This blowdryer completley stopped functioning within 6 months of purchase. I have tried everything. I did love the blowdryer when it function. Not happy customer.</li>
            <li> Tried this blow dryer at a hotel, went to my iPhone and ordered it immediately. I have long, curly hair and even on the slow speed, it dries my hair fast with less frizz.</li>
            <li> Just as the other reviews said, this dryer is great- drys your hair very fast and somehow manages to eliminate static which is always a problem for me in the winter. It did not feel any heavier than other dryers I have used in the past. Great buy for the price!</li>
            <li> Very good. Pleasantly surprise</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer. I ordered it for college and it works great. It&#x27;s not only small but it also packs a big punch. It warms up quickly and gets the job done. I go home and I hate using my mother&#x27;s hairdryer because mine is so much better than her expensive, bulky one.</li>
            <li> I just got it in the mail and it&#x27;s going back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It sparked as soon as i plugged it in and turned it on&lt;br /&gt;2. The attachments don&#x27;t really snap on, you just place them on and they can easily pop off&lt;br /&gt;3. In my attempt to attach the attachment it scratched off the \\&quot;chrome\\&quot; finish which is essentially painted on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it a star because when I turned it on and placed it on the highest setting it got warm enough for my intended uses.&lt;br /&gt;(I am spanish with curly hair, I use to relax my hair a long time ago but I have stopped and gone natural, I wanted to have a dryer that would help me blow dry my hair when I want it straight)&lt;br /&gt;Also it comes with three attachments: a comb and two concentrators.  One concentrator is wider but shorter and the other is longer and thinner giving you an option depending on hair texture while other hair dryers only give you one and if your lucky a diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like it but sadly I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Excellent hairdryer was a gift for my wife and she loved it, the color is great and a good value!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Dries your hair in half the time. I have thick wavy hair and it does a great job is fixing the frizzies</li>
            <li> Dries fast and leaves my hair shiny and straight. Its a little loud, but it puts out a lot of air so I guess that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times and really like how it drys my hair. It&#x27;s quick and the attachments come in hamdy, especially the comb one. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love this dryer. I was first introduced to it when we stayed at a very upscale hotel. I wrote down the information and ordered on on Amazon when I returned home. It was a little pricey but some things are just worth it. The only down side for me is the placement of the buttons. I am right handed, andthe way I hold this dryer, allows me to  I sometimes accidently hit the off button as I am drying my hair. It is not a deal breaker, but a bit annoying. Nice wattage and fast drying. I would purchase it again, although maybe their newer models have the button relocated. Price of the item was reasonable as was the shipping cost. I would recommend the product and the seller.</li>
            <li> Purchased this years ago and I am still using it till this day!</li>
            <li> i bought this for a christmas present and my wife love it good attacment that she use all the time.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer was a great price.  I was primarily looking for something with a long cord.  It has plenty of power, isn&#x27;t overly noisy, and has the cord length to allow you to move around a bit while blow drying.</li>
            <li> Nicest blow dryer we&#x27;ve ever had!  Actually does reduce frizz and dries extremely fast.  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> For those who have said that it&#x27;s a bit heavy for them, they are correct. I do wish it was lighter. However it is not that heavy, and it dries my hair so quickly. Some people have said that the cool shot button is in a difficult place. I have not found that. I think it is very easy to use. In all,  I&#x27;m very happy with this dryer.</li>
            <li> A blow dyrer that gets the job done. I have very thick hair that requires a lot of heat. The Andis 1875 Watt provided that and what would normally take about 30 minutes only took 15.  The comb attachment is heavy duty and durable. I dropped it on the floor twice before using it and it remained intact.  I will say the dryer is on the heavy side but I didn&#x27;t care because I&#x27;d finally found a PROFESSIONAL grade, affordable, and durable hair dryer.</li>
            <li> My expectations were met</li>
            <li> I downgraded from a Chi (that burnt out after about two years) and a higher priced dryer from a beauty supply store, and I would recommend this mid-priced dryer as well as any of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not seem overly heavy to me, as other reviewers have noticed, nor have I had issues with accidentally hitting the temperature or off switches because of their placement.  It does get very, very hot on the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; setting, but the \\&quot;warm\\&quot; setting is just as good if you can&#x27;t take the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few reviewers have mentioned the extra-long cord, which is a major positive selling point for me.  All in all, I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s crazy to spend up to $150 or even $75 on a dryer when this ~$40 one works just as well if not better and has the extra long cord.</li>
            <li> Very fast and rightly hot. Makes a bit of noise and heavier than usual. But I still like it, for its looks and quality,</li>
            <li> Works amazing! Makes hair so silky and dries very quickly!</li>
            <li> I purchased this blow dryer November 5, 2013. Today is October 14, 2014. The heating element died. I have not dropped or abused this dryer. I expected at this price for it to last longer than a cheap dryer but I am disappointed. I will go back to buying the $20 Conair dryers because other than the price I don&#x27;t find a difference.</li>
            <li> I was so happy initially with this dryer, but after the straightening pick attachment broke I&#x27;ve been SOL. It doesn&#x27;t tell you, but you&#x27;re supposed to only use that attachment on low heat, low speed. For my natural African American hair I was using it on low heat high speed after parting my hair in very small sections, but it still broke. There are no replacement picks that can be purchased/used on this dryer that I have found.</li>
            <li> My wife has not owned a dryer that cost less than $200 in years.  When her primary dryer failed, this dryer was provided to her while staying at a Ritz Carlton Hotel this summer and she loved it.  Upon arriving home, we bought this model and have not looked back.</li>
            <li> Poor quality while looking very professional.  It was a waste of hard-earned and an embarrassment as a gift.  I simply can&#x27;t recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I had an Andis Hair Dryer for at least 8 years until it died on me recently.&lt;br /&gt;The replacement is wonderful; product still as reliable as it was before!</li>
            <li> Really like this hair dryer.  Does not frizz hair when drying. Can be used with or without several dryer attachments. Like all silver color.  Controls are well placed and very easy to use.  Has really long cord which helps.  A little heavy (but I&#x27;m in my sixties) but its weight not a real problem.  Hangs up easily when not in use. Highly recommend this hair dryer.  Price reflects quality, value and great find!</li>
            <li> My hair has come out fantastic every time with this. The attachments are great. The only thing is that the attachments are hard to get on...but it works. Love it and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair that I blow dry 2-3 times a week and this blow dryer is amazing. After my expensive blow dryer bit the dust, I was looking for a more affordable but just as effective replacement. I decided to give this a try and was very surprised. It delivered at half the cost and does not burn my hair. Some reviewers complained that the unit is heavy but I don&#x27;t think so - it is a hair dryer, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer was recommended by our salon.  It works well and has low and high settings which help not to dry out the hair when used often.  Its sometime kind of awkward to use because its so big so you need to have a strong hand to hold it up for a long time if you have a lot of hair.  Overall the unit is good.  My biggest problem is that the comb teeth have broken and I can&#x27;t seem to find a replacement piece for the comb attachment.  Maybe I&#x27;m missing something but I thought that would be a standard replacement item.</li>
            <li> My wife neede a hair dryer, and she got this one. This is the best one she has ever had.</li>
            <li> I saw the other reviews and thought this was the dryer for me. Well not so much. Yes it did make my hair less frizzy. But my main disappointment is that it doesn&#x27;t have enough power nor did it dry my hair quicker.</li>
            <li> This is a very good hair dryer, especially if you are less accustomed to professional dryers. If you like myself have been buying Conair or Revlon dryers since you were a teenager then you&#x27;ll appreciate a step up from those. This dries my hair quickly without an intense level of heat. Better yet much less noise and a longer cord than my previous dryers. A solid purchase.</li>
            <li> Low setting is to strong and to fast also the dryer is too heavy</li>
            <li> It still works great and I&#x27;ve had it for years!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer cuts your drying time in half! Keep in mind that it is the &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; version so it is very heavy! The motor is loud, but again these are the trade offs to gain more time while getting ready.</li>
            <li> My mom used daily, good quality, and fulfills the functions for which it is made. Very windy. I recommend this product</li>
            <li> great dryer.  a little heavy in hand as other reviews wrote but I look at it as a good bicep/tricep workout in the morning.  besides after using for a month or so I don&#x27;t feel the heaviness anymore.  Use attachments, they make drying time go faster and great results.  It does shut off from time to time due to the position of buttons but again, really a non issue.  My hair looks great and the ionic feature does not give salon results but again, not a $300 dryer either.  All in all good purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a replacement since the button on my other dryer broke off.  It works well but it does not get quite as hot as my other dryer. Also, the attachments can be a pain to get on and off.  If you are only using one attachment this is not a big deal, but I go between straight and curly hair pretty regularly so I switch the attachments a couple times per week.</li>
            <li> Nothing special here. Just mediocre hair dryer could&#x27;ve bought one at Walmart got a third of the price</li>
            <li> Its just like the picture and what was advertise ....great product</li>
            <li> This was a requested gift for my daughter for Christmas 2012. She shared her previous use of this hair dryer. Her comments included, worked great and was fast without overdrying her long hair.</li>
            <li> i bought the &amp;#34;used&amp;#34;/open box item - no idea what was wrong with it - it looked like i got it off of the store shelf.</li>
            <li> I cant believe that Hair dryer fast than old hair dryer ..  I love it.  I still use hair dryer and fast dry my hair 10 mins.</li>
            <li> I ordered this dryer for my sister and she loved it, it was exactly as the page and picture described</li>
            <li> very cheap product, typical made in china product with a very bad quality. the color start to wears out after a few days</li>
            <li> When I first reviewed this product in the winter of 2013 I was lukewarm about it.  After a year-plus of use, I need to amend that review and state that this is the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  The high speed setting is perfect for blow drying my short hair, and the ionic characteristic makes hair soft.  Thanks, And is.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer! Dries my hair fast!</li>
            <li> Awesome does the job like a professional</li>
            <li> excellent product it has nine month working without problems, i recommend it</li>
            <li> The dryer, which has a lot of power, does not seem to ever get hot.  I prefer my blow dryers to be able to blow very hot air rather than just luke warm.</li>
            <li> The thing that pushed me over the edge to buy this specific hairdryer was the claims that it dries hair faster...even the product reviews claimed as much.  I did not see a difference in dry time though.  I have a lot of thick hair and it seemed to take just as long.  Yes, as mentioned, the power and heat control buttons are awkwardly placed on the handle.  But the cord is super crazy long.  It&#x27;s fine...but honestly I don&#x27;t think it works any better than a $20 or $30 dryer would.</li>
            <li> Works great only complaint is that when using the attachment it doesn&#x27;t always stay on when trying to change the diretion.</li>
            <li> excelente muy buena calidad es preciosa a mi hija le gusto mucho y soy de venezuela y todo fue rapido</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavier than I thought and louder. But it works great. Happy with the product.  Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a professional hair stylist and this was given to her as a gift. She said it is the best blow dryer she has used and people often ask where did she get them.</li>
            <li> I was using a cheaper hair dryer but I purchased this product I was surprised that makes my hair not so fly away.</li>
            <li> Just what my husband wanted. When mine bites the dust I will replace it with the same kind</li>
            <li> Works great, a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer cuts my dry time down by ALOT!&lt;br /&gt;I have very course 4a hair type so it takes a while to dry usually but after purchasing this Andis, I&#x27;ve found a solution.&lt;br /&gt;The cons are that this dryer is heavy!! (or so it feel like it weights more than a typical dryer)</li>
            <li> I like the safety feature...not extremely loud...good attachments</li>
            <li> Disappointed that 2 years have gone by and it died.  Seems to be the life of these hair dryers as this one was my 2nd.  Not sure that I am buying a 3rd as I don&#x27;t feel like buying a new hair dryer every 2 years.</li>
            <li> Take a while to warm up.  well built but the fan speed is too fast for thin hair.</li>
            <li> Still functioning without any problem</li>
            <li> Great quality works great.</li>
            <li> Nice looking blow Dryer but liked my Revlon dryer better.  Not only was it much much cheaper but it would leave my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Attachments won&#x27;t stay on well. I had to tape it on. :(</li>
            <li> i have to say i was a never a hair/ blowdryer person, but i see a huge difference using this. my hair holds better is shinier, and less damaged looking.</li>
            <li> excelente producto llego en el tiempo previsto recomiendo a la tienda</li>
            <li> Usually I buy Conair hair dryers but chose the Andis and it is more powerfull than the Conair even though they are 1875 Watt.  I have not used the attachments because I have short, straight, thick hair that I blow dry and it just falls into place requiring little brushing.  I do believe it is just a bit heavier than the Conair dryer but not so much that causes me a problem.  I am so glad I chose the Andis instead of another Conair.  It was packaged very well and arrived two days after I placed my order.  I would be glad to recommend this Andis 82005 to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer looked awesome when I took it out of the box...unfortunately, it went from loud, to louder, to ear-piercing in a matter of minutes and there was also a strange, high-pitched rattling noise...almost like part of the coil was bouncing off the side. In any case it did NOT work out. I&#x27;d purchased it for my mother-in-law for Christmas and had to scramble to find another in time when this one turned out to be busted. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Excelent product good quality, the shipping excelent, and the description is really like the publication, i am happy with my order and everything is excelent</li>
            <li> Works great! Straighten out my hair just fine. The comb is the best part, runs through my hair just fine.</li>
            <li> excelente todo me llego en tiempo y condiciones esperadas extraordinario servicio sigan asi honestidad, responsabilidad y buen servicio lo mejor de lo mejor</li>
            <li> I purchased this hairdryer because it&#x27;s the one my beautician uses !I LOVED how fast it was to blowdry my hair !!I got the travel one too !! LOVE IT LOVE !! FAST SHIPPING TOO !! THANK YOU !!</li>
            <li> My dream hair dryer....great product.  This hair dryer dries my hair quickly and gives me the smoothness that I want.  I enjoy using this hair dryer because it gets the job done in less time.  My hair is thick and it takes forever to dry but not with the Andis 82005 Professional 1875 Watt Ceramic Ionic Hair Dryer!!</li>
            <li> Great long cord and dries my thick hair faster than my old hair dryer.</li>
