            <li>The serum works well - like most if these serums tend to.</li>

            <li>... i absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought the 2-pack</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for natural hair!!!</li>
            <li>I tried this product at home and liked it right away!</li>
            <li>But the product itself is pretty good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for a very long time, and it works great!</li>
            <li>You absolutely must use this product in your hair, it smells great and makes your hair so smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>I have found a wonderful leave in conditioner to use now along side of this product which has really helped with the dryness, but I would not recommend this particular product to anyone.</li>
            <li>It just doesnt make my hair look shiny and feel soft, the smell is also great. 😍</li>
            <li>It smells great; my hair is manageable, soft, and shiny after using it.</li>
            <li>now looks full and healthy and her curls look really cute now.</li>
            <li>I loved the product so much</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair super soft and smooth and smells amazing!!</li>
            <li>I first tried this product as a sample at the mall and fell in love with it!  </li>
            <li>Love this product, makes my hair super soft and not greasy, and smells great too.  </li>
            <li>The smell is so good, and leaves my hair nice, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that is made in China, I got this as a sample on a mall and</li>
            <li>I would strongly suggest if you want a straightnier or anything else for that matter DO NOT BUY from Herstyler.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair soft and smelling really good.</li>
            <li>Not too greasy, leaves my hair feeling soft and silky with a nice shine!</li>
            <li>, i use it daily.. and smells beautifully..</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it is tangled after drying.  </li>
            <li>she has fine hair</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect for it too come so quickly!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made this money 1000s of dollars and this is the way they repay their loyal customers!</li>
            <li>Its such a great product.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair smooth, shiny and with a &amp;#34;just from the salon&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>so when I did my research and found out how cheap it was on amazon</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it smelled that great, but I&#x27;m the only one.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and smells wonderful not too heavy.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair feel soft, takes away the fizziness and it smells good as well.  </li>
            <li>Makes our hair so shinny soft and smells so good.</li>
            <li>Great for an oil treatment and flat ironing.</li>
            <li>I guess the original formula is no longer available.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I still prefer the original version.  </li>
            <li>This potion is worth the money!</li>
            <li>Smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>When I originally purchased HerStyler Hair Serum/Vitamin E, I thought it included Argan Oil as an ingredient, but it does not, thus my 4 star rating instead of 5.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it for anyone with colored, dry, frizzy or fly away hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair so soft and smooth and silky!!</li>
            <li>Plus, the price was right!</li>
            <li>I really really like this product and love teh smell as always........</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several comments on how good my hair smells.  </li>
            <li>Very affordable, extremely good smelling, light, and decently natural...</li>
            <li>Makes my hair less frizzy, adds a beautiful shine, and softness.</li>
            <li>I love how shiny this makes my hair, but at the same time I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>more msnageable.would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Overall, very satisfied.</li>
            <li>so happy to be able to purchase it through amazon prime rather than pay the ridiculous amounts they charge at the kiosks.</li>
            <li>awesome price, product works really well, apply small amounts to tips before styling.</li>
            <li>It combs out easily and feels very silky.  </li>
            <li>Now to be fair, I do have very fine, but thick hair.  </li>
            <li>So I looked at me fav website AMAZON and found it there for so much cheaper!!</li>
            <li>I have med to fine straight hair</li>
            <li>Very satisfied have seen a major difference in my hair vet smooth and soft</li>
            <li>and it looked absolutely amazing hours later.</li>
            <li>and it also seemed to make my naturally curly hair drier and more frizzy.  </li>
            <li>to 3-4 months at a time it was rarely used.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much, I went back to the mall and bought some.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth buying.  </li>
            <li>This has Argon oil but has a fragrance that is fresh.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite hair serum.</li>
            <li>Im Just not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li>It smells good and leaves my hair with kinda a wet look if I use a lot.  </li>
            <li>totally worth it..</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find this product on Amazon, originally bought from a mall vendor for double this price, will never go back to the mall, will keep reordering on here</li>
            <li>Sure enough - Amazon never fails me,  Found this so much cheaper,  I just seriously love the smell, leaves my hair very soft and best used when straightening your hair or a small amount added to your hair when it is damp.</li>
            <li>Works so well for right after you shower.</li>
            <li>Need to reorder and get right item somehow</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I have never tried it on my hair when its wet but using it on dry hair works great</li>
            <li>It makes her hair super soft and smooth, and she insists on putting some in my hair all the time.</li>
            <li>HerStyler made my normally frizzy hair, feel smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>If I only use a little it is great!!</li>
            <li>My daughters are mixed and it leaves my girls hair smooth and tangle free.</li>
            <li>Like this product very much because of the smell and the shine</li>
            <li>Super nice does not weigh my hair down</li>
            <li>They worked good for the little bit of use</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s not the same one I tried</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle at a Florida Flea Market.</li>
            <li>First off</li>
            <li>Hey I ought to go back and get some more samples</li>
            <li>I first found out about this product at the Pallisades Mall, a girl curled my hair with it</li>
            <li>i first tried this at a kiosk at the mall.  </li>
            <li>Already use this product and my hair feels so much!</li>
            <li>The first time I bought this HerStyler serum was in the Mall of America.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The first tome I tried this product was when a mall worker was passing out samples.  </li>
            <li>She uses heated irons a lot and has used many different oils to protect her hair.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that would make this serum better is Aragon oil.</li>
            <li>I first tried it from a tester I got at a mall</li>
            <li>Since that first purchase,  Amazon is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and I have been back 3 more times.</li>
            <li>so i tried the samples and that was enough for me to fall in love with it.</li>
            <li>I have really dry hair because i dyed it so many times, and this product not only moisturizes it but also makes it smell lovely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone who has drier hair or uses hot irons hot curlers straight irons</li>
            <li>The iron i bought still works, its decent, but the hair dryer broke right away.  </li>
            <li>I just use it on the ends &amp; not near the top of my head.  </li>
            <li>Now that I know I can find 2 for less than the price of one on Amazon, I&#x27;m very excited!</li>
            <li>Just make sure not too use so much, maybe one pump for medium to thick hair is good enough just on the ends.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I have extremely dry hair tips and the only time I have ever been able to have my hair feeling soft and luxurious is when I use this.  </li>
            <li>Great Product and Protector - offers shine on dry hair before flat iron or curling process - use sparingly!  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve found for my crazy, kinky, Puerto Rican hair.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll get my money back in free samples at the kiosk.</li>
            <li>I felt really ripped off.</li>
            <li>I really like this product as it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily or with too much of a shine that it looks oily.</li>
            <li>My hair is very frizzy and curly</li>
            <li>Package was wrapped very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product and it really protects my hair from heat.</li>
            <li>I thought they were crazy, but I really loved what it did to my hair!!</li>
            <li>I really preferred the serum with Aloe and Vitamin E.  </li>
            <li>She absolutely loves the results and smell of this serum.</li>
            <li>Bought it and really like it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real deal</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>I have introduced it to a few friends and one of them even orders her own from Amazon now.</li>
            <li>since I loved it I decided to go for it, no regrets, even with curly not obedient hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using hair serums for years for my long, wavy, fine frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>Happy with the buy, this serum makes my hair soft and silky and convenient to apply as it can be used both on wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li>have naturally curly, long hair and it makes my hair smell great for the first little bit</li>
            <li>This was originally %75 but They gave me 75% off since I bought a flat Iron cost 200$ which I also got 25% student discount.</li>
            <li>Does not weigh hair down and smells so refreshing.</li>
            <li>This hair serum smells great and will last you at least a year.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time with no damage... Makes my hair so soft with only a small amount of product and smells great.</li>
            <li>I got a sample from the mall, inStantly fell in love,this product works.it left my hair soft and great smelling; it also made the process of untangling my wet hair way easier.</li>
            <li>I love putting it in my little girls hair.</li>
            <li>being said, I&#x27;ve been trudging the internet and beauty shops looking for something that I could put on my hair in the mornings before styling, after my shower or right before flat ironing and found something I actually really like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My dried hair never looked better.</li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair which damages easily from using curling/straightening irons and blow dryers.  </li>
            <li>It also helps control static without making my hair feel heavy or oily.  </li>
            <li>I use it every day as part of my normal routine regardless of whether or not I am styling for work or wearing it in a ponytail on the weekends.  </li>
            <li>i have dyed my hair for too many years now and it was dead before i started using this serum.</li>
            <li>Even with a new version of this product is out</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li>Cant live without this product.</li>
            <li>I abuse my hair with color and highlights and I live in New Mexico.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I live in NM</li>
            <li>I love this product it last a long time and also helps with frizzy damaged hair!!!</li>
            <li>I accidentally ordered this instead of the argan oil and figured it would be about the same but the argan oil is much better this product may work for other people</li>
            <li>I recently went to a salon and lighten my hair so my hair got pretty damaged on my ends</li>
            <li>Wow what a Godsend!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve decided to wait and my usual instinct is to look  up reviews of the product and find a better deal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that it makes my hands soft, too!</li>
            <li>This Serum is such a deal,  I first tried  it at my Mall near by.</li>
            <li>for very fine straight hair, it can be a little heavy if used too much.  </li>
            <li>but luckily the other one i still have</li>
            <li>This serum leave sky hair so manageable and ultra soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is sooooo soft</li>
            <li>So I talked to the kiosk, and called the company directly.</li>
            <li>Makes hair feel soft and get rid of frizz.</li>
            <li>Seems to work well and keeps my hair soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Makes my hair soft and manageable - check.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my hair is shiny, silky, soft.  </li>
            <li>i used to have to go to a kiosk at the mall which was really out of my way (different city) and it was like 25 bucks for an oil</li>
            <li>recommend if you want your hair restored to baby soft feeling..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this &amp; it does make my hair SOFT.  </li>
            <li>My hair comes out soft, and not &amp;#34;Oily&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling Soft and Silky.</li>
            <li>Like the product however one of the bottles had spilled so it was half way full.</li>
            <li>two weeks later my hair was as soft as never !!</li>
            <li>The product itself was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>The serum leaked a little while being shipped and was kind of messy.</li>
            <li>I do have to put other stuff in my hair to smooth it out, as my hair can get frizzy after I shampoo and dry it.</li>
            <li>also cuts down on straightening time by more than half.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other products in the past and this one had helped me the most so far.</li>
            <li>I little goes a long way and it makes my hair smooth, shinny, and it blows in the wind.</li>
            <li>So today I used the bottle and lets put it this way, I could barely put my fingers through my hair while I was blow drying it.  </li>
            <li>The consistency was no where near the same again.  </li>
            <li>Shipping fast as expected.</li>
            <li>lasts a long time, a little goes a long way,  Will definitely be ordering some more once I run out:D</li>
            <li>I use  serums before I blow dry it as straight as I can before flat ironing it.  </li>
            <li>I style my hair with a flat iron or curling iron, and this has really helped improve the overall health of my hair, and my hair has never been so long!</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this product like a year ago with my flat iron and really liked it &amp;#34;then.&amp;#34; Came it across it randomly here on Amazon and thought, &amp;#</li>
            <li>I recommended it to all of my friends and highly recommend it to anyone else that has problems with extreme split ends.</li>
            <li>It makes my dry hair soft and shiny, I use it instead of conditioner.</li>
            <li>When I put it in for curly styles, I just comb some through with my fingers on damp hair, let it air dry, and it curbs the frizz completely without being crunchy.  </li>
            <li>I use a small amount everyday, and about ten pumps of it at night twice a week to help my hair stay healthy.</li>
            <li>Especially if you live in a dry climate and your hair is always dry.  </li>

            <li> The serum works well - like most if these serums tend to.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought the 2-pack</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for natural hair!!!</li>
            <li> I tried this product at home and liked it right away!</li>
            <li> But the product itself is pretty good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for a very long time, and it works great!</li>
            <li> You absolutely must use this product in your hair, it smells great and makes your hair so smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> I have found a wonderful leave in conditioner to use now along side of this product which has really helped with the dryness, but I would not recommend this particular product to anyone.</li>
            <li> It just doesnt make my hair look shiny and feel soft, the smell is also great. 😍</li>
            <li> It smells great; my hair is manageable, soft, and shiny after using it.</li>
            <li> now looks full and healthy and her curls look really cute now.</li>
            <li> I loved the product so much</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair super soft and smooth and smells amazing!!</li>
            <li> I first tried this product as a sample at the mall and fell in love with it!  </li>
            <li> Love this product, makes my hair super soft and not greasy, and smells great too.  </li>
            <li> The smell is so good, and leaves my hair nice, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that is made in China, I got this as a sample on a mall and</li>
            <li> I would strongly suggest if you want a straightnier or anything else for that matter DO NOT BUY from Herstyler.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair soft and smelling really good.</li>
            <li> Not too greasy, leaves my hair feeling soft and silky with a nice shine!</li>
            <li> , i use it daily.. and smells beautifully..</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it is tangled after drying.  </li>
            <li> she has fine hair</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect for it too come so quickly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made this money 1000s of dollars and this is the way they repay their loyal customers!</li>
            <li> Its such a great product.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair smooth, shiny and with a &amp;#34;just from the salon&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> so when I did my research and found out how cheap it was on amazon</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it smelled that great, but I&#x27;m the only one.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is light and smells wonderful not too heavy.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair feel soft, takes away the fizziness and it smells good as well.  </li>
            <li> Makes our hair so shinny soft and smells so good.</li>
            <li> Great for an oil treatment and flat ironing.</li>
            <li> I guess the original formula is no longer available.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I still prefer the original version.  </li>
            <li> This potion is worth the money!</li>
            <li> Smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> When I originally purchased HerStyler Hair Serum/Vitamin E, I thought it included Argan Oil as an ingredient, but it does not, thus my 4 star rating instead of 5.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it for anyone with colored, dry, frizzy or fly away hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair so soft and smooth and silky!!</li>
            <li> Plus, the price was right!</li>
            <li> I really really like this product and love teh smell as always........</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several comments on how good my hair smells.  </li>
            <li> Very affordable, extremely good smelling, light, and decently natural...</li>
            <li> Makes my hair less frizzy, adds a beautiful shine, and softness.</li>
            <li> I love how shiny this makes my hair, but at the same time I love the smell.  </li>
            <li> more msnageable.would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Overall, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> so happy to be able to purchase it through amazon prime rather than pay the ridiculous amounts they charge at the kiosks.</li>
            <li> awesome price, product works really well, apply small amounts to tips before styling.</li>
            <li> It combs out easily and feels very silky.  </li>
            <li> Now to be fair, I do have very fine, but thick hair.  </li>
            <li> So I looked at me fav website AMAZON and found it there for so much cheaper!!</li>
            <li> I have med to fine straight hair</li>
            <li> Very satisfied have seen a major difference in my hair vet smooth and soft</li>
            <li> and it looked absolutely amazing hours later.</li>
            <li> and it also seemed to make my naturally curly hair drier and more frizzy.  </li>
            <li> to 3-4 months at a time it was rarely used.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much, I went back to the mall and bought some.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth buying.  </li>
            <li> This has Argon oil but has a fragrance that is fresh.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite hair serum.</li>
            <li> Im Just not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li> It smells good and leaves my hair with kinda a wet look if I use a lot.  </li>
            <li> totally worth it..</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this product on Amazon, originally bought from a mall vendor for double this price, will never go back to the mall, will keep reordering on here</li>
            <li> Sure enough - Amazon never fails me,  Found this so much cheaper,  I just seriously love the smell, leaves my hair very soft and best used when straightening your hair or a small amount added to your hair when it is damp.</li>
            <li> Works so well for right after you shower.</li>
            <li> Need to reorder and get right item somehow</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I have never tried it on my hair when its wet but using it on dry hair works great</li>
            <li> It makes her hair super soft and smooth, and she insists on putting some in my hair all the time.</li>
            <li> HerStyler made my normally frizzy hair, feel smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> If I only use a little it is great!!</li>
            <li> My daughters are mixed and it leaves my girls hair smooth and tangle free.</li>
            <li> Like this product very much because of the smell and the shine</li>
            <li> Super nice does not weigh my hair down</li>
            <li> They worked good for the little bit of use</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s not the same one I tried</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle at a Florida Flea Market.</li>
            <li> First off</li>
            <li> Hey I ought to go back and get some more samples</li>
            <li> I first found out about this product at the Pallisades Mall, a girl curled my hair with it</li>
            <li> i first tried this at a kiosk at the mall.  </li>
            <li> Already use this product and my hair feels so much!</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this HerStyler serum was in the Mall of America.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The first tome I tried this product was when a mall worker was passing out samples.  </li>
            <li> She uses heated irons a lot and has used many different oils to protect her hair.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that would make this serum better is Aragon oil.</li>
            <li> I first tried it from a tester I got at a mall</li>
            <li> Since that first purchase,  Amazon is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and I have been back 3 more times.</li>
            <li> so i tried the samples and that was enough for me to fall in love with it.</li>
            <li> I have really dry hair because i dyed it so many times, and this product not only moisturizes it but also makes it smell lovely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone who has drier hair or uses hot irons hot curlers straight irons</li>
            <li> The iron i bought still works, its decent, but the hair dryer broke right away.  </li>
            <li> I just use it on the ends &amp; not near the top of my head.  </li>
            <li> Now that I know I can find 2 for less than the price of one on Amazon, I&#x27;m very excited!</li>
            <li> Just make sure not too use so much, maybe one pump for medium to thick hair is good enough just on the ends.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have extremely dry hair tips and the only time I have ever been able to have my hair feeling soft and luxurious is when I use this.  </li>
            <li> Great Product and Protector - offers shine on dry hair before flat iron or curling process - use sparingly!  </li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve found for my crazy, kinky, Puerto Rican hair.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll get my money back in free samples at the kiosk.</li>
            <li> I felt really ripped off.</li>
            <li> I really like this product as it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily or with too much of a shine that it looks oily.</li>
            <li> My hair is very frizzy and curly</li>
            <li> Package was wrapped very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product and it really protects my hair from heat.</li>
            <li> I thought they were crazy, but I really loved what it did to my hair!!</li>
            <li> I really preferred the serum with Aloe and Vitamin E.  </li>
            <li> She absolutely loves the results and smell of this serum.</li>
            <li> Bought it and really like it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> I have introduced it to a few friends and one of them even orders her own from Amazon now.</li>
            <li> since I loved it I decided to go for it, no regrets, even with curly not obedient hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using hair serums for years for my long, wavy, fine frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Happy with the buy, this serum makes my hair soft and silky and convenient to apply as it can be used both on wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> have naturally curly, long hair and it makes my hair smell great for the first little bit</li>
            <li> This was originally %75 but They gave me 75% off since I bought a flat Iron cost 200$ which I also got 25% student discount.</li>
            <li> Does not weigh hair down and smells so refreshing.</li>
            <li> This hair serum smells great and will last you at least a year.  </li>
            <li> Arrived on time with no damage... Makes my hair so soft with only a small amount of product and smells great.</li>
            <li> I got a sample from the mall, inStantly fell in love,this product works.it left my hair soft and great smelling; it also made the process of untangling my wet hair way easier.</li>
            <li> I love putting it in my little girls hair.</li>
            <li> being said, I&#x27;ve been trudging the internet and beauty shops looking for something that I could put on my hair in the mornings before styling, after my shower or right before flat ironing and found something I actually really like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dried hair never looked better.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair which damages easily from using curling/straightening irons and blow dryers.  </li>
            <li> It also helps control static without making my hair feel heavy or oily.  </li>
            <li> I use it every day as part of my normal routine regardless of whether or not I am styling for work or wearing it in a ponytail on the weekends.  </li>
            <li> i have dyed my hair for too many years now and it was dead before i started using this serum.</li>
            <li> Even with a new version of this product is out</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li> Cant live without this product.</li>
            <li> I abuse my hair with color and highlights and I live in New Mexico.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I live in NM</li>
            <li> I love this product it last a long time and also helps with frizzy damaged hair!!!</li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered this instead of the argan oil and figured it would be about the same but the argan oil is much better this product may work for other people</li>
            <li> I recently went to a salon and lighten my hair so my hair got pretty damaged on my ends</li>
            <li> Wow what a Godsend!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided to wait and my usual instinct is to look  up reviews of the product and find a better deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that it makes my hands soft, too!</li>
            <li> This Serum is such a deal,  I first tried  it at my Mall near by.</li>
            <li> for very fine straight hair, it can be a little heavy if used too much.  </li>
            <li> but luckily the other one i still have</li>
            <li> This serum leave sky hair so manageable and ultra soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is sooooo soft</li>
            <li> So I talked to the kiosk, and called the company directly.</li>
            <li> Makes hair feel soft and get rid of frizz.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well and keeps my hair soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Makes my hair soft and manageable - check.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my hair is shiny, silky, soft.  </li>
            <li> i used to have to go to a kiosk at the mall which was really out of my way (different city) and it was like 25 bucks for an oil</li>
            <li> recommend if you want your hair restored to baby soft feeling..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this &amp; it does make my hair SOFT.  </li>
            <li> My hair comes out soft, and not &amp;#34;Oily&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling Soft and Silky.</li>
            <li> Like the product however one of the bottles had spilled so it was half way full.</li>
            <li> two weeks later my hair was as soft as never !!</li>
            <li> The product itself was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> The serum leaked a little while being shipped and was kind of messy.</li>
            <li> I do have to put other stuff in my hair to smooth it out, as my hair can get frizzy after I shampoo and dry it.</li>
            <li> also cuts down on straightening time by more than half.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products in the past and this one had helped me the most so far.</li>
            <li> I little goes a long way and it makes my hair smooth, shinny, and it blows in the wind.</li>
            <li> So today I used the bottle and lets put it this way, I could barely put my fingers through my hair while I was blow drying it.  </li>
            <li> The consistency was no where near the same again.  </li>
            <li> Shipping fast as expected.</li>
            <li> lasts a long time, a little goes a long way,  Will definitely be ordering some more once I run out:D</li>
            <li> I use  serums before I blow dry it as straight as I can before flat ironing it.  </li>
            <li> I style my hair with a flat iron or curling iron, and this has really helped improve the overall health of my hair, and my hair has never been so long!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product like a year ago with my flat iron and really liked it &amp;#34;then.&amp;#34; Came it across it randomly here on Amazon and thought, &amp;#</li>
            <li> I recommended it to all of my friends and highly recommend it to anyone else that has problems with extreme split ends.</li>
            <li> It makes my dry hair soft and shiny, I use it instead of conditioner.</li>
            <li> When I put it in for curly styles, I just comb some through with my fingers on damp hair, let it air dry, and it curbs the frizz completely without being crunchy.  </li>
            <li> I use a small amount everyday, and about ten pumps of it at night twice a week to help my hair stay healthy.</li>
            <li> Especially if you live in a dry climate and your hair is always dry.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what you would get at the kiosk at your local mall, only those guys con you into purchasing one bottle for around $30, when you can log into Amazon and buy 2 of them for less than half their cost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this almost everyday since getting it and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My hair has improved with this product, it&#x27;s so much smoother and no more split ends.</li>
            <li> I found out about this when i purchased a herstyler Flat Iron at the mall.</li>
            <li> flat iron your hair.  </li>
            <li> then I flat iron my hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy or weigh it down and it completely washes out.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts such a long time because you only need a very little bit, you rub 1 or 2 drops in your hands and then gently evenly distribute the product and brush it through, every one that tries it, loves it.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling greasy everytime, My hair is quite dry</li>
            <li> I blow dry and straighten daily, so my hilited/colored hair gets abused.</li>
            <li> but she naturally has tight curls kinda like a perm</li>
            <li> My daughter loves to use a little to tame her fly-a-ways and right before straightening.</li>
            <li> When dry I flat iron it</li>
            <li> I have wavy/curly long brown hair.  </li>
            <li> Will be buying this for a long time.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair sooo soft with just a few drops.</li>
            <li> Because my hair is so fine, other products I have used in the past seem to weigh it down and leave it less shiny.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fuzzy and dry</li>
            <li> so she has an afro, her hair would often look dry and her hair was falling out her hair</li>
            <li> I put about a teaspoon on my long wet hair after I washed it.  </li>
            <li> I left it laying down on my vanity one day and came back home to half a bottle of serum on all of my stuff</li>
            <li> and I still ave half of a bottle left!</li>
            <li> Sadly, i bought this exact same hair product at the mall for about $40 #_#</li>
            <li> I was visiting the Mall of America once and this man tried to sell me this product, but it was super expensive.</li>
            <li> but it makes my hair very dry and fuzzy</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very dry here.  </li>
            <li> I apply a little twice a day when I straighten my hair and instantly my hair is shiny, not greasy.</li>
            <li> and we all know there is not much in a sample pack.  </li>
            <li> Just a few drops, rub in your hand, apply to the ends and it refreshes the moisture back in your hair.  </li>
            <li> I straighten my hair everyday and this doesn&#x27;t make it feel gross and greasy</li>
            <li> Not very fond of the smell</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> It also is no where near as thick.  </li>
            <li> I use a flat iron everyday</li>
            <li> I have thick mixed hair and use a flat iron a lot!!</li>
            <li> Use it everyday on my wet hair and again before I flat iron my hair!!</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit of HerStyler in the palm goes a long way, so start off sparingly and adjust up from there.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it works the same way,</li>
            <li> Also, it does not make my hair oily, which a lot of other hair products do.</li>
            <li> Our hair lacked lustre due to coloring and heat appliance overuse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products in the past and this is the only one that works with my hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day and it doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy like other products.</li>
            <li> I gave my other bottle to my mom</li>
            <li> It works wonders, and a little bit goes a VERY long way.</li>
            <li> You can also apply it to dry hair to help tame frizz</li>
            <li> and you just need a little bit not a whole lot to put in your hair.</li>
            <li> and you only need a small amount - just a few pumps.</li>
            <li> Smell is irritating, but made my hair soft n shiny.i would recommend it to my frens.</li>
            <li> It makes my thick coarse wavy hair behave</li>
            <li> I want to say he watered them down and try and buy a bottle off of here.  </li>
            <li> It smooths out my frizzies, but does not weight it down.  </li>
            <li> I talked them down because I had to have it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and keeps the frizz down.</li>
            <li> I have found that either they do not work or weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> Why else would someone buy a warrnity other then have your product covered when it broke!</li>
            <li> I have gold highlights in my black hair</li>
            <li> so I can use less product and get less of that greesy look when styling.</li>
            <li> Two bottles for half the price of what they try and sell them for at the mall.</li>
            <li> I apply a small amount to my wet hair before blow drying.</li>
            <li> But at least now with this product it won&#x27;t feel so dry on my ends.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this product while visiting in Little Rock AK.  </li>
            <li> He gave me a little sample though.</li>
            <li> I use it, but I have to be very careful to use a really small amount.</li>
            <li> Keeps the frizz down!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and it doesnt compare!!</li>
            <li> but it goes away after a few minutes .</li>
            <li> Does not make your hair stiff and puts a little shine in your hair.</li>
            <li> Adds shine to my previously weathered hair!</li>
            <li> Use this to help straighten the mess that is my hair!</li>
            <li> This stuff is extremely expensive, generally.</li>
            <li> like I have in the past.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it stacks up in humid weather yet though.  </li>
            <li> I used it in the hotel when I realized I had forgotten the product I usually use before straightening my hair.  </li>
            <li> I ran out of what I usually use and tried the sample.</li>
            <li> Have used this in the past, it absorbs well and does not leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> it was put through, nothing to hard</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick and wavy hair</li>
            <li> I put a very small amount in my palm and rub on the ends of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Ladies who are thinking of purchasing this for your extensions you will not be disappointed a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad product by any means and I will continue to use it as a back up</li>
            <li> The only thing I was disappointed with was packaging for shipping.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, somewhat frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> So I found it much less expensive here!</li>
            <li> hate having to count down my words for something you asked me for</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it as I hate to waste.  </li>
            <li> got wrong item, had to return.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.  </li>
            <li> But seriously Buy it here!!</li>
            <li> The reason I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars is because the packaging stinks.</li>
            <li> and it was really expensive!</li>
            <li> Smells bad and didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li> However,  They were just trying to rip me off so bad -by</li>
            <li> the day it arrived i opened and apply some and somehow dropped it breaking it and wasting all of oil inside :(</li>
            <li> and of course it&#x27;s $7.00, so I felt like an idiot.  </li>
            <li> All I know is what is in this bottle is nothing but crap.  </li>
            <li> This company is CRAP!</li>
            <li> But I hate the smell of Argon oil!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> my daughter and I love it....and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> I was gonna buy at the mall but by Amazon as always is ship and I really love the product !!!</li>
            <li> Different than the one I tried at the mall, this product has a different smell as well as it made in Hong Kong instead of Japan.  Not sure if it works the same way, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s not the same one I tried</li>
            <li> Loved HerStyler Hair Serum &amp; it smells so GOOD.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!! This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve found for my crazy, kinky, Puerto Rican hair. It tames the &#x27;fro, makes it feel like it isn&#x27;t sandpaper strapped to my head and still keeps some of the curls. I wish I had bought it through Amazon instead of at the mall. I totally overpaid but I&#x27;ll get my money back in free samples at the kiosk.</li>
            <li> I got a sample from the mall, inStantly fell in love,this product works.it left my hair soft and great smelling; it also made the process of untangling my wet hair way easier.Ladies who are thinking of purchasing this for your extensions you will not be disappointed a little goes a long way. This item is awesome.</li>
            <li> I love this serum. I found out about this when i purchased a herstyler Flat Iron at the mall. This was originally %75 but They gave me 75% off since I bought a flat Iron cost 200$ which I also got 25% student discount. I loved the product so much so I decided to buy more and amazon gave it to me for a really good price. I also bought a herstyler curling wand. Im inlove with herstyler now especially to their serum. It just doesnt make my hair look shiny and feel soft, the smell is also great. 😍</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! It&#x27;s great for natural hair!!!</li>
            <li> This serum leave sky hair so manageable and ultra soft. It&#x27;s lasted me a couple of years and I still ave half of a bottle left! Can&#x27;t wait to to purchase more!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what you would get at the kiosk at your local mall, only those guys con you into purchasing one bottle for around $30, when you can log into Amazon and buy 2 of them for less than half their cost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for a very long time, and it works great! Not too greasy, leaves my hair feeling soft and silky with a nice shine! Plus, it smells great! People have asked me what perfume I was wearing, and it turned out to be the hair serum fragrance! lol</li>
            <li> Love this !! And the price is great!  At the mall it&#x27;s over priced like 30 for one!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It is inexpensive and works just as well as the more expensive hair serums. It makes my dry hair soft and shiny, I use it instead of conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product line for years now. I tried the AO line and I love it! The fragrance is light and smells wonderful not too heavy. Great for skipping a wash after a blow out.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the results. I only use one or two drops because my hair is short, this product leave my hair shiny. I will recommended.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect for it too come so quickly! I only had to wait about 2 days.  I love the smell of it as well. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> The smell is so good, and leaves my hair nice, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that is made in China, I got this as a sample on a mall and since I loved it I decided to go for it, no regrets, even with curly not obedient hair</li>
            <li> Product is most definitely authentic. Was shipped and arrived on the estimated time. I&#x27;m most definitely satisfied as a customer.</li>
            <li> Very gooood!!!!!!! 60ml + 60ml</li>
            <li> Its such a great product. It works on hair really good. This is the best product I&#x27;ve had. It just works.</li>
            <li> Bought it at the swap meet for $5 and its the same</li>
            <li> The best hair serum!!</li>
            <li> awesome price, product works really well, apply small amounts to tips before styling.</li>
            <li> I love these products, my hair feels amazing</li>
            <li> So great for the ends of my hair. My hair is sooooo soft</li>
            <li> Makes your hair look and feel great.</li>
            <li> I love this item because it makes my hair silky and you just need a little bit not a whole lot to put in your hair. This last you for almost 2 or 3 months.</li>
            <li> I love this Hair Serum! It smells wonderful and makes my hair look amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I tried some from the mall and it seemed very nice but for very fine straight hair, it can be a little heavy if used too much.  However, after swimming, it does add some moisture back to my hair and protects it from drying out.</li>
            <li> The value of this product is good, but I am just not crazy about it.  I found the scent to be a bit off and it also seemed to make my naturally curly hair drier and more frizzy.  I will continue to use it as I hate to waste.  I have found a wonderful leave in conditioner to use now along side of this product which has really helped with the dryness, but I would not recommend this particular product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Exceeded expectations!!!!!  In seventy two years I&#x27;ve not found a conditioner that worked on my &amp;#34;fly away&amp;#34; hair,  until now !!!!!</li>
            <li> Even if you put too much it never feels oily and it goes great when you use it with heat tools. I recommend!</li>
            <li> I first tried this product as a sample at the mall and fell in love with it!  Leaves hair smooth, shiny and with a &amp;#34;just from the salon&amp;#34; look.  And smells great too!!  Just a little goes a long way.  I recommend it for anyone with colored, dry, frizzy or fly away hair.</li>
            <li> This hair serum smells great and will last you at least a year.  We have seen it in our local mall but the price was astronomical.  So, glad we found it here are amazon. My daughter loves to use a little to tame her fly-a-ways and right before straightening.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. The smell is amazing. You truly only need 1-2 drops for the ends of your hair. Put 1-2 drops in your hand. Rub hands together. Then apply to ends only. After a minute-then brush your hair. Any more than that will make your hair too oily. Great for overnite oil treatment and wash hair in the morning. I bought my first bottle at a Florida Flea Market. Was $35. On &amp;#34;sale&amp;#34; for $20. I was told that it went for $75 in the mall. Hmmm... So when I found this on Amazon-I was so excited!!! I love you Amazon!!!❤️❤️❤️</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful and it is just what I ordered. I love it and will purchase it again. I arrived to me just in time.</li>
            <li> For a swimmer I could never get the chlorine smell out of my hair.  With this my hair still gets frizzy, but no longer smells like chlorine.  Also, it does not make my hair oily, which a lot of other hair products do.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair feel soft, takes away the fizziness and it smells good as well.  I have introduced it to a few friends and one of them even orders her own from Amazon now.</li>
            <li> Okay......First off I&#x27;m not bashing the product because I know it works.  But what worked were the samples of HerStyler that I got in a mall.  I used it and I have wavy/curly hair.  I use  serums before I blow dry it as straight as I can before flat ironing it.  This stuff worked so good and we all know there is not much in a sample pack.  So I bought it for $30.  I went home and of course it&#x27;s $7.00, so I felt like an idiot.  But I didn&#x27;t care cause this stuff worked great.  Well when I used it out of the bottle it did nothing like the sample packet did.  It also is no where near as thick.  Well I just stopped using it for a couple months.  And then two days later I found another sample that I forgot I put up.  So I said &amp;#34;why not&amp;#34;?  It worked amazingly.  So today I used the bottle and lets put it this way, I could barely put my fingers through my hair while I was blow drying it.  The consistency was no where near the same again.  I can&#x27;t remember if the box was sealed that I bought in the mall.  I want to say he watered them down and try and buy a bottle off of here.  I see all these reviews and can&#x27;t believe what I&#x27;m seeing.  All I know is what is in this bottle is nothing but crap.  This is just MY experience with this product.....Hey I ought to go back and get some more samples lol</li>
            <li> Sadly, i bought this exact same hair product at the mall for about $40 #_# so when I did my research and found out how cheap it was on amazon I felt really ripped off. But for now on must buy it here!! I love this product a lot. I have really dry hair because i dyed it so many times, and this product not only moisturizes it but also makes it smell lovely. I have gold highlights in my black hair so whenever i use this product it actually helps my gold look even prettier. this is a must have for all hair! especially if you dye it every year like me.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I used to get the trail size from people handing them out at the mall, always wanted some more. Saw this and instantly bought it. My hair ALWAYS looks bomb when I put this on after the shower.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this product. It lives up to my expectations. I first found out about this product at the Pallisades Mall, a girl curled my hair with it and it looked absolutely amazing hours later. It seemed pricy at the mall so I kept the sample and moved on until I found it on amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and she loves this stuff. It makes her hair super soft and smooth, and she insists on putting some in my hair all the time.</li>
            <li> READ TIL THE END! I got 2 of these her styler products and paid EXTRA! For the lifetime warranty. I got One for my wife and one for my sister. They worked good for the little bit of use it was put through, nothing to hard the most my wife used hers was 2x a week and that&#x27;s the top she had not touched it up to 3-4 months at a time it was rarely used. Same with my sister. My sisters herstyler cracked and won&#x27;t heat up any more! my wife&#x27;s just quit heating up. So I talked to the kiosk, and called the company directly. They told me they will not back the warrnity I purchased! And they told my wife we would have to pay $100 upgrade fee. If I did that it would be $200 to replace the products that I purchased lifetime warrnities with to avoid future headache and so the product would be covered! This company is CRAP! Why else would someone buy a warrnity other then have your product covered when it broke! I would strongly suggest if you want a straightnier or anything else for that matter DO NOT BUY from Herstyler. And when I talked to the company on the phone they bull$#^++% me and told me that there are only 3 people running a company that is producing hundreds of thousands of products. They also told me it is NOT a corporation, that it was a family owned business. The company does not stick to their word. And everyone involved is trained to Lie. I will never do business with or refer anyone to this company ever again like I have in the past. I&#x27;ve made this money 1000s of dollars and this is the way they repay their loyal customers! If you purchase one of these products be prepared to spend more money on repair or replacement even WITH a warrnity! I would refer you to the CHI AIR I got my wife one and she loved it and she said it does a way better job then the Herstyler ever thought to.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I used to buy it at the mall and it was really expensive! Thank God I found it here cheaper and what I love the most..., The smell! Is awesome!</li>
            <li> My sister in law had this sitting on her vanity and I gave it a try while I was straightening my hair.  LOVE IT!!!  The smell is very clean, perfect amount of hydration with out the oily feel, leaves my hair soft and silky.  Not sure how it stacks up in humid weather yet though.  Great price!!!  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my daughter and myself. Our hair lacked lustre due to coloring and heat appliance overuse. This product gave us back shine and strength.  Awesome product!! Smells great too!!</li>
            <li> Makes hair feel soft and get rid of frizz. Great scent, which is a bonus. Shipping fast as expected. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My dried hair never looked better. Even with a new version of this product is out I still prefer the original version.  Awesome!! Please don&#x27;t discontinue it.</li>
            <li> i first tried this at a kiosk at the mall.  I let the guys there do my hair, and then I was tricked into buying a bunch of stuff, one of them being this serum.  The iron i bought still works, its decent, but the hair dryer broke right away.  This serum though... its the most amazing thing I&#x27;ve put in my hair.  I have wavy/curly long brown hair.  When I put it in for curly styles, I just comb some through with my fingers on damp hair, let it air dry, and it curbs the frizz completely without being crunchy.  when I want to straighten my hair, NOTHING has left it looking sleeker.  also cuts down on straightening time by more than half.  According to the kiosk people this sells for $75!!!  I would maybe pay $25, it&#x27;s that good, but here on amazon its an amazing deal.</li>
            <li> Works so well for right after you shower. Awesome, love mine makes my hair super soft and smells wonderful. Great product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!  I&#x27;ve tried other products in the past and this is the only one that works with my hair.  It smooths out my frizzies, but does not weight it down.  Excellent for blowing drying.</li>
            <li> So, I read all of the reviews on this product, and I had to order it.  I have to say that it didn&#x27;t do well in my hair.  Now to be fair, I do have very fine, but thick hair.  I have found that it makes a great skin moisturizer, however.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I have never tried it on my hair when its wet but using it on dry hair works great</li>
            <li> Great product! It does leave it greasy by the second day (waking up next morning) but it&#x27;s an awesome product!vmy fav. When it comes to styling</li>
            <li> two different pics were set up for this item.....got wrong item, had to return.  Need to reorder and get right item somehow</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product. My girls and I both use it. Makes our hair so shinny soft and smells so good. I love putting it in my little girls hair. Great for an oil treatment and flat ironing.</li>
            <li> Items were here before time! Yay! Love it! Already use this product and my hair feels so much!</li>
            <li> Been using for years after trying out in the mall.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time with no damage... Makes my hair so soft with only a small amount of product and smells great.</li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered this instead of the argan oil and figured it would be about the same but the argan oil is much better this product may work for other people but it makes my hair very dry and fuzzy</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!! MAKES YOU STOP BUYING FROM THOSE HAIR KIOSKS IN THE SHOPPING MALLS.SUCH A SAVE ON MONEY</li>
            <li> I really love this product and for the price. Who can beat that. I will definitely recommend this product to family and friends</li>
            <li> LOVE this product smells great and works well. Great deal and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, somewhat frizzy hair. This stuff adds lots of shine and helps with the frizziness, especially noticeable when I apply it after I&#x27;ve straightened or curled my hair. Will be buying this for a long time.</li>
            <li> This was my second time purchasing the product and I love it! It works great on taming frizz. I apply a small amount to my wet hair before blow drying. You can also apply it to dry hair to help tame frizz and you only need a small amount - just a few pumps.</li>
            <li> Great product at a reasonable price.  I really like this product as it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily or with too much of a shine that it looks oily.</li>
            <li> You absolutely must use this product in your hair, it smells great and makes your hair so smooth and silky.  The bottle lasts such a long time because you only need a very little bit, you rub 1 or 2 drops in your hands and then gently evenly distribute the product and brush it through, every one that tries it, loves it.</li>
            <li> I love this Serum! It is the best out there! I&#x27;ve tried other products and it doesnt compare!! This works best for my hair!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this almost everyday since getting it and would highly recommend it. I style my hair with a flat iron or curling iron, and this has really helped improve the overall health of my hair, and my hair has never been so long! The smell alone was enough to convince me to get the 2 pack!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product amazing scent...just wish I had more hair not always the best for this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good product. My hair is fuzzy and dry but after I start using the serum it&#x27;s fill different an nice</li>
            <li> I really really like this product and love teh smell as always........hate having to count down my words for something you asked me for</li>
            <li> My hair is very frizzy and curly/wavy so I only used it on my hair post straightening... It left my hair feeling greasy everytime, My hair is quite dry so I also had to reapply multiple times a day.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! Smells so good. My hair is so shiny after I straighten it.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair soft and smelling really good. For the price of two its perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using hair serums for years for my long, wavy, fine frizzy hair. This is my favorite serum and have been using it for more than 2 years. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy or weigh it down and it completely washes out. I blow dry and straighten daily, so my hilited/colored hair gets abused. This serum sells for $50 in the mall and on company website- order it from Amazon! Also, I use 5-6 pumps and bottle lasts over a month with daily use.</li>
            <li> I have thick mixed hair and use a flat iron a lot!! This is the ONLY product  I have found that actually goes in and changes the texture of my hair instead of making it look like a helmet. I little goes a long way and it makes my hair smooth, shinny, and it blows in the wind. Keeps my hair in great shape so I can use less product and get less of that greesy look when styling. LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this HerStyler serum was in the Mall of America. I payed $20. I fell in love with it. (the texture is light and nice and the smell is amazing) The second time, (6 months later) I went back to the MOA and the same stand tried to charge me $50! I talked them down because I had to have it. Now that I know I can find 2 for less than the price of one on Amazon, I&#x27;m very excited! One bottle can last about 6 months. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot to see and smell the effect of this serum. I apply a little twice a day when I straighten my hair and instantly my hair is shiny, not greasy. It&#x27;s lightweight and keeps the frizz down. This potion is worth the money!</li>
            <li> This is my second shipment and like it and it&#x27;s effects! Great on reducing scars, moisturizing skin and hair. Adds shine to my previously weathered hair! Package was wrapped very well. Order arrived before the estimated arrival.</li>
            <li> Good price, like getting two bottles. Seems to work well and keeps my hair soft. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of HerStyler Hair Serum from a sales person in a local mall. I tried this product at home and liked it right away! So, I did a search for this Hair Serum on the internet, ordered it and have been using it ever since I received it. Very happy with this product! I&#x27;ve used Biosilk silk therapy for years and thought it was the best product for my hair until I tried HerStyler Hair Serum. I&#x27;m glad that sales person gave me a sample!</li>
            <li> Smell is irritating, but made my hair soft n shiny.i would recommend it to my frens. one who uses rod on regular basis can get it.</li>
            <li> My wife enjoys this product!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.  Excellent price.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product like a year ago with my flat iron and really liked it &amp;#34;then.&amp;#34; Came it across it randomly here on Amazon and thought, &amp;#34;why not!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally curly, long hair and it makes my hair smell great for the first little bit but then later in the day, my hair just looks a lil greasy. This isn&#x27;t a bad product by any means and I will continue to use it as a back up but it&#x27;s just not as great as I remembered it being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I&#x27;ve been trudging the internet and beauty shops looking for something that I could put on my hair in the mornings before styling, after my shower or right before flat ironing and found something I actually really like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re wondering what that product is, it&#x27;s the Marvelous Oil by Garnier Fructis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive - check. Makes my hair smell great - check.&lt;br /&gt;Makes my hair soft and manageable - check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even more awesome, it can found at your local drug store or grocer! I use the one for frizzy hair and no, I don&#x27;t work for Garnier lol</li>
            <li> Cant live without this product. Smells really good an tames the frizz</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best! It keeps my hair soft and smooth. It smells great too!</li>
            <li> This product is great!  Especially if you live in a dry climate and your hair is always dry.  Just a few drops, rub in your hand, apply to the ends and it refreshes the moisture back in your hair.  I abuse my hair with color and highlights and I live in New Mexico.  I wouldn&#x27;t survive without this product.  Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this product while visiting in Little Rock AK.  I used it in the hotel when I realized I had forgotten the product I usually use before straightening my hair.  HerStyler made my normally frizzy hair, feel smooth and silky.  After using the hot iron, it still looked great.  I loved it so much, I went back to the mall and bought some. I didn&#x27;t think it smelled that great, but I&#x27;m the only one.  I&#x27;ve had several comments on how good my hair smells.  I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores where I live, so I am happy to have found this on-line!</li>
            <li> Happy with the buy, this serum makes my hair soft and silky and convenient to apply as it can be used both on wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> Great stuff and a lot cheaper here than if you bought it from the Herstyler mall stand!</li>
            <li> Two bottles for half the price of what they try and sell them for at the mall. Amazing deal here! Works just like its suppose too. Smells great and lasts a long time. Would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The first tome I tried this product was when a mall worker was passing out samples.  I tried the sample and ould not believe how it made my hair feel.  Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product and it really protects my hair from heat. I use a flat iron everyday and I apply this before and after. My hair looks so nice and smells good too!</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  It keeps my hair from frizzing during humidity.  It does not make my hair oily.</li>
            <li> Not only as a hair serum but as a facial moisturizer. Love it would buy it sgsin and again.  Love it love it</li>
            <li> Great Product and Protector - offers shine on dry hair before flat iron or curling process - use sparingly!  Works on all types of hair</li>
            <li> Perfect for all types of hair. My daughters are mixed and it leaves my girls hair smooth and tangle free. My hair has improved with this product, it&#x27;s so much smoother and no more split ends. I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day and it doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy like other products. Will never use anything else. One more comment... I found this product at a stand in the mall, they wanted to charge me $70 for just one bottle. I thought they were crazy, but I really loved what it did to my hair!! So I looked at me fav website AMAZON and found it there for so much cheaper!!</li>
            <li> I was visiting the Mall of America once and this man tried to sell me this product, but it was super expensive. He gave me a little sample though. I ran out of what I usually use and tried the sample. I loved it!! I straighten my hair everyday and this doesn&#x27;t make it feel gross and greasy and it smells wonderful too! Plus, the price was right!</li>
            <li> love this product. so happy to be able to purchase it through amazon prime rather than pay the ridiculous amounts they charge at the kiosks.</li>
            <li> Realy works at my hair.</li>
            <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth buying.  It smells great; my hair is manageable, soft, and shiny after using it. I can recommend HerStyler Hair Serum.</li>
            <li> This item description was &amp;#34;HerStyler Hair Serum - Vitamin E&amp;#34;.  I was hoping it was as described, but no, it was not.  It is the HerStyler with Argan Oil.  I guess the original formula is no longer available.  I really preferred the serum with Aloe and Vitamin E.  For my hair, the formula with the Argan Oil feels greasy in my hair.  I use it, but I have to be very careful to use a really small amount.</li>
            <li> The smell alone is amazing. The serum works well - like most if these serums tend to. Reduces frizz, adds shine.. But I hate the smell of Argon oil! This has Argon oil but has a fragrance that is fresh. I wish they sold shampoo/conditioner in the same scent. I love it!</li>
            <li> The product itself was exactly what I expected. (I had a sample before I purchased this)  It&#x27;s awesome for diminishing frizz when applying before blowdrying and straightning hair. A little goes a long way. The only thing I was disappointed with was packaging for shipping. The serum leaked a little while being shipped and was kind of messy. Only some product from each bottle was lost though.</li>
            <li> I love how shiny this makes my hair, but at the same time I love the smell.  I don&#x27;t know why but it smells like roses to me, which I love.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!! Leaves your hair so soft and smooth and silky!! Not to mention it smells SO good!!! lasts a long time, a little goes a long way,  Will definitely be ordering some more once I run out:D</li>
            <li> Like this product very much because of the smell and the shine that it gives my hair to make it more manageable.</li>
            <li> Like the product however one of the bottles had spilled so it was half way full.</li>
            <li> I like the price. Thank you</li>
            <li> They wanted $50 at the mall for one bottle of this. Got two bottles for a 1/5 of the price here!!! Love it!! Use it everyday on my wet hair and again before I flat iron my hair!! Leaves my hair super soft and smooth and smells amazing!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I put about a teaspoon on my long wet hair after I washed it.  When dry I flat iron it and my hair is shiny, silky, soft.  I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my hair since using this serum.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair shiny and silky!!!!</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite hair serum. It makes my hair so smoth and silky. Im Just not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li> Love it cheaper than the mall they want to sell it for $47</li>
            <li> Have used this in the past, it absorbs well and does not leave a greasy feel. Will keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> Smells bad and didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li> The serum works aaaaamazing !! Not very fond of the smell but it goes away after a few minutes . The reason I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars is because the packaging stinks. I left it laying down on my vanity one day and came back home to half a bottle of serum on all of my stuff 😤</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it is tangled after drying.  I put a very small amount in my palm and rub on the ends of my hair.  It combs out easily and feels very silky.  I do not put at the roots as it may cause oilyness</li>
            <li> This stuff is extremely expensive, generally. I use a small amount everyday, and about ten pumps of it at night twice a week to help my hair stay healthy. It works wonders, and a little bit goes a VERY long way. If you&#x27;re growing your hair out and want a good treatment, or if you&#x27;ve dyed your hair and want to restore it... This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> I love this product I&#x27;ve been using it for two years and I can&#x27;t live without it. It makes my hair look healthy and shiny!!!  Not greasy!</li>
            <li> The price was outstanding. Love the smell and the way it feels on the hair.&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorite products.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time and in great condition.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair look great, and much cheaper than buying from those carts in the mall!  Would recommend to anyone with frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product makes hair so soft Nd shiny</li>
            <li> Hair has never felt smoother!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have extremely dry hair tips and the only time I have ever been able to have my hair feeling soft and luxurious is when I use this.  I recommended it to all of my friends and highly recommend it to anyone else that has problems with extreme split ends.</li>
            <li> Love this product, makes my hair super soft and not greasy, and smells great too.  I was so happy to find this product on Amazon, originally bought from a mall vendor for double this price, will never go back to the mall, will keep reordering on here</li>
            <li> Very satisfied have seen a major difference in my hair vet smooth and soft more msnageable.would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item at my teenage daughters request.  She uses heated irons a lot and has used many different oils to protect her hair.  She absolutely loves the results and smell of this serum.</li>
            <li> Been buying it from here for awhile now. Does not make your hair stiff and puts a little shine in your hair. Good for the scalp also.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing hair serum, leaves hair smooth and smells good. In love with it...</li>
            <li> When I got them, both were leaking. But the product itself is pretty good. I don&#x27;t use conditioner these days now.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I live in NM so it&#x27;s very dry here.  I put this on at night after my shower and my hair feels great.  I don&#x27;t even have to use it every night but I love the smell of it.  I have also used it on my skin and it makes it smoother.</li>
            <li> This item was recommended to me by a co-worker.  Bought it and really like it.  It smells good and leaves my hair with kinda a wet look if I use a lot.  If I only use a little it is great!!</li>
            <li> great product--I have used it for years</li>
            <li> No they have not paid me to write this review i wish they would lol. But seriously Buy it here!! It&#x27;s the real deal i know because i still had oil from when i purchased at the mall to compare it to. i used to have to go to a kiosk at the mall which was really out of my way (different city) and it was like 25 bucks for an oil and i would purchase the shampoo and conditioner for like 30 bucks. That&#x27;s how much i love their product. I have med to fine straight hair so i only put a drop or two, it smells great and makes my hair nice and shiny. I gave my other bottle to my mom she has fine hair but she naturally has tight curls kinda like a perm so she has an afro, her hair would often look dry and her hair was falling out her hair now looks full and healthy and her curls look really cute now.</li>
            <li> I love this very cheap than that woman at the mall trying to sell it to me for like 30 bucks</li>
            <li> Great serum to use before you flat iron your hair.  Affordable pricing too.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product.  It&#x27;s perfect for keeping your hair soft and it smells lovely...&lt;br /&gt;It mends split ends and manages your hair... recommend if you want your hair restored to baby soft feeling..&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t use anything else.. great product</li>
            <li> Makes my hair less frizzy, adds a beautiful shine, and softness.</li>
            <li> The best hair product out there and I&#x27;ve tried them all! I recommend this product for everyone with any type of hair.Prevents hairyness and fly aways.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair sooo soft with just a few drops. I&#x27;d recommend it for anyone who has drier hair or uses hot irons hot curlers straight irons it any hair shaper that dries your hair out.  Great product, great deal!!</li>
            <li> Super nice does not weigh my hair down it&#x27;s just rite! It&#x27;s perfect so thankful the girl at the mall put it in my hair at the mall</li>
            <li> I love this product it last a long time and also helps with frizzy damaged hair!!! Great product! Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Great product, my hair feels silky and smooth. The only thing that would make this serum better is Aragon oil.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I first tried it from a tester I got at a mall and then I decided I should purchase it to try it out. I recently went to a salon and lighten my hair so my hair got pretty damaged on my ends and I had to cut it short. But at least now with this product it won&#x27;t feel so dry on my ends. Just make sure not too use so much, maybe one pump for medium to thick hair is good enough just on the ends. Very happy with this product, and got a super deal 2 for &amp;15.</li>
            <li> Very affordable, extremely good smelling, light, and decently natural... this product is something I order over and over again. Keeps the frizz down!</li>
            <li> Love this product &amp; have used it for over 1 year!</li>
            <li> it makes my hair feel great.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair which damages easily from using curling/straightening irons and blow dryers.  HerStyler Hair Serum - Vit. E gives my hair a softer/healthier look by sealing (concealing) my split ends.  It also helps control static without making my hair feel heavy or oily.  It smells really nice too.  Because my hair is so fine, other products I have used in the past seem to weigh it down and leave it less shiny.  A little bit of HerStyler in the palm goes a long way, so start off sparingly and adjust up from there.  I use it every day as part of my normal routine regardless of whether or not I am styling for work or wearing it in a ponytail on the weekends.  I love it all the time.  When I originally purchased HerStyler Hair Serum/Vitamin E, I thought it included Argan Oil as an ingredient, but it does not, thus my 4 star rating instead of 5.  My next purchase will include Argan Oil Serum just to check it out.  I would recommend this product for all hairstyles.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved the serum. Will definitely buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> Very good! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great Product! It makes my thick coarse wavy hair behave and It protects my hair from the harmful effects of the flatiron.&lt;br /&gt;BTW, Go to the mall and check out how they charge for this product there. There is such a price difference that I doubted that it was the same product but I decided to take a chance and bought only 1. Since that first purchase,  Amazon is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; place to buy this and I have been back 3 more times.</li>
            <li> Great product! Does not weigh hair down and smells so refreshing.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this product at the mall and LOVED it. When I looked at the herstyler website I couldn&#x27;t believe the price. This was a great deal!</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of tis product in a mall.  Wow what a Godsend!  I use the entire line now and my hair is beautiful!</li>
            <li> Love,love,love this product it smells so good and helps with frizz too. I will definitely order again...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this &amp; it does make my hair SOFT.  I just use it on the ends &amp; not near the top of my head.  It does the job.  I do have to put other stuff in my hair to smooth it out, as my hair can get frizzy after I shampoo and dry it. then I flat iron my hair.  My hair comes out soft, and not &amp;#34;Oily&amp;#34;.  Will order again!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  Got it as a gift with purchase of a her styler straightener and LOVED it. But when the bottle broke and I went to replace it,  they wanted $75 for the stuff!  So I found it much less expensive here!</li>
            <li> Takes away frizz after blow drying</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick and wavy hair plus I color it, so it is frizzy.  I have tried many products to correct this problem. I have found that either they do not work or weigh my hair down.  This is the only one that works on my hair.  It is awesome!  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love this serum..  I use it daily!</li>
            <li> Love Argan oil.  Great for my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product. My daughter tried it,also saw immediate results so  I gave her the second bottle. Great product! Arrived sooner than expected. Overall, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is the best leave in hair treatment I have ever used...I doubt I will ever need to try another!</li>
            <li> I love this hair product, so good for my hair, very happy with this product , I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love it... Love the smell... Leaves my hair feeling Soft and Silky. Get a lot of &amp;#34; Your hair smells so good&amp;#34; compliments. Love it  :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all I use!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This Serum is such a deal,  I first tried  it at my Mall near by. However,  They were just trying to rip me off so bad -by trying to sell this over to me for $29 for one... I&#x27;ve decided to wait and my usual instinct is to look  up reviews of the product and find a better deal. Sure enough - Amazon never fails me,  Found this so much cheaper,  I just seriously love the smell, leaves my hair very soft and best used when straightening your hair or a small amount added to your hair when it is damp.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling and greatest product for long hair that is heat-styled.</li>
            <li> HerStyler is an excellent hair serum, I love their products and the performance. I would definitely purchase again and will try the shampoo and conditioner to compliment the serum.</li>
            <li> Like this product. Use this to help straighten the mess that is my hair! I&#x27;ve used other products in the past and this one had helped me the most so far.</li>
            <li> im so glad i bought this 2 bottle pack. the day it arrived i opened and apply some and somehow dropped it breaking it and wasting all of oil inside :( but luckily the other one i still have... i absolutely love it. i have dyed my hair for too many years now and it was dead before i started using this serum. a girl at the mall gave me some samples but i refused to pay the 40 dlls a bottle they charge so i tried the samples and that was enough for me to fall in love with it. two weeks later my hair was as soft as never !! 100 % recommend it., i use it daily.. and smells beautifully.. totally worth it..</li>
            <li> This product smells great and gives lots of shine and silky smoothness.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or look greasy when you apply it. I&#x27;ve noticed that it makes my hands soft, too! I&#x27;m glad I bought the 2-pack so it will be a while before I run out.</li>
            <li> nice for curly hair and if you are strightening it.  I have very curly hair and I do not have to use anything with it to hold in shine.</li>
