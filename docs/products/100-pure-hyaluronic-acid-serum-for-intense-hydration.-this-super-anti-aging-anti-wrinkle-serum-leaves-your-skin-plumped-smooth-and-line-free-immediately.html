            <li>Love the product to erase fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Many others advertise the &amp;#34;appearance&amp;#34; will improve but with this product, the skin does smooth out.  </li>
            <li>Great value for a serum that is professional grade.</li>
            <li>I think this would be a nice fresh start.    </li>
            <li>I love how this product is 100% organic and free from the dyes and extra chemical additives that my skin abhores, so all I experience are the wonderfully pleasing results from this very pure 1% Hyaluronic Acid solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has made my skin look brighter, feel smoother and seems to have reduced the appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li>Also I noticed with this product that it does help with fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and soaks in within a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started using this hyaluronic acid serum right before bed follow by my favorite night moisturizer</li>
            <li>I get older, I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is needing more and more</li>
            <li>This Serum was wonderful and felt so good on my skin, its light and goes on smoothly , I used this Serum daily and will definitely order a new supply, I used this serum in combination with the the acid peel</li>
            <li>bcuz I plan on buying more of it now so that I can keep having such amazing looking skin.</li>
            <li>Light like water, dries fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>I am sure with extended use of the Carbon serum, that it may even repair some of my newly forming fine lines.</li>
            <li>I have absolutely fallen in LOVE with this serum.</li>
            <li>I have been using this facial serum for about six weeks, and while I haven&#x27;t noticed a great reduction in lines, I have noticed that using this in combination with a 30% lactic acid peel, my skin has become much fresher and more vibrant during that time.</li>
            <li>and I actually got it mailed to me for free just for giving my honest opinion on how it works</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well made and effective AND waaaay cheaper here than similar products.</li>
            <li>I use this each night before bed followed by my favorite moisturizer, and have noticed how soft my skin is feeling.  </li>
            <li>I smear it on right out of the shower and again at night.</li>
            <li>, decollete, back of hands, and top of feet.  </li>
            <li>I will admit that I was scared at first to try it bcuz of it being a peel that you do at home by myself,  but if you follow the instructions EXACTLY how it says to in theinstructional email they send you</li>
            <li>This product was sent in for an honest, unbiased review, however, that has no absolutely barrings on my opinion of the product.</li>
            <li>Now i know that it&#x27;s mostly because i&#x27;m not drinking enough water.</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one week of twice-daily use, this facial serum seems to work well.</li>
            <li>Carbon Skincare Hyaluronic Acid Serum really works!</li>
            <li>just a few days of twice daily use, I saw tremendous improvement in my face, which looked beautifully radiant and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This arrives in a pretty blue, easy to use, pump style bottle.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, just a few drops and smooth onto my skin.  </li>
            <li>At 66, my skin was just starting to show fine lines.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very damaged from sunshine.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend, and I&#x27;m not just saying that!        </li>
            <li>Really helps with moisture.</li>
            <li>I started using hyaluronic acid as an extra (grease free) moisturizing step in my beauty routine.</li>
            <li>I also applied a moisturizer afterward at night, and a sunscreen by day, and found the results to be absolutely excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have found that serums are the key, to keeping your face and skin looking young and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I have struggled with dry and flaking skin on my nose for as long as I can remember, and for the first time EVER I have smooth and flake free skin on my nose.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This helps  plump up fine lines and bring some moisture back into my skin, which helps my skin feel soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>serum is applied with a pump applicator atop the beautiful blue bottle, and I found that one squirt of serum covered by entire face, with two providing enough to cover my face, neck, and upper decolletage.</li>
            <li>I will continue to sue it on the deeper wrinkles and watch for results over several more weeks of daily use.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my main weapons in my arsonal against aging skin.  </li>
            <li>Firstly, it soothed the skin and helped if there were any hot spots left.</li>
            <li>skin is very soft, very hydrated.</li>
            <li>you are planning on doing a lactic acid peel, I would highly recommend this nourishing treatment to help re-moisturize your skin afterwards.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I washed my face day and night and applied to clean and dry skin.</li>
            <li>and i am really liking it so far.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed wrinkles on my forehead and eyes and this has definitely aided in nourishing and plumping my skin right up without making my skin overly oily and shiny.</li>
            <li>found it helpful to apply this serum while my skin was still damp from cleansing, since apparently the extra water makes a difference in ensuring full hydration.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this serum to anyone who has chemically-sensitive skin, as I do, since it is 100% natural, in accordance with the quality that Carbon Skincare is known for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fine lines did in fact disappear after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t love is if I don&#x27;t put moisturizer on afterwards immediately, my skin can feel a bit tight around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Following up with this pure organic hyaluronic acid afterwards made all the difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually trying to convince my husband to let me do a peel on his face, because he does absolutely NOTHING for his skin, not even moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Works very well after doing facial peels, exfoliating or dermablading.</li>
            <li>skin is soft, even toned.</li>
            <li>My skin felt wonderfully tight and super hydrated after use.</li>
            <li>I tend to have very dry skin; to the point where it flakes and peels and this has certainly to hydrates it.</li>
            <li>I want to keep myself looking as young as possible without going towards surgical methods and this is one product that will help with this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve use far more expensive products that didn&#x27;t do as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It felt lovely on and I never noticed any stinging sensation, even though I have heard that normally you get at least a small sunburn feeling.  </li>
            <li>they frequently tell me my skin is dry.</li>
            <li>Though I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days, I can certainly tell the difference in my skin.</li>

            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t love is if I don&#x27;t put moisturizer on afterwards immediately, my skin can feel a bit tight around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Following up with this pure organic hyaluronic acid afterwards made all the difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually trying to convince my husband to let me do a peel on his face, because he does absolutely NOTHING for his skin, not even moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Works very well after doing facial peels, exfoliating or dermablading.</li>
            <li> skin is soft, even toned.</li>
            <li> My skin felt wonderfully tight and super hydrated after use.</li>
            <li> I tend to have very dry skin; to the point where it flakes and peels and this has certainly to hydrates it.</li>
            <li> I want to keep myself looking as young as possible without going towards surgical methods and this is one product that will help with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use far more expensive products that didn&#x27;t do as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It felt lovely on and I never noticed any stinging sensation, even though I have heard that normally you get at least a small sunburn feeling.  </li>
            <li> they frequently tell me my skin is dry.</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days, I can certainly tell the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Different areas have reacted differently: the decollete is the only area that is taking a long time to see an improvement</li>
            <li> Especially after long sunny beach day when it comes to treat my face</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 30s and smoke, which contributes to my dry skin and formation or wrinkles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes skin feel a bit tight, which may be unexpected, but is part of the plumping process.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical as I&#x27;ve tried many different products and they never seem to work for my very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Then let it air dry</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way to make your skin instantly tighten and brighten.</li>
            <li> I tend to be very heavy handed and would otherwise use way too much because I don&#x27;t want a drop to go to waste, but the pump helps me with this.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t have any reaction with the other products I use on my face.  </li>
            <li> The serum feels a bit thick, reminding me a bit of natural aloe vera plant extract, with a scent so subtle I barely noticed it, and dries leaving little sign</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it as an after peel treatment, as well as a few times a week after cleansing and before moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few days now</li>
            <li> But this way at least I&#x27;m battling the dryness from both sides!</li>
            <li> This product is useless without directions on how to use it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> LOVE. THIS. Finally, a product that lives up to it&#x27;s &amp;#34;hype&amp;#34;. This is not hype. It&#x27;s well made and effective AND waaaay cheaper here than similar products. It moisturizes effectlively so that my Eleven&#x27;s and forehead lines aren&#x27;t as pronounced. Does it make them go away? No, it plumps the skin and smooths the look. I smear it on right out of the shower and again at night. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I used this in combination with Carbon&#x27;s 30% Chemical Peel.  It is used after the peel and after using a neutralizing rinse.  It felt lovely on and I never noticed any stinging sensation, even though I have heard that normally you get at least a small sunburn feeling.  Nope.  Just felt nice.  I did use an exfoliator before the peel.    Between both products, I did my face (my cheekbones are the worst!), decollete, back of hands, and top of feet.  Twice (a week apart).  Different areas have reacted differently: the decollete is the only area that is taking a long time to see an improvement but it&#x27;s very damaged from sunshine.  I grew up when Mom&#x27;s didn&#x27;t slather their kids in sunscreen, we only used that white stuff on our noses!    I also didn&#x27;t have any reaction with the other products I use on my face.  Later that night I used Origins Night a Mins and in the morning I used Strivectin&#x27;s daily moisturizer (on sale, of course) and they all work well together.  I&#x27;m very pleased as I could never afford to go to a dermatologist.    I&#x27;m actually trying to convince my husband to let me do a peel on his face, because he does absolutely NOTHING for his skin, not even moisturizer.  I think this would be a nice fresh start.    Highly recommend, and I&#x27;m not just saying that!        Rec&#x27;d sample from manufacturer for review.</li>
            <li> I am loving the hyaluronic acid. This has made my skin look brighter, feel smoother and seems to have reduced the appearance of fine lines. I want to keep myself looking as young as possible without going towards surgical methods and this is one product that will help with this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!!! I will admit that I was scared at first to try it bcuz of it being a peel that you do at home by myself,  but if you follow the instructions EXACTLY how it says to in theinstructional email they send you then there&#x27;s nothing to worry about but I&#x27;m glad I tried it and I actually got it mailed to me for free just for giving my honest opinion on how it works and I&#x27;m sooo glad that I gave it a try bcuz I plan on buying more of it now so that I can keep having such amazing looking skin.</li>
            <li> Really helps with moisture.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to receive this in exchange for my honest review.  I have found that serums are the key, to keeping your face and skin looking young and healthy.  I use this each night before bed followed by my favorite moisturizer, and have noticed how soft my skin is feeling.  I am sure with extended use of the Carbon serum, that it may even repair some of my newly forming fine lines. If you are looking for a good facial serum, Carbon Skincare has some great products to offer.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely fallen in LOVE with this serum. Though I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days, I can certainly tell the difference in my skin. I tend to have very dry skin; to the point where it flakes and peels and this has certainly to hydrates it. I was very skeptical as I&#x27;ve tried many different products and they never seem to work for my very dry skin. Also I noticed with this product that it does help with fine lines and wrinkles. I am in my mid 30s and smoke, which contributes to my dry skin and formation or wrinkles. I&#x27;ve noticed wrinkles on my forehead and eyes and this has definitely aided in nourishing and plumping my skin right up without making my skin overly oily and shiny. People I know who have also have tried this say that it works wonders after a chemical peel, however I cannot verify as I&#x27;ve never had a peel. I like the fact that it comes in a pump container to helps me with the amount I put on. I tend to be very heavy handed and would otherwise use way too much because I don&#x27;t want a drop to go to waste, but the pump helps me with this. This is another wonderful serum I&#x27;ll be adding to my daily routine. NOTE: This product was sent in for an honest, unbiased review, however, that has no absolutely barrings on my opinion of the product. All reviews are 100% honest and totally my own conclusions.</li>
            <li> I love this.  So silky on the skin. I minute I put it on I knew this was going to work for me. At 66, my skin was just starting to show fine lines.  Now after using this for over the weeks I can see the difference.</li>
            <li> I was given this product in exchange for an honest review. I started using hyaluronic acid as an extra (grease free) moisturizing step in my beauty routine. when i get facials (i have problem skin so i try to do that once a month, thank the lord for groupon) they frequently tell me my skin is dry. Now i know that it&#x27;s mostly because i&#x27;m not drinking enough water. But this way at least I&#x27;m battling the dryness from both sides! Do yourself a favor and start putting this on your face!</li>
            <li> This has cleared my daughters acne up  tremendously !!</li>
            <li> Fantastic value - seems to be very effective. Noticeable results after one nights use. Also use during the day when skin feels a bit dryer. Works very well after doing facial peels, exfoliating or dermablading.</li>
            <li> This product worked as advertised.  The fine lines did in fact disappear after a few weeks.  Many others advertise the &amp;#34;appearance&amp;#34; will improve but with this product, the skin does smooth out.  I will continue to sue it on the deeper wrinkles and watch for results over several more weeks of daily use.  I will definitely reorder this product.</li>
            <li> Skin is definitely moisturized after around 8-9 days.</li>
            <li> I started using this hyaluronic acid serum right before bed follow by my favorite night moisturizer I am very happy with the results. Especially after long sunny beach day when it comes to treat my face this is the best and it&#x27;s organic cherry on top.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a great difference in my skin. I love this product and would recommend it to anybody.</li>
            <li> Love the product to erase fine lines.  Easy to use, just a few drops and smooth onto my skin.  This is one of my main weapons in my arsonal against aging skin.  I am winning the battle.</li>
            <li> This Serum was wonderful and felt so good on my skin, its light and goes on smoothly , I used this Serum daily and will definitely order a new supply, I used this serum in combination with the the acid peel and i&#x27;m thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> I love this Carbon Skincare serum! I&#x27;ve been applying this product twice daily for a couple of weeks now, and am truly amazed at what a difference in hydration it makes for my skin. I love how this product is 100% organic and free from the dyes and extra chemical additives that my skin abhores, so all I experience are the wonderfully pleasing results from this very pure 1% Hyaluronic Acid solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In just a few days of twice daily use, I saw tremendous improvement in my face, which looked beautifully radiant and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is applied with a pump applicator atop the beautiful blue bottle, and I found that one squirt of serum covered by entire face, with two providing enough to cover my face, neck, and upper decolletage. The serum feels a bit thick, reminding me a bit of natural aloe vera plant extract, with a scent so subtle I barely noticed it, and dries leaving little sign it is there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it helpful to apply this serum while my skin was still damp from cleansing, since apparently the extra water makes a difference in ensuring full hydration. I also applied a moisturizer afterward at night, and a sunscreen by day, and found the results to be absolutely excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this serum to anyone who has chemically-sensitive skin, as I do, since it is 100% natural, in accordance with the quality that Carbon Skincare is known for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review was written based on a complementary product sample I received in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Wonderful.  Great product my skin texture is looking better</li>
            <li> Great Product, Really does the job well. I will definitely buy again. I received this as a gift to share my experiences with this product.  thank you!</li>
            <li> I received a sample bottle for my review. I&#x27;ve had the bottle in my possession for about 5 days. It is recommended that you use it daily for a minimum of 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;To start with, the consistency and texture is nice and refreshing on the skin. Light like water, dries fairly quickly. I washed my face day and night and applied to clean and dry skin. Then let it air dry (it can take a minute or two) and applied my favourite moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very soft, very hydrated. I have struggled with dry and flaking skin on my nose for as long as I can remember, and for the first time EVER I have smooth and flake free skin on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is soft, even toned. The only thing I don&#x27;t love is if I don&#x27;t put moisturizer on afterwards immediately, my skin can feel a bit tight around my eyes. I am hopeful that my skin will continue to improve and stay hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have been using this facial serum for about six weeks, and while I haven&#x27;t noticed a great reduction in lines, I have noticed that using this in combination with a 30% lactic acid peel, my skin has become much fresher and more vibrant during that time. I&#x27;ve been using it as an after peel treatment, as well as a few times a week after cleansing and before moisturizing. It goes on smoothly and soaks in within a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are planning on doing a lactic acid peel, I would highly recommend this nourishing treatment to help re-moisturize your skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> Sample was provided by the manufacturer for review. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one week of twice-daily use, this facial serum seems to work well. It has a nice cooling sensation when applied, and it leaves my face feeling hydrated and smooth. One pump of the solution effectively covers my face, so I should get a lot of use out of it!</li>
            <li> I received thisbto try as part of an at home chemical peel kit from the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chemical peel worked great, really made a difference in my skin (see my review on it). Following up with this pure organic hyaluronic acid afterwards made all the difference. Firstly, it soothed the skin and helped if there were any hot spots left. My skin felt wonderfully tight and super hydrated after use. I actually like to use this after doing some micro needling too. Feels great, skin looks beautiful after use and it is the perfect way to hydrate after an at home dermatologist strength chemical peel.</li>
            <li> This product is useless without directions on how to use it.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know if this works, but I feel better using it. I use it after a peel and then put a good moisturizer on top and it seems to work.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few days now and i am really liking it so far.  My face feels really smooth!!  I received this product in exchange for my honest review. All opinions stated are that of my own and have in no way been swayed.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice Hyaluronic Acid, it feels so good after a peel. This helps  plump up fine lines and bring some moisture back into my skin, which helps my skin feel soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I get older, I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is needing more and more moisturizing,...creams and moisturizers are ok but since discovering how nicely hyaluronic acid makes my skin feel I have been trying to choose products that includes it. Just about every face product I own now has hyaluronic acid in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This arrives in a pretty blue, easy to use, pump style bottle. A sample was provided by the manufacturer for evaluation and review. I like the way this Hyaluronic Acid makes my skin feel so I will continue to use it! :)</li>
            <li> Carbon Skincare Hyaluronic Acid Serum really works! A little goes a long way to make your skin instantly tighten and brighten. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Worked good an hydrating  my face in the winter would deffenatly  use again</li>
            <li> This Serum goes on Smooth feels amazing fills in fine line and wrinkles it reduce redness its Dr.in a bottle I got it to test and review Yaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great value for a serum that is professional grade. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This hyaluronic acid serum does what it claims to do.  It plumps up skin, and adds moisture.  It&#x27;s great to use after a peel, giving your skin a real kick start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes skin feel a bit tight, which may be unexpected, but is part of the plumping process.  Use a good moisturizer and you&#x27;re good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really pleased with this serum&#x27;s effect.  I&#x27;ve use far more expensive products that didn&#x27;t do as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample received for review.</li>
