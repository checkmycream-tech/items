            <li>But nothing spectacular.  </li>
            <li>I will disclose that I was sent a bottle for review, and have since purchased bottles of my own.</li>
            <li>Nice lotion for the price.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast and this cream is great!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy, which is a nice plus.</li>
            <li>i mix it with my toner to create a kind of serum...</li>
            <li>I kind of forgot I had it and stopped using it.</li>
            <li>Make sure to use on a consistent basis for best results.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clog pores, feels amazing, very good under makeup as it dries fast.</li>
            <li>great seller, fast shipping, good price.</li>
            <li>My skin felt great after the first use and continues to improve!</li>
            <li>This is a very good lotion, but it is very liquidy.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best lotion I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>This is by far THE BEST HAND LOTION for eczema !!!</li>
            <li>My skin despises any kind of moisturizer, it feels &amp;#34;suffocated&amp;#34; for lack of a better work.</li>
            <li>This is the best lotion I have found for keeping my hands and legs soft.  </li>
            <li>My skin really needed help &amp; so like many I heard of this lotion, tried it , &amp; loved it!</li>
            <li>This stuff is very light, almost gel like.</li>
            <li>Also contains no parabens which is very important to me.</li>
            <li>I have very fair sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but I really am impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li>My wife and daughter love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Glides on smoothly, almost acts like a primer for my make up!</li>
            <li>It is an ok moisturizer, she uses it for her face</li>
            <li>Glad it&#x27;s not a watery consistency either.</li>
            <li>but im sure now its more water than anything....</li>
            <li>My favorite part is that since it is a \\&quot;shielding lotion,\\&quot; I can put it on my babe&#x27;s face and his drool does not rinse it</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is just okay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>Product was recommended so wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>it feels like a layer of softness sitting on top of your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure how to describe it...</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I just happened across this at the pharmacy counter, and found better pricing through Amazon...of course ;-}</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The light-textured moisturizer doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and I&#x27;m able to use it on face, eyes, throat, hands and body.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that this stuff is just ok.</li>
            <li>I love this miracle lotion.</li>
            <li>I love love LOVE this lotion.</li>
            <li>At night, I still like to wear night cream on top of the Skin MD.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>will buy lotion again for sure.</li>
            <li>My skin is softer and more even.</li>
            <li>we love this lotion..</li>

            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion..</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much more than the cheap-y store bought brands.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>love this lotion.</li>
            <li>so I know for sure this product is not for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered more to get me through the winter.</li>
            <li>i love  that my doej skin feels likethe non-greasy  feeling.</li>
            <li>Perhaps if this lotion could be made as a cream it would have better moisturizing properties</li>
            <li>This is better than most, but not the miracle lotion some reviewers describe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Each I try to dispense an appropriate amount from the bottle, I get about 3X an appropriate amount.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Glad my friend recommended this to me and I would recommend this as well.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, clean smell and does moisturize just not the way that I need it to.</li>
            <li>Have seen many great reviews on this lotion on YouTube but cant find it in stores where I live.</li>
            <li>This lotion has single-handedly turned my skin soft and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Excellent before makeup and works well on dry patches on legs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, soaks in quickly, and my skin feels nice.  </li>
            <li>In fact this lotion was perfect for my dry skin during my pregnancy.</li>
            <li>The best light facial moisturizer  in the world!</li>
            <li>It will NOT heal your excema but it makes it much more comfortable and manageable.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much, I use it all over my body including my face.</li>
            <li>but I have to put on a second application for it to be real effective...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It absorbs very quickly, and does not leave a scent.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>Love the clean, light feeling of this product.</li>
            <li>Hands down one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve come by.</li>
            <li>This is my first Amazon review, cause Skin MD is simply THE BEST cream</li>
            <li>and I felt fine</li>
            <li>I used this lotion during my pregnancy and it was a huge help.</li>
            <li>The fading capability is certainly a huge bonus however I&#x27;d use this product even without it.  </li>
            <li>so nice &amp; lightweight yet really does a fantastic job at moisterizing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky.</li>
            <li>It is a light weight face lotion for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every available lotion and cream in stores to no avail.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non-greasy and light weight.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and does not feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li>But, the ingredients are fabulous.</li>
            <li>use DK Elan Silky Smooth body lotion</li>
            <li>So far so good...</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I really want to write a great review for this product because it really does everything it claims and it saved my skin........</li>
            <li>product was received before expected, very fast shipment also best price for amount of product!</li>
            <li>Love this product so much!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth ever penny!</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Ok, liked other lotions better.</li>
            <li>I live in a warm climate and I&#x27;m outdoors a lot.</li>
            <li>I use it every time I clean my face.</li>
            <li>Great lotion and gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It gives you a clean feeling.</li>
            <li>it feels great on the skin, but doesn&#x27;t help dry patches unless used over a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I took a show to clean this product off from my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, I love this!</li>
            <li>This makes my whole face silky smooth!</li>
            <li>also kept my legs nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I have struggled with eczema all my life, and while Skin MD is no cure, after a month or so of using this, I can confidently say it really does the trick in terms of helping to keep it under control.</li>
            <li>This one is natural, moisturizing, effective, and non comedogenic.</li>
            <li>This winter I (for the first  time) had a strong attack of itchy skin.</li>
            <li>Healed the mild eczema on my legs overnight.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s mild, with a mild/almost no scent.</li>
            <li>The combination worked, not Skin MD OR Cerave/Restoraderm alone, to heal my skin really quickly.  </li>
            <li>We have been loyal Skin MD lotion customers for about 5 years or so.</li>
            <li>*side note: i have mild acne....</li>
            <li>it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t have this greasy residue.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Its not unpleasant and does feel like it&#x27;s shielding, as advertised.</li>
            <li>Its slick,easy to spread and smells good to boot!This is a first for me-to actually write up a recommendation!</li>
            <li>Works really well!!  </li>
            <li>I definitely would recommend and I did recommend Skin MD to many of my friends!</li>
            <li>First impression of smell - nothing special..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very cheap as a body lotion, but it&#x27;s very good price if using for face and neck, and hands!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like gel, not thick at all.</li>
            <li>I use it daily on my face and it reduces my redness amazingly</li>
            <li>and it calm the itchness</li>
            <li>but they rarely have it in stock.</li>
            <li>Was not as good as expected.</li>
            <li>It definitely does leave some kind of \\&quot;shield\\&quot; that you can feel--</li>
            <li>This lotion is so worth trying it feels</li>
            <li>and nightI love the fact that the one has spf 15.It keeps my sking so soft and dont have to worry about sun effects</li>
            <li>Had the smaller samples and it worked great for my sensitive skin on my face.  </li>
            <li>Use about a dimes worth of lotion for each underarm.</li>
            <li>If I manage to get an appropriate amount out of the bottle, I&#x27;m able to handle doorknobs without slipping and handle fabrics without discoloring them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>found this a nice daytime moisturizer, but doesn&#x27;t do the heavy duty repair of my favorite hand cream, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different high end primers and this is much, MUCH cheaper for equal and in most cases superior results.</li>
            <li>I have too much experience with prescription products to be persuaded by clever marketing for over the counter lotions (which this product avoids for the most part).  </li>
            <li>I apply this on my feet right after I get out of the shower</li>
            <li>On a trip to the East Coast at the end of February, with heating going full blast everywhere, I found that mid-flare, when I had already scratched my skin all raw, I had to apply Skin MD to soothe and hydrate my skin, and then apply a layer of Cerave or Restoraderm (or even better still, Atopiclair or Avene XD) on top to lock it in.</li>
            <li>The plus is that it is easy to reapply mid-day without getting your clothing all greasy, as it somehow both spreads easily and sinks in quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say maybe half that would be fair.</li>
            <li>i still have it still on my counter collecting dust, even when my hands or legs are healthy and not dry</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick or sticky like others, it feels pure, light and hydrates your skin right away.</li>
            <li>Skin MD really works better than many many other big brand face cream I tried.</li>
            <li>But that was fine with me because I could put it on and it would dry very quickly</li>
            <li>On my hands, I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>Hard to find in drugstores, so happy that Amazon carrys it.</li>
            <li>, I put lotion next to my bed :))</li>
            <li>its keeping my hands and feet soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I first saw this lotion on youtube.</li>
            <li>It was ok on my body as well, but will likely just use it for my hands.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Lori over 40!</li>
            <li>I was waking up every 2 hours to remoisturize the first couple of nights of my trip.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>First of all, I have combination skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light lotion that doesn&#x27;t aggravate my Sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like this at first because it felt like it just disappeared without doing anything, but you have to give it a chance</li>
            <li>It also works great if you are sensitive to fragrances because it has little to no scent.</li>
            <li>We only use it on our face and hands and really don&#x27;t use much more than a pea-sized drop for each.</li>
            <li>was suffering severe eczema on my hands for a long time and now they are gone :)</li>
            <li>it coats, but yet dries pretty fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s brilliant, never greasy &amp; a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite lotion , work for my dry skin and my psoriasis</li>
            <li>After three days of applying it every couple of hours, my skin looked healthy, all the peeling was gone, and better yet, after not using any for several hours and washing my hands a few times, my skin still felt soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The formula has a gel like consistency that I love, it never feels greasy or heavy on my skin and it quickly soaks in.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say now that my acne is much less, and my face looks and feels so much</li>
            <li>not make my skin oily&lt;br /&gt;Can be applied throughout day, or over many days to resolve very dry skin</li>
            <li>They either absorbed right away and left my skin feeling just as dry, or just sat on the top of my skin leaving me slimy.  </li>
            <li>Yes, as a lot of reviewers have said, it is very watery.</li>
            <li>$20 is just too much for this.</li>
            <li>It really is like a shield.</li>
            <li>It really keeps my foundation on all day and keeps the moisture locked in.  </li>
            <li>I am 37 and still have very oily/acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>This lotion helped soo much and helped my acne scars fade that can&#x27;t be seen from a distance.</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>I definitely feels &#x27;light&#x27; on the skin.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>My makeup application is so much smoother after using this.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>The consistency is thin and watery but it works great.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need much, so</li>
            <li>I bought this for myself but didn&#x27;t use it much.</li>
            <li>Then my DH started using it and really likes it.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin very silky and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t need too much.</li>
            <li>I apply it at night, and when I wake up, my skin is so much smoother.</li>
            <li>It really is medicine for the skin.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I no longer have dryness on my nose and chin, and any blemishes I may have heal much faster than they did before.  </li>
            <li>Just wish it wasn&#x27;t soooo much $$.$$</li>
            <li>once it rubs in you don&#x27;t really feel it at all</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really use during the day)</li>
            <li>I really like it- live in a hot dry area and its light non greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say, but I have super sensitive skin and an incurable skin disease, and I am really happy with the results.</li>
            <li>While the lotion is extremely light, it is extremely soothing and does seem to help restore the natural skin barrier relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li>I will repurchase this as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy and bonds to the skin quickly meaning it doesn&#x27;t rub off onto things you touch later.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by its thin consistency, it locks in your natural moisture and leaves skin feeling great.</li>
            <li>This is my third repurchase, and I never repurchase lotions with so many different kinds out there to try!  </li>
            <li>Skeptical at first to use on my sensitive face, because i use prescription products on my face, i needed a great healing lotion as well because the medications were clearing my face</li>
            <li>My skin still feels almost tight after application like it needs more moisture.</li>
            <li>I had high hope for this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t like using lotion because of the greasy feeling left on my skin, but this dries completely while keeping your skin feeling healthy and not dry.</li>
            <li>It isnt greasy and it really sooths my sensitive, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>(which, though amazing, is so thick and greasy</li>
            <li>Said it was well worth th extra money.</li>
            <li>Soaks in easily, leaving the skin soft and moisturized without feeling greasy or wet.  </li>
            <li>It is not very thick or heavy, which I think is why I love it..</li>
            <li>but it was just like any other light lotion.  </li>
            <li>It creates a barrier,is smooth and silky to apply and it feels wonderful!!I&#x27;ve recommended it to my surgeon for him to tell other patients.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the website claims it&#x27;s all you need, and to just repeatedly apply it until your natural skin barrier is restored, that is only true when the natural humidity is over 40% or so.  </li>
            <li>I live in the Midwest</li>
            <li>but the only thing that comes to mind is PURE AWESOMENESS!</li>
            <li>However, this lotion is the only one where I feel comfortable putting it on my entire body including my face.</li>
            <li>This past winter I made sure to use it twice a day and never did go through the dryness I normally do.</li>
            <li>but my skin was very soft.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and was hesitant to try it.</li>
            <li>Makes hands so soft too!</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so soft!</li>
            <li>Skin on my feet are so soft!</li>
            <li>My skin feels more resilient already - the same amount of scratching does not result in deep cuts but only surface</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think my skin has ever felt this soft and smooth from any other lotion.</li>
            <li>Also, unlike most lotions that have this feature, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hands slick.</li>
            <li>Was disappointed that this product didn&#x27;t alleviate my dry skin, as many reviewers seemed so happy with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not strong enough for winter, which is when I needed it most, and bought a whole range of hand lotions as a result.</li>
            <li>I live in FL where it is normally hot and humid, but in the winter the weather can get pretty dry and my legs especially start to itch and flake.  </li>
            <li>I have eczema on my hands and it helped clear it up.</li>
            <li>Gel type consistancy lotion that leaves your skin feeling soft and hydrated without a greasy feel to it.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s not too sensitive</li>
            <li>No parabens, almost every ingredient is natural.</li>
            <li>and it really works as a healing agent for my skin, especially my face.</li>
            <li>and it really works as a healing agent for my skin, especially my face.</li>
            <li>WOW....</li>
            <li>Thanks God I bought big (8 oz) bottle.. !!!</li>
            <li>I have been blemish free since I started using this a few weeks ago and nothing else has changed in my skin care or makeup routine.</li>
            <li>so when I noticed my hyperpigmentation spots fading I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>(The 4oz bottle was marketed as &amp;#34;enough for 3 months&amp;#34; but obviously it will depend on how much of your body is affected by eczema.)</li>
            <li>(I have naturally rosy skin)</li>
            <li>My husband uses it and swears his skin hasn&#x27;t been this soft since he was a child.  </li>
            <li>keeps my hand moisturize and soft.</li>
            <li>After bilateral mastectomy my underarms were extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve nearly tried every 5 star reviewed lotion on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I may try it out again in the summer months, because right now in the dead of winter I need something a little more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well on my dry</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only lotion I&#x27;ve used that can heal and soothe my ultra dry skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin that&#x27;s only in my Tzone and super dry on the perimeter on my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thin consistency, dries quick and super hydrated.</li>
            <li>No, it&#x27;s not cheap, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>, they had this exact size bottle at my local pharmacy for the same price as Amazon.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money, especially if you&#x27;re looking for eczema or really dry skin relief.</li>
            <li>This lotion gets right into your skin and instantly relieves cracks and dry patches.  </li>
            <li>Found it to really hydrate my dry skin</li>
            <li>My hands dry and crack in the winter without intense moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Helps with dry irritated skin really well.</li>
            <li>(this is my second winter with it, and it looks like I will get at least two more winters out of this bottle).</li>
            <li>After a few uses I put my face lotions aside and use this as my primary facial moisturizer day and night!</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, but is not greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all.</li>
            <li>I bought this lotion after reading other&#x27;s feedback but my goodness, first day I put this on my arms and legs, I could not sleep with itchness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hands are horribly dry from constant washing (jeweler and dishwasher here, so my hands really take a beating!)  </li>
            <li>Amazing stuff for anyone with troubled skin.  </li>
            <li>The packaging and initial description makes this product seem non-toxic and natural.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and non-greasy, with barely any scent.  </li>
            <li>#34;What&#x27;s in Your Purse.&amp;#34;  The moderator suffered from very dry skin and highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>It is smooth and goes on clear and a very small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li>There are other reviews that say it doesn&#x27;t moisturize very well, but the directions specifically say to use multiple times a day until your moisture level improves, and then just 1-2 times a day.</li>
            <li>First ingredient is aloe Vera, so it&#x27;s very calming/non irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s definitely worth the cost, especially because a little bit goes a really long way.</li>
            <li>I actually use this on my face because my skin is dry &amp; sensitive.</li>
            <li>This looks thin like it&#x27;s not going to moisturize, but it absorbs quickly, and feels just like soft skin, not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it to be no better than any other light</li>

            <li> This is by far THE BEST HAND LOTION for eczema !!!</li>

            <li> Glides on smoothly, almost acts like a primer for my make up!</li>
            <li> It is an ok moisturizer, she uses it for her face</li>
            <li> Glad it&#x27;s not a watery consistency either.</li>
            <li> but im sure now its more water than anything....</li>
            <li> My favorite part is that since it is a \\&quot;shielding lotion,\\&quot; I can put it on my babe&#x27;s face and his drool does not rinse it</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is just okay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> Product was recommended so wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> it feels like a layer of softness sitting on top of your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure how to describe it...</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I just happened across this at the pharmacy counter, and found better pricing through Amazon...of course ;-}</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> The light-textured moisturizer doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and I&#x27;m able to use it on face, eyes, throat, hands and body.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that this stuff is just ok.</li>
            <li> I love this miracle lotion.</li>

            <li> will buy lotion again for sure.</li>

            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion..</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much more than the cheap-y store bought brands.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> love this lotion.</li>
            <li> so I know for sure this product is not for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered more to get me through the winter.</li>
            <li> i love  that my doej skin feels likethe non-greasy  feeling.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if this lotion could be made as a cream it would have better moisturizing properties</li>
            <li> This is better than most, but not the miracle lotion some reviewers describe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Each I try to dispense an appropriate amount from the bottle, I get about 3X an appropriate amount.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Glad my friend recommended this to me and I would recommend this as well.</li>
            <li> It has a nice, clean smell and does moisturize just not the way that I need it to.</li>
            <li> Have seen many great reviews on this lotion on YouTube but cant find it in stores where I live.</li>
            <li> This lotion has single-handedly turned my skin soft and beautiful.  </li>
            <li> Excellent before makeup and works well on dry patches on legs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, soaks in quickly, and my skin feels nice.  </li>
            <li> In fact this lotion was perfect for my dry skin during my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> The best light facial moisturizer  in the world!</li>
            <li> It will NOT heal your excema but it makes it much more comfortable and manageable.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much, I use it all over my body including my face.</li>
            <li> but I have to put on a second application for it to be real effective...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It absorbs very quickly, and does not leave a scent.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> Love the clean, light feeling of this product.</li>
            <li> Hands down one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve come by.</li>
            <li> This is my first Amazon review, cause Skin MD is simply THE BEST cream</li>
            <li> and I felt fine</li>
            <li> I used this lotion during my pregnancy and it was a huge help.</li>
            <li> The fading capability is certainly a huge bonus however I&#x27;d use this product even without it.  </li>
            <li> so nice &amp; lightweight yet really does a fantastic job at moisterizing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> It is a light weight face lotion for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every available lotion and cream in stores to no avail.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non-greasy and light weight.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and does not feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li> But, the ingredients are fabulous.</li>
            <li> use DK Elan Silky Smooth body lotion</li>
            <li> So far so good...</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I really want to write a great review for this product because it really does everything it claims and it saved my skin........</li>
            <li> product was received before expected, very fast shipment also best price for amount of product!</li>
            <li> Love this product so much!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth ever penny!</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Ok, liked other lotions better.</li>
            <li> I live in a warm climate and I&#x27;m outdoors a lot.</li>
            <li> I use it every time I clean my face.</li>
            <li> Great lotion and gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It gives you a clean feeling.</li>
            <li> it feels great on the skin, but doesn&#x27;t help dry patches unless used over a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I took a show to clean this product off from my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, I love this!</li>
            <li> This makes my whole face silky smooth!</li>
            <li> also kept my legs nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with eczema all my life, and while Skin MD is no cure, after a month or so of using this, I can confidently say it really does the trick in terms of helping to keep it under control.</li>
            <li> This one is natural, moisturizing, effective, and non comedogenic.</li>
            <li> This winter I (for the first  time) had a strong attack of itchy skin.</li>
            <li> Healed the mild eczema on my legs overnight.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s mild, with a mild/almost no scent.</li>
            <li> The combination worked, not Skin MD OR Cerave/Restoraderm alone, to heal my skin really quickly.  </li>
            <li> We have been loyal Skin MD lotion customers for about 5 years or so.</li>
            <li> *side note: i have mild acne....</li>
            <li> it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t have this greasy residue.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Its not unpleasant and does feel like it&#x27;s shielding, as advertised.</li>
            <li> Its slick,easy to spread and smells good to boot!This is a first for me-to actually write up a recommendation!</li>
            <li> Works really well!!  </li>
            <li> I definitely would recommend and I did recommend Skin MD to many of my friends!</li>
            <li> First impression of smell - nothing special..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very cheap as a body lotion, but it&#x27;s very good price if using for face and neck, and hands!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like gel, not thick at all.</li>
            <li> I use it daily on my face and it reduces my redness amazingly</li>
            <li> and it calm the itchness</li>
            <li> but they rarely have it in stock.</li>
            <li> Was not as good as expected.</li>
            <li> It definitely does leave some kind of \\&quot;shield\\&quot; that you can feel--</li>
            <li> This lotion is so worth trying it feels</li>
            <li> and nightI love the fact that the one has spf 15.It keeps my sking so soft and dont have to worry about sun effects</li>
            <li> Had the smaller samples and it worked great for my sensitive skin on my face.  </li>
            <li> Use about a dimes worth of lotion for each underarm.</li>
            <li> If I manage to get an appropriate amount out of the bottle, I&#x27;m able to handle doorknobs without slipping and handle fabrics without discoloring them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> found this a nice daytime moisturizer, but doesn&#x27;t do the heavy duty repair of my favorite hand cream, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different high end primers and this is much, MUCH cheaper for equal and in most cases superior results.</li>
            <li> I have too much experience with prescription products to be persuaded by clever marketing for over the counter lotions (which this product avoids for the most part).  </li>
            <li> I apply this on my feet right after I get out of the shower</li>
            <li> On a trip to the East Coast at the end of February, with heating going full blast everywhere, I found that mid-flare, when I had already scratched my skin all raw, I had to apply Skin MD to soothe and hydrate my skin, and then apply a layer of Cerave or Restoraderm (or even better still, Atopiclair or Avene XD) on top to lock it in.</li>
            <li> The plus is that it is easy to reapply mid-day without getting your clothing all greasy, as it somehow both spreads easily and sinks in quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say maybe half that would be fair.</li>
            <li> i still have it still on my counter collecting dust, even when my hands or legs are healthy and not dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thick or sticky like others, it feels pure, light and hydrates your skin right away.</li>
            <li> Skin MD really works better than many many other big brand face cream I tried.</li>
            <li> But that was fine with me because I could put it on and it would dry very quickly</li>
            <li> On my hands, I like it very much.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in drugstores, so happy that Amazon carrys it.</li>
            <li> , I put lotion next to my bed :))</li>
            <li> its keeping my hands and feet soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I first saw this lotion on youtube.</li>
            <li> It was ok on my body as well, but will likely just use it for my hands.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Lori over 40!</li>
            <li> I was waking up every 2 hours to remoisturize the first couple of nights of my trip.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> First of all, I have combination skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light lotion that doesn&#x27;t aggravate my Sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this at first because it felt like it just disappeared without doing anything, but you have to give it a chance</li>
            <li> It also works great if you are sensitive to fragrances because it has little to no scent.</li>
            <li> We only use it on our face and hands and really don&#x27;t use much more than a pea-sized drop for each.</li>
            <li> was suffering severe eczema on my hands for a long time and now they are gone :)</li>
            <li> it coats, but yet dries pretty fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s brilliant, never greasy &amp; a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite lotion , work for my dry skin and my psoriasis</li>
            <li> After three days of applying it every couple of hours, my skin looked healthy, all the peeling was gone, and better yet, after not using any for several hours and washing my hands a few times, my skin still felt soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The formula has a gel like consistency that I love, it never feels greasy or heavy on my skin and it quickly soaks in.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say now that my acne is much less, and my face looks and feels so much</li>
            <li> not make my skin oily&lt;br /&gt;Can be applied throughout day, or over many days to resolve very dry skin</li>
            <li> They either absorbed right away and left my skin feeling just as dry, or just sat on the top of my skin leaving me slimy.  </li>
            <li> Yes, as a lot of reviewers have said, it is very watery.</li>
            <li> $20 is just too much for this.</li>
            <li> It really is like a shield.</li>
            <li> It really keeps my foundation on all day and keeps the moisture locked in.  </li>
            <li> I am 37 and still have very oily/acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion helped soo much and helped my acne scars fade that can&#x27;t be seen from a distance.</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> I definitely feels &#x27;light&#x27; on the skin.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> My makeup application is so much smoother after using this.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> The consistency is thin and watery but it works great.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need much, so</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself but didn&#x27;t use it much.</li>
            <li> Then my DH started using it and really likes it.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin very silky and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need too much.</li>
            <li> I apply it at night, and when I wake up, my skin is so much smoother.</li>
            <li> It really is medicine for the skin.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I no longer have dryness on my nose and chin, and any blemishes I may have heal much faster than they did before.  </li>
            <li> Just wish it wasn&#x27;t soooo much $$.$$</li>
            <li> once it rubs in you don&#x27;t really feel it at all</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really use during the day)</li>
            <li> I really like it- live in a hot dry area and its light non greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say, but I have super sensitive skin and an incurable skin disease, and I am really happy with the results.</li>
            <li> While the lotion is extremely light, it is extremely soothing and does seem to help restore the natural skin barrier relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li> I will repurchase this as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy and bonds to the skin quickly meaning it doesn&#x27;t rub off onto things you touch later.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by its thin consistency, it locks in your natural moisture and leaves skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> This is my third repurchase, and I never repurchase lotions with so many different kinds out there to try!  </li>
            <li> Skeptical at first to use on my sensitive face, because i use prescription products on my face, i needed a great healing lotion as well because the medications were clearing my face</li>
            <li> My skin still feels almost tight after application like it needs more moisture.</li>
            <li> I had high hope for this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t like using lotion because of the greasy feeling left on my skin, but this dries completely while keeping your skin feeling healthy and not dry.</li>
            <li> It isnt greasy and it really sooths my sensitive, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> (which, though amazing, is so thick and greasy</li>
            <li> Said it was well worth th extra money.</li>
            <li> Soaks in easily, leaving the skin soft and moisturized without feeling greasy or wet.  </li>
            <li> It is not very thick or heavy, which I think is why I love it..</li>
            <li> but it was just like any other light lotion.  </li>
            <li> It creates a barrier,is smooth and silky to apply and it feels wonderful!!I&#x27;ve recommended it to my surgeon for him to tell other patients.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the website claims it&#x27;s all you need, and to just repeatedly apply it until your natural skin barrier is restored, that is only true when the natural humidity is over 40% or so.  </li>
            <li> I live in the Midwest</li>
            <li> but the only thing that comes to mind is PURE AWESOMENESS!</li>
            <li> However, this lotion is the only one where I feel comfortable putting it on my entire body including my face.</li>
            <li> This past winter I made sure to use it twice a day and never did go through the dryness I normally do.</li>
            <li> but my skin was very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and was hesitant to try it.</li>
            <li> Makes hands so soft too!</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt so soft!</li>
            <li> Skin on my feet are so soft!</li>
            <li> My skin feels more resilient already - the same amount of scratching does not result in deep cuts but only surface</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my skin has ever felt this soft and smooth from any other lotion.</li>
            <li> Also, unlike most lotions that have this feature, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hands slick.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed that this product didn&#x27;t alleviate my dry skin, as many reviewers seemed so happy with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not strong enough for winter, which is when I needed it most, and bought a whole range of hand lotions as a result.</li>
            <li> I live in FL where it is normally hot and humid, but in the winter the weather can get pretty dry and my legs especially start to itch and flake.  </li>
            <li> I have eczema on my hands and it helped clear it up.</li>
            <li> Gel type consistancy lotion that leaves your skin feeling soft and hydrated without a greasy feel to it.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not too sensitive</li>
            <li> No parabens, almost every ingredient is natural.</li>
            <li> and it really works as a healing agent for my skin, especially my face.</li>
            <li> and it really works as a healing agent for my skin, especially my face.</li>
            <li> WOW....</li>
            <li> Thanks God I bought big (8 oz) bottle.. !!!</li>
            <li> I have been blemish free since I started using this a few weeks ago and nothing else has changed in my skin care or makeup routine.</li>
            <li> so when I noticed my hyperpigmentation spots fading I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> (The 4oz bottle was marketed as &amp;#34;enough for 3 months&amp;#34; but obviously it will depend on how much of your body is affected by eczema.)</li>
            <li> (I have naturally rosy skin)</li>
            <li> My husband uses it and swears his skin hasn&#x27;t been this soft since he was a child.  </li>
            <li> keeps my hand moisturize and soft.</li>
            <li> After bilateral mastectomy my underarms were extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve nearly tried every 5 star reviewed lotion on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I may try it out again in the summer months, because right now in the dead of winter I need something a little more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well on my dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only lotion I&#x27;ve used that can heal and soothe my ultra dry skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin that&#x27;s only in my Tzone and super dry on the perimeter on my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thin consistency, dries quick and super hydrated.</li>
            <li> No, it&#x27;s not cheap, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> , they had this exact size bottle at my local pharmacy for the same price as Amazon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money, especially if you&#x27;re looking for eczema or really dry skin relief.</li>
            <li> This lotion gets right into your skin and instantly relieves cracks and dry patches.  </li>
            <li> Found it to really hydrate my dry skin</li>
            <li> My hands dry and crack in the winter without intense moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Helps with dry irritated skin really well.</li>
            <li> (this is my second winter with it, and it looks like I will get at least two more winters out of this bottle).</li>
            <li> After a few uses I put my face lotions aside and use this as my primary facial moisturizer day and night!</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, but is not greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion after reading other&#x27;s feedback but my goodness, first day I put this on my arms and legs, I could not sleep with itchness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hands are horribly dry from constant washing (jeweler and dishwasher here, so my hands really take a beating!)  </li>
            <li> Amazing stuff for anyone with troubled skin.  </li>
            <li> The packaging and initial description makes this product seem non-toxic and natural.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and non-greasy, with barely any scent.  </li>
            <li> #34;What&#x27;s in Your Purse.&amp;#34;  The moderator suffered from very dry skin and highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> It is smooth and goes on clear and a very small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> There are other reviews that say it doesn&#x27;t moisturize very well, but the directions specifically say to use multiple times a day until your moisture level improves, and then just 1-2 times a day.</li>
            <li> First ingredient is aloe Vera, so it&#x27;s very calming/non irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s definitely worth the cost, especially because a little bit goes a really long way.</li>
            <li> I actually use this on my face because my skin is dry &amp; sensitive.</li>
            <li> This looks thin like it&#x27;s not going to moisturize, but it absorbs quickly, and feels just like soft skin, not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it to be no better than any other light</li>
            <li> I have had excema for a few years and this is the only thing that makes my skin feel normal.</li>
            <li> I do like it, but for the extra trouble to order it and a higher price that some other lotions I like, I doubt I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis, and this product actually eliminates minor outbreaks.  </li>
            <li> and it penetrates quickly into your skin leaving no greasy residue behind.</li>
            <li> You do have to apply it at least three times a day to get the maximum positive effects.</li>
            <li> so far my skin has improved a little bit.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended SkinMD Natural, and that I put it on when my skin is still a little damp after showering.  </li>
            <li> - a little goes a long way BUT not quite as far as the makers would suggest.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even enjoy wearing nail polish cause my fingers feel uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It goes a long way for me.</li>
            <li> (New purchasers may want to also buy an empty pump-style dispenser to fill with SkinMD in order to waste less)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will continue to use as long as it is on the market!</li>
            <li> My mother in law swears by this for dry hands.</li>
            <li> i was having some VERY extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I had a patch of skin on my hand that would get dry,</li>
            <li> During winters, from dry weather and heated house, the skin on my knuckles cracks and almost bleeds.</li>
            <li> , I have really dry skin on my cheeks  and my forehead, I put it on like 5 times a day.</li>
            <li> 5 minutes after I put it on, my skin get dry and itchy again.</li>
            <li> I tend to be on the dry side</li>
            <li> Works well on my dry skin</li>
            <li> SkinMD soothes my skin and reduces redness and dry patches.</li>
            <li> Our allergist suggested this lotion for my sons dry skin and excema.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and dries instantly, leaving hands moisturized and protected from the cold winter air</li>
            <li> My wife had suffered with itchy skin for  a few years and after several doctor appointments and attempts with lotions and potions; she came to the conclusion that the malady is personal.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to use solely as a face primer, but it&#x27;s definitely not your average primer.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and this is the only moisturizer that can soften my dry spots without making the rest of my face an oily mess.</li>
            <li> My skin normalized and hasn&#x27;t been dry or flakey since the day I started using this!</li>
            <li> You could reapply this lotion every hour and still feel dry and rough.</li>
            <li> They get very dry &amp; sometimes crack &amp; bleed.</li>
            <li> My hands became very dry as did</li>
            <li> recommend this lotion to women and men that are looking for a non-greasy lotion to resolve very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I bought it for eczema and mild psoriasis and the only thing that worked for those is simply cutting out processed foods!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live in Texas, so the last thing you want is a heavy thick lotion that results in just sweating it off.</li>
            <li> BUT you use so little of it that it ends up lasting forever.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin with very minimal rosacea.</li>
            <li> And after only a few applications my skin feels moist again.</li>
            <li> This lotion is really expensive but worth the money.</li>
            <li> lotion is a bit pricey but it works so well that it is money well spent</li>
            <li> Seems like an expensive product, but is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Extremely nourishing for dry, crispy,winter and summer parched skin!</li>
            <li> The bottle is very small but it does last a long time because you only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> This product is not nearly as good as the same product I got at the local drug store.  </li>
            <li> bought another bottle upon returning home, and within a few months of using it, my face had actually cleared up and calmed down.</li>
            <li> Only a small amount is required to soften and protect your skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other primers and they all break me out as well.</li>
            <li> This lotion has worked miracles on my 7-month-old&#x27;s eczema, and we&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING, including steroid creams, Aquaphor, and umpteen other lotions/creams.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit runny, so watch out when getting it out of the bottle, but other than that i like it</li>
            <li> I have purchased countless creams, gels, lotions and treatments over the past 5 years and my search is over.</li>
            <li> Tried other types of lotions but this is the one.</li>
            <li> These affects lasts for some time, but if you have any serious dry spots, those are the areas that will require repeated application on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> I think the price is a little high given the amount, but the lotion is on the thin side</li>
            <li> Not worth the price tag</li>
            <li> It really was to expensive for what it was.</li>
            <li> not sure how long we will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> But if you scroll down and look at the ingredients it is not:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started with 2 and 3 applications of MD and now I am down to one application after a shower.  </li>
            <li> Leaves a slight coating or primer on your skin.</li>
            <li> Skin still felt like it was pulling and tight.  </li>
            <li> It broke me out after a little while</li>
            <li> For the last few months I have always had at least one blemish on my face (usually around my mouth or chin)</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a little pricy</li>
            <li> I would feel so itchy and it was hard not to scratch really hard until I found this lotion at the hospital medical store.</li>
            <li> She has me order it a few times a year for her by</li>
            <li> I had been applying moisturizing lotions and creams for a few months without noticing any noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to put few times tonight again.</li>
            <li> $28 for a bottle is not cheap, and it does nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have now used this lotion a few times.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday on my face when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> So, after a few maddening nights of itching and scratching until I drew blood,  I decided to try Skin MD with the addition of evening primrose tablets.</li>
            <li> It is costly to use an 8 ounce bottle every few days.</li>
            <li> I must deduct stars accordingly, as with this amount of waste</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my face while using retin-a which normally irritates and drys my skin out like crazy..</li>
            <li> this has helped deminish it a little!</li>
            <li> All you need is a very little amount about a pea size.</li>
            <li> The lotion is very runny and I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch or</li>
            <li> My skin still felt dried plus not a nice smell.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure I can bring myself to pay $20 for it again.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will buy again.</li>
            <li> only con is that it&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t use face lotion because of my oil acne prone skin...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please buy small bottle to try out before buying the 8 oz.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m both frustrated and really not able to evaluate the whole product.</li>
            <li> Not only did it not quench my dry skin, my skin got worse!!!</li>
            <li> i randomly use it and NOTHING or even starts to go dry.</li>
            <li> I even use it on my face without experiencing any negative side effects.</li>
            <li> for the price, the small amount and how thin and watery the consistency was i had this lurking feeling it wouldnt work.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a simple sticker, it was so hard to remove it made the bottle look bad.</li>
            <li> Its lightweight but seriously hydrating.</li>
            <li> I hate to put lotion on during the day when I&#x27;m busy and then have to wait forever for it to soak in.</li>
            <li> I work in the cold half the time, working with plants, and I wash my hands a lot.</li>
            <li> Definitely does not leave a greasy base on the skin.</li>
            <li> It is a thin lotion, but it soaks in and leaves a silky feeling on the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always felt like it would make my problems worse.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting any dramatic results</li>
            <li> It has also completely cured my sons horrible eczema.</li>
            <li> was not impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li> yes , you can&#x27;t get wrong with this Skin MD</li>
            <li> It is quite expensive though so</li>
            <li> I feel like ill be using this for ever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thin and didn&#x27;t give me the moisture I need during the colder months</li>
            <li> /&gt;However the lotion is very thin, almost watery, and the container&#x27;s dispenser is very poorly designed for a lotion with this viscosity.</li>
            <li> so well they were also drying my face like crazy.</li>
            <li> I bought it and what a disappointment</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to find.</li>
            <li> but i think in this case its bad because there is nothing there.</li>
            <li> (How bad was bad?  </li>
            <li> was scratching myself so bad that evening....</li>
            <li> Ordering from Amazon though the product arrived with ugly sticker over front.  </li>
            <li> but it was awful and too expensive not to work.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am allergic to formeldehyde-based ingredients that are used in a shocking amount of skin care items.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I have psoriasis, and this product actually eliminates minor outbreaks.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but I really am impressed with this product.  I have too much experience with prescription products to be persuaded by clever marketing for over the counter lotions (which this product avoids for the most part).  My point is I would not endorse an over the counter product unless it seemed to be truly different from others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs very quickly, and does not leave a scent.  Only a small amount is required to soften and protect your skin.  Will it make a difference for you?  I can&#x27;t say, but I have super sensitive skin and an incurable skin disease, and I am really happy with the results.</li>
            <li> My skin still felt dried plus not a nice smell.</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter love this lotion.  They say it&#x27;s the best they&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> My mother in law swears by this for dry hands. She has me order it a few times a year for her by she lives abroad and can&#x27;t get it. I&#x27;m ordering some for myself next time.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! I live in a warm climate and I&#x27;m outdoors a lot. I had some heat rash issues I could not seem to find a solution for despite trying an assortment of zinc ointments, barrier creams, and powders. This product was recommended my my dermatologist and has made all my skin problems a memory. It is smooth and goes on clear and a very small amount goes a long way. God bless the person/people who came up with this!</li>
            <li> Love this product so much! It&#x27;s the only lotion I&#x27;ve used that can heal and soothe my ultra dry skin quickly.  Healed the mild eczema on my legs overnight.  I&#x27;m never without this product.  The formula has a gel like consistency that I love, it never feels greasy or heavy on my skin and it quickly soaks in.</li>
            <li> Ordered if from my local pharmacy . It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> I heard about this moisturizer from a youtube beauty guru.  This is perfect for those with oily, combination skin.  Glides on smoothly, almost acts like a primer for my make up!</li>
            <li> Good Product quality. Gel type consistancy lotion that leaves your skin feeling soft and hydrated without a greasy feel to it.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion to control eczema!  Have tried to get this from local pharmacies but they rarely have it in stock.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after Tiffany D recommended this on her Youtube videos and blog. I had high hope for this product. It is an ok moisturizer, she uses it for her face and so that&#x27;s what I did. It broke me out after a little while but my skin was very soft. It didn&#x27;t moisturize all that great though. Maybe if you have oily skin that&#x27;s not too sensitive this would work for you.</li>
            <li> Was not as good as expected.</li>
            <li> Found it to really hydrate my dry skin&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend to family and friends</li>
            <li> This lotion worked well for me. I have eczema on my hands and it helped clear it up. Yes, as a lot of reviewers have said, it is very watery. But that was fine with me because I could put it on and it would dry very quickly and I could go about my business. I hate to put lotion on during the day when I&#x27;m busy and then have to wait forever for it to soak in. This lotion has a nice smell and a nice silky feel on your skin. The only reason I took a star off of my review was because I feel it is way overpriced. $20 is just too much for this. I&#x27;d say maybe half that would be fair. Amazon is not jacking up the price though, they had this exact size bottle at my local pharmacy for the same price as Amazon. Oh well, if it works it works but I&#x27;m not sure I can bring myself to pay $20 for it again. My search for an effective and fairly priced lotion for eczema continues.</li>
            <li> I used this lotion during my pregnancy and it was a huge help. I would feel so itchy and it was hard not to scratch really hard until I found this lotion at the hospital medical store. It helps instantly, what a relief. Its lightweight but seriously hydrating. A+++ will always recommend to ANYONE for use. Makes hands so soft too!</li>
            <li> This is great!Moisturizers I use on my face always break me out.This doesn&#x27;t.Glad it&#x27;s not a watery consistency either.It really is like a shield.I can use it as a primer under my makeup.I&#x27;ve tried other primers and they all break me out as well.I have very fair sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> i was having some VERY extremely dry skin. after lots of searching, recommendation and reading reviews i thought id try this. Not only did it not quench my dry skin, my skin got worse!!! for the price, the small amount and how thin and watery the consistency was i had this lurking feeling it wouldnt work. i still have it still on my counter collecting dust, even when my hands or legs are healthy and not dry i randomly use it and NOTHING or even starts to go dry. People comment it doesnt leave a residue which i agree but i think in this case its bad because there is nothing there. i haven&#x27;t re-read the ingredients but im sure now its more water than anything....</li>
            <li> This product has been great for my skin. I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement with my dry skin. Very happy purchase.</li>
            <li> Best face moisturizer, makeup primer in one!  It really keeps my foundation on all day and keeps the moisture locked in.  This was my third bottle of this miracle worker!  Hard to find in drugstores, so happy that Amazon carrys it.</li>
            <li> This lotion has worked miracles on my 7-month-old&#x27;s eczema, and we&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING, including steroid creams, Aquaphor, and umpteen other lotions/creams. My favorite part is that since it is a \\&quot;shielding lotion,\\&quot; I can put it on my babe&#x27;s face and his drool does not rinse it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s definitely worth the cost, especially because a little bit goes a really long way. I see this 8 ounce bottle lasting us several months, even considering that I put it on him multiple times a day.</li>
            <li> This product seems to do what it claims. It&#x27;s not thick or sticky like others, it feels pure, light and hydrates your skin right away.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is just okay. It&#x27;s very thin and didn&#x27;t give me the moisture I need during the colder months and I didn&#x27;t care for how it performed under my makeup. I&#x27;ll use it up as a hand lotion but I won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion after reading good reviews.  It is a bit pricey and was no where in my city at a Walgreens.  I do like it, but for the extra trouble to order it and a higher price that some other lotions I like, I doubt I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am 37 and still have very oily/acne prone skin. My husband and I were in Jackson Hole on a ski trip, and I forgot my face moisturizer at home. I stumbled upon this at the store, and bought it just because I needed something for the weekend. What a miraculous discovery! My face survived the wind and chill and sunshine that the slopes had to offer all weekend. Not only is it NOT greasy, you can apply it multiple times a day, and you can actually feel it healing and calming inflamed skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought another bottle upon returning home, and within a few months of using it, my face had actually cleared up and calmed down. I can honestly say now that my acne is much less, and my face looks and feels so much healthier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence about trying this - spend the $20 to try it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This lotion is great. No parabens, almost every ingredient is natural. This lotion helped soo much and helped my acne scars fade that can&#x27;t be seen from a distance. I had a great experience with this lotion but I&#x27;d say that the Spf version of this lotion tops this one</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference except my skin was itchy and I had to apply my regular lotion over it.  Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK. I won&#x27;t be repurchasing. I definitely feels &#x27;light&#x27; on the skin. I can put it on my hands and they don&#x27;t feel too greasy afterwards. I just don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s moisturizing enough.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion to my core! This is maybe the 3rd time I&#x27;ve ordered it. I use it for my face multiple times a day or just before my makeup. It is not very thick or heavy, which I think is why I love it.. It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky. I live in Texas, so the last thing you want is a heavy thick lotion that results in just sweating it off. There are other reviews that say it doesn&#x27;t moisturize very well, but the directions specifically say to use multiple times a day until your moisture level improves, and then just 1-2 times a day. Which does give perfect results!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and I&#x27;ve used the product for years and it really works as a healing agent for my skin, especially my face.</li>
            <li> Product was recommended so wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. Great moisturizer with healing benefits. Leaves a slight coating or primer on your skin. Excellent before makeup and works well on dry patches on legs. Will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on the recommendation of Makeup by TiffanyD on youtube. This is by far the best lotion I have ever tried. Will continue to use as long as it is on the market!</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t like using lotion because of the greasy feeling left on my skin, but this dries completely while keeping your skin feeling healthy and not dry. It definitely does leave some kind of \\&quot;shield\\&quot; that you can feel-- it feels like a layer of softness sitting on top of your skin. I&#x27;m not quite sure how to describe it... but it is amazing. My skin has never felt so soft!</li>
            <li> I had a patch of skin on my hand that would get dry, crack, heal and then the cycle would start all over again. I had been applying moisturizing lotions and creams for a few months without noticing any noticeable improvement. I ordered Skin M.D. shielding lotion from Amazon and have been applying it three times a day for 1-2 months and have noticed a great improvement. I no longer experience the itchiness and pain that I had been experiencing before. It&#x27;s not an overnight solution, although I felt instant relief the moment I put it on. It isn&#x27;t greasy and bonds to the skin quickly meaning it doesn&#x27;t rub off onto things you touch later.</li>
            <li> Definitely does not leave a greasy base on the skin.I really liked this product.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It absorbs quickly, but is not greasy or heavy. My skin feels hydrated and I am in the sun a lot with a pool. I just happened across this at the pharmacy counter, and found better pricing through Amazon...of course ;-}</li>
            <li> was not impressed with this product.  I had heard great things but it was just like any other light lotion.  Not worth the price tag</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a great moisturizer. This one is perfect!! I have combination skin that&#x27;s only in my Tzone and super dry on the perimeter on my face. This makes my whole face silky smooth! I also use it on my neck and forearms where I get eczema and it makes it go away. My makeup application is so much smoother after using this. I hope this product never gets discontinued!</li>
            <li> I had used this product before, but the store I purchased it at stopped carrying it. I was so glad when I seen it on Amazon !!! You guys have everything !! By the way its a great product !</li>
            <li> During winters, from dry weather and heated house, the skin on my knuckles cracks and almost bleeds. This cream is a huge help!! It does not smell and does not leave my fingers/hands all greasy. And after only a few applications my skin feels moist again. Definitely recommend and will buy again when I run out of it (this is my second winter with it, and it looks like I will get at least two more winters out of this bottle).</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and I&#x27;ve used the product for years and it really works as a healing agent for my skin, especially my face.</li>
            <li> Have seen many great reviews on this lotion on YouTube but cant find it in stores where I live. It is a light weight face lotion for me. Doesn&#x27;t clog pores, feels amazing, very good under makeup as it dries fast. I love it.</li>
            <li> Been using this lotion for years and am very happy with the results.  The light-textured moisturizer doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and I&#x27;m able to use it on face, eyes, throat, hands and body.  No need to purchase separate moisturizing products--just this one!</li>
            <li> The best light facial moisturizer  in the world! I wish I could buy it locally. I use it every time I clean my face.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading all the great reviews. After I used it on my hands for a few days they became very chapped. I had my husband try it and his hands became chapped also after using it. The lotion is very runny and I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch or what but it was awful and too expensive not to work. So dissappointed.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any benefits of this product. I bought it for eczema and mild psoriasis and the only thing that worked for those is simply cutting out processed foods!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t bother, just change your diet!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite lotion , work for my dry skin and my psoriasis yes , you can&#x27;t get wrong with this Skin MD</li>
            <li> I am a stay-at-home mom, which means for years I have had to deal with washing, cleaning, cooking which plays havoc with the skin on my hands.  I&#x27;ve tried every available lotion and cream in stores to no avail.  They either absorbed right away and left my skin feeling just as dry, or just sat on the top of my skin leaving me slimy.  In anticipation of the holiday season (where my skin splits and bleeds from doing my extensive outdoor Xmas lights) I began using Gloves in a Bottle to create a barrier between my hands and external irritants but even with reapplying every 3-4 hours, my skin still starting peeling when I began my Xmas lights.  I read the reviews for Skin MD and thought, &amp;#34;Why not?&amp;#34;  After three days of applying it every couple of hours, my skin looked healthy, all the peeling was gone, and better yet, after not using any for several hours and washing my hands a few times, my skin still felt soft and smooth.  This looks thin like it&#x27;s not going to moisturize, but it absorbs quickly, and feels just like soft skin, not greasy at all.  At night after this absorbs, I like to follow with Honey Guy waterblocker skin cream.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this stuff is just ok. I tried to use this as a facial moisturizer for my oily/combination skin. I may try it out again in the summer months, because right now in the dead of winter I need something a little more moisturizing. This stuff is very light, almost gel like. It has a nice, clean smell and does moisturize just not the way that I need it to. My skin still feels almost tight after application like it needs more moisture.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see the hype...didn&#x27;t see results.</li>
            <li> If you have excema you NEED this product. It&#x27;s not filmy like some of the reviews suggest. I have had excema for a few years and this is the only thing that makes my skin feel normal. It will NOT heal your excema but it makes it much more comfortable and manageable.</li>
            <li> WOW.... I love this miracle lotion. Skeptical at first to use on my sensitive face, because i use prescription products on my face, i needed a great healing lotion as well because the medications were clearing my face so well they were also drying my face like crazy. My skin really needed help &amp; so like many I heard of this lotion, tried it , &amp; loved it! This lotion was my help and so much more! I do believe it has helped with the healing of my  hyperpigmentation &amp; scarring that i was left with on my face. This lotion is so worth trying it feels awesome applying, gel-like and light and it penetrates quickly into your skin leaving no greasy residue behind.</li>
            <li> Ok, liked other lotions better.</li>
            <li> This is an expensive.....moisturizing lotion.  You do have to apply it at least three times a day to get the maximum positive effects. It makes an immediate positive&lt;br /&gt;appearance to the skin.  These affects lasts for some time, but if you have any serious dry spots, those are the areas that will require repeated application on a daily basis.  We suggest getting the 8 ounce bottle, because of the price.</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE this lotion. I use it on my face morning and night. At night, I still like to wear night cream on top of the Skin MD. It moisturizes without the greasy feeling. This is also a great makeup primer! Will definitely re-purchase when I run out!</li>
            <li> Will repurchase again and again. I make everyone touch my hands. I work in the cold half the time, working with plants, and I wash my hands a lot. It&#x27;s amazing my hands aren&#x27;t cracking and it&#x27;s December.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my face and it&#x27;s definitely helped improve my skin texture and eliminated my need to wear a makeup primer.</li>
            <li> Love this product. My skin felt great after the first use and continues to improve! I will be permanently switching to this lotion from now on.</li>
            <li> Works really well!!  My hands are horribly dry from constant washing (jeweler and dishwasher here, so my hands really take a beating!)  This lotion gets right into your skin and instantly relieves cracks and dry patches.  Make sure to use on a consistent basis for best results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very cheap as a body lotion, but it&#x27;s very good price if using for face and neck, and hands!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like gel, not thick at all. First impression of smell - nothing special.. but after you put it on, skin smells very nice! It absorbs very quickly. Yesterday night when I received it , I applied it like 3-4 times. Once every 2 hours, I don&#x27;t know why I took it with me when I went to sleep, I put lotion next to my bed :))&lt;br /&gt;Today I haven&#x27;t used it yet. Skin on my feet are so soft! It was disaster before. I&#x27;m going to put few times tonight again. And I couldn&#x27;t decide what lotion to buy for my neck (i&#x27;m almost 30), this is perfect!! Ingredients are awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy lotion again for sure. Thanks God I bought big (8 oz) bottle.. !!!</li>
            <li> So far so good... its keeping my hands and feet soft and smooth. I apply this on my feet right after I get out of the shower then I put on my socks to lock in the moisture. I also been applying it on my face as a moisturizer. And I have not seen any adverse reaction. This is perfect of the winter months to lock in the skins moisture. All you need is a very little amount about a pea size.</li>
            <li> For the last few months I have always had at least one blemish on my face (usually around my mouth or chin) I have combination skin and was in search of a really good face lotion. I ordered this after watching MakeupbyTiffanyD talk about it (I have been watching her channel ever since she started) and I decided to buy this. I have been blemish free since I started using this a few weeks ago and nothing else has changed in my skin care or makeup routine. Great product! My skin is softer and more even. And I have also been using this on a recent scar and I has helped healing it as well. Definitely will repurchase!!!</li>
            <li> with psorasis on my hands and working as a RN this lotion was great barrier and kept moisture in. also kept my legs nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I got this for someone to try who has psoriasis, it seems to help with alleviating the problem. I used to get this locally but no one carries it around here anymore.</li>
            <li> This is by far THE BEST HAND LOTION for eczema !!!&lt;br /&gt;I was suffering severe eczema on my hands for a long time and now they are gone :)</li>
            <li> Was disappointed that this product didn&#x27;t alleviate my dry skin, as many reviewers seemed so happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it to be no better than any other light moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s mild, with a mild/almost no scent. This is an advantage.</li>
            <li> The packaging and initial description makes this product seem non-toxic and natural. But if you scroll down and look at the ingredients it is not:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purified Water (Aqua), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract (Aloe Vera), Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Methyl Gluceth-20, Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Arnica Montana Flower Extract (Arnica), Symphytum Officinale Leaf Extract (Comfrey), Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Extract (Chamomile), Achillea Millefolium Extract (Yarrow), Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, 1,2 Hexanediol, Caprylyl Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Aminomethyl Propanol, Phenoxyethanol</li>
            <li> I heard a lot of good reviews about this product, also Makeupbytiffany recommended it. I bought it and what a disappointment, I have really dry skin on my cheeks  and my forehead, I put it on like 5 times a day. 5 minutes after I put it on, my skin get dry and itchy again. $28 for a bottle is not cheap, and it does nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> product was received before expected, very fast shipment also best price for amount of product! I will be repurchasing as needed in the future</li>
            <li> Great lotion and gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> morning noon and nightI love the fact that the one has spf 15.It keeps my sking so soft and dont have to worry about sun effects</li>
            <li> This product is not nearly as good as the same product I got at the local drug store.  They must have changed the formula.</li>
            <li> This lotion is AMAZING! I bought it to use solely as a face primer, but it&#x27;s definitely not your average primer. I&#x27;ve tried many different high end primers and this is much, MUCH cheaper for equal and in most cases superior results. Makes your skin so smooth, perfect for before makeup application. After a few uses I put my face lotions aside and use this as my primary facial moisturizer day and night! It&#x27;s non-greasy and light weight.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by its thin consistency, it locks in your natural moisture and leaves skin feeling great. I wasn&#x27;t expecting any dramatic results so when I noticed my hyperpigmentation spots fading I was pleasantly surprised. I also find I no longer have a use for under eye concealer.  The fading capability is certainly a huge bonus however I&#x27;d use this product even without it.  Already have my mother and friends using this product and everyone loves it! Start using it now you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion to use for the face !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This product does not make my already oily face oilier, and provides the perfect moisture level</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a colorist in a spa and my hands are in water constantly. They get very dry &amp; sometimes crack &amp; bleed. This lotion has saved my hands. I loved it so much, I use it all over my body including my face. It&#x27;s brilliant, never greasy &amp; a little goes a long way. Definitely worth ever penny!</li>
            <li> we love this lotion..this is the only lotion that works on my daughter&#x27;s eczema. The consistency is thin and watery but it works great. The bottle is very small but it does last a long time because you only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> so nice &amp; lightweight yet really does a fantastic job at moisterizing. Perfect for children and adults.&lt;br /&gt;We use it on our entire family hands and face. GREAT product</li>
            <li> I first saw this lotion on youtube. This lotion is really expensive but worth the money. It goes on smooth and does not feel greasy at all. I have very sensitive skin and was hesitant to try it. I am very happy with the results and will repurchase this product</li>
            <li> I have now used this lotion a few times.  On my hands, body, and face.  I tend to be on the dry side and this didn&#x27;t work for my face.  Skin still felt like it was pulling and tight.  On my hands, I like it very much.  It&#x27;s not greasy, soaks in quickly, and my skin feels nice.  But nothing spectacular.  I guess it&#x27;s because, according to the bottle, you are supposed to use it multiple times a day until you reach your desired level of moisture.  It was ok on my body as well, but will likely just use it for my hands.  I think the price is a little high given the amount, but the lotion is on the thin side and you don&#x27;t need much, so maybe it will last longer than I expect it will.  Not sure if I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I will disclose that I was sent a bottle for review, and have since purchased bottles of my own. My tester bottle was 4oz and lasted about 8 months. In fact this lotion was perfect for my dry skin during my pregnancy. My hands became very dry as did my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Love:&lt;br /&gt;Does not make my skin oily&lt;br /&gt;Can be applied throughout day, or over many days to resolve very dry skin&lt;br /&gt;Scent Free&lt;br /&gt;Does Not Cause Me to Break Out&lt;br /&gt;Feels like a glove that provides protection for hours&lt;br /&gt;Instantly softens skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Dislike&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is a bit pricey but it works so well that it is money well spent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this lotion to women and men that are looking for a non-greasy lotion to resolve very dry skin. It also works great if you are sensitive to fragrances because it has little to no scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thin consistency, dries quick and super hydrated. I use it on my body and face! It works pretty well on my dry hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that it&#x27;s expensive and I can only find it online.</li>
            <li> Excellent product not greasy and not smelly! Does not clog pours and great for face and body.Thanks Lori over 40!</li>
            <li> I will not buy this again. But, the ingredients are fabulous. I saw this on Youtube. It&#x27;s not a cure-all, but I use it on my neck and face after needling. It doesn&#x27;t break me out. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money, especially if you&#x27;re looking for eczema or really dry skin relief.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with eczema all my life, and while Skin MD is no cure, after a month or so of using this, I can confidently say it really does the trick in terms of helping to keep it under control. While the lotion is extremely light, it is extremely soothing and does seem to help restore the natural skin barrier relatively quickly.  My skin feels more resilient already - the same amount of scratching does not result in deep cuts but only surface scrapes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the website claims it&#x27;s all you need, and to just repeatedly apply it until your natural skin barrier is restored, that is only true when the natural humidity is over 40% or so.  On a trip to the East Coast at the end of February, with heating going full blast everywhere, I found that mid-flare, when I had already scratched my skin all raw, I had to apply Skin MD to soothe and hydrate my skin, and then apply a layer of Cerave or Restoraderm (or even better still, Atopiclair or Avene XD) on top to lock it in. The combination worked, not Skin MD OR Cerave/Restoraderm alone, to heal my skin really quickly.  (How bad was bad?  I was waking up every 2 hours to remoisturize the first couple of nights of my trip.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;m back in a humid environment, one or two applications a day is sufficient.  It works out to a similar price per use as Restoraderm or Cerave - a little goes a long way BUT not quite as far as the makers would suggest. (The 4oz bottle was marketed as &amp;#34;enough for 3 months&amp;#34; but obviously it will depend on how much of your body is affected by eczema.) As another reviewer pointed out, it feels like a makeup primer, no doubt because of the use of silicones.  The plus is that it is easy to reapply mid-day without getting your clothing all greasy, as it somehow both spreads easily and sinks in quickly.</li>
            <li> Nice lotion for the price. Doesn&#x27;t leave skin oily or feeling gross. It gives you a clean feeling. I recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by a YouTube video showcasing &amp;#34;What&#x27;s in Your Purse.&amp;#34;  The moderator suffered from very dry skin and highly recommended.  This is a very good lotion, but it is very liquidy.  I prefer a thicker lotion.  It really was to expensive for what it was.</li>
            <li> Works well on my dry skin</li>
            <li> this is definitely a shielding lotion, NOT a moisturizer. it feels great on the skin, but doesn&#x27;t help dry patches unless used over a moisturizer. it&#x27;s a bit runny, so watch out when getting it out of the bottle, but other than that i like it</li>
            <li> I live in the Midwest so I need a heavier cream in the winter (my favorite is Yu-Be that I get on Amazon) but this is a perfect lightweight moisturizer for summertime. I wear it under my makeup and my skin stays hydrated all day! Love the clean, light feeling of this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself but didn&#x27;t use it much. Then my DH started using it and really likes it. It is quite expensive though so not sure how long we will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this by a youtube beauty guru (makeupbytiffanyd) and it is truly amazing. I am allergic to formeldehyde-based ingredients that are used in a shocking amount of skin care items. This one is natural, moisturizing, effective, and non comedogenic. Thank you Skin MD!</li>
            <li> This lotion has solved many problems I had with my skin.  I have been using it on my face and my skin has never been this good.  I am in my mid 20s and have struggled to find any product that kept my skin moisturized.  I also have acne from time to time and since using this lotion it has gone away.  I found out about this product because I purchased an obscure product in London that worked wonders for my skin and couldn&#x27;t get it in the US.  I looked up the ingredients in that gel, and found that it matched the ingredients of this product.  I have purchased countless creams, gels, lotions and treatments over the past 5 years and my search is over.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and this cream is great! Will re- purchase. The cream is very gentle and not overly creamy or greasy, so it&#x27;s perfect for the face and neck.</li>
            <li> This is my first Amazon review, cause Skin MD is simply THE BEST cream I ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on face,hand,body, yes everywhere. It&#x27;s not like I do this all the time...Skin MD really works better than many many other big brand face cream I tried. This seemingly body-cream thing actually heals my acne scars and hyperpigmentation faster than those revitalizing/whitening serum. I got to know Skin MD from a Youtube beauty guru, she use it on her face too! I definitely would recommend and I did recommend Skin MD to many of my friends!</li>
            <li> Seems like an expensive product, but is worth every penny. I use it daily on my face and it reduces my redness amazingly (I have naturally rosy skin)</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It moisturizes and protects the skin without feeling greasy. I actually use this on my face because my skin is dry &amp; sensitive. It&#x27;s brilliant. I will repurchase this as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my face while using retin-a which normally irritates and drys my skin out like crazy.. My skin normalized and hasn&#x27;t been dry or flakey since the day I started using this! It has also completely cured my sons horrible eczema. I love this lotion.. I will never go back!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It&#x27;s very difficult to find. I use it on my face, hands, body...anywhere. I use it everyday on my face when I get out of the shower. Makes my skin very silky and not greasy at all. It acts as a primer under my makeup too. My boyfriend also uses this on his face and hands, he doesn&#x27;t like using lotion a lot but doesn&#x27;t mind this because it&#x27;s not greasy. It is a thin lotion, but it soaks in and leaves a silky feeling on the skin. Also contains no parabens which is very important to me.</li>
            <li> Hands down one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve come by. My skin despises any kind of moisturizer, it feels &amp;#34;suffocated&amp;#34; for lack of a better work. I can&#x27;t even enjoy wearing nail polish cause my fingers feel uncomfortable. However, this lotion is the only one where I feel comfortable putting it on my entire body including my face. Especially helpful in winter.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much more than the cheap-y store bought brands.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff for anyone with troubled skin.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> one of the  best hand creams i have ever used. it coats, but yet dries pretty fast. you don&#x27;t need too much. great seller, fast shipping, good price. thanks!</li>
            <li> I had never heard of the product before until a UTube personality suggested giving it a try. I really like it- live in a hot dry area and its light non greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product especially for summer!&lt;br /&gt;Rajean</li>
            <li> First of all, I have combination skin. This moisturizer is hydrating (without being greasy) and smoothing. I apply it at night, and when I wake up, my skin is so much smoother. I have acne prone skin, and it doesn&#x27;t break me out. First ingredient is aloe Vera, so it&#x27;s very calming/non irritating to the skin. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It really is medicine for the skin.  Soaks in easily, leaving the skin soft and moisturized without feeling greasy or wet.  I use it on my face and around my eyes.  When I travel this is the ONE lotion that I MUST HAVE with me.  My husband uses it and swears his skin hasn&#x27;t been this soft since he was a child.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> We have been loyal Skin MD lotion customers for about 5 years or so. We tried it on a whim several years back and we were sold instantly. No, it&#x27;s not cheap, but it&#x27;s worth it! This is the best lotion we&#x27;ve ever used. You will only use a tiny amount, so it lasts a while. We only use it on our face and hands and really don&#x27;t use much more than a pea-sized drop for each. It doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy, which is a nice plus. I don&#x27;t think my skin has ever felt this soft and smooth from any other lotion. This is the best price I&#x27;ve found, so this will be our source from now on.</li>
            <li> It does go on lite but I have to put on a second application for it to be real effective...</li>
            <li> Just bought this bigger size now.  Had the smaller samples and it worked great for my sensitive skin on my face.  It goes a long way for me. It&#x27;s a light lotion that doesn&#x27;t aggravate my Sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and this is the only moisturizer that can soften my dry spots without making the rest of my face an oily mess. It absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy at all. I feel like my pores can actually breathe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s a little pricy BUT you use so little of it that it ends up lasting forever. I go through one bottle a year. No joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is holy grail for me. I will never use another moisturizer again. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is the cream my gf wanted and she is very satisfied with it. I got it for her to make her happy. So far so good.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it all over for my hands body and face! It isnt greasy and it really sooths my sensitive, acne prone skin. If you are on the fence about it definitely go for it. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t use face lotion because of my oil acne prone skin... I&#x27;ve always felt like it would make my problems worse. So far, I love this! My face is softer, soothed and not oily AT ALL!  I hope they never discontinue this product.... I feel like ill be using this for ever.</li>
            <li> great product. its moisturizing, but not oily, and wont make you break out!!! i mix it with my toner to create a kind of serum...so far my skin has improved a little bit. *side note: i have mild acne....this has helped deminish it a little!</li>
            <li> love this lotion. keeps my hand moisturize and soft. it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t have this greasy residue. great if you work in an office and handle paper often.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion after reading other&#x27;s feedback but my goodness, first day I put this on my arms and legs, I could not sleep with itchness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was scratching myself so bad that evening....I took a show to clean this product off from my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave my bottle to my sister who had the same reaction so I know for sure this product is not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use DK Elan Silky Smooth body lotion and it calm the itchness and I felt fine almost immediatly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please buy small bottle to try out before buying the 8 oz.  What a wast of money...</li>
            <li> This lotion has single-handedly turned my skin soft and beautiful.  I apply it every night after I remove my makeup and it has been a life changer!  I no longer have dryness on my nose and chin, and any blemishes I may have heal much faster than they did before.  This is my third repurchase, and I never repurchase lotions with so many different kinds out there to try!  This is a must have.</li>
            <li> This winter I (for the first  time) had a strong attack of itchy skin. My wife had suffered with itchy skin for  a few years and after several doctor appointments and attempts with lotions and potions; she came to the conclusion that the malady is personal.  What works for one may not work for another.  So, after a few maddening nights of itching and scratching until I drew blood,  I decided to try Skin MD with the addition of evening primrose tablets. This seems to work for me.  I started with 2 and 3 applications of MD and now I am down to one application after a shower.  I&#x27;d say 80-90% of the itching is gone. One 8oz bottle lasted about a month.  I&#x27;ve ordered more to get me through the winter.</li>
            <li> Extremely nourishing for dry, crispy,winter and summer parched skin! i love  that my doej skin feels likethe non-greasy  feeling. Just wish it wasn&#x27;t soooo much $$.$$</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin with very minimal rosacea. SkinMD soothes my skin and reduces redness and dry patches. This is the best moisturizer I have found. I even use it on my face without experiencing any negative side effects.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product as a daytime moisturizer for a week now, based off of a recommendation and its the best! My skin has never been softer and did not make my face oily/greasy, which is a concern for me since I have oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;Did not break me out either. I have received complements on my complexion as well. I would recommend this to anyone. Absorbs quickly and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Our allergist suggested this lotion for my sons dry skin and excema. it has helped somewhat but does not moisturize at all. You could reapply this lotion every hour and still feel dry and rough. It is costly to use an 8 ounce bottle every few days. Perhaps if this lotion could be made as a cream it would have better moisturizing properties</li>
            <li> The product is great, I have bought it many times.  Ordering from Amazon though the product arrived with ugly sticker over front.  It wasn&#x27;t a simple sticker, it was so hard to remove it made the bottle look bad.</li>
            <li> I was not a fan of this.  I didn&#x27;t like the consistency (watery feeling, not creamy) and I didn&#x27;t feel it worked as it stated it does.</li>
            <li> This is something I can&#x27;t find in the town I just moved to. My husband uses it every day, and, thankfully, I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have found for keeping my hands and legs soft.  It is lightweight and non-greasy, with barely any scent.  They call it a \\&quot;shielding\\&quot; lotion and it does feel different from traditional lotions in that once it rubs in you don&#x27;t really feel it at all (like it doesn&#x27;t coat your skin or feel like you have any lotion on).  I didn&#x27;t like this at first because it felt like it just disappeared without doing anything, but you have to give it a chance and if you use it regularly it works!  I live in FL where it is normally hot and humid, but in the winter the weather can get pretty dry and my legs especially start to itch and flake.  My dermatologist recommended SkinMD Natural, and that I put it on when my skin is still a little damp after showering.  This past winter I made sure to use it twice a day and never did go through the dryness I normally do.</li>
            <li> After bilateral mastectomy my underarms were extremely sensitive.Even the seams from my t-shirts hurt.I started using Skin MD and I couldn&#x27;t beleive the relief I felt.Still can&#x27;t use deodorant but with this lotion I don&#x27;t need it.It creates a barrier,is smooth and silky to apply and it feels wonderful!!I&#x27;ve recommended it to my surgeon for him to tell other patients.Had never heard of this lotion before.When I went to store to buy some lotion, pharmacist recommended this product.Said it was well worth th extra money.He wasn&#x27;t kidding! Use about a dimes worth of lotion for each underarm.Its slick,easy to spread and smells good to boot!This is a first for me-to actually write up a recommendation!</li>
            <li> My hands dry and crack in the winter without intense moisturizing. I think I&#x27;ve nearly tried every 5 star reviewed lotion on Amazon. This is better than most, but not the miracle lotion some reviewers describe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion does leave a residue you can feel. Its not unpleasant and does feel like it&#x27;s shielding, as advertised. Also, unlike most lotions that have this feature, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hands slick. If I manage to get an appropriate amount out of the bottle, I&#x27;m able to handle doorknobs without slipping and handle fabrics without discoloring them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the lotion is very thin, almost watery, and the container&#x27;s dispenser is very poorly designed for a lotion with this viscosity. Each I try to dispense an appropriate amount from the bottle, I get about 3X an appropriate amount. I must deduct stars accordingly, as with this amount of waste I&#x27;m both frustrated and really not able to evaluate the whole product. At More than $2.50 per ounce, this amount of over-dispensing is expensive and not acceptable. (New purchasers may want to also buy an empty pump-style dispenser to fill with SkinMD in order to waste less)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this a nice daytime moisturizer, but doesn&#x27;t do the heavy duty repair of my favorite hand cream, [[ASIN:B000HHO7VE Corona Ointment 14 oz., jar]] (which, though amazing, is so thick and greasy I can&#x27;t really use during the day)</li>
            <li> Love this product. It goes on smoothly and dries instantly, leaving hands moisturized and protected from the cold winter air</li>
            <li> I really want to write a great review for this product because it really does everything it claims and it saved my skin........but the only thing that comes to mind is PURE AWESOMENESS!</li>
            <li> Helps with dry irritated skin really well. Tried other types of lotions but this is the one. Glad my friend recommended this to me and I would recommend this as well.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough for winter, which is when I needed it most, and bought a whole range of hand lotions as a result. After application, I could still see and feel dryness. I kind of forgot I had it and stopped using it.</li>
