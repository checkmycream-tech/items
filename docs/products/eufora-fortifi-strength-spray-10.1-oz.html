            <li>Finding a deal here was great as we all know good products can be pricey.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and have loved it.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t care what they call it, it&#x27;s GREAT!</li>
            <li>Nothing more can be said about a great product that smells good and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t love it</li>
            <li>item arrived quickly….could have had slightly better packaging but wasn&#x27;t damaged when i got it.</li>
            <li>After using this product, my hair has become so healthy and manageable.  </li>
            <li>It keeps hair from drying out and splitting with hair dryer use, while giving it healthy texture.  </li>
            <li>but soooo worth it!!</li>
            <li>A great productt and a very convenient, economical way to buy it!</li>
            <li>It really helps reverse some of the damage and also smells really good.  </li>
            <li>The Eufora fortifi strengthening spray was originally introduced to me by my hairdresser.</li>
            <li>Amazon cost is so much more reasonable than the salon, too.</li>
            <li>I loved it immediately for the extra body it gave my hair</li>
            <li>After years of abuse through color, I finally have shiny, healthy hair again!  </li>
            <li>This is worth the investment.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to have my healthy hair back!</li>
            <li>i cant imagine that this was the right product as they used ti on me in the salon</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted; exactly what I order; exactly what was delivered...in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li>I just love my fortify spray especially since we now have well water.</li>
            <li>It is not too heavy and keeps hair soft and helps prevent fly aways.</li>
            <li>My hair was thinning due to extensions, this product brought back my hair to a growing healthy state!!  </li>
            <li>Even my hairdresser cannot get over how much thicker my hair is.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>it made my hair very unmanagable.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years along with other Eufora products.this is one of my favorites in the line, but I have had a significant problem with the way the sprayer/applicator works on the last 4or5orders received.  </li>
            <li>and it tends to dry out easily.  </li>
            <li>Plus, on Amazon I was able to buy it for considerably less.  </li>
            <li>I buy several at a time to ensure that I don&#x27;t run out and transfer some to smaller &#x27;airline appropriate&#x27; spray containers when I travel.</li>
            <li>Eufora Fortify &amp; Strengthen spray breathes new life into my weary hair.</li>
            <li>after about a month of using it I wondered how I would ever live with out it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this only happened to me, but I purchased this product because I am an avid eufora user.</li>
            <li>And if need be i can live with just walking out the door and messing with it later.</li>
            <li>It just won&#x27;t spray even if run under hot water and every other tip</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just recently begun to dye my hair and it lost the natural shine that it had.</li>
            <li>At 65, with monthly color-treated, naturally curly hair, I recently decided time was taking its toll;  I should begin preparing to have &amp;#34;old-lady hair.&amp;#34; My hairdresser had recommended this  product</li>
            <li>For a company that claims that they only male products that are good for your health and for the environment, having ingredients like polysorbate 20, cetrimonium chloride, fragrance/parfum, SODIUM HYDROXYMETHYLGLYCINATE (FORMALDEHYDE RELEASER) and other products with aerosols and not openly disclosing ingredients on others, it is questionable.</li>

            <li> I thought I would get this because I had my hair high-lighted, and ever since, my hair has been extremely dry and has had breakage.</li>

            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and the &amp;#34;jury is still out&amp;#34;, as to how well it actually strengthens my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the humidity in FL does a number on it unless i take the time to tame it with dryer and flat iron.</li>
            <li> I sprayed this on my hair and I am not sure what is in this product, but my hair was so dry feeling that I could not even brush or comb my hair.</li>
            <li> Half the price of the salon.  </li>
            <li> Less cost than in the salons.</li>
            <li> Now It dryers faster and smoother with just a bit of attention with a round brush.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t hate it.</li>

            <li> Worked aweful ...i cant imagine that this was the right product as they used ti on me in the salon and it was great</li>

            <li> Very happy with this product.  Adds shine and body to my hair!!  Half the price of the salon.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years.  If your hair is thinning, or damaged...this product is for you.  My hair was thinning due to extensions, this product brought back my hair to a growing healthy state!!  Even my hairdresser cannot get over how much thicker my hair is.  It takes time..but soooo worth it!!</li>

            <li> I can literally see a difference in my hair&#x27;s quality when I use this product. I&#x27;ve just recently begun to dye my hair and it lost the natural shine that it had. I find that shine coming back as I use Fortifi. I&#x27;m so excited to have my healthy hair back!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and the &amp;#34;jury is still out&amp;#34;, as to how well it actually strengthens my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t love it and I don&#x27;t hate it.</li>
            <li> this is a great product for all types of hair. i would recommend this purchase. item arrived quickly….could have had slightly better packaging but wasn&#x27;t damaged when i got it.</li>
            <li> I just love my fortify spray especially since we now have well water.</li>
            <li> This stuff is liquid gold for my hair!  Keeps my hair stronger &amp; healthier looking.  My hair styles faster &amp; stays in longer with no flyaways.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> After using this product, my hair has become so healthy and manageable.  After years of abuse through color, I finally have shiny, healthy hair again!  Amazon cost is so much more reasonable than the salon, too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this only happened to me, but I purchased this product because I am an avid eufora user. I thought I would get this because I had my hair high-lighted, and ever since, my hair has been extremely dry and has had breakage. I thought this product would help in the healing process by improving my hair and helping to strengthen it. I sprayed this on my hair and I am not sure what is in this product, but my hair was so dry feeling that I could not even brush or comb my hair. it made my hair very unmanagable. I did not like this product. it just wasnt for me. I tried this for about a week and that was all I could handle. I gave up on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years since I color my hair blonde and it tends to dry out easily.  It really helps reverse some of the damage and also smells really good.  The product arrived on time and without hastle!</li>
            <li> Fortifies and protects. Nothing more can be said about a great product that smells good and is reasonably priced. Done.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!! At 65, with monthly color-treated, naturally curly hair, I recently decided time was taking its toll;  I should begin preparing to have &amp;#34;old-lady hair.&amp;#34; My hairdresser had recommended this  product and I&#x27;m so delighted she did!! Eufora Fortify &amp; Strengthen spray breathes new life into my weary hair. I describe it as body, while they describe it as Fortify and Strengthen. I really don&#x27;t care what they call it, it&#x27;s GREAT!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years along with other Eufora products.this is one of my favorites in the line, but I have had a significant problem with the way the sprayer/applicator works on the last 4or5orders received.  It just won&#x27;t spray even if run under hot water and every other tip I can think to try.  Therefore I have resorted to replacing the sprayer part from one from another brand. I did email the co. Itself and asked what the problem is about, but never received a response.  I like the product so well that I keep buying it anyway.</li>
            <li> Less cost than in the salons. Came days after ordering, packed well. No issues. I use this spray every day. It is not too heavy and keeps hair soft and helps prevent fly aways.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product while on a trip to CA. after about a month of using it I wondered how I would ever live with out it. I use the serum and shine mist with this product. My hair is frizzy/curly and the humidity in FL does a number on it unless i take the time to tame it with dryer and flat iron. Now It dryers faster and smoother with just a bit of attention with a round brush. And if need be i can live with just walking out the door and messing with it later.</li>
            <li> The Eufora fortifi strengthening spray was originally introduced to me by my hairdresser. I loved it immediately for the extra body it gave my hair (you spray it on when your hair is wet and then blow dry), and the protection.  It keeps hair from drying out and splitting with hair dryer use, while giving it healthy texture.  Plus, on Amazon I was able to buy it for considerably less.  I buy several at a time to ensure that I don&#x27;t run out and transfer some to smaller &#x27;airline appropriate&#x27; spray containers when I travel. A great productt and a very convenient, economical way to buy it!</li>
