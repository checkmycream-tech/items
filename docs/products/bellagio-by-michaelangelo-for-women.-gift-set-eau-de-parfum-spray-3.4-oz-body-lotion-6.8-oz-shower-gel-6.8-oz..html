            <li>, I&#x27;m light brown and this fragrance does not favor my pH. Before continuing my review of this item select your fragrance according to your own tastes.</li>

            <li>The floral, fresh, musk combination is amazing, all achieved without a strong overwhelming scent.</li>
            <li>The packaging looked better in a photo but felt like something cheap, like the leftovers from an outlet store.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice product for gifting to some one near &amp; dear.</li>
            <li>Then again, I&#x27;m easily amused.  </li>
            <li>I prefer a strong flowery smelling perfume</li>
            <li>I layer the bodywash, lotion and perfum and it lasts all day without being too strong.</li>
            <li>you will smell like strong peppers.</li>
            <li>The lotion is moisturizing and gentle without the stickiness of some scented lotions, the shower gel is also moisture rich with a good lather.</li>
            <li>Packaging and handling were just fine.  </li>
            <li>The parfum was original but the lotions had no smell at all and the lotions did not have original design as the parfum.  </li>
            <li>i would do ,, i wanted it to give it as a gift for a special event</li>
            <li>This product has a floral fragrance, very fresh and the price is right.</li>
            <li>It was delivered in time as expected, the price is reasonable &amp; it has a very good fragrance.</li>
            <li>and many people have commented I love the smell of your perfume when she is out in the public.</li>
            <li>I could not find it and luckily for me</li>
            <li>This perfume is also a lily of the valley floral but nowhere near as strong smelling!</li>
            <li>I enjoy it very mucho on her.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for her sensitive skin and his allergies.</li>
            <li>Did not smell right.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Bellagio\\&quot; is a gorgeous scent that opens with an intoxicating blend of florals - I get a lush white floral burst - almost like gardenia - that settles into something softer.  </li>
            <li>It was&#x27;nt sweet, or musky or soft or bold....</li>
            <li>The odor wears off VERY FAST.  </li>
            <li>as you can see, there is smokey glass at the top and bottom of a silvery canister - there are actually TWO bottles of the perfume, totaling the 3.4 oz. of perfume.  </li>
            <li>love the mixed flora scent.</li>
            <li>im an avid fan of jm</li>
            <li>it was exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and airy but strong enough to be commented on and to last all day.</li>
            <li>I think this is very cool, personally.  </li>
            <li>This a fantastic product, a smell from the past when the things were more real.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;One really neat thing about the bottle -</li>
            <li>This is a very lovely,light scent.  </li>
            <li>All the ones I listed above are light florals.</li>
            <li>This was not the real thing.</li>
            <li>the fragrance is light , it last about 15 minutes .</li>
            <li>The shower gel is scented the same as the perfume and full of lots of bubbles.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is nice and thick and luxurious - very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>The Item is good, but the packaging is poor, the shower gel crimp had a leak and the almost all of the gel spilled inside the package.</li>
            <li>I had first found Michaelangelo scent at the  Bellagio casino in LV several years ago.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care for it, it was too light and the smell didn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li>but kind of weak.  </li>
            <li>but like I said, kind of weak.</li>
            <li>A drop of this spicy perfume last the whole day.</li>
            <li>No one would like to stay near you.</li>
            <li>This product was delivered on time and was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>I have been wearing Realities for Women for years and recently began experimenting for new fragrances along that same line.</li>
            <li>i will be very cautious when oredering beauty products.!same thing with other perfume orders...</li>
            <li>and i am disappointed i would prefer to go to a store and get something better .. if you want it quick d&#x27;ont buy it from here .</li>
            <li>Okay, I bought this as a gift for a friend for Christmas but was so disappointed no words are adequate.</li>

            <li> and so i am getting everyday unhappy for the delay its taking even more than extra 2 days than the regular shipping its almost a week</li>
            <li> The smell itslelf was somewhat similar to rubbing alcohol but with a distinct odor that difficult to describe.</li>
            <li> This product looks beautiful but it smells horrific!  </li>
            <li> By using the shower gel, putting on the lotion and then topping it with the perfume you can make the scent last all day long with little need for a touch up - the art of layering.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I could not use this item as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;One of the worst transactions through Amazon I have experienced.</li>
            <li> Not worth</li>
            <li> The lotion was bland.</li>
            <li> Package was damaged in that the shower get burst open from the cold.</li>
            <li> very weak</li>
            <li> except i hate theses rating surveys</li>

            <li> I gave this to my mother for Mother&#x27;s Day.  She loves it.  Packaging and handling were just fine.  Nothing to complain about.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Bellagio\\&quot; is a gorgeous scent that opens with an intoxicating blend of florals - I get a lush white floral burst - almost like gardenia - that settles into something softer.  After a few hours the dry-down gives a softly musky sandalwood fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Launched by the design house of Bellagio in 2000, Bellagio perfume by Micaelangelo (this is the proper spelling, BTW) for women is classified as a luxurious, flowery fragrance. It possesses a blend of floral with notes of rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang and lily of the valley, finishing with sandalwood and musk. It is recommended for evening wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One really neat thing about the bottle - as you can see, there is smokey glass at the top and bottom of a silvery canister - there are actually TWO bottles of the perfume, totaling the 3.4 oz. of perfume.  I think this is very cool, personally.  Then again, I&#x27;m easily amused.  The shower gel is scented the same as the perfume and full of lots of bubbles.

            <li> This a fantastic product, a smell from the past when the things were more real.  A drop of this spicy perfume last the whole day.</li>
            <li> Bellagio is okay but kind of weak.  The odor wears off VERY FAST.  Nice smell but like I said, kind of weak.</li>
            <li> This is a very lovely,light scent.  I would definitely order it again and probably will when I run out!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive this perfume set yet and so i am getting everyday unhappy for the delay its taking even more than extra 2 days than the regular shipping its almost a week and i didn&#x27;t receive anything and showing longer than that ,, i couldn&#x27;t even cancel it if i could i would do ,, i wanted it to give it as a gift for a special event and i am disappointed i would prefer to go to a store and get something better .. if you want it quick d&#x27;ont buy it from here .</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s good buy for it&#x27;s price on Amazon.   However, both of my purchased perfume was leaked in the box, I did not bother to return them.</li>
            <li> I loved Jessica McClinktock until I put it on! This perfume is also a lily of the valley floral but nowhere near as strong smelling! I layer the bodywash, lotion and perfum and it lasts all day without being too strong. I have been wearing Realities for Women for years and recently began experimenting for new fragrances along that same line. I have found this one, Lily Pulitzer \\&quot;Beachy\\&quot;, Coach Signature, Mon Classique de Morabito and Cabotine de Gres to wear that are all florals and are all now my favorites! I am not stuck with only one! All the ones I listed above are light florals. They are all on AMAZON at WONDERFUL prices!</li>
            <li> I had first found Michaelangelo scent at the  Bellagio casino in LV several years ago. When I later returned to the casino I  could not buy it there anymore. I am delighted that I searched the web and found the Comlpete set!&lt;br /&gt;I love the mixed flora scent.It is the scent that the casino pumped into there public areas.&lt;br /&gt;This  package  has all that is needed to layer scent without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for her birthday and she loves the scent of this and I do also and many people have commented I love the smell of your perfume when she is out in the public.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful scent.  This product was delivered on time and was exactly what I expected.  It is a wonderful product and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Stay away! you will smell like strong peppers. No one would like to stay near you. I had to break the bottle and put in in the trash can for no one else to use it. Every  one who tried, asked me how and where the h*** did I get it from. Not worth</li>
            <li> This product looks beautiful but it smells horrific!  Made me nauseous and would not recommend that an animal where this!!!</li>
            <li> Package was damaged in that the shower get burst open from the cold. Therefore, I could not use this item as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;One of the worst transactions through Amazon I have experienced.</li>
            <li> I have had this product before!!! It is an excellent fragrance!!!!!! I could not find it and luckily for me Amazon.com had it!!!!! Thanks Amazon.com!!!!</li>
            <li> when received the perfume it was open... n product was oozin out...every order....ive had two replacements and they wer all the same...i will be very cautious when oredering beauty products.!same thing with other perfume orders...one looked like water n it was jessica mclintock...very weak n im an avid fan of jm</li>
            <li> Never smelled this scent but took a chance and sent as a gift-recipient said fragrance was pretty and light and was happy with gift.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is considered by some to be a jewel of perfumes and I can not generalize, but I do not feel well, I&#x27;m light brown and this fragrance does not favor my pH. Before continuing my review of this item select your fragrance according to your own tastes.</li>
            <li> The parfum was original but the lotions had no smell at all and the lotions did not have original design as the parfum.  Not satisifed with the honesty of product.</li>
            <li> Did not smell right. This was not the real thing. I did not use it</li>
            <li> My Wife loved it &amp; I believe you would too. This is a very nice product for gifting to some one near &amp; dear. It was delivered in time as expected, the price is reasonable &amp; it has a very good fragrance.</li>
            <li> The Item is good, but the packaging is poor, the shower gel crimp had a leak and the almost all of the gel spilled inside the package. However the Body Lotion and the Perfume are in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please check the items condition before shipping to customer.</li>
            <li> the fragrance is light , it last about 15 minutes . i love the lotion and shower gel.use them together it will last about 30 mins</li>
            <li> i purchase this for mothers day for my sister in law she likes this perfume a lot she was so happy with the perfume great buy</li>
            <li> I like the perfume even though it seemed that I had to spray on more throughout the day. Okay product.</li>
            <li> This product has a floral fragrance, very fresh and the price is right. I enjoy it very mucho on her.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this product for a gift.  I am told it was a hit with the lady who received it.</li>
            <li> Okay, I bought this as a gift for a friend for Christmas but was so disappointed no words are adequate. The smell itslelf was somewhat similar to rubbing alcohol but with a distinct odor that difficult to describe. It was&#x27;nt sweet, or musky or soft or bold....it was best defined as medicinal. It kinda reminded me of medicine, (referring to the liquid spray). The lotion was bland. The packaging looked better in a photo but felt like something cheap, like the leftovers from an outlet store. Obviously, I do not recommend this product except as a gag gift.</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy this again. it was exactly what i was looking for. except i hate theses rating surveys</li>
