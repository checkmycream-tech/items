            <li> i dont know how to use it</li>
            <li> Better than the pricey one I bought.</li>

            <li> I love the derma roller! My skin pores are getting lesser, clearer and softer. I just need to ask you what is the best serum should i apply after doing the roller. Currently, im in cosmelan 2 and tyrosinase inhibitor. Please let me know what serum should i apply. Thank you and awaiting.</li>
            <li> Love my new Belo dermaroller!!!!  I did not feel any pain at all. Looking forward to use this every month as per recommendation.</li>
            <li> I purchased this derma roller because I read some reviews that derma roller can be a big help for hair fall. So far, I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet since I&#x27;m using this for just a month now ( once a week).</li>
