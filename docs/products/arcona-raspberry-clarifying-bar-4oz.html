            <li>face with raspberry bar avoiding eyes and the hairline (per spa that sold me the bar)&lt;br /&gt;-Follow up with a toner; the spa recommended their cranberry pads but in my opinion any good toner will do (there is a witch hazel that smells like rose; this is about $7 smells amazing and does wonders for your skin)&lt;br /&gt;-Follow</li>

            <li>This product however is just amazing for pores and acne and anything to do with your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice container and the bar on the inside is also wrapped up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I should start by saying I have always had nice skin.</li>

            <li>however I received the item quickly and in great shape.</li>

            <li>I have also used the cranberry scrub from Arcona and it has the most amazing smell out of all of the cranberry products though I feel this bar is so much more useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>lathers nicely, has great ingredients, cleans my skin very well, and I do feel like it keeps my acne at bay.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I used to use many products (drugstore products)that claimed they work for acne.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>At night, most times I use just Arcona + Glytone Benzoyl, sometimes just just Arcona.  </li>
            <li>(Spa recommended doing this and it is meaningful).</li>
            <li>i was going through a period of many breakouts when i bought this soap.</li>
            <li>even though i love the scent, i am not going to be a repeat buyer.</li>
            <li>I have gone through so many soaps, cleansers, washes - you</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll try to find something more</li>
            <li>I really love the container.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it cleanses my skin well.</li>
            <li>I am a bit of a product junkie and have used many high-end skincare lines for my combination/hormonal acne skin.</li>
            <li>For the most part, my acne has cleared up and once in a while I do get pimples here and there</li>
            <li>Although I must admit I was hesitant to purchase a bar cleanser, I decided to bite the bullet and try the Arcona Raspberry Clarifying Bar, and I am exceedingly glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got mine 3 days after I ordered so I am really pleased with the prompt shipping.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>ARCONA notes that prolonged usage results in greater results.  </li>
            <li>No bad ingredients, I love that!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super effective</li>
            <li>It is natural and smells great.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>I skip this step out of laziness but it works so well and is gentle and good for</li>
            <li>This may seem counterintuitive and at first I hesitated doing this, but trust me, you will be glad you did!</li>
            <li>I have not seen a huge improvement in my acne as promised though.  </li>
            <li>, then oil free spf 15 moisture (varies on brand).  </li>
            <li>Seems to be absorbed better than others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>For my acne prone and oily skin this line is fantastic for me.</li>
            <li>I have always used cheap drug store soap and I almost never moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really complain, it smells AMAZING,</li>
            <li>, be proud that you&#x27;re taking care of your looks and being proactive to the one feature everyone sees on a daily basis)!  </li>
            <li>My occasional breakout/blemish have greatly been reduced.  </li>
            <li>Good for combination and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>First, I love the smell and it wakes me up immediately in the morning.</li>
            <li>As soon as I start using this soap again, my skin looks so much better and pimples heal so much faster as well!  </li>
            <li>and I am really excited to see how it works.  </li>
            <li>The smell is great, and I like the way my face feels when dry</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is a solo cure if you have acne like mine, but clean well balanced skin is the 1st step!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant, lasts only when applying and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin smelling like a Raspberry (gentleman</li>
            <li>It does take some time for your skin to adjust and to get the full benefits, but SO worth it!</li>
            <li>my nonstop, go-to, absolute favorite face wash.  </li>
            <li>will admit I found the soap pleasantly mild.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update at the two week mark date, however, here&#x27;s a quick review.  </li>
            <li>I know I give high ratings to a lot of acne medications because they all work compared to using nothing, but I am absolutely in love with this product.</li>
            <li>before which I felt cleaned my skin and made it feel squeaky (which it does - black soap is a great full body soap).</li>
            <li>and I am very glad that my search is finally over.  </li>
            <li>The most important thing is that it has really helped clear my skin!!!</li>
            <li>It is a bit drying at first but nothing a good moisturizer can&#x27;t fix (I use Neutrogena daily moisturizer for combination skin - works wonders!).</li>
            <li>I love it, besides the ridiculous price :p</li>
            <li>Overall, seems like an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Solid five stars which I rarely feel is warranted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Solid five stars which I rarely feel is warranted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Price was about what we expected also, with good value.</li>
            <li>and I am so happy to have clear skin again after 2 years with constant blemishes on my face.</li>
            <li>I have been using it now for about a year and a half and have been 100% thrilled with it!</li>
            <li>I would reccommed ordering anything from them as they really do ship things out quickly.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I ever write a review for a product</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not that overwhelming when you actually use it.  </li>
            <li>First off, the bar comes in the container as pictured.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who is willing to try it although it is pricy, I think it&#x27;s worth it rather than wasting money on drugstore products that more than likely may not work.</li>
            <li>This helps clean out any build up and maintain clear skin..</li>
            <li>This helps clean out any build up and maintain clear skin.</li>
            <li>, I wet my hands and face, rub the bar on my hands to get a nice lather, and then gently apply to my face and neck (avoiding the eyes).</li>
            <li>Soft cleanser great for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>I also really like this product because it&#x27;s very gentle and doesn&#x27;t make my face or acne irritated.</li>
            <li>so it might make your skin too dry if you use it more than once a day.</li>
            <li>Skin is now healthy, soft, not oily, not dry.  </li>
            <li>if, you want a higher end cleanser, try la roche possay toleraine or effaclar - when i want a cleanser to deep clean without drying, those are my go to cleansers.</li>
            <li>It is very drying</li>
            <li>i do not know if it was a result of this soap - it very well may not have been.</li>
            <li>I travel a lot and the container really comes in handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>utilizing now for two (2) weeks and still really like the product.  </li>
            <li>A good product but not worth the big price tag.</li>
            <li>This product has been super helpful in keeping my skin clean &amp; keep my blemishes down.</li>
            <li>This will inevitably happen toward the end of the use of the 1 quarter of the soap so better that you cut the soap into 4 pieces before starting to use it.</li>
            <li>I highly, highly recommend this because you will not run out any time soon.</li>
            <li>I also highly recommend the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the cranberry toner as well.</li>
            <li>Great soap but expensive.</li>
            <li>This makes my face feel so clean without making it dry.</li>
            <li>and I feel like the Arcona was the missing piece to make everything better.  </li>
            <li>But if you have normal skin then find something cheaper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this soap for a few years and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>as it is one of the only Benzoyl&#x27;s that does not seem to dry out skin or sit on top of your skin.  </li>
            <li>This works far better on my skin in every way than the previous brand.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and also very very sensitive</li>
            <li>I still get the occasional break around that time of the month, but other than that - my skin is soooooooo much better.</li>
            <li>I think this bar cleanser is produces way more lather/foam than any foaming or liquid cleanser I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  </li>
            <li>First impressions are lasting</li>
            <li>My problem skin has been clear ever since I started using this product line.</li>
            <li>My skin has been completely clear since using this bar along with Arcona AM Acne Lotion.  </li>
            <li>It was a question of mine, but it wasn&#x27;t clearly identified whether it was included or not.  </li>
            <li>My overall nose area, prior to usage, constantly showed signs (when examining in a mirror up close) of pores clogged (blackheads), however, since using this clarifying bar a huge difference is noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend:  </li>
            <li>I use it in the morning only and use a gentle cleanser at night.  </li>
            <li>i have oily skin with adult acne.</li>
            <li>I figure I am at the age where what I do to my skin now will directly effect how my skin ages in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>suggest trying it if you have sensitive skin or maybe acne issues.</li>
            <li>BUT it&#x27;s not harsh at all.  </li>
            <li>This years flare up has been manageable so far</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30 years old and since having kids I&#x27;ve been dealing with hormonal breakouts around my mouth and chin.</li>
            <li>I have used many facial products in the past.</li>
            <li>Finally, after washing my face with this clarifying bar, my face feels smooth and moisturized - not tight or dried out!  </li>
            <li>I rarely breakout and when I do it&#x27;s generally a pimple that pops up during my special lady time (sorry tmi)</li>
            <li>Natural, nurturing and cleansing at the same time.</li>
            <li>The combo has almost completely cleared up all the facial skin problems I had.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve barely reduced the size of it.  </li>
            <li>Store 3 quarters in a zip lock bag in a (preferably dark) and dry and cool place.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t exactly what I thought as it is a little more like that fake fruity smell you find in lip balms claiming to smell like banana or something</li>
            <li>Additionally, that one little bar generates so much lathery-goodness</li>
            <li>based on the rave reviews, i expected it to help clear my acne.</li>

            <li> and I am very glad that my search is finally over.  </li>
            <li> The most important thing is that it has really helped clear my skin!!!</li>
            <li> It is a bit drying at first but nothing a good moisturizer can&#x27;t fix (I use Neutrogena daily moisturizer for combination skin - works wonders!).</li>
            <li> I love it, besides the ridiculous price :p</li>
            <li> Overall, seems like an amazing product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Solid five stars which I rarely feel is warranted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Solid five stars which I rarely feel is warranted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Price was about what we expected also, with good value.</li>
            <li> and I am so happy to have clear skin again after 2 years with constant blemishes on my face.</li>
            <li> I have been using it now for about a year and a half and have been 100% thrilled with it!</li>
            <li> I would reccommed ordering anything from them as they really do ship things out quickly.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ever write a review for a product</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not that overwhelming when you actually use it.  </li>
            <li> First off, the bar comes in the container as pictured.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone who is willing to try it although it is pricy, I think it&#x27;s worth it rather than wasting money on drugstore products that more than likely may not work.</li>
            <li> This helps clean out any build up and maintain clear skin..</li>
            <li> This helps clean out any build up and maintain clear skin.</li>
            <li> , I wet my hands and face, rub the bar on my hands to get a nice lather, and then gently apply to my face and neck (avoiding the eyes).</li>
            <li> Soft cleanser great for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> I also really like this product because it&#x27;s very gentle and doesn&#x27;t make my face or acne irritated.</li>
            <li> so it might make your skin too dry if you use it more than once a day.</li>
            <li> Skin is now healthy, soft, not oily, not dry.  </li>
            <li> if, you want a higher end cleanser, try la roche possay toleraine or effaclar - when i want a cleanser to deep clean without drying, those are my go to cleansers.</li>
            <li> It is very drying</li>
            <li> i do not know if it was a result of this soap - it very well may not have been.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and the container really comes in handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> utilizing now for two (2) weeks and still really like the product.  </li>
            <li> A good product but not worth the big price tag.</li>
            <li> This product has been super helpful in keeping my skin clean &amp; keep my blemishes down.</li>
            <li> This will inevitably happen toward the end of the use of the 1 quarter of the soap so better that you cut the soap into 4 pieces before starting to use it.</li>
            <li> I highly, highly recommend this because you will not run out any time soon.</li>
            <li> I also highly recommend the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the cranberry toner as well.</li>
            <li> Great soap but expensive.</li>
            <li> This makes my face feel so clean without making it dry.</li>
            <li> and I feel like the Arcona was the missing piece to make everything better.  </li>
            <li> But if you have normal skin then find something cheaper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for a few years and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> as it is one of the only Benzoyl&#x27;s that does not seem to dry out skin or sit on top of your skin.  </li>
            <li> This works far better on my skin in every way than the previous brand.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and also very very sensitive</li>
            <li> I still get the occasional break around that time of the month, but other than that - my skin is soooooooo much better.</li>
            <li> I think this bar cleanser is produces way more lather/foam than any foaming or liquid cleanser I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> First impressions are lasting</li>
            <li> My problem skin has been clear ever since I started using this product line.</li>
            <li> My skin has been completely clear since using this bar along with Arcona AM Acne Lotion.  </li>
            <li> It was a question of mine, but it wasn&#x27;t clearly identified whether it was included or not.  </li>
            <li> My overall nose area, prior to usage, constantly showed signs (when examining in a mirror up close) of pores clogged (blackheads), however, since using this clarifying bar a huge difference is noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend:  </li>
            <li> I use it in the morning only and use a gentle cleanser at night.  </li>
            <li> i have oily skin with adult acne.</li>
            <li> I figure I am at the age where what I do to my skin now will directly effect how my skin ages in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> suggest trying it if you have sensitive skin or maybe acne issues.</li>
            <li> BUT it&#x27;s not harsh at all.  </li>
            <li> This years flare up has been manageable so far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old and since having kids I&#x27;ve been dealing with hormonal breakouts around my mouth and chin.</li>
            <li> I have used many facial products in the past.</li>
            <li> Finally, after washing my face with this clarifying bar, my face feels smooth and moisturized - not tight or dried out!  </li>
            <li> I rarely breakout and when I do it&#x27;s generally a pimple that pops up during my special lady time (sorry tmi)</li>
            <li> Natural, nurturing and cleansing at the same time.</li>
            <li> The combo has almost completely cleared up all the facial skin problems I had.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve barely reduced the size of it.  </li>
            <li> Store 3 quarters in a zip lock bag in a (preferably dark) and dry and cool place.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t exactly what I thought as it is a little more like that fake fruity smell you find in lip balms claiming to smell like banana or something</li>
            <li> Additionally, that one little bar generates so much lathery-goodness</li>
            <li> based on the rave reviews, i expected it to help clear my acne.</li>
            <li> Was expecting to hate a bar facial soap but took a leap of faith bc of the reviews, and wow what a good product on your skin</li>
            <li> guess I expected something major</li>
            <li> face first with a usual soap (black soap in my case) to get all the major gunk off</li>
            <li> You should try to keep the bar as dry as possible not allowing water to accumulate in the container.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recomend that anyone tries this product.</li>
            <li> Of course I still get outbreaks every once in a while due to humid weather, but my daily acne is basically gone.  </li>
            <li> Then I rinse off with water and pat dry.</li>
            <li> (doesn&#x27;t dry it out).  </li>
            <li> I recently began experiencing an unfortunate bout of adult acne (I&#x27;m in my mid-20s); so I decided to change up my skin care regimen and purchase products which directly target unsightly blemishes.</li>
            <li> spend a lot on cleanser, it just goes down the drain.&amp;#34; i am going back to that philosophy.</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about the quality of the product, unless you have a problem with using bar soaps, you should love this.</li>
            <li> 1 piece has lasted me close to two months as I am careful to not let the bar get too wet</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nothing bad to say. Great product! My problem skin has been clear ever since I started using this product line.</li>
            <li> I know I give high ratings to a lot of acne medications because they all work compared to using nothing, but I am absolutely in love with this product. First, I love the smell and it wakes me up immediately in the morning. Second, I stopped using proactiv for two months to test this and I absolutely love it. My acne around my forehead has decreased to nothing and the ones around my lips and chin are nearly microscopic. Of course I still get outbreaks every once in a while due to humid weather, but my daily acne is basically gone.  I would recommend testing twice daily versus once daily use. It is very drying so it might make your skin too dry if you use it more than once a day. I use it in the morning only and use a gentle cleanser at night.  Update: February 2012 - I still have the same bar that I bought last year. I&#x27;m amazed!! I highly, highly recommend this because you will not run out any time soon.</li>
            <li> I used to use many products (drugstore products)that claimed they work for acne. None of them worked like this. With this I don&#x27;t get any acne while I always get some acne with other products. Love it.</li>
            <li> Great soap but expensive.</li>
            <li> Great scent and perfect for acne prone skin. Natural, nurturing and cleansing at the same time.</li>
            <li> On my gf&#x27;s advice, I tried this product when nothing else seemed to work.  The regime I use is: In the morning: Proactive Cleanser, then Arcona, then [[ASIN:B0001EKZ5K Glytone Glytone Acne Treatment Gel 10% Benzoyl Peroxide]], then oil free spf 15 moisture (varies on brand).  At night, most times I use just Arcona + Glytone Benzoyl, sometimes just just Arcona.  The combo has almost completely cleared up all the facial skin problems I had.  Skin is now healthy, soft, not oily, not dry.  I&#x27;ve tried everything for years and I feel like the Arcona was the missing piece to make everything better.  I dislike the smell, a bit fruity for a man, but they do have a men&#x27;s version on their site which I will try next.  Overall, seems like an amazing product.  I also highly recommend the [[ASIN:B0001EKZ5K Glytone Glytone Acne Treatment Gel 10% Benzoyl Peroxide]] as it is one of the only Benzoyl&#x27;s that does not seem to dry out skin or sit on top of your skin.  Seems to be absorbed better than others I&#x27;ve tried.  Hard to find on Amazon though.</li>
            <li> I use this daily. Great cleanser.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. It is natural and smells great. I typically have used &amp;#34;black soap&amp;#34; before which I felt cleaned my skin and made it feel squeaky (which it does - black soap is a great full body soap). This product however is just amazing for pores and acne and anything to do with your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arcona appears to be a good brand. I also have the cranberry pads which work well. I have also used the cranberry scrub from Arcona and it has the most amazing smell out of all of the cranberry products though I feel this bar is so much more useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My regimen:&lt;br /&gt;-You can choose to remove makeup with coconut oil - I skip this step out of laziness but it works so well and is gentle and good for you&lt;br /&gt;-Wash face first with a usual soap (black soap in my case) to get all the major gunk off&lt;br /&gt;-Wash face with raspberry bar avoiding eyes and the hairline (per spa that sold me the bar)&lt;br /&gt;-Follow up with a toner; the spa recommended their cranberry pads but in my opinion any good toner will do (there is a witch hazel that smells like rose; this is about $7 smells amazing and does wonders for your skin)&lt;br /&gt;-Follow up with lotion or skin repair items as you wish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Storing this item***&lt;br /&gt;-First and foremost, cut the bar into quarters. This may seem counterintuitive and at first I hesitated doing this, but trust me, you will be glad you did! (Spa recommended doing this and it is meaningful). Store 3 quarters in a zip lock bag in a (preferably dark) and dry and cool place. I don&#x27;t know how it would do in the fridge although I did consider this but have not tried it. Store 1 of the quarters in the jar it comes in. The soap comes in a very good quality jar as seen on amazon. You should try to keep the bar as dry as possible not allowing water to accumulate in the container. This will inevitably happen toward the end of the use of the 1 quarter of the soap so better that you cut the soap into 4 pieces before starting to use it. It will prolong the use of the product. 1 piece has lasted me close to two months as I am careful to not let the bar get too wet so it does not melt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Solid five stars which I rarely feel is warranted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After literally two uses of this item you notice a difference. The only thing is is that you cannot go to sleep with your makeup on or skip a day using this soap - you will notice. This helps clean out any build up and maintain clear skin..

            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! I have been using it now for about a year and a half and have been 100% thrilled with it!

This works far better on my skin in every way than the previous brand.</li>
            <li> i have oily skin with adult acne. i was going through a period of many breakouts when i bought this soap. it smells wonderful and lathers well, and contains natural ingredients. based on the rave reviews, i expected it to help clear my acne. instead, my acne got worse. i do not know if it was a result of this soap - it very well may not have been. but this soap didn&#x27;t help prevent it, either. i had always had the philosophy &amp;#34;don&#x27;t spend a lot on cleanser, it just goes down the drain.&amp;#34; i am going back to that philosophy. for the price, you can buy about 10 desert essence tea tree bars, which work as well if not better. if, you want a higher end cleanser, try la roche possay toleraine or effaclar - when i want a cleanser to deep clean without drying, those are my go to cleansers. and they are half the price of this arcona bar. even though i love the scent, i am not going to be a repeat buyer.</li>
            <li> I have used many facial products in the past. For my acne prone and oily skin this line is fantastic for me.</li>
            <li> I have gone through so many soaps, cleansers, washes - you name it! My skin is combination - oily/normal/dry, it&#x27;s very sensitive, and I am suffering from horrible adult acne! I was actually looking at purchasing another cleanser when I came across this one. I saw the good reviews and decided to give it try (what do I have to lose? lol), and what a great decision! I love the Arcona Raspberry Clarifying Bar and it smells great!! It comes in a nice container and the bar on the inside is also wrapped up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use it, I wet my hands and face, rub the bar on my hands to get a nice lather, and then gently apply to my face and neck (avoiding the eyes). Then I rinse off with water and pat dry. It is a bit drying at first but nothing a good moisturizer can&#x27;t fix (I use Neutrogena daily moisturizer for combination skin - works wonders!). The most important thing is that it has really helped clear my skin!!! &#x3D;) I still get the occasional break around that time of the month, but other than that - my skin is soooooooo much better. It does take some time for your skin to adjust and to get the full benefits, but SO worth it!</li>
            <li> One of the best products I&#x27;ve used on my face.  The smell is great, and I like the way my face feels when dry (doesn&#x27;t dry it out).  Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I should start by saying I have always had nice skin. I rarely breakout and when I do it&#x27;s generally a pimple that pops up during my special lady time (sorry tmi) but that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about my skin is it gets oily after a long day of make up (I wear alot of heavy make up daily) but other than that I have always used cheap drug store soap and I almost never moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I recently turned 30 and I&#x27;ve become heavy into the whole &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products era so I thought I&#x27;d give Arcona a try. I figure I am at the age where what I do to my skin now will directly effect how my skin ages in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I expected something major but I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement (granted there wasn&#x27;t anything specific to improve) and for $40 a bar I think I&#x27;ll try to find something more reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit I found the soap pleasantly mild. I love the nice silkly lather! It&#x27;s a nice soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about it at all. I really love the container. I travel a lot and the container really comes in handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest trying it if you have sensitive skin or maybe acne issues. But if you have normal skin then find something cheaper.</li>
            <li> This makes my face feel so clean without making it dry. No bad ingredients, I love that! Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Love this. Good for combination and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it cleanses my skin well. I have not seen a huge improvement in my acne as promised though.  A good product but not worth the big price tag.</li>
            <li> I am a bit of a product junkie and have used many high-end skincare lines for my combination/hormonal acne skin. This product has been super helpful in keeping my skin clean &amp; keep my blemishes down. I still break out around my period but with this product and the herbal compound &amp; tabula rasa, I can get rid of breakouts A LOT quicker than I used to! I would definitely recomend that anyone tries this product.</li>
            <li> I started using this product last October when my annual acne flare up...well..flared up...I swear this soap instantly makes acne inflammation go away or at lease reduce it by 75%.  It&#x27;s super effective BUT it&#x27;s not harsh at all.  I have combination skin and also very very sensitive, I get these stubborn underneath the skin bumps that sometimes get inflamed every year at around August - November (seasonal?).  It takes me forever to get rid of them and afterwards I&#x27;m left with these scars (I&#x27;m a picker).  This years flare up has been manageable so far and it&#x27;s definitely because of this soap.  I strayed away and tried to replace this soap a couple of times but they only made my skin worse.  As soon as I start using this soap again, my skin looks so much better and pimples heal so much faster as well!  I love it, besides the ridiculous price :p</li>
            <li> Bought for our teenage daughter.  Soft cleanser great for everyday use.  Price was about what we expected also, with good value.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ever write a review for a product and I must say that I am 100% satisfied with my purchase! I have been using this bar for three months now and I am about to purchase my second one. This is the only acne cleanser that has worked in my favor. I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne for about 8 years now and nothing I have ever purchased has given me the results that this acne bar has given me! I&#x27;ve even purchased proactive, St. Ives, Clearasil, etc. you name it I&#x27;ve bought it and I am very glad that my search is finally over.  For the most part, my acne has cleared up and once in a while I do get pimples here and there but not like I did before I started using this product. There were times in which I would even cry because of how irritited my acne would get and breakout insanely and nothing worked. This bar smells really good and it lasts about 3 months if you use it twice a day. I use this everyday and at night I use benzoyl peroxide. I also really like this product because it&#x27;s very gentle and doesn&#x27;t make my face or acne irritated. I highly recommend it to anyone who is willing to try it although it is pricy, I think it&#x27;s worth it rather than wasting money on drugstore products that more than likely may not work. The seller does a really good job with shipping the item on time. In fact I received it before the estimated date. I also recommend the grommage exfoliator!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** If anyone knows about any efficient products that help with acne scarring, I would appreciate your suggestions!</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about the quality of the product, unless you have a problem with using bar soaps, you should love this. I can&#x27;t really complain, it smells AMAZING, lathers nicely, has great ingredients, cleans my skin very well, and I do feel like it keeps my acne at bay. I don&#x27;t think this is a solo cure if you have acne like mine, but clean well balanced skin is the 1st step!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely give it a try if you have oily/acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have been fighting acne for the past 4-5 years. Murad products helped me for about 3 years then stopped working.  I have been skeptical of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; skin care products and was introduced recently to Arcona at the salon where I went for a facial.  My skin has been completely clear since using this bar along with Arcona AM Acne Lotion.  It&#x27;s been 3 months and I am so happy to have clear skin again after 2 years with constant blemishes on my face.</li>
            <li> I recently began experiencing an unfortunate bout of adult acne (I&#x27;m in my mid-20s); so I decided to change up my skin care regimen and purchase products which directly target unsightly blemishes. Although I must admit I was hesitant to purchase a bar cleanser, I decided to bite the bullet and try the Arcona Raspberry Clarifying Bar, and I am exceedingly glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the smell is delightful!  I look forward to washing my face each morning just for the delicious raspberry smell alone.  Additionally, that one little bar generates so much lathery-goodness, it&#x27;s truly impressive.  I think this bar cleanser is produces way more lather/foam than any foaming or liquid cleanser I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  Finally, after washing my face with this clarifying bar, my face feels smooth and moisturized - not tight or dried out!  This is a product I would definately recommend!</li>
            <li> I got mine 3 days after I ordered so I am really pleased with the prompt shipping.  The smell isn&#x27;t exactly what I thought as it is a little more like that fake fruity smell you find in lip balms claiming to smell like banana or something but it&#x27;s not that overwhelming when you actually use it.  I bought this because of a video I saw on youtube and I am really excited to see how it works.  I would reccommed ordering anything from them as they really do ship things out quickly.</li>
            <li> my nonstop, go-to, absolute favorite face wash.  never switching</li>
            <li> I just finished day two of using this Clarifying Bar.  I&#x27;ll update at the two week mark date, however, here&#x27;s a quick review.  First off, the bar comes in the container as pictured.  It was a question of mine, but it wasn&#x27;t clearly identified whether it was included or not.  Secondly, after completing day two, my face already feels and looks different.  The smell is pleasant, lasts only when applying and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin smelling like a Raspberry (gentleman, it&#x27;s okay, be proud that you&#x27;re taking care of your looks and being proactive to the one feature everyone sees on a daily basis)!  Males of the United States have this warped sense around masculinity when it comes to personal appearance and bodily care.  First impressions are lasting impressions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** UPDATE *****&lt;br /&gt;Been utilizing now for two (2) weeks and still really like the product.  My occasional breakout/blemish have greatly been reduced.  My overall nose area, prior to usage, constantly showed signs (when examining in a mirror up close) of pores clogged (blackheads), however, since using this clarifying bar a huge difference is noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend:  At this point, I&#x27;d recommend this product hands down.  ARCONA notes that prolonged usage results in greater results.  With that in mind, I look forward to seeing my facial skin condition once I have gone through the entire bar. Rest assure for another update!</li>
            <li> Great product and awesome shipping!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t vouch for how well the product works because I have not started using it however I received the item quickly and in great shape.</li>
            <li> Love it! Cut it into thirds and used one for travel. Was expecting to hate a bar facial soap but took a leap of faith bc of the reviews, and wow what a good product on your skin</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts. I&#x27;m 30 years old and since having kids I&#x27;ve been dealing with hormonal breakouts around my mouth and chin. Arcona is the best out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for a few years and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, cleans my face and clears up the acne.  I will definitely buy this one again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this bar for two months and I&#x27;ve barely reduced the size of it.  Its a great cleanser that leaves no residue and doesn&#x27;t overdry.  I highly recommend the cranberry toner as well.</li>
