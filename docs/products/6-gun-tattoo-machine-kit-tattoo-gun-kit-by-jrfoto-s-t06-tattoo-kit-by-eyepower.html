            <li>This was definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li>I already have a good 10-12 hours in on tattooing with this power supply.</li>
            <li>The machines are good quality</li>
            <li>This kit is good for two of the six machines and the case.</li>

            <li>I bought this for my daughter since she is planning on learning to tatoo, good time to practice on stuff before people, she said they guns don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>Every thing was good until I went to use it</li>
            <li>The power and strength have 6 machines, needed some calibration, for people who are inciia would be guided by good tutorials on youtube because it has no manual whatsoever.</li>
            <li>because they were a good buy i would tell everyone i know to buy them</li>
            <li>so I expect what I paid for and so for looks good.</li>
            <li>The colors provided were good quality.</li>
            <li>Power supply is good but one of the guns didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>From what I noticed about everything that comes in the kit, for the price is exceptional.</li>
            <li>From what she has told me, is very pleased.</li>

            <li>Didn&#x27;t even bother opening the ink because I knew better.</li>
            <li>Glad it worked for some of you.</li>
            <li>but it was ok.</li>
            <li>I bought upgraded ink, a better power supply and a better foot pedal based on recommendations.  </li>
            <li>get better quality ink for that.</li>
            <li>i love this kit and the company there</li>
            <li>The machine runs without me touching it</li>
            <li>i love this 6 gun tattoo machine kit</li>
            <li>Love everything that came with it.</li>
            <li>Need better inks.</li>
            <li>An u needed  more copy pappers in it</li>
            <li>- I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better one.</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>I ask so many questions you would think I didn&#x27;t know my ass from my elbow.</li>
            <li>it :)</li>
            <li>, I am totally pleased.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m throughly satisfied.</li>
            <li>you are better off piecing a kit together</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Would recommend for starters like me :)</li>
            <li>Buy better ink seperatly.  </li>
            <li>i got these machines  for an practice before i apprentice and so far there doing good!</li>
            <li>pretty good machine.</li>
            <li>&amp; I think it pretty good to start off with .</li>
            <li>I was so excited when this arrived!</li>
            <li>Really good to start, it cames with a complete set to start practicing and develop your own skills,</li>
            <li>a whole box of needles 6 good guns glad they were on sale</li>
            <li>I found the machine excellent, I hope to see other interesting items have to sell and do business with you again</li>
            <li>Overall a very good purchase</li>
            <li>Works great took longer to ship than was expected but very satisfied with the kit.</li>
            <li>fast shipping, good product</li>
            <li>other then that though this is a great kit for starters!</li>
            <li>But it was easy to find, on youtube.</li>
            <li>Tattoo ink isn&#x27;t as good as it could be but overall an amazing tattoo kit for price</li>
            <li>and it was actually really easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good kit, it comes with everything you need to bring the tools and cleaning brushes, ink is poor / intermediate quality, the cd it brings, has fair to good images tattoo, otherwise it is very good kit worth worth the price.</li>
            <li>keys to lock your kit (which comes in a mildly badass briefcase), and pretty good ink.</li>
            <li>I really thought the ink would be a better quality, but overall, it&#x27;s great!!!  </li>
            <li>would suggest that you buy more ink and needles right away because the one&#x27;s in the kit will go very fast depending on how many people or tats you do !</li>
            <li>every thing els works fine</li>
            <li>But for its cost and convenience, it was a fine purchase.</li>
            <li>This kit comes with everything you need to get started, the guns are light weight easy to handle and a dvd to start learning on how to tattoo</li>
            <li>The stuff that came in the kit is working just fine, though.  </li>
            <li>mine&#x27;s been running fine)...</li>
            <li>I say they are just fine.  </li>
            <li>I love this product also, I would recommend this site to anyone that would like a tattoo kit, you will get your money worth</li>
            <li>Great as a beginners sets but check the coils if you can or take them to a local tatt artist and pay a set amount to have them check your machines</li>
            <li>hope you enjoy it as me</li>
            <li>For a starter kit it really comes in handy.</li>
            <li>Really smooth guns.</li>
            <li>Thank you so match I am happy with the machine hope deal with you next time.</li>
            <li>Turns out being a fantastic drawer/painter</li>
            <li>This kit arrived on time and in fantastic condition.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic buy!1</li>
            <li>the digital power supply works great with a smooth/steady voltage.</li>
            <li>perfect started kit are a few draw backs example</li>
            <li>Worked like a charm, everything still works although the ink is reallly cheap.</li>
            <li>Alrdy putting it to use daily :) def a good deal</li>
            <li>I still haven&#x27;t use all the machines I&#x27;ll buy more practice skin to keep using this toys I hope to do a real tatto soon with a better tattoo machine.</li>
            <li>Reviews were right,  get better ink.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it!!!</li>
            <li>complain.i think best kit for starting something new for fun or professional users also can be happy with that toys</li>
            <li>and I had recieved free shipping, I was so excited.</li>
            <li>Overall a very satisfying purchase for the beginning tattoo artist, and my daughter will get many hours and experience from this kit.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with how fast this tattoo kit was sent to me, along with another set of ink because based on other reviews the ink that comes with this product isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>I think its a good kit for starting out and becoming familiar with all the parts and supplies.</li>
            <li>The original price was $299, but I picked it up for $89 here...</li>
            <li>I will most definitely need better ink, needles, pedal and eventually get a better power supply.</li>
            <li>Lol, overall i would recommend this to anyone who is interested in tattooing!</li>
            <li>Stuff to clean the machines,</li>
            <li>I love it, and can easily see why the normal price would be $299....</li>
            <li>This kit was more than expected and shipping was exceptional.</li>
            <li>I just bought a bunch of ink and was super excited.</li>
            <li>Amazing package professional case</li>
            <li>Overall a good investment while you get yourself used to it.</li>
            <li>Loved it but got stolen two days later.</li>
            <li>but it is so true.</li>
            <li>love it  thanks</li>
            <li>is corney as hell but other than that this is great for aspiring tattoo artists</li>
            <li>Would of been happier with better ink but overall satisfied.</li>
            <li>Ladies please explore this art form its not only for men, anything they can do we can do it better :)</li>
            <li>it fades quick and does not go bold at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The power supply is adequate and allowed for the needed adjustments and tuning during the tattoo process.</li>
            <li>super exselente equipo los felicitos.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anybody just starting out or even someone with experience, great price for all the kit comes with</li>
            <li>Easy to use and sterilize stainless and aluminum tubes/tips/grips.</li>
            <li>Ten more colors of ink would have been 5 stars!</li>
            <li>I would have liked a little bit more instructions about the machines perhaps an updated dvd.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a starting tattoo artist this is an amazing kit to use.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>i did a few tattoos on myself which turned out great, and my brother tated himself and my boyfriend.</li>
            <li>WELL WORTH THE MONEY</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth every cent.</li>
            <li>the kit arrived as described and works very well , the only problem is the adjuster bar that control&#x27;s the speed is bent on 4 guns but does not affect the functions but does hinder the speed control , the needles and inks are of a good quality and as a customer</li>
            <li>Everything is there and its pretty sweet.</li>
            <li>For the price, it was definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>If you want to start or already tatúas tattoo and want something more professional worth to invest in this valuable KIT.</li>
            <li>still worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the $</li>
            <li>You get some nice machines and a power supply (some people have written that theirs died shortly after use...</li>
            <li>good starter kit but upgraded from that fast with new ink and new guns.</li>
            <li>but i wish this kit would of came with some skin sheets to practice on but other then that its a good investment</li>
            <li>I got my tattoo kit and opened it right a way and started tattooing my brother and wife</li>
            <li>Daughter is tattooing right now.  </li>
            <li>garbage...never worked right</li>
            <li>With that being said the only benefit would be familiarizingand becoming comfortable</li>
            <li>will be setting up for a sleeve in the next week or so, and will update on how all this stuff actually performs in a real world scenario.&lt;br /&gt;Shipment received fast, and in perfect exterior condition.&lt;br /&gt;Would</li>
            <li>The Tattoo Kit came exactly as described and well worth it.</li>
            <li>Slick and affordable; this starter would be a great gift to someone who loves tattoo arts.</li>
            <li>And for those out there who can&#x27;t afford $100+ for a machine and or are just starting in this tattoo world, I think this little kit is about perfect...</li>
            <li>i had to buy new ink but other than that its a great set.</li>
            <li>I got this kit fairly fast and its the complete set to start off tattoin, with DVD, 6guns, inks, stencil and much more.</li>
            <li>It came with an absolutely useless instructional video, but everything in the case is in great condition, and for six gun you will not find a better deal.</li>
            <li>i bought this for my son and he loves it very much</li>
            <li>VERY RESPONSIBLE SELLER.</li>
            <li>you very much and aloha kakou.</li>
            <li>BUT if u buy this kit be ready to buy another power supply!</li>
            <li>Exactly as describe.</li>
            <li>Will gladly do business again shortly.</li>
            <li>This kit was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The only thing i dont agree with is that it should come with more than one synthetic skin to practice on.</li>
            <li>everything came with it as it said it would deff will be buying more in the future</li>
            <li>I have always been an artist and been incredibly interested in tattooing.</li>
            <li>every thing you need to get started thank you so much the price is right for this</li>
            <li>the machines in this kit are sturdy and ready to cut right from the box.</li>
            <li>Everything is really great, however the foot pedal is no good.</li>
            <li>you Amazon.com for offering such a wide variety of products and selections, at such great prices, and the ease of wich everyone can take advantage of through ordering and shipping,another winner purchase for me!</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my daughter, who within an hour, had a couple of the machines ready to go and proceeded to give her first tattoo, which was on me.</li>
            <li>WELL, TOTALLY SMOOTH, and I barely had to adjust any of them...</li>
            <li>(Basic Fundamentals Of Modern Tattoo ) for a good starting point on seting up machines and types of needles and their uses.</li>
            <li>IF there were anything that could have been better, it would be that the grommets are a VERY tight fit with the needles supplied, I had to use pliers to bend the needle eyes.</li>
            <li>Well I got it in the mail fairly quick and everything seems to work so far.</li>
            <li>It turned out to be a very decent machine.</li>
            <li>take my advice and buy a single gun kit with a good starter book, and solid instructions.  </li>
            <li>It looks fine on the test tats I did on my leg but only time will tell.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing little tattoo kit...</li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s a crappy little foot switch and power supply, so what - - get a nice one, those aren&#x27;t expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>very inexpensive works</li>
            <li>LEARNING/ WANTS TO BECOME  A TATTOO APPRENTICESHIP</li>
            <li>Better than what I expected</li>
            <li>I have never tattooed anyone in my whole life.</li>
            <li>is what is described in the purchase, thanks</li>
            <li>but really teaches you how (if you dont know) to tatt and set up the machines.</li>
            <li>The case that holds everything is very convenient.</li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for, everything I expected and more</li>
            <li>I was very upset with the power supply.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>the inks are really cheep</li>
            <li>the package came on time, it was packed very well.</li>
            <li>this has no information of what different needles are used for, there is nothing about the guns, but bottom line none of the guns  fit together at all</li>
            <li>thanks a lot amazon</li>
            <li>I changed some components out, tuned it to my comfort &amp; they work very well.</li>
            <li>I opened it up and gave it a whirl - it&#x27;s really so much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Use disposable tubes available through Technical Tattoo Supply (.com), they don&#x27;t ask questions because they want people to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this product receives a much deserved three snaps in Z formation.  </li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>All parts work, box is better than expected.</li>
            <li>but it REALLY needs to have a &amp;#34;How-To&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Use these inks while practicing on things other than people, then buy a good brand once you tattoo an actual person.</li>
            <li>Only downside was the DVD, it was a little to out dated but other then that its an awesome kit!!!</li>
            <li>Glad we went this route and gave it a pre-shot before investing heavily in the real deal.  </li>
            <li>Machines seem to be of high quality material, plenty of extras to get you started.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to anyone wanting to learn to tattoo.</li>
            <li>He was pleasantly surprised by how much this kit included,everything to get started tattooing with and releasing the inner artistic talent</li>
            <li>The fake skin is ehh (but what one isn&#x27;t lol).</li>
            <li>but it absorbed Thur the skin and is on the outside of the lining as well now</li>
            <li>Once you take care of the material it will last you quite long, but you will need to order more ink.</li>
            <li>Contrary to other submissions that I have read, the power pack works just fine.</li>
            <li>They included free stencils and rubber skin, along with all of the other stuff imaginable.</li>
            <li>Had to order a new power supply.</li>
            <li>ink is a no go get new ink</li>
            <li>I do recommend you get a new foot pedal</li>
            <li>and i thought getting her some tattoo guns might give her a new skill to practice.  </li>
            <li>The black is good but the red looks light and dull.</li>
            <li>The kit came complete!</li>
            <li>The designed machines are cute as shit!</li>
            <li>This is for a super basic scratcher and should only be used to practice on bananas.</li>
            <li>I also only paid $99 for this whole kit when it was offered through amazon and shipped prime.</li>
            <li>A complete kit to start tattooing everything included except an autoclave and a ultra sonic cleaner</li>
            <li>And then I called and tried to get it fixed an</li>
            <li>Everything was as advertised but one tattoo gun completely stopped working after 20 minutes of use.</li>
            <li>The product came early and it had everything inside that I needed and it was the lowest price i could find on this product.</li>
            <li>The dvd is a complete joke.</li>
            <li>an at least one body pen.. needed more</li>
            <li>There is little to no explanation on how to use teh guns that come in the case and we are pretty much going to have to order a book to explain how the things we have work.  </li>
            <li>Typically, you cannot buy a quality tattoo machine for less than $150 and many run as high as $500.  </li>
            <li>The extra guns are hard to start and the skin isnt that hood ether but other than that its a good beginner kit</li>
            <li>2 out of 6 guns worked perfectly the other 4 had shorts in them and the coils were bad.</li>
            <li>Ink sucks but other than that amazing kit</li>
            <li>It has all the tools you need to learn techniques and just get the feel of it in general.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how soon i recieved this package i orderd it on the ninth and by the 13th i was already using it, it come with everything you need to get started and a how to video</li>
            <li>i got this kit fast but it is really cheap the guns work but are of very poor quality and the ink is garbage</li>
            <li>but it does work) and started tuning them (with a tube and needle inserted) and was even more shocked to find out they all run VERY VERY</li>
            <li>Also the machines are not tuned very well, you have to tweek them a little bit.</li>
            <li>the DVD didn&#x27;t work but everything worked other than that I give this a 5 star rating and would purchase it again when I need new tat guns</li>

            <li> Every thing was good until I went to use it</li>
            <li> The power and strength have 6 machines, needed some calibration, for people who are inciia would be guided by good tutorials on youtube because it has no manual whatsoever.</li>
            <li> because they were a good buy i would tell everyone i know to buy them</li>
            <li> so I expect what I paid for and so for looks good.</li>

            <li> The machines that came with my set all seem like nice sturdy pieces of equipment.  </li>
            <li> Great starter kit .. arrived quickly. .</li>
            <li> Great place to start, but I quickly outgrew this kit,  the guns suck</li>
            <li> The machines are great, the power supply is worthy.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied! :-)</li>
            <li> the ink isn&#x27;t the best out there, but other than that this is a great kit.</li>

            <li> for this price this tattoo kit has every thing you need to get started on your way to a great profession and have lots of fun doing it</li>
            <li> The needles it comes with arent high quality needles though, they kinda want to dig the skin &amp; dont perform a very good line</li>
            <li> It is nice guns great power box and just helped me out a whole lot</li>
            <li> In general terms this is an excellent produt, with quality, good presentation, fast delivery process and good price.</li>

            <li> This was for my son everything works great and exactly what he wanted .</li>

            <li> The price was cheap!</li>
            <li> I always get my equipment off the street but this was way cheaper and the machines are way better.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even bother opening the ink because I knew better.</li>
            <li> Glad it worked for some of you.</li>
            <li> but it was ok.</li>
            <li> I bought upgraded ink, a better power supply and a better foot pedal based on recommendations.  </li>
            <li> get better quality ink for that.</li>
            <li> i love this kit and the company there</li>
            <li> The machine runs without me touching it</li>
            <li> i love this 6 gun tattoo machine kit</li>
            <li> Love everything that came with it.</li>
            <li> Need better inks.</li>
            <li> An u needed  more copy pappers in it</li>
            <li> - I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better one.</li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> I ask so many questions you would think I didn&#x27;t know my ass from my elbow.</li>
            <li> it :)</li>
            <li> , I am totally pleased.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m throughly satisfied.</li>
            <li> you are better off piecing a kit together</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Would recommend for starters like me :)</li>
            <li> Buy better ink seperatly.  </li>
            <li> i got these machines  for an practice before i apprentice and so far there doing good!</li>
            <li> pretty good machine.</li>
            <li> &amp; I think it pretty good to start off with .</li>
            <li> I was so excited when this arrived!</li>
            <li> Really good to start, it cames with a complete set to start practicing and develop your own skills,</li>
            <li> a whole box of needles 6 good guns glad they were on sale</li>
            <li> I found the machine excellent, I hope to see other interesting items have to sell and do business with you again</li>
            <li> Overall a very good purchase</li>
            <li> Works great took longer to ship than was expected but very satisfied with the kit.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, good product</li>
            <li> other then that though this is a great kit for starters!</li>
            <li> But it was easy to find, on youtube.</li>
            <li> Tattoo ink isn&#x27;t as good as it could be but overall an amazing tattoo kit for price</li>
            <li> and it was actually really easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good kit, it comes with everything you need to bring the tools and cleaning brushes, ink is poor / intermediate quality, the cd it brings, has fair to good images tattoo, otherwise it is very good kit worth worth the price.</li>
            <li> keys to lock your kit (which comes in a mildly badass briefcase), and pretty good ink.</li>
            <li> I really thought the ink would be a better quality, but overall, it&#x27;s great!!!  </li>
            <li> would suggest that you buy more ink and needles right away because the one&#x27;s in the kit will go very fast depending on how many people or tats you do !</li>
            <li> every thing els works fine</li>
            <li> But for its cost and convenience, it was a fine purchase.</li>
            <li> This kit comes with everything you need to get started, the guns are light weight easy to handle and a dvd to start learning on how to tattoo</li>
            <li> The stuff that came in the kit is working just fine, though.  </li>
            <li> mine&#x27;s been running fine)...</li>
            <li> I say they are just fine.  </li>
            <li> I love this product also, I would recommend this site to anyone that would like a tattoo kit, you will get your money worth</li>
            <li> Great as a beginners sets but check the coils if you can or take them to a local tatt artist and pay a set amount to have them check your machines</li>
            <li> hope you enjoy it as me</li>
            <li> For a starter kit it really comes in handy.</li>
            <li> Really smooth guns.</li>
            <li> Thank you so match I am happy with the machine hope deal with you next time.</li>

            <li> This is a fantastic buy!1</li>
            <li> the digital power supply works great with a smooth/steady voltage.</li>
            <li> perfect started kit are a few draw backs example</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm, everything still works although the ink is reallly cheap.</li>
            <li> Alrdy putting it to use daily :) def a good deal</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t use all the machines I&#x27;ll buy more practice skin to keep using this toys I hope to do a real tatto soon with a better tattoo machine.</li>
            <li> Reviews were right,  get better ink.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it!!!</li>
            <li> complain.i think best kit for starting something new for fun or professional users also can be happy with that toys</li>
            <li> and I had recieved free shipping, I was so excited.</li>
            <li> Overall a very satisfying purchase for the beginning tattoo artist, and my daughter will get many hours and experience from this kit.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with how fast this tattoo kit was sent to me, along with another set of ink because based on other reviews the ink that comes with this product isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> I think its a good kit for starting out and becoming familiar with all the parts and supplies.</li>
            <li> The original price was $299, but I picked it up for $89 here...</li>
            <li> I will most definitely need better ink, needles, pedal and eventually get a better power supply.</li>
            <li> Lol, overall i would recommend this to anyone who is interested in tattooing!</li>
            <li> Stuff to clean the machines,</li>
            <li> I love it, and can easily see why the normal price would be $299....</li>
            <li> This kit was more than expected and shipping was exceptional.</li>
            <li> I just bought a bunch of ink and was super excited.</li>
            <li> Amazing package professional case</li>
            <li> Overall a good investment while you get yourself used to it.</li>
            <li> Loved it but got stolen two days later.</li>
            <li> but it is so true.</li>
            <li> love it  thanks</li>
            <li> is corney as hell but other than that this is great for aspiring tattoo artists</li>
            <li> Would of been happier with better ink but overall satisfied.</li>
            <li> Ladies please explore this art form its not only for men, anything they can do we can do it better :)</li>
            <li> it fades quick and does not go bold at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The power supply is adequate and allowed for the needed adjustments and tuning during the tattoo process.</li>
            <li> super exselente equipo los felicitos.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anybody just starting out or even someone with experience, great price for all the kit comes with</li>
            <li> Easy to use and sterilize stainless and aluminum tubes/tips/grips.</li>
            <li> Ten more colors of ink would have been 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I would have liked a little bit more instructions about the machines perhaps an updated dvd.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a starting tattoo artist this is an amazing kit to use.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> i did a few tattoos on myself which turned out great, and my brother tated himself and my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> WELL WORTH THE MONEY</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth every cent.</li>
            <li> the kit arrived as described and works very well , the only problem is the adjuster bar that control&#x27;s the speed is bent on 4 guns but does not affect the functions but does hinder the speed control , the needles and inks are of a good quality and as a customer</li>
            <li> Everything is there and its pretty sweet.</li>
            <li> For the price, it was definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> If you want to start or already tatúas tattoo and want something more professional worth to invest in this valuable KIT.</li>
            <li> still worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth the $</li>
            <li> You get some nice machines and a power supply (some people have written that theirs died shortly after use...</li>
            <li> good starter kit but upgraded from that fast with new ink and new guns.</li>
            <li> but i wish this kit would of came with some skin sheets to practice on but other then that its a good investment</li>
            <li> I got my tattoo kit and opened it right a way and started tattooing my brother and wife</li>
            <li> Daughter is tattooing right now.  </li>
            <li> garbage...never worked right</li>
            <li> With that being said the only benefit would be familiarizingand becoming comfortable</li>
            <li> will be setting up for a sleeve in the next week or so, and will update on how all this stuff actually performs in a real world scenario.&lt;br /&gt;Shipment received fast, and in perfect exterior condition.&lt;br /&gt;Would</li>
            <li> The Tattoo Kit came exactly as described and well worth it.</li>
            <li> Slick and affordable; this starter would be a great gift to someone who loves tattoo arts.</li>
            <li> And for those out there who can&#x27;t afford $100+ for a machine and or are just starting in this tattoo world, I think this little kit is about perfect...</li>
            <li> i had to buy new ink but other than that its a great set.</li>
            <li> I got this kit fairly fast and its the complete set to start off tattoin, with DVD, 6guns, inks, stencil and much more.</li>
            <li> It came with an absolutely useless instructional video, but everything in the case is in great condition, and for six gun you will not find a better deal.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my son and he loves it very much</li>
            <li> VERY RESPONSIBLE SELLER.</li>
            <li> you very much and aloha kakou.</li>
            <li> BUT if u buy this kit be ready to buy another power supply!</li>
            <li> Exactly as describe.</li>
            <li> Will gladly do business again shortly.</li>
            <li> This kit was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The only thing i dont agree with is that it should come with more than one synthetic skin to practice on.</li>
            <li> everything came with it as it said it would deff will be buying more in the future</li>
            <li> I have always been an artist and been incredibly interested in tattooing.</li>
            <li> every thing you need to get started thank you so much the price is right for this</li>
            <li> the machines in this kit are sturdy and ready to cut right from the box.</li>
            <li> Everything is really great, however the foot pedal is no good.</li>
            <li> you Amazon.com for offering such a wide variety of products and selections, at such great prices, and the ease of wich everyone can take advantage of through ordering and shipping,another winner purchase for me!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter, who within an hour, had a couple of the machines ready to go and proceeded to give her first tattoo, which was on me.</li>
            <li> WELL, TOTALLY SMOOTH, and I barely had to adjust any of them...</li>
            <li> (Basic Fundamentals Of Modern Tattoo ) for a good starting point on seting up machines and types of needles and their uses.</li>
            <li> IF there were anything that could have been better, it would be that the grommets are a VERY tight fit with the needles supplied, I had to use pliers to bend the needle eyes.</li>
            <li> Well I got it in the mail fairly quick and everything seems to work so far.</li>
            <li> It turned out to be a very decent machine.</li>
            <li> take my advice and buy a single gun kit with a good starter book, and solid instructions.  </li>
            <li> It looks fine on the test tats I did on my leg but only time will tell.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing little tattoo kit...</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s a crappy little foot switch and power supply, so what - - get a nice one, those aren&#x27;t expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> very inexpensive works</li>
            <li> LEARNING/ WANTS TO BECOME  A TATTOO APPRENTICESHIP</li>
            <li> Better than what I expected</li>
            <li> I have never tattooed anyone in my whole life.</li>
            <li> is what is described in the purchase, thanks</li>
            <li> but really teaches you how (if you dont know) to tatt and set up the machines.</li>
            <li> The case that holds everything is very convenient.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for, everything I expected and more</li>
            <li> I was very upset with the power supply.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> the inks are really cheep</li>
            <li> the package came on time, it was packed very well.</li>
            <li> this has no information of what different needles are used for, there is nothing about the guns, but bottom line none of the guns  fit together at all</li>
            <li> thanks a lot amazon</li>
            <li> I changed some components out, tuned it to my comfort &amp; they work very well.</li>
            <li> I opened it up and gave it a whirl - it&#x27;s really so much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Use disposable tubes available through Technical Tattoo Supply (.com), they don&#x27;t ask questions because they want people to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this product receives a much deserved three snaps in Z formation.  </li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> All parts work, box is better than expected.</li>
            <li> but it REALLY needs to have a &amp;#34;How-To&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Use these inks while practicing on things other than people, then buy a good brand once you tattoo an actual person.</li>
            <li> Only downside was the DVD, it was a little to out dated but other then that its an awesome kit!!!</li>
            <li> Glad we went this route and gave it a pre-shot before investing heavily in the real deal.  </li>
            <li> Machines seem to be of high quality material, plenty of extras to get you started.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to anyone wanting to learn to tattoo.</li>
            <li> He was pleasantly surprised by how much this kit included,everything to get started tattooing with and releasing the inner artistic talent</li>
            <li> The fake skin is ehh (but what one isn&#x27;t lol).</li>
            <li> but it absorbed Thur the skin and is on the outside of the lining as well now</li>
            <li> Once you take care of the material it will last you quite long, but you will need to order more ink.</li>
            <li> Contrary to other submissions that I have read, the power pack works just fine.</li>
            <li> They included free stencils and rubber skin, along with all of the other stuff imaginable.</li>
            <li> Had to order a new power supply.</li>
            <li> ink is a no go get new ink</li>
            <li> I do recommend you get a new foot pedal</li>
            <li> and i thought getting her some tattoo guns might give her a new skill to practice.  </li>
            <li> The black is good but the red looks light and dull.</li>
            <li> The kit came complete!</li>
            <li> The designed machines are cute as shit!</li>
            <li> This is for a super basic scratcher and should only be used to practice on bananas.</li>
            <li> I also only paid $99 for this whole kit when it was offered through amazon and shipped prime.</li>
            <li> A complete kit to start tattooing everything included except an autoclave and a ultra sonic cleaner</li>
            <li> And then I called and tried to get it fixed an</li>
            <li> Everything was as advertised but one tattoo gun completely stopped working after 20 minutes of use.</li>
            <li> The product came early and it had everything inside that I needed and it was the lowest price i could find on this product.</li>
            <li> The dvd is a complete joke.</li>
            <li> an at least one body pen.. needed more</li>
            <li> There is little to no explanation on how to use teh guns that come in the case and we are pretty much going to have to order a book to explain how the things we have work.  </li>
            <li> Typically, you cannot buy a quality tattoo machine for less than $150 and many run as high as $500.  </li>
            <li> The extra guns are hard to start and the skin isnt that hood ether but other than that its a good beginner kit</li>
            <li> 2 out of 6 guns worked perfectly the other 4 had shorts in them and the coils were bad.</li>
            <li> Ink sucks but other than that amazing kit</li>
            <li> It has all the tools you need to learn techniques and just get the feel of it in general.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how soon i recieved this package i orderd it on the ninth and by the 13th i was already using it, it come with everything you need to get started and a how to video</li>
            <li> i got this kit fast but it is really cheap the guns work but are of very poor quality and the ink is garbage</li>
            <li> but it does work) and started tuning them (with a tube and needle inserted) and was even more shocked to find out they all run VERY VERY</li>
            <li> Also the machines are not tuned very well, you have to tweek them a little bit.</li>
            <li> the DVD didn&#x27;t work but everything worked other than that I give this a 5 star rating and would purchase it again when I need new tat guns</li>
            <li> used black and blue for a star on my leg and the blue was the coloring on the inside</li>
            <li> The shading needles werent too bad, they were better than the lining needles.</li>
            <li> Everything that I expected  is in there.</li>
            <li> Works to perfection money well spent</li>
            <li> Received on expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> This kit isn&#x27;t recommended for long term use, but buying it with some fake skin (or a tattoo junky without fear) will give you the practice you need for the real stuff.</li>
            <li> The video also gives instructions on how to use a bunch of other things that did not come with the package.  </li>
            <li> (I did buy Mom&#x27;s ink after reading other reviews).</li>
            <li> The last thing that i find frustrating about this is that they sent us 6 identicle guns, the only difference being the art on the casing of the guns.  </li>
            <li> Not worth 80 bucks..more like 40.</li>
            <li> The ink is awful, but good to practice with.</li>
            <li> and it got all chunky inside the tip i suggest getting other ink, i wont be using the ink after what happened, i had trouble getting the ink to even stay in the tip.</li>
            <li> However, the video sucks completely and I feel you won&#x27;t learn hardly anything from it.</li>
            <li> As well as the needle tends to jump once in awhile which will mess up a tattoo..</li>
            <li> Major disappointment, especially since this was a gift.</li>
            <li> Worked for a little bit but wouldn&#x27;t turn on after a while.</li>
            <li> This is a neat little kit...</li>
            <li> but i learned that after adjusting the rubber bands and making them less tight all worked out!</li>
            <li> PLEASE don&#x27;t do anything that the guy shows you, except how to set the machine up, other than that DON&#x27;t!!</li>
            <li> Tattoo ink fades and you cant really tell you had a tattoo there, Really disappointing )&#x3D;</li>
            <li> After switching it on and off a few times, by the 5th time I tried turning it on I had no power.</li>
            <li> , the inks are dried up and the ones that are usable dont mix, they separate.</li>
            <li> i was told by a friend, and also read a few reviews about not using this ink.</li>
            <li> I had trouble keeping them tuned correctly when they were working.</li>
            <li> at least 4 other people said theirs had burned up also!</li>
            <li> The instructional DVD wasnt pathetic most not a lot of tips</li>
            <li> small size tattoos and the motor in the box already burnt out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what happen.</li>
            <li> DVD is laughable, but combining it with some Youtube videos will give you enough to get started.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the supply box how ever the guns work perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> but ink sucks</li>
            <li> it sucks ass</li>
            <li> that sucks</li>
            <li> sucks all u hear is a click</li>
            <li> THE PEOPLE THAT SELL IT ARE RUDE AND</li>
            <li> But wish u had at least a couple guns that looked lady like.  </li>
            <li> The how to video sucks maybe try utube</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t automatically mean you&#x27;d like tatting.  </li>
            <li> I had recently had all of my equipment stolen in a home robbery and was basically going to have to re-buy everything, which was going to be very EXPENSIVE.  </li>
            <li> That is not good ink, do yourself and the recipient a favor, THROW IT AWAY.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed as it burnt out in the middle of a tat.</li>
            <li> I plugged it in, and the foot pedal is broken.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not great...</li>
            <li> needles are so poor</li>
            <li> Bought this and practice skin for someone who wondered if she&#x27;d like to get in the tatoo game.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy.</li>
            <li> The ink is poor quality which I already knew it would be.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that I would get drunk and wake up with random tattoos on my body.</li>
            <li> thats kinda lame</li>
            <li> ( sorry amazon )</li>
            <li> /&gt;So needless to say</li>
            <li> DVD horrible , and no precise instructions on which machine does what ...</li>
            <li> and nothing has gone bad on me</li>
            <li> The inside divider in the box was broken, nothing horrible.</li>
            <li> I brought it home and was actually shocked about everything it came with.  </li>
            <li> the dvd is worthless really bad video and audio</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t even rebuild em and the pwr supply was crap</li>
            <li> the skin is just a piece of rubber, and the inks are crap, but for practicing with on the rubber or some pigskin</li>
            <li> very bad cd instructions</li>
            <li> The power supply that comes with this kit is a piece of crap!</li>
            <li> DVD WAS HORRIBLE</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The extra guns are hard to start and the skin isnt that hood ether but other than that its a good beginner kit every thing els works fine</li>
            <li> I got my tattoo kit and opened it right a way and started tattooing my brother and wife I perchanced star bright ink cause I havent heard any thing good bout the ink in the kit and the DVD didn&#x27;t work but everything worked other than that I give this a 5 star rating and would purchase it again when I need new tat guns thank you guys for the nice tattoo kit</li>
            <li> Bought this to just play around and learn with. Items are of good starter quality. Machines need tweaking to get what you want out of them and power supply will need replaced after awhile of use. Mine lasted 2 months and I bought a better one. I do reccomend http://amzn.com/0615281478 (Basic Fundamentals Of Modern Tattoo ) for a good starting point on seting up machines and types of needles and their uses. I also only paid $99 for this whole kit when it was offered through amazon and shipped prime.</li>
            <li> I love this product also, I would recommend this site to anyone that would like a tattoo kit, you will get your money worth</li>
            <li> The DVD it comes with does not work.. As well as the needle tends to jump once in awhile which will mess up a tattoo.. You do get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Great starter kit .. arrived quickly. . Great value for an inexpensive price</li>
            <li> Would of been happier with better ink but overall satisfied.</li>
            <li> A very nice first kit. My biggest complaint is that I would get drunk and wake up with random tattoos on my body. Lol, overall i would recommend this to anyone who is interested in tattooing!</li>
            <li> I give it a two guns are good but ink sucks if it don&#x27;t come out it absorbs into the skin where tattoo was not even out lined or colored at I used black and blue for a star on my leg and the blue was the coloring on the inside but it absorbed Thur the skin and is on the outside of the lining as well now</li>
            <li> 2 out of 6 guns worked perfectly the other 4 had shorts in them and the coils were bad. Great as a beginners sets but check the coils if you can or take them to a local tatt artist and pay a set amount to have them check your machines</li>
            <li> very inexpensive works well no problems as of yet. would reorder again for sure. Good product for any one in my opinion</li>
            <li> i ordered this kit and for the price its good!!! BUT...BUT if u buy this kit be ready to buy another power supply! the one that came with it sucks ass i had it for about 30 minutes or so just enough time to open the the package it came in and hook up one of the guns to the power supply and not even 30 seconds later the power supply was smoking like it was about to katch fire!!!!!! now i got to spend more money and order another power supply! after that happend i got in contact with amazon and they told me to send it back and that it would take 2 to 4 weeks to refund my money! my wife got on amazon and was looking for another power supply and came across the same one that was in the kit and well lets just say its a ITS A FIRE HAZARD! plane and simple! at least 4 other people said theirs had burned up also!</li>
            <li> Really good to start, it cames with a complete set to start practicing and develop your own skills, hope you enjoy it as me</li>
            <li> Well I got it in the mail fairly quick and everything seems to work so far. A complete kit to start tattooing everything included except an autoclave and a ultra sonic cleaner, I&#x27;m very happy</li>
            <li> I found the machine excellent, I hope to see other interesting items have to sell and do business with you again</li>
            <li> THIS WAS FOR MY SON MATTHEW, HE IS LEARNING/ WANTS TO BECOME  A TATTOO APPRENTICESHIP</li>
            <li> Works great took longer to ship than was expected but very satisfied with the kit.</li>
            <li> The instructional DVD wasnt pathetic most not a lot of tips jus watchin the guy do tattoos but the kit came with everything it said it did, needles sterile, power fuse still working gun broke soon as i tried using it tried tune it up but nothing worked  , WELL WORTH THE MONEY</li>
            <li> the best for the buck perfect</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day.  All we knew is that he wanted to learn how to tattoo, so picking the equipment was left up to me and the kids.  We did our research and read the reviews and went with the 6 gun kit.  He absolutely loves it!!! Great purchase, items just as described, fast shipping, and great price..we will be ordering more items from this seller.</li>
            <li> I got this kit fairly fast and its the complete set to start off tattoin, with DVD, 6guns, inks, stencil and much more. Once you take care of the material it will last you quite long, but you will need to order more ink. All is in good shape... I like this kit a lot, the briefcase is awesome.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied! :-)</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet...but everything&#x27;s is there even the DVD...can&#x27;t wait to learn how to use this</li>
            <li> Better than what I expected</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend. She was tattooing herself that night. &#x3D;p  It turned out to be a very decent machine. Runs well, tattoos well.. But be warned, the different machines are for different aspects of tattooing. For example, one is for shading, one is for regular lines, and so on. But for its cost and convenience, it was a fine purchase. I&#x27;ve never done a tattoo, never planned to, but I did one with this machine and it was an exhilarating experience. I recommend this for most beginners, if not all.</li>
            <li> Everything was great! Absolutely great...only downfall was I got 4 guns and not 6. And then I called and tried to get it fixed an was told there was nothing they could do so that sucks but hay I or my 2 shaders n 2 liners so I&#x27;m ok with that everything works perfect! Alrdy putting it to use daily :) def a good deal</li>
            <li> Everything that I expected  is in there. For a starter kit it really comes in handy.</li>
            <li> Great kit. DVD will not work.</li>
            <li> Exactly as describe. You get what it says. Really smooth guns.</li>
            <li> Got exactly what I ordered, everything worked and Im very happy with it. I would have liked a little bit more instructions about the machines perhaps an updated dvd. But it was easy to find, on youtube. This was definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> Thank you so match I am happy with the machine hope deal with you next time.</li>
            <li> Good shipping, I purchased this for my fiance as a gift!! He was very happy. The price was cheap! The kit came complete! Only downside was the DVD, it was a little to out dated but other then that its an awesome kit!!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when this arrived! I plugged it in, and the foot pedal is broken. Major disappointment, especially since this was a gift.</li>
            <li> I have never tattooed anyone in my whole life. This kit comes with everything you need to get started, the guns are light weight easy to handle and a dvd to start learning on how to tattoo but i wish this kit would of came with some skin sheets to practice on but other then that its a good investment</li>
            <li> Best thing for a beginner to buy</li>
            <li> Great kit. Nice variety.</li>
            <li> Tattoo power supply doesn&#x27;t work??had to order a different one.....would still recommend because of quality of products but power supply sucks all u hear is a click</li>
            <li> This kit rocks every thing you need to get started thank you so much the price is right for this</li>
            <li> Product was excellent. The Tattoo Kit came exactly as described and well worth it. The quality is great, the machines run smooth, and overnight shipping arrived perfect. Will gladly do business again shortly.</li>
            <li> Item arrived in perfect condition, I am very satisfied with the purchase. is what is described in the purchase, thanks</li>
            <li> I was surprised how soon i recieved this package i orderd it on the ninth and by the 13th i was already using it, it come with everything you need to get started and a how to video thats kinda lame but really teaches you how (if you dont know) to tatt and set up the machines. I always get my equipment off the street but this was way cheaper and the machines are way better. Ladies please explore this art form its not only for men, anything they can do we can do it better :)</li>
            <li> This kit was exactly what I was looking for. Contrary to other submissions that I have read, the power pack works just fine. I already have a good 10-12 hours in on tattooing with this power supply. The machines are good quality and I have no complaints. The case that holds everything is very convenient. Easy to use and sterilize stainless and aluminum tubes/tips/grips. Comes with plenty of rubber bands and ink caps. IF there were anything that could have been better, it would be that the grommets are a VERY tight fit with the needles supplied, I had to use pliers to bend the needle eyes. However, that doesn&#x27;t even factor into my opinion here. A great kit. Anyone who tats out of their house or even in a shop, I recommend this to you.</li>
            <li> This kit is good for two of the six machines and the case. The rubber bands maybe. It&#x27;s really not great...needles are so poor I had to throw. 2/3 ofthe box out. Didn&#x27;t even bother opening the ink because I knew better. This is for a super basic scratcher and should only be used to practice on bananas. Not worth 80 bucks..more like 40.</li>
            <li> Awesome set would buy it again. Works a plus</li>
            <li> Everything was as advertised but one tattoo gun completely stopped working after 20 minutes of use. Otherwise it is a very nice starter kit for anyone wanting to tattoo!</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Only had this machine for 5 months and only used it 6 times, on small size tattoos and the motor in the box already burnt out. I just bought a bunch of ink and was super excited. Disappointed as it burnt out in the middle of a tat.</li>
            <li> This was a gift, for a friend in another state. For her Birthday. But she loves it! From what she has told me, is very pleased. It has everything she needed to start doing tattoos.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my son and he loves it very much he said it is exactly what it is advertised great for beginer</li>
            <li> IT is great ive putt hours on every gun and they all run great the colors that come with this kit have stuck into every client ive used them on and im very pleased by this product</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for, everything I expected and more</li>
            <li> Ten more colors of ink would have been 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Amazing package professional case a whole box of needles 6 good guns glad they were on sale</li>
            <li> This kit was more than expected and shipping was exceptional. Absolutely worth every cent.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with how fast this tattoo kit was sent to me, along with another set of ink because based on other reviews the ink that comes with this product isn&#x27;t that great. I was very upset with the power supply. After switching it on and off a few times, by the 5th time I tried turning it on I had no power. Worked for a little bit but wouldn&#x27;t turn on after a while. Had to order a new power supply. The power supply that comes with this kit is a piece of crap! Glad it worked for some of you.</li>
            <li> My power supply box is not displaying current reading when pedal is pressed. I&#x27;m not sure what happen. Very disappointed in the supply box how ever the guns work perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> This is actually a really good starter kit. My husband started with this and im not going to lie the CD is corney as hell but other than that this is great for aspiring tattoo artists</li>
            <li> It came with an absolutely useless instructional video, but everything in the case is in great condition, and for six gun you will not find a better deal.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for his birthday. We watched the learners video, it wasn&#x27;t that good but it was ok. guns work good, ink is nice.. UPDATE03/27/2015 Tattoo ink fades and you cant really tell you had a tattoo there, Really disappointing )&#x3D;</li>
            <li> I think its a good kit for starting out and becoming familiar with all the parts and supplies. However, the video sucks completely and I feel you won&#x27;t learn hardly anything from it.With that being said the only benefit would be familiarizingand becoming comfortable</li>
            <li> the kit arrived as described and works very well , the only problem is the adjuster bar that control&#x27;s the speed is bent on 4 guns but does not affect the functions but does hinder the speed control , the needles and inks are of a good quality and as a customer im over all a very happy customer and would suggest this kit to every one who views this item BUT,&lt;br /&gt;i would suggest that you buy more ink and needles right away because the one&#x27;s in the kit will go very fast depending on how many people or tats you do !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now you can do as i did and visit this site for cheaper supply&#x27;s .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wholesale inks needles and more that cant be found on amazon ! ( sorry amazon )</li>
            <li> fast shipping, good product</li>
            <li> It is nice guns great power box and just helped me out a whole lot thanks</li>
            <li> very bad cd instructions</li>
            <li> The machines overheat and I still don&#x27;t know which machine is for lining and for shading, is supposed to be 10 coil machines but they&#x27;re 8 coil  the inks are really cheep the dvd is worthless really bad video and audio you cant learn anything from it  but you&#x27;re getting what you pay for I still haven&#x27;t use all the machines I&#x27;ll buy more practice skin to keep using this toys I hope to do a real tatto soon with a better tattoo machine. For beginners  like me I recommend to buy a rotary machin it&#x27;s way easier to practice with it</li>
            <li> The product came early and it had everything inside that I needed and it was the lowest price i could find on this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for father&#x27;s day and he loves it...he needed a tattoo gun and this was simply it!</li>
            <li> Bought this and practice skin for someone who wondered if she&#x27;d like to get in the tatoo game.  Turns out being a fantastic drawer/painter doesn&#x27;t automatically mean you&#x27;d like tatting.  Glad we went this route and gave it a pre-shot before investing heavily in the real deal.  But it works exceptionally well and is cool as heck.</li>
            <li> I really thought the ink would be a better quality, but overall, it&#x27;s great!!!  It&#x27;s a good starter kit and to build upon.</li>
            <li> So far this kit has been great!!! I highly recommend this to anybody just starting out or even someone with experience, great price for all the kit comes with</li>
            <li> The case brings the same as shown in pictures! Is a big deal for bigining in tattoo art. I really liked it. The only thing i dont agree with is that it should come with more than one synthetic skin to practice on. In general terms this is an excellent produt, with quality, good presentation, fast delivery process and good price.</li>
            <li> Very nice equipment the dvd isn&#x27;t helpful at all the ink isnt that great but can get you by in a pinch</li>
            <li> Very happy with this. Bought it for my girlfriend for Christmas. She loved it everything came with it as it said it would deff will be buying more in the future</li>
            <li> Daughter is tattooing right now.  I bought upgraded ink, a better power supply and a better foot pedal based on recommendations.  The stuff that came in the kit is working just fine, though.  Very impressive kit.</li>
            <li> the package came on time, it was packed very well. i would suggest to buyers to tune all machines before use! i got these machines  for an practice before i apprentice and so far there doing good! one think i will say however is DO NOT use the ink in skin. get better quality ink for that. other then that though this is a great kit for starters!</li>
            <li> Great place to start, but I quickly outgrew this kit,  the guns suck but you can make them work.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a starting tattoo artist this is an amazing kit to use.&lt;br /&gt;The ink is a no go get new ink it fades quick and does not go bold at all.&lt;br /&gt;The Machines are real nice and smooth running. I do recommend you get a new foot pedal tho.&lt;br /&gt;Everything in this kit was intact and running its a great kit i hope all that buy it use it the moment i got it i went off and did 35-50 tattoos already and nothing has gone bad on me at all i love this kit and the company there amazing hope you all have great time with this kit.&lt;br /&gt;put an image of the ink used in the kit and its already fading.</li>
            <li> Excellent service and best price.no complain.i think best kit for starting something new for fun or professional users also can be happy with that toys</li>
            <li> I bought this beginner kit as a birthday present for my son,Adam.He was pleasantly surprised by how much this kit included,everything to get started tattooing with and releasing the inner artistic talent he posesses!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon.com for offering such a wide variety of products and selections, at such great prices, and the ease of wich everyone can take advantage of through ordering and shipping,another winner purchase for me!</li>
            <li> I got this as a birthday gift for my boyfriend &amp; he loves it. It&#x27;s being used almost daily. Even the case it comes in is great.</li>
            <li> Tattoo ink isn&#x27;t as good as it could be but overall an amazing tattoo kit for price</li>
            <li> Great for practice. The video was in Chinese or something. I got on you tube.</li>
            <li> awesome kit , just needed to have instructions on how much voltage to use on each machines. DVD WAS HORRIBLE</li>
            <li> From what I noticed about everything that comes in the kit, for the price is exceptional. Machines seem to be of high quality material, plenty of extras to get you started.&lt;br /&gt;I will be setting up for a sleeve in the next week or so, and will update on how all this stuff actually performs in a real world scenario.&lt;br /&gt;Shipment received fast, and in perfect exterior condition.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy from seller again</li>
            <li> Works but already replaced the couls twice.</li>
            <li> this has no information of what different needles are used for, there is nothing about the guns, but bottom line none of the guns  fit together at all; you can&#x27;t try tattooing when the guns fall apart.  There was a video with this but it tells nothing about assemble of the guns, uses of different needles or anything else that is in the box.  There is a video of a guy getting a tattoo but you can&#x27;t see how the gun is put together to do so.  I will say the guy giving the tattoo in the video is not using one of the fall apart guns that came with this kit.  I can&#x27;t believe anyone can use this for anything.</li>
            <li> Slick and affordable; this starter would be a great gift to someone who loves tattoo arts. I bought this for my niece who is finishing her Bachelor in Arts. I hope she can handle this tools and human skin just like paper and pencil.</li>
            <li> TOOK OVER A MONTH TO GET MY KIT.. THE PEOPLE THAT SELL IT ARE RUDE AND THEY DONT UNDERSTAND SIMPLE ENGLISH!!!!CHINA JUNK!</li>
            <li> I have never done any tattoos before. The kit comes with all of the practice stuff that you need to start. It is not a pro kit by any means but it is a great starter kit if you want to learn and practice!</li>
            <li> very good tattoo kit exellent</li>
            <li> For a beginners kit, it is very good.</li>
            <li> Great deal for the price</li>
            <li> my daughter is learning how to tattoo so this was a great price and i think it is of good quality .</li>
            <li> This kit isn&#x27;t recommended for long term use, but buying it with some fake skin (or a tattoo junky without fear) will give you the practice you need for the real stuff. How to hold the gun, how to put it in the power supply, how to use the needles and how to use the inks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DVD is laughable, but combining it with some Youtube videos will give you enough to get started.</li>
            <li> My niece has decided to become a tattoo artist and has started an apprenticeship.  When she got this kit, she was thrilled.  It won&#x27;t likely be her last set, but both she and her mentor say it is a really good starter set.</li>
            <li> Everything is there and its pretty sweet. My fiancé had me do a practice skin and it was actually really easy. Nice kit. Were proud to show it off.</li>
            <li> Everything is really great, however the foot pedal is no good. The machine runs without me touching it</li>
            <li> for this price this tattoo kit has every thing you need to get started on your way to a great profession and have lots of fun doing it i am very glad tht i found this item on amazon and if you are thinking about buying it dont hesitate you will be very impressed with your purchase thanks a lot amazon</li>
            <li> This kit arrived on time and in fantastic condition. This was a gift for my daughter, who within an hour, had a couple of the machines ready to go and proceeded to give her first tattoo, which was on me. The power supply is adequate and allowed for the needed adjustments and tuning during the tattoo process. While the inks included, though not the best available, provided excellent lines and shading with the included needles. Overall a very satisfying purchase for the beginning tattoo artist, and my daughter will get many hours and experience from this kit.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter since she is planning on learning to tatoo, good time to practice on stuff before people, she said they guns don&#x27;t work, they spark but don&#x27;t run. I guess this was one Christmas present that was a dud</li>
            <li> Some pieces of this are great and others a not so great. The dvd is a complete joke. PLEASE don&#x27;t do anything that the guy shows you, except how to set the machine up, other than that DON&#x27;t!! The ink is awful, but good to practice with. Overall a good investment while you get yourself used to it.</li>
            <li> Ink sucks but other than that amazing kit</li>
            <li> For the price, it was definitely worth the purchase. The carrying case was packed with everything needed and it&#x27;s great for a beginner.</li>
            <li> Loved it but got stolen two days later. Wanted to buy another one but don&#x27;t got the money for them now.</li>
            <li> Every thing was good until I went to use it, the inks are dried up and the ones that are usable dont mix, they separate. I&#x27;m not happy.</li>
            <li> VERY RESPONSIBLE SELLER. I RECOMMEND IT. PRODUCT IS OFFERED AS IT ON PAGE</li>
            <li> pretty good machine. awesome customer service. i was told by a friend, and also read a few reviews about not using this ink. i had to buy new ink but other than that its a great set. the power supply might short out on you but i learned that after adjusting the rubber bands and making them less tight all worked out! i would buy this again, and again. i did a few tattoos on myself which turned out great, and my brother tated himself and my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> I got my tattoo guns today and it only took 5 days with basic shiping and that was over the weekend. I was happy with everything execpt there are no direction I dont no anything about putting this thing together, but I will figure it out. I will let youno later how it works.</li>
            <li> I love this tattoo kit , it works perfectly. They look very nice and they work with no problems and it come with a good amount of supples.</li>
            <li> i love this 6 gun tattoo machine kit it is great and cant wait to buy more&lt;br /&gt;tattoo stuff with them</li>
            <li> I really liked the kit, but I had problems with the guns not continuing to work.  I had trouble keeping them tuned correctly when they were working.</li>
            <li> ok  the kit was awesome came with everything just as pictured, the skull liner machine didnt work at all when the wires were atatched, had to use another liner machine that came in the kit. I tried tatting with the ink the kit came with and it got all chunky inside the tip i suggest getting other ink, i wont be using the ink after what happened, i had trouble getting the ink to even stay in the tip.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good kit, it comes with everything you need to bring the tools and cleaning brushes, ink is poor / intermediate quality, the cd it brings, has fair to good images tattoo, otherwise it is very good kit worth worth the price. The power and strength have 6 machines, needed some calibration, for people who are inciia would be guided by good tutorials on youtube because it has no manual whatsoever. If you want to start or already tatúas tattoo and want something more professional worth to invest in this valuable KIT.</li>
            <li> because they were a good buy i would tell everyone i know to buy them they work great a really good price.</li>
            <li> worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> mahalo for the tatt kit. Love everything that came with it. Haven&#x27;t tatt anyone yet but looking forward to tatt my boss soon.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much and aloha kakou.</li>
            <li> good starter kit but upgraded from that fast with new ink and new guns.</li>
            <li> This tattoo kit is pretty awesome. I like how it labeled the machines. The ink is poor quality which I already knew it would be. So if you plan on using the ink it comes with, use it on a practice skin not on a human canvas. Also the machines are not tuned very well, you have to tweek them a little bit. I changed some components out, tuned it to my comfort &amp; they work very well. The needles it comes with arent high quality needles though, they kinda want to dig the skin &amp; dont perform a very good line (thank god it was on myself). The shading needles werent too bad, they were better than the lining needles. But for the price &amp; the quality of the machines this is a good kit for rooks &amp; for experienced artists.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandson for Christmas.  He loves the product.  He used it several times already and it serves what he wanted it for</li>
            <li> Perfect for a beginner. Machines run great. Need better inks. Plenty of needle variation to practice with. Overall a very good purchase</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the kit!  But wish u had at least a couple guns that looked lady like.  An u needed  more copy pappers in it an at least one body pen.. needed more</li>
            <li> arrived on time and to the door, I have not set it up yet so no complaint.but it is a starter kit so I expect what I paid for and so for looks good.</li>
            <li> I have always been an artist and been incredibly interested in tattooing. I did a ton of research and after picking every kit I found apart, I decided to buy this one. It arrived in the mail the next day and I had recieved free shipping, I was so excited. I opened it up and gave it a whirl - it&#x27;s really so much better than I expected. I&#x27;m teaching myself how to tattoo via youtube videos and books (I didn&#x27;t even try the dvd that came with the kit). They included free stencils and rubber skin, along with all of the other stuff imaginable. Stuff to clean the machines, keys to lock your kit (which comes in a mildly badass briefcase), and pretty good ink. I&#x27;m so happy I bought this kit - I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better one.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing little tattoo kit...I love it...The original price was $299, but I picked it up for $89 here...I love it, and can easily see why the normal price would be $299.... This is a fantastic buy!1</li>
            <li> It has everything needed to do tattoos.  The extra guns and needles help with the differnt types of tattoos. The colors provided were good quality.</li>
            <li> the machines in this kit are sturdy and ready to cut right from the box. the digital power supply works great with a smooth/steady voltage. the ink isn&#x27;t the best out there, but other than that this is a great kit.</li>
            <li> This was for my son everything works great and exactly what he wanted . He started tattoo the same day he got it .</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend as a christmas gift.  She is a great artist and i thought getting her some tattoo guns might give her a new skill to practice.  It arrived and the DVD that comes with it talks about different guns than the ones that come in your box.  The video also gives instructions on how to use a bunch of other things that did not come with the package.  There is little to no explanation on how to use teh guns that come in the case and we are pretty much going to have to order a book to explain how the things we have work.  The last thing that i find frustrating about this is that they sent us 6 identicle guns, the only difference being the art on the casing of the guns.  When i bought this i was assuming it was 6 different guns set up for different purposes (shading contrasting outlining etc.)  but they are 6 of the sdame gun, i think its an outline gun.  take my advice and buy a single gun kit with a good starter book, and solid instructions.  not one of these made in china frustrations in a box.</li>
            <li> Everything came that was said. The fake skin is ehh (but what one isn&#x27;t lol). The inside divider in the box was broken, nothing horrible. The ink isn&#x27;t the best isn&#x27;t the worst. I bought a 14 pack of Mom&#x27;s ink. It looks fine on the test tats I did on my leg but only time will tell. The video is junk but that shouldn&#x27;t be the reason you buys this. If you are relying on the video to teach you don&#x27;t buy this. You need guidance from a pro. I know EVERYONE says it but it is so true. I ask so many questions you would think I didn&#x27;t know my ass from my elbow. The designed machines are cute as shit! All in all I would totally recommend this.</li>
            <li> Hubby was stoked to receive this as gift. (I did buy Mom&#x27;s ink after reading other reviews). The tattoo gun operation is to par and I like to quality for the price I paid....would give 5 stars if power supply switch had not given out day one.... still worth it.</li>
            <li> It works great! Worth the $</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift to my husband. He loves it !!! He is practicing with it as he has time ...perfect started kit are a few draw backs example DVD horrible , and no precise instructions on which machine does what ... If you know those problems going into purchase (like I did from reading reviews ) then it&#x27;s a great machine ... Need any of that info YouTube it :)</li>
            <li> Great item at a great price !!!</li>
            <li> Works to perfection money well spent</li>
            <li> I love this kit! It has everything you need to get started. The inks aren&#x27;t very good, but all the tattoo machines run well, I have learned a lot using this set. Would highly recommend to anyone wanting to learn to tattoo. It has all the tools you need to learn techniques and just get the feel of it in general. Use these inks while practicing on things other than people, then buy a good brand once you tattoo an actual person. Great for students or hobbyists.</li>
            <li> I added this to my wishlist at the beginning of the year.  I had recently had all of my equipment stolen in a home robbery and was basically going to have to re-buy everything, which was going to be very EXPENSIVE.  I saw this and figured for the price I could get the machines and if they ran crappy, I could rebuild them myself.  Well I never purchased this but my dad bought it for me for Christmas. I brought it home and was actually shocked about everything it came with.  Then I plugged in the machines to the power supply (not the greatest PS either but it does work) and started tuning them (with a tube and needle inserted) and was even more shocked to find out they all run VERY VERY WELL, TOTALLY SMOOTH, and I barely had to adjust any of them...there was only 1 that ran so so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So needless to say, I am totally pleased.  Typically, you cannot buy a quality tattoo machine for less than $150 and many run as high as $500.  These machines run just as well as the ones I had stolen (and had purchased individually for a lot of money).  For the price of this \\&quot;kit\\&quot; you are getting 6 very nice running machines...so WHO CARES ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE IN IT.  LOL, seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Yes it&#x27;s a crappy little foot switch and power supply, so what - - get a nice one, those aren&#x27;t expensive.&lt;br /&gt;2. DON&#x27;T USE THAT INK!  That is not good ink, do yourself and the recipient a favor, THROW IT AWAY.  Go get some quality ink.&lt;br /&gt;3. Don&#x27;t use the metal tubes, grips, and tips unless you get an autoclave...you must have a way to sterilize your equipment. Use disposable tubes available through Technical Tattoo Supply (.com), they don&#x27;t ask questions because they want people to be safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok that&#x27;s it - - this product receives a much deserved three snaps in Z formation.  It rocks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take care, happy (safe) tattooing!!</li>
            <li> Great!!!.&lt;br /&gt;All machines working.  love it  thanks</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter.  Works really well.  Reviews were right,  get better ink. The black is good but the red looks light and dull.</li>
            <li> garbage...never worked right and I don&#x27;t use it I tossed it in the trash couldn&#x27;t even rebuild em and the pwr supply was crap</li>
            <li> super exselente equipo los felicitos.</li>
            <li> Received on expected delivery date. All parts work, box is better than expected. This is a beginner kit and for the price I&#x27;m throughly satisfied. I will most definitely need better ink, needles, pedal and eventually get a better power supply. 3 liners and 3 shaders.</li>
            <li> i got this kit fast but it is really cheap the guns work but are of very poor quality and the ink is garbage you are better off piecing a kit together and it would def save u money</li>
            <li> Every thing was great.</li>
            <li> The machines that came with my set all seem like nice sturdy pieces of equipment.  And for those out there who can&#x27;t afford $100+ for a machine and or are just starting in this tattoo world, I think this little kit is about perfect... You get some nice machines and a power supply (some people have written that theirs died shortly after use... mine&#x27;s been running fine)... you get tubes and grips and a couple clips.... the skin is just a piece of rubber, and the inks are crap, but for practicing with on the rubber or some pigskin I say they are just fine.  This is a neat little kit... and I think, as a starter kit, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Love it but it REALLY needs to have a &amp;#34;How-To&amp;#34; guide on setting up the damn gun.... I still cannot figure out how to set it up..</li>
            <li> The machines are great, the power supply is worthy. Only thing I wouldn&#x27;t recommend is using the ink included, they&#x27;re s*** and runny as hell. It fades the very next day.</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm, everything still works although the ink is reallly cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m A biggener . &amp; I think it pretty good to start off with . I love it! Would recommend for starters like me :)</li>
            <li> Love the kit, it has everything you need to do tats!</li>
            <li> Very good kit, don&#x27;t use the ink. Power supply is good but one of the guns didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I just started to learn tattoos.  MY boss has been tattooing for years had him look at the set he couldn&#x27;t believe the deal the hole set is great.  Buy better ink seperatly.  The how to video sucks maybe try utube</li>
