            <li>makes- but in just a week I am seeing improvements which has me feeling positive!</li>
            <li>I really liked the taste as it was very minty and left my mouth fresh.</li>
            <li>I loved that it is created to support enamel health because I typically don&#x27;t get that in any of my mouth care routines.</li>
            <li>I love the fresh mint taste,  but I only wish it stayed around longer.</li>
            <li>The taste is ok, but I didn&#x27;t find it made my breath more fresh then usual.</li>
            <li>However, when I got the opportunity to try this product I will admit that I was excited to try something new.</li>
            <li>it really makes your breath fresh as well as cleaning your mouth and helping your enamel.</li>
            <li>Love the taste and with daily flossing and brushing your teeth will feel like heaven</li>
            <li>But I went ahead and opened the Enamel Health mouthwash and got ready to give it a shot!</li>
            <li>i love this and will have to start buying it regularly</li>
            <li>I most likely will be buying this from now on thanks to @Influenster!</li>
            <li>I love that I can freshen my breath and promote the health of my teeth at the same time.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend if you care for your teeth. :)</li>
            <li>and this is great for me because i am a coffee fanatic as well as a lemonade fan</li>
            <li>I am so much more likely to use mouthwash</li>
            <li>Both my husband and I added it to our morning and night routines and have been pleasantly surprised by its mild yet powerful flavor.</li>
            <li>I love that this #ColgateEnamelHealth mouthwash is gentle, it makes me actually want to use it.</li>
            <li>This Enamel Health Anti-Cavity Fluoride toothpaste not only leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean but it strengthens enamel and helps replenish calcium.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel soo much cleaner after using this mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I really like Colgate Enamel Health Anticavity Fluoride Mout Wash.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Influenster</li>
            <li>It also does give you fresh breath for a while, however; crest still gives me personally a longer period of fresh breath.</li>
            <li>but I like it a lot more than other mouthwashes.</li>
            <li>tried the mouthwash in addition to my regular tooth brushing routine this morning, and I can say that my breath was fresh for much longer than with just brushing.</li>
            <li>Personally, it does not burn my mouth like other mouthwashes and we love the minty flavor!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>Likes the little cup top.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as other brands.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels so clean all day long!</li>
            <li>I use it everyday in the morning to make sure my breath and teeth are on point.</li>
            <li>This is now my new mouthwash</li>
            <li>and although it has a minty taste I find it to be harsh and strong .</li>
            <li>I also have really sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>As a dental health professional I would not ask my patients to uses this .</li>
            <li>only time will tell how much of a difference</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this rinse for over a week now and am anxious to see the benefits when I go for a dental check up in October, hopeful that for once the visit will be pain free.</li>
            <li>I think a good mouthwash is essential to oral hygiene, and Colgate is definitely stepping up their game.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed a major improvement with my teeth and breathe.</li>

            <li> I love that this #ColgateEnamelHealth mouthwash is gentle, it makes me actually want to use it.</li>
            <li> This Enamel Health Anti-Cavity Fluoride toothpaste not only leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean but it strengthens enamel and helps replenish calcium.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel soo much cleaner after using this mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I really like Colgate Enamel Health Anticavity Fluoride Mout Wash.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Influenster</li>
            <li> It also does give you fresh breath for a while, however; crest still gives me personally a longer period of fresh breath.</li>
            <li> but I like it a lot more than other mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> tried the mouthwash in addition to my regular tooth brushing routine this morning, and I can say that my breath was fresh for much longer than with just brushing.</li>
            <li> Personally, it does not burn my mouth like other mouthwashes and we love the minty flavor!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Likes the little cup top.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as other brands.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so clean all day long!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday in the morning to make sure my breath and teeth are on point.</li>
            <li> This is now my new mouthwash</li>
            <li> and although it has a minty taste I find it to be harsh and strong .</li>
            <li> I also have really sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> As a dental health professional I would not ask my patients to uses this .</li>
            <li> only time will tell how much of a difference</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this rinse for over a week now and am anxious to see the benefits when I go for a dental check up in October, hopeful that for once the visit will be pain free.</li>
            <li> I think a good mouthwash is essential to oral hygiene, and Colgate is definitely stepping up their game.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a major improvement with my teeth and breathe.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t harsh and doesn&#x27;t have that harsh burn like so many other mouthwashes out there</li>
            <li> it would be really harsh early in the morning..</li>
            <li> I actually had just ran out of my previous mouthwash</li>
            <li> so my teeth need a little extra TLC.</li>
            <li> My teeth are less sensitive to cold and sweets than they were a week ago (particularly my molar that my dentist told me had starting signs of a cavity)</li>
            <li> It is a bit hard to open.</li>
            <li> I am a regular coffee drinker (at least 2-3 cups a day)</li>
            <li> Another thing i like about it is the enamel strengthening that it gives it helps protect your enamel against the foods that help break it down</li>
            <li> but I did not even know the half of it until I tried it.</li>
            <li> So I received my #wellness voxbox from @Influenster and was a little indifferent to the products in the box.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mouthwash for a little over a week now</li>
            <li> It is not strong and doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth.</li>
            <li> The flavor is not as intense, there is no burning sensation and the aftertaste was not as bad.</li>
            <li> The dangers of fluoride have already been proven and I usually avoid it where I can, but I figured I&#x27;d just try this out for influenster.</li>
            <li> The burn is so bad that you can&#x27;t stand it, only been using it a few weeks and already noticed that my enamel and been strengthened.</li>
            <li> and it does it all without that annoying burning sensation that other brands have with their mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I have bad enamel</li>
            <li> And the burn isn&#x27;t that bad!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth or leave a nasty taste in my mouth.</li>

            <li> i received this free from influenster about a week ago and i love it. it really makes your breath fresh as well as cleaning your mouth and helping your enamel. i will be making the switch to this mouthwash. also i like that its alcohol-free i was using one that had alcohol before and it would be really harsh early in the morning.. not the problem  with this product .</li>
            <li> Great mouthwash! I got to try it free with @influensters #wellnessvoxbox. I am glad they sent it. I like using after meals and in the morning.  It has a good taste with no bad aftertaste and is overall effective. I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have bad enamel so this helps me. It works and it leaves my breath minty fresh. I got this free from influnester for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this mouthwash. It has a nice winter fresh taste, without being too overpowering. I like that this mouth wash actually makes my teeth look whiter after using. I think a good mouthwash is essential to oral hygiene, and Colgate is definitely stepping up their game. It also does give you fresh breath for a while, however; crest still gives me personally a longer period of fresh breath. But this is a nice product, I&#x27;m feeling it.</li>
            <li> I received this amazing product from @influenster for testing purposes. This product leaves your mouth free and clean with the great minty taste. It is not strong and doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth. I am also gaining an entry into a sweepstakes #ColgateEnamelHealth</li>
            <li> I received this mouthwash for free through the Influenster program! This review will earn me an entry into a sweepstakes, however these opinions are mine and mine alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the mouthwash in addition to my regular tooth brushing routine this morning, and I can say that my breath was fresh for much longer than with just brushing. Additionally, my teeth still feel clean, even after eating breakfast and a deliciously garlic tomato-y pasta lunch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say with some authority that this mouthwash is worth a try for those who think other brands may be too astringent, or those that leave blue or purple stains on your teeth!</li>
            <li> #ColgateEnamelHealth I got this product in my #WellnessVoxBox for free from @Influenster for testing and entering the sweepstakes.&lt;br /&gt;This is the brand of toothpaste I use and highly recommend it, but this mouthwash is good minty flavor, but I have to stick with my Listerine. I gave this to my sister to use. Good to use after every brushing to help keep enamel strong and clean breath. Healthy gums and teeth too. :)</li>
            <li> #ColgateEnamelHealth. I received thus complimentary product trough @influenster. I really like this mouthwash because it is not to harsh like listerine would be. Love the taste and with daily flossing and brushing your teeth will feel like heaven</li>
            <li> I received this #colgateenamelhealth from @influenster for free to test out in their &amp;#34;wellness vox box&amp;#34;. The mouthwash works okay, but I find it pretty ironic that fluoride would be in anything labeled for &amp;#34;welness&amp;#34;. The dangers of fluoride have already been proven and I usually avoid it where I can, but I figured I&#x27;d just try this out for influenster. I doubt I&#x27;d ever buy this mouthwash in the store although it&#x27;s pretty cheap. The taste is ok, but I didn&#x27;t find it made my breath more fresh then usual.</li>
            <li> I was given this mouthwash to try through a sample @Influenster. I actually had just ran out of my previous mouthwash so this was perfect timing to try out #ColgateEnamelHealth. I will say that I definitely liked it. I loved that it is created to support enamel health because I typically don&#x27;t get that in any of my mouth care routines. I also have really sensitive teeth and this mouthwash didn&#x27;t disturb them. I really liked the taste as it was very minty and left my mouth fresh. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I tried #ColgateEnamelHealth complimetary from @Influenster and my breath was very fresh! It isn&#x27;t burny! By writing this, I am gaining entry into the sweepstakes.</li>
            <li> Fresh breath and protection for my teeth all in one product.  I have really liked using this for a week now.  I received it complimentary from @Influenster for testing purposes and to enter a contest.  This review is solely my personal opinion.  #ColgateEnamelHealth #contest&lt;br /&gt;The product is a bit mild for me.  I like a very strong mouthwash but once I use the product it leaves my mouth feeling clean and refreshed.  If you prefer milder formula mouthwashes, you will love this!</li>
            <li> I recently received this bottle of #ColgateEnamelHealth Mouthwash from @Influenster complimentary for review purposes and so far am loving it! Both my husband and I added it to our morning and night routines and have been pleasantly surprised by its mild yet powerful flavor. I have noticed it has kept my breath feeling fresher, longer - which is a huge plus since I spend most of the day running around. Personally, it does not burn my mouth like other mouthwashes and we love the minty flavor! Couldn&#x27;t recommend this more if you are looking to switch up your mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and strengthens my teeth. I love the fresh mint taste,  but I only wish it stayed around longer. I received the product free to try out, and I&#x27;m gaining entry into a sweepstakes. #ColgateEnamelHealth @influenster</li>
            <li> So I received my #wellness voxbox from @Influenster and was a little indifferent to the products in the box. I don&#x27;t normally use mouth wash because most of them are too strong and really burn my mouth. And I don&#x27;t like the aftertaste that they leave. But I went ahead and opened the Enamel Health mouthwash and got ready to give it a shot! I can&#x27;t say I LOVE it but I like it a lot more than other mouthwashes. The flavor is not as intense, there is no burning sensation and the aftertaste was not as bad. There is still an aftertaste but I can handle it. I am glad I gave this product a chance! #colgateenamelhealth&lt;br /&gt;I received this complimentary item from Influenster for the purpose of testing and reviewing. All opinion expressed in this review are my own.</li>
            <li> I got a bottle of this free from @influenster. And I love it!!! My mouth feels so clean all day long! And the burn isn&#x27;t that bad! I may switch!! #ColgateEnamelHealth. These aren&#x27;t own opinions! Even though I&#x27;m getting an entry into a sweepstakes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many mouthwash products and this one I love the most. It doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth or leave a nasty taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> i received my #ColgateEnamelHealth free from @Influenster in my ##wellnessvoxbox  the mouthwash isnt too strong and after using it it keeps my mouth feeling fresh and clean with the added bonus of better enamel health. i love this and will have to start buying it regularly cause enamel is what keeps your teeth strong and healthy so you can keep them longer and without enamel youll have tooth issues so YAY for Colgate Enamel Health Mouthwash</li>
            <li> @influenster #colgateenamelhealth&lt;br /&gt;Got this product from influesnter for free to review.Really good mouthwash, refreshing with a good flavor. The burn is so bad that you can&#x27;t stand it, only been using it a few weeks and already noticed that my enamel and been strengthened. I had a cavity starting that I could feel and since using this mouth wash the cavity isn&#x27;t bothering me anymore.</li>
            <li> Well first off let me start by saying I received my bottle of #ColgateEnamelHealth from @Influenster 100% complimentary to try out and give my honest opinion of and to be entered into their sweepstakes. I&#x27;ve been using this mouthwash for a little over a week now and I like how fresh it makes my breath smell. I also like how it doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming alcohol burn to it. My teeth feel soo much cleaner after using this mouthwash. I most likely will be buying this from now on thanks to @Influenster!</li>
            <li> I will admit that I&#x27;ve not always been a fan of Colgate products. However, when I got the opportunity to try this product I will admit that I was excited to try something new. This mouthwash makes your teeth feel clean all day (and in my case, even after drinking a can of soda!) and it does it all without that annoying burning sensation that other brands have with their mouthwash. Definitely picking up another bottle once mine runs out. This product was provided by Influenster complimentary for testing purposes but the opinions are all my own.</li>
            <li> I first tried this mouth wash for free through Influenster but this is my personal opinion: I really like Colgate Enamel Health Anticavity Fluoride Mout Wash. I love that I can freshen my breath and promote the health of my teeth at the same time. I tastes good and leaves me feeling clean and fresh afterwards. I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> #ColgateEnamelHealth and tag @Influenster I  received this item to sample and although it has a minty taste I find it to be harsh and strong . As a dental health professional I would not ask my patients to uses this .</li>
            <li> Love it, so minty and makes my mouth feel so clean. Not as strong as other brands. I use it everyday in the morning to make sure my breath and teeth are on point. Likes the little cup top. It is a bit hard to open. I got this product free to review for influenster. #colgateenamelhealth @influenster</li>
            <li> I receive this from Influenster, my options are not based off of that. I&#x27;m loving this mouthwash so far! Fresh tasting and a healthy choice for your mouth. I would definitely recommend if you care for your teeth. :)</li>
            <li> I am a product tester for influenster.com i was sent this free from influenster for testing and review purposes only all thoughts are my own. Lets get to the review, I am already a colgate fan I use colgate toothpaste as well as colgate toothbrushes so i was excited when i got this product! It does the job by keeping your breath fresh but it isn&#x27;t harsh and doesn&#x27;t have that harsh burn like so many other mouthwashes out there so that was a great plus. Another thing i like about it is the enamel strengthening that it gives it helps protect your enamel against the foods that help break it down and this is great for me because i am a coffee fanatic as well as a lemonade fan so this comes in handy!! If your a person looking for a product that will assist with helping protect your enamel this is the product for you. #colgateenamelhealth #influenster</li>
            <li> I got this product for free from influenster and I am gaining entry into a contest however all views are truthful and by me! Absolutely loved this product! The mouthwash is not too strong and I have fresh breath after. Does not sting or burn your mouth! Plus I love the color.</li>
            <li> I got this #ColgateEnamelHealth mouthwash as a free sample from @influenster and by far is the best mouthwash that I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my teeth in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to receive this product for free in my Wellness Vox Box from @Influenster because Colgate has always been my first choice when it comes to oral health, it&#x27;s a brand I trust because they take oral health personally.  This Enamel Health Anti-Cavity Fluoride toothpaste not only leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean but it strengthens enamel and helps replenish calcium.  The problem with tooth enamel is that once it&#x27;s gone you don&#x27;t get it back so it&#x27;s crucial to be proactive in taking care of it.  This rinse reverses the softening of enamel and prevents cavities from forming and the taste isn&#x27;t overpowering.  I&#x27;ve been using this rinse for over a week now and am anxious to see the benefits when I go for a dental check up in October, hopeful that for once the visit will be pain free. #ColgateEnamelHealth #contest.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this mouthwash! I received it from influenced to test and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Influenster I was able to try out this amazing mouthwash for free and I am gaining entry into the sweepstakes. I have heard good things about this mouthwash but I did not even know the half of it until I tried it. This is now my new mouthwash and I love it. It makes my mouth smell and feel fresh! You must go out and get this mouthwash! Definitely the best mouthwash I have tried and now every morning after I brush my teeth I use this mouthwash and I have noticed a major improvement with my teeth and breathe.</li>
            <li> This product was sent to me by @influenster to test and review. This review also grants me an entry to a sweepstakes. That aside, #colgateenamelhealth is truly a great mouthwash. It doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth off and I love the taste! I am so much more likely to use mouthwash 2 times a day with this mouthwash. I also like the packaging- sleek design and easy to read ingredients and instructions. I recommend this product- perfect for the whole family!</li>
            <li> I received this product to test from @influenster. I didn&#x27;t want to write a review until I had time to see if it actually worked. I have been using it regularly for about a week now, and I can already tell a difference. I am a regular coffee drinker (at least 2-3 cups a day) so my teeth need a little extra TLC. I love that this #ColgateEnamelHealth mouthwash is gentle, it makes me actually want to use it. My teeth are less sensitive to cold and sweets than they were a week ago (particularly my molar that my dentist told me had starting signs of a cavity) only time will tell how much of a difference this mouthwash makes- but in just a week I am seeing improvements which has me feeling positive!</li>
