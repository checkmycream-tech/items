            <li>Very sweet and sexy fragrance</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not too sweet and floral but not to strong of a floral!~</li>
            <li>so it is easy to hold.</li>
            <li>And, this is a true Bath and Body works product unlike many of the knock offs I&#x27;ve seen on amazon and ebay.</li>
            <li>GOOD QUALITY, SO FAR, FAST SHIPPING, GOOD PRICE</li>
            <li>It is extremely light.  </li>
            <li>I would have to agree that it&#x27;s a light scent.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this fragrance....</li>
            <li>I discovered this scent was available as a body spray and purchased it</li>
            <li>But either I didn&#x27;t read the fine print, or this fragrance is  a knockoff of the original.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t purchase again although it&#x27;s my favorite fragrance right now.</li>
            <li>A very fresh and sensual smell</li>
            <li>THIS FRAGRANCE IS CLEAN &amp; LIGHT</li>
            <li>One of my favorite scents from bath and bodyworks... smells slightly sweet, fresh, floral.</li>
            <li>A+  Originally thought they made error in scent but realized it was my error</li>
            <li>You may want to try the stores first to see if you can catch a better deal</li>
            <li>I will definitely be returning, the item arrived early and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>But although its not bad.</li>
            <li>and they were very willing to exchange my product</li>
            <li>&amp; IT IS A GREAT FOR EVERYDAY USE.......</li>
            <li>Not too strong...just right.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone who likes a light, flowery fragrance that does not knock people down when you get in an elevator!</li>
            <li>Even though it is just a body spray it smells nice for a long time.</li>
            <li>there are sensitive people who can&#x27;t take strong smells</li>
            <li>Shipping is very fast.</li>
            <li>I first tried this product (JCB fragrance mist)</li>
            <li>I love the Japanese cherry blossom line from Bath &amp; Body Works.  </li>
            <li>Not too overwhelming but enough to know it is there.  </li>
            <li>, I will purchase more later</li>
            <li>fast shipping will order some more big bottle!!!</li>
            <li>I expected better smell with fresh elements.</li>
            <li>I loved this perfume the first time I ever smelled it, it has a pure refreshing smell and it does not get a stale oder during the day</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, and product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>One spray is enough to make my whole apartment smell strongly for a whole day.</li>
            <li>Very  high quality for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>does not have a scent i can finish the whole bottle and don&#x27;t smell anything</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this scent.  </li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>Thanks And God BlessðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li>I really like all of the Cherry Blossom products and think they smell heavenly.</li>
            <li>First of all, the new scent is weaker.</li>
            <li>Whenever I used it I was left with a fresh soft clean smell and my girlfriends would always ask &amp;#34;mmmmm, what perfume is that?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>My clue was that the label wasn&#x27;t in the same font as the original.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves this scent on me as well, we finally found a scent we both love equally.</li>
            <li>UNLESS you build up uses over and over again on a particular item.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend, it smells clean and has a soft fragrance.</li>
            <li>The Japanese Cherry Blossom that I first used is not what is being made today.</li>
            <li>This body spray smells fantastic, but because it&#x27;s a body spray and not eau de parfum or eau de toilette, the scent doesn&#x27;t last as long.  </li>
            <li>If by chance you have dry skin, just use the fragrance right after you moisturize your skin and the scent will hold well.  </li>
            <li>First, my favorite fragrance Bath &amp; Body Japanese Cherry Blossom was offered at half price; then the Japanese Cherry Blossom was delivered several days in advance of the delivery date; AND it was brand new!</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s strong enough that other people notice it on me.</li>
            <li>The scent last longer then 5 mins and thats without having to spray too much on you.</li>
            <li>but I kept and will purchasing others in very near future</li>
            <li>&quot; Unfortunately, the older versions will not be available forever at Amazon, so I am buying them while I can.</li>
            <li>It is soft and long lasting.  </li>

            <li> I was expecting a much smaller bottle than I got, and I was exited that I can use this for so long.</li>
            <li> If you like a strong scent, this will do it, but didn&#x27;t do it for me unfortunately.</li>
            <li> the smell will not stay on you for long.  </li>
            <li> Love this fragrance but soooo frustrated that it doesn&#x27;t last any time at all</li>
            <li> I have not been to Bath and Body Works in so long due to all the fragrances that mingle in the air.</li>
            <li> I prefer light scents, that simply drift a bit in the air as you walk by, but this will fill the room with your perfumey smell :(  </li>
            <li> Description and delivery were as expected!</li>
            <li> But just saying, I went to bath and body works the other day and saw it for sale there for almost half off.</li>
            <li> too heavy a scent for me.  </li>
            <li> If I wanted to wear a cologne, I have a few favorites that I use from time to time.</li>
            <li> However, with this bad economy, it is hard to find anything original anymore.</li>
            <li> nothing negative to say...</li>
            <li> That may just mean that I need to get the purfume.</li>
            <li> Manufacturers are constantly cutting corners to save money.</li>
            <li> I was EXTREMELY disappointed.</li>
            <li> But I am very disappointed that the manufacturer is changing its products.</li>

            <li> I have been usung this product for a while one of my favorites from Bath and Body</li>
            <li> I first tried this product (JCB fragrance mist) becaue it was a gift and I fell in love with the smell. I then began hunting for more. I still love the scent but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s strong enough that other people notice it on me. That may just mean that I need to get the purfume. Which will be my next purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  It is soft and long lasting.  I wear this during the summer because it is light and airy!</li>
            <li> nothing negative to say...great product, great purchase. Arrived on time and price was excellent!  Will purchase in future.  A+  Originally thought they made error in scent but realized it was my error and they were very willing to exchange my product but I kept and will purchasing others in very near future</li>
            <li> This smells as gorgeous as the lotions and I love that it&#x27;s cheaper than buying it from the bbw store itself!</li>
            <li> This fragrance Mist makes you feel beautiful... I hope it is always around.    GREAT PRODUCT!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the Japanese cherry blossom line from Bath &amp; Body Works.  This body spray smells fantastic, but because it&#x27;s a body spray and not eau de parfum or eau de toilette, the scent doesn&#x27;t last as long.  But it&#x27;s still a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Gave this as gift to wife. She likes the stuff. She&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the Bath &amp; Body Works Japanese Cherry Blossom Body Mist I purchased.  I love the scent.  It is also a good size bottle for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this smell!!!!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents from bath and bodyworks... smells slightly sweet, fresh, floral. I am not one for floral smells i am more of a sweet scent person and i love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> glad to see it make it before christmas</li>
            <li> Description and delivery were as expected!</li>
            <li> I Wish it was a bit stronger so that i wouldnt have to keep re-applying   the perfume on myself. However i think the product itself is a vey nice  product because the smell is very beautiful. It smells like cherry flowers  if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li> I bought the Japanese Cherry Blossom for some friends, myself&lt;br /&gt;and my daughter for Christmas 2010. It was a big hit, everyone&lt;br /&gt;loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this fragrance to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is great for a light freshening scent great price at 7.00 just wish it was a Prime item!  I recommend the fragrance it&#x27;s not too sweet and floral but not to strong of a floral!~</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful fragrance.  It is extremely light.  If you have the type of skin and hair that holds a scent, all is well.  If by chance you have dry skin, just use the fragrance right after you moisturize your skin and the scent will hold well.  It&#x27;s also great to spray through your hair :)</li>
            <li> I have never been happier with a scent in my life. I absolutely love this scent! Shipping was very fast, I am extremely happy!! My husband loves this scent on me as well, we finally found a scent we both love equally. I will buy this from now on!!!</li>
            <li> The shipment came on time that&#x27;s a plus.  But either I didn&#x27;t read the fine print, or this fragrance is  a knockoff of the original. My clue was that the label wasn&#x27;t in the same font as the original.  I would have to agree that it&#x27;s a light scent. I sprayed it liberally on my clothes and skin this morning and now it&#x27;s 4:30pm and I can&#x27;t smell it at all. good thing it&#x27;s the 8oz size cause I definitely have to re-apply.    Won&#x27;t purchase again although it&#x27;s my favorite fragrance right now.</li>
            <li> I have now bought me two bottle of this spray.  It smells great last all day, and it a great gift or just bought for yourself.  The spray body is a good form so it is easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Some one gave me this as a gift and when the bottle finished I found it in Amazon and purchased it love the scent.</li>
            <li> excellent aroma, happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> does not have a scent i can finish the whole bottle and don&#x27;t smell anything</li>
            <li> excellent fragrance be delighted</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this spray as does my boyfriend :)And, this is a true Bath and Body works product unlike many of the knock offs I&#x27;ve seen on amazon and ebay.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this item. I spray it all over and it last all day. I have even gotten lots of compliments :).   Definitely recommend, it smells clean and has a soft fragrance.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this scent.  Not too overwhelming but enough to know it is there.  It really is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be somewhat like the body splash I ordered through B&amp;BW but it is not at all.  Though it says it&#x27;s a mist, it&#x27;s more like a perfume, &amp; too heavy a scent for me.  I prefer light scents, that simply drift a bit in the air as you walk by, but this will fill the room with your perfumey smell :(  If you like a strong scent, this will do it, but didn&#x27;t do it for me unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this fragrance....it&#x27;s not overpowering and where I work there are sensitive people who can&#x27;t take strong smells</li>
            <li> It smells like alcohol. Doesn&#x27;t last. I was EXTREMELY disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love the sent. It&#x27;s my favorite. Not too strong...just right.</li>
            <li> Amazon delivered big time! First, my favorite fragrance Bath &amp; Body Japanese Cherry Blossom was offered at half price; then the Japanese Cherry Blossom was delivered several days in advance of the delivery date; AND it was brand new! I was able to get two for the price of one!</li>
            <li> The smell is not strong.it&#x27;s light,do not last long</li>
            <li> Very  high quality for a reasonable price. Shipping is very fast.</li>
            <li> GOOD QUALITY, SO FAR, FAST SHIPPING, GOOD PRICE</li>
            <li> I really like this, I will purchase more later</li>
            <li> I was given the anti bacterial gel hand sanitizer version if this scent as a gift. Whenever I used it I was left with a fresh soft clean smell and my girlfriends would always ask &amp;#34;mmmmm, what perfume is that?&amp;#34; And I said no its just my hand sanitizer lol. Them I discovered this scent was available as a body spray and purchased it and it has the same delicious effect. No it is not a perfume it is a body spray but the smell is excellent.</li>
            <li> on time , good product</li>
            <li> the smell will not stay on you for long.  i didn&#x27;t like it for the price.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, and product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Love it, my favorite!</li>
            <li> I love this scent because I always get compliments on it. The scent last longer then 5 mins and thats without having to spray too much on you.</li>
            <li> I have not been to Bath and Body Works in so long due to all the fragrances that mingle in the air. I was delighted to find this product online and it smeels just as I remembered it.</li>
            <li> Love it just got it today fast shipping will order some more big bottle!!!</li>
            <li> This has always been one of my favorite scents! But just saying, I went to bath and body works the other day and saw it for sale there for almost half off. You may want to try the stores first to see if you can catch a better deal</li>
            <li> My sister turned me on to this wonderful fragrance years ago, and I have been wearing it ever since. However, with this bad economy, it is hard to find anything original anymore. In recent years, this fragrance has gone through changes. Yes, the packaging is different, but so is the scent. Manufacturers are constantly cutting corners to save money. The Japanese Cherry Blossom that I first used is not what is being made today. First of all, the new scent is weaker. It does not last. And they started making it into an eau de toilette, which I won&#x27;t buy. If I wanted to wear a cologne, I have a few favorites that I use from time to time. I like the body sprays because they are lighter and fresher. I can wear them to work with no problems. I don&#x27;t offend anyone. Instead, people are constantly asking me what I wear. In fact, I wore Japanese Cherry Blossom yesterday when I went to the movies and a woman in the restroom asked me the name of the fragrance. She then said she would have to get some. I know it smells great! I also layer the scent. But I am very disappointed that the manufacturer is changing its products. They should stick with what is great and keep it. I now come to Amazon.com to purchase the \\&quot;oldies but goodies.\\&quot; Unfortunately, the older versions will not be available forever at Amazon, so I am buying them while I can. You should too!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent!</li>
            <li> I expected better smell with fresh elements. But although its not bad. i decided to present it to my friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked this scent and get tons of compliments when I wear it. It&#x27;s light and perfect for spring and summer. The bottle seems to last me a long time.</li>
            <li> I cannot complain.  All the products meet my standard</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with my order. I will be placing many more. Thanks And God BlessðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> The was received in a promptly manner and was as discribed</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance but soooo frustrated that it doesn&#x27;t last any time at all UNLESS you build up uses over and over again on a particular item. I use it on sleeping pillows and bedspread.  Need to research if is comes stronger!!!!</li>
            <li> Very sweet and sexy fragrance all st tgs same time.</li>
            <li> I love this body spray. I was expecting a much smaller bottle than I got, and I was exited that I can use this for so long. I will definitely be returning, the item arrived early and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> i buy it on own bath and body&#x27;s store on KSA and i liked it , this on is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better than it.&lt;br /&gt;i loved it .</li>
            <li> en espera del paquete por favor entregarlo en la direcciÃ³n nueva de liberty express  MEDLEY FLORIDA 33178-1044** mil gracias</li>
            <li> I really love the cherry blossom scent from bath and body works, but this perfume is VERY STRONG. One spray is enough to make my whole apartment smell strongly for a whole day. Use sparingly.</li>
            <li> LOVE this scent - you smell like you just stepped out of the shower!!!!</li>
            <li> happy with this product!!</li>
            <li> I loved this perfume the first time I ever smelled it, it has a pure refreshing smell and it does not get a stale oder during the day</li>
            <li> love  the way it smells</li>
            <li> Hmmmmm, this is me - humming with delight over this Japanese Cherry Blossom body spray. I love how it smells. It leaves a lingering scent on me that is not over powering or obnoxious - like some perfumes. I really like all of the Cherry Blossom products and think they smell heavenly. I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone who likes a light, flowery fragrance that does not knock people down when you get in an elevator! Very very nice!</li>
            <li> The best ever.  I hope they never stop producing it.</li>
            <li> THIS FRAGRANCE IS CLEAN &amp; LIGHT&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT........BOUGHT IT YEARS AGO &amp; IT IS A GREAT FOR EVERYDAY USE.......I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragrance, and so does my husband. Even though it is just a body spray it smells nice for a long time. A very fresh and sensual smell</li>
            <li> Makes for a nice room spray</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been wearing it for years and this was the deal of all deals.  She loves it and I do too.</li>
            <li> Love this scent. Will buy again when I run out.</li>
