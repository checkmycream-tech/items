            <li>I am 44 and my skin is otherwise in very good shape....</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m hoping I can give a great review at that time.</li>
            <li>Great lip cream....</li>
            <li>Many stores carry this product, but this is the best price you will find.</li>
            <li>If I were 25, I would start using it with probably good results.</li>
            <li>I tend to lick my lips, so try to keep the cream there for a goodly part of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>after that I should know is it is good product or not.</li>
            <li>I depend on helpful and thought-out reviews in my own purchasing, and try to keep my review karma in good</li>
            <li>Returning customer, I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>, I think Dermelect may be on to something good, so although I should be writing holiday cards, here you are, ladies and gentlemen, for what it is worth!  </li>
            <li>does a nice job, as well as any OTC product, better than many.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>(I did quit in 2002:).  </li>
            <li>We all hope for miracle results, and perhaps as the weeks go on it may improve more.</li>
            <li>None of the many others I&#x27;ve tried have.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many others, including some which cost significantly more.  </li>
            <li>#1 criterion for buying anything is satisfied with Dermelect - they are said to not test on animals.  </li>
            <li>I can tell a wonderful difference in smoothness and the darkness  around the upper lip area is fading as well!</li>
            <li>I think that their intentions were good, but it really has not made any changes....</li>
            <li>It has helped heal the tiniest of fine lines but not the deeper ones.  </li>
            <li>The cream does feel and taste fine, so you can call it a lip area moisturizer, in any</li>

            <li>It really makes my skin smooth around my lips.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth your patience and money.</li>
            <li>It could well be worth $50 to give it a try no matter how permanent you suspect your lip lines may be.</li>

            <li>used almost the entire tube and not seeing any real significant changes.</li>
            <li>the best product for wrinkles above upper lift, especially if you were smoker.  </li>

            <li>Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t experienced any benefit or improvement to the vertical lines I have on my upper lip.  </li>
            <li>-I had such high hopes for it!</li>

            <li>No noticeable difference so far.  </li>

            <li>I am looking forward to trying the new &amp;#34;professional strength&amp;#34; which I discovered after I ordered the last time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve never been a smoker and try to keep a pleasant smile on my face, so was appalled to see hideous vertical lip lines trying to break through after this last (50-really something) birthday.</li>

            <li>t improved the look of my upper lip considerably.</li>
            <li>I can live with a few lines (they are much softer) but that&lt;br /&gt;mustache</li>

            <li>Semi-kidding there, as a vain woman who wouldn&#x27;t wish those ugliest of age-lines on you, but seriously, make a resolution to make sure you&#x27;re not helping to fund the evil-doers who torture dogs and other animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> can just say, I am simply amazed that after using for only 4 days both am and pm, that those lines above my lip are hardly noticeable!!  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I noticed very little change even after using it religiously for a month.  </li>

            <li> A waste of $$$ spent.  </li>
            <li> absolutely no improvement, a waste of money.</li>

            <li> Little change , but not even a month.</li>
            <li> given that it&#x27;s a tough skin problem to solve and that a tube should last months</li>
            <li> I expected at least SOME improvement from this product.</li>
            <li> wasted my money....</li>
            <li> It took a few weeks of applying every day and on the&lt;br /&gt;verge of giving up, it kicked in!  </li>
            <li> Not seeing results after 3 weeks, and not sure I ever will.</li>
            <li> It was an expensive product &amp; I feel I&#x27;ve wasted my money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would be uncomfortable advising you not to buy it if your vertical lip lines ARE already there</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Fantastic.  Seems to be working.</li>
            <li> After a month I could see a change softer looking</li>
            <li> I have used this 2+ times a day as directed in addition to always keeping a moisturizer on my lips. I haven&#x27;t noticed any visible difference except when I look at my reflection in the mirror without my glasses on.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and feel that it has helped some.  I am looking forward to trying the new &amp;#34;professional strength&amp;#34; which I discovered after I ordered the last time.  I noticed the price was lower than in the past, and then saw an ad for the new stronger version.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to a lot of other reviews ..this product does not work at all for someone in their 60&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I noticed very little change even after using it religiously for a month.  The product if not worth the expense.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product faithfully for several years. It does just what it says. Many stores carry this product, but this is the best price you will find. Using this once or twice a day, I only use 2 tubes per year. A little goes a long way. I have very sensitive skin, and this is non-irritating.</li>
            <li> i could not see any difference using this product. it did not help at all for me. maybe i am not using it correctly.</li>
            <li> Noticed everyone seems to focus on lip lines. Have had some improvement&lt;br /&gt;but you have to use it every day.  What I bought it for was discoloration on&lt;br /&gt;upper lip that made me look like I had a mustache much like&lt;br /&gt;Charlie Chaplin.  It took a few weeks of applying every day and on the&lt;br /&gt;verge of giving up, it kicked in!  Went to apply makeup one day and noticed&lt;br /&gt;vast improvement.  I can live with a few lines (they are much softer) but that&lt;br /&gt;mustache (shadowing) had to go.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Does not do what it advertises to do!</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing.  A waste of $$$ spent.  Use a moisturizer, results will be the same.</li>
            <li> Another cosmetic rip off.Like all the other products out there that promise the world and deliver nothing,add&lt;br /&gt;this one to the list.</li>
            <li> Age 63, numerous lines around mouth.  Am using Upper Lip &amp; Perioral Treatment.  Wrinkles started improving within 2 weeks.  Haven&#x27;t disappeared but greatly improved, especially those around lower lip.  I too think it&#x27;s a product I should have started using 30 years ago.      The lip treatment worked so well, I also bought the Empower MP6 Anti-Wrinkle Treatment.  Not seeing results after 3 weeks, and not sure I ever will.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when this product actually performed as I had hoped.  It visibly lessened the lines around my upper (and lower) lips.  I&#x27;ve ordered it again.</li>
            <li> Seems to keep red lipstick from bleeding into lines outside of lipline.  Have not noticed that it removes lines on lips.</li>
            <li> the best product for wrinkles above upper lift, especially if you were smoker.  Will use for the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> Works fo me age 62 former smoker😎</li>
            <li> I saw no improvement.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a month and have not seen any changes in the lines above or below my lip. I will not be reordering.</li>
            <li> I believe this would work for prevention if you hadn&#x27;t smoked for 35 years (I did quit in 2002:).  It has helped heal the tiniest of fine lines but not the deeper ones.  If I were 25, I would start using it with probably good results.</li>
            <li> This product claimed to erase the vertical lines around your mouth if you are an ex smoker.  I think that their intentions were good, but it really has not made any changes....too bad-I had such high hopes for it!</li>
            <li> absolutely no improvement, a waste of money. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used 2-3 times.  I don&#x27;t see much of a difference yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-40s (nonsmoker, has used daily facial sunscreen for decades) and had just begun in recent months to notice these lip lines. Since getting the product, I&#x27;ve used it as directed for the last three weeks. I do see about 50-65% improvement in the lines themselves, and feel that the &amp;#34;shadowy&amp;#34; appearance that this skin area had begun to take on is reversing. We all hope for miracle results, and perhaps as the weeks go on it may improve more. I would guess, from my experience, that if I began using it at the barest first hint of the problem and only got partial good results, that someone who has advanced perioral wrinkles would not gain much advantage from using this product. I&#x27;m willing to use one or two tubes so I can give a longer term review....given that it&#x27;s a tough skin problem to solve and that a tube should last months (you only need a tiny amount per application), I&#x27;m pleased overall.</li>
            <li> This Dermelect product really works. None of the many others I&#x27;ve tried have. Apply generously AM &amp; PM. In about 2 weeks you&#x27;ll start to see a slight difference in the wrinkles surrounding your lips. The longer you use it, the more improvement you will see. It&#x27;s worth your patience and money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for 3 weeks and have seen no change in the wrinkles or the darkening of my upper lip. I am 44 and my skin is otherwise in very good shape....it&#x27;s not as if I have a leathery old upper lip that it&#x27;s too late to help. I expected at least SOME improvement from this product.</li>
            <li> It plumps the skin for awhile....does a nice job, as well as any OTC product, better than many.  Tough wrinkles like these require professional intervention to remove completely, however!</li>
            <li> Little change , but not even a month. The change I see will make me buy a 2nd time so I have more results</li>
            <li> Would like some more.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product. It doesn&#x27;t work.  It was an expensive product &amp; I feel I&#x27;ve wasted my money.</li>
            <li> This is product is very good.  I&#x27;ve tried many others, including some which cost significantly more.  Wrinkles aren&#x27;t completely gone, but significantly diminished</li>
            <li> I am in my 40&#x27;s and started seeing deep lines appearing above my upper lip and was trying other products containing retinol and not getting the results as the product predicted.  I stumbled on to Dermelect and read some reviews and thought what the heck - let&#x27;s give it a shot!&lt;br /&gt;Well can just say, I am simply amazed that after using for only 4 days both am and pm, that those lines above my lip are hardly noticeable!!  I also tried it on my crows feet and even though it states for lips, I said lets just see what it will do there and same thing, I couldn&#x27;t believe how it made this deeper creases almost disappear!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the results that others did. Unfortunately i am a heavy smoker and I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s why. I would recommend that younger women that smoke quit or start using this by age 35.</li>
            <li> This is another one of those gimmicks that does absolutely nothing.  I might as well have put hand lotion on my upper lip.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on another product that offers big results when there are no results at all.</li>
            <li> Dermelect is a very good product.  It really makes my skin smooth around my lips.  I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> The product did absolutely nothing to improve the wrinkles above my lip. The only change I saw was that there was another layer of product on my skin which became flaky when I put my foundation over it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything that I could notice.Used it faithfully for three weeks then I gave up.Certainly not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Returning customer, I love this product!</li>
            <li> No noticeable difference so far.  Has been over 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> #1 criterion for buying anything is satisfied with Dermelect - they are said to not test on animals.  If you don&#x27;t care about this factor, shame on you, and may you get the lip lines you deserve!  Semi-kidding there, as a vain woman who wouldn&#x27;t wish those ugliest of age-lines on you, but seriously, make a resolution to make sure you&#x27;re not helping to fund the evil-doers who torture dogs and other animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2 - I only review a small percentage of what I buy online - if I think I have something helpful to say to another potential buyer, something no one else seems to have mentioned, etc.  I depend on helpful and thought-out reviews in my own purchasing, and try to keep my review karma in good fettle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the case of this product, I think Dermelect may be on to something good, so although I should be writing holiday cards, here you are, ladies and gentlemen, for what it is worth!  I usually don&#x27;t take time to carefully edit and spellcheck, as long as I am coherent enough to get thoughts across.  Happy 2013 to all of you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never been a smoker and try to keep a pleasant smile on my face, so was appalled to see hideous vertical lip lines trying to break through after this last (50-really something) birthday. I&#x27;ve used two tubes of this lip cream (a total of maybe four months&#x27; use) and think there is definite staving off and even reduction of these lines as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen another such product (I only looked in the reasonably priced categories, meaning under $50 unless it&#x27;s a wonder drug and NOT TESTED ON ANIMALs) with as many good reviews, and this is why I gave it a try, despite an almost equal number of negative comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seeing results and reviewing the reviews, I theorize that there is a point beyond which Dermelect lip fix won&#x27;t help much or at all.  I noticed several buyers said they wished they had started to use it earlier, which to me sounds like they saw enough benefit to even have that wish. Sites where the reviewers gave their age range agreed with my theory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, your age doesn&#x27;t seem to be the biggest factor in whether you should give this a try -- it&#x27;s if the lines are already there all the time. If they are only there when you make certain expressions (try blowing a kiss to yourself in the mirror to get the verdict)--in my opinion, if you can afford the cream, give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would be uncomfortable advising you not to buy it if your vertical lip lines ARE already there -- I did not spend that much time formulating my \\&quot;theory.\\&quot;  In my experience a single tube told me whether or not it was going to help me. It could well be worth $50 to give it a try no matter how permanent you suspect your lip lines may be. The cream does feel and taste fine, so you can call it a lip area moisturizer, in any case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should add the way I use it is to slather it on lightly several times a day, all around the whole mouth area. I tend to lick my lips, so try to keep the cream there for a goodly part of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you know of a cosmetic that really actually seems to work, I&#x27;d love to hear about it in a comment here!sh.

            <li> While I didn&#x27;t see the results I had hoped for, it does seem to slightly soften the lip lines.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering another tube soon....after that I should know is it is good product or not. I&#x27;m hoping I can give a great review at that time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this several times daily for at least a month and have seen no change or even softening of the lines around my mouth.  Maybe it&#x27;s not been long enough yet. I keep using it tho!</li>
            <li> I can tell a wonderful difference in smoothness and the darkness  around the upper lip area is fading as well! Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t experienced any benefit or improvement to the vertical lines I have on my upper lip.  It is very moisturizing and creamy so I&#x27;m continuing to use it as a moisturizer under my makeup.  .</li>
            <li> The wrinkles are still there!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference. I won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> Package came and when I went to use the cream came out of the bottom of tube. It was split wide open. If I don&#x27;t get replacement or refund I will post again</li>
            <li> used almost the entire tube and not seeing any real significant changes. i will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> Dermelect works. I did see a difference! But I also think regular micbrasion and other skin treatments should be used as well. Iwill order this product again.</li>
            <li> wasted my money....didn&#x27;t do a thing....</li>
            <li> I was deligtfully surprised to see results.  If your looking to get rid of all wrinkles, don&#x27;t use this but if you need to soften existing wrinkles, this is the cream.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks, still holding judgement - haven&#x27;t seen much difference yet, but I will continue to use it</li>
            <li> This started working right away. t improved the look of my upper lip considerably. I&#x27;m 76 years old so needed lots of improvement. Wish I could find a lip plumper to do the same.</li>
            <li> Great lip cream....smooth not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
