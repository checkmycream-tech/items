            <li>I love that I can break up the crunch with my fingers, what an amazing non-committal gel!</li>
            <li>I love these 2 products!</li>
            <li>This is a nice styling product.</li>
            <li>So this is a good pull back your hair product and it works best when the hair is damp.</li>
            <li>It also has a pleasant, light smell.</li>
            <li>This is great for wash &amp; go&#x27;s and is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>hope is that it does what it says keep your hair healthy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love it because it makes my hair a bit crunchy, which I can&#x27;t stand.</li>
            <li>It gives me good results for up to 4 days after I first use it.  </li>
            <li>It is not like a gel and pretty water but gives good hold for fine to medium density curls.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Because of that, I needed to switch to products that didn&#x27;t need strong detergent to get them out of my hair (i.e. anything with silicone).  </li>
            <li>This detangles my hair instantly &amp; defines curls beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair that fizzes in the humidity</li>
            <li>I remain a huge JC fan ...</li>
            <li>I have short cut hair and it works great for making manal waves,  waves, twist, and curls.</li>
            <li>I have tried for years to find the right products for my curly hair - haven&#x27;t we all?!</li>
            <li>My non-relaxed hair is \\&quot;stylin\\&quot; with a head full of non-kinky ringlets that lengthen over time ...</li>
            <li>This product you will have to manipulate your hair manually in order to get full results.</li>
            <li>You basically have to either sprinkle it onto your hair or put some in your hands and quickly run them through your hair.</li>
            <li>Love this product, that it&#x27;s cruelty free and that it&#x27;s completely affordable online.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, never flakes, leaves my hair shiny and completely frizz free.</li>
            <li>I recommend using this right after shampooing and  towel drying.</li>
            <li>This product works much better for me than Mixed Chicks.</li>
            <li>Crunchier than I thought it would be, but does the job pretty well.</li>
            <li>&quot; at first; it is very runny</li>
            <li>It is also really liquid-y.</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I just lightly refresh my hair daily with a salt spray, or another spray on refresher.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really sure what this product is supposed to do, but I can safely say that I&#x27;ve tried it as a gel, as an enhancement to existing gels, and even as a pre-gel -- and it does pretty much nothing in all capacities.  </li>
            <li>This is even better and you need less solution.</li>
            <li>After you put this in, use your normal buttercreme or oil to set.</li>
            <li>My curls are somewhere between 3a and 3b and tend to be weighed down easily.  </li>
            <li>However, I live in the tropics, and can&lt;br /&gt;keep</li>
            <li>I mix this product with Jane Carter&#x27;s Curl Defining Cream in equal portions scrunching it into my sulfite free freshly shampooed/co-washed wet/damp hair (Deva Curl Style, i.e. with my head upside down).  </li>
            <li>I dug it out and tried it again but used a generous portion and WOW!</li>
            <li>I am interested in the whole Jane Carter Line due to trying this one product.  </li>
            <li>Applied it to wet fresh out of the shower locks and....</li>
            <li>At least it all happened before I left the house and was able to put my hair up in a bun.</li>
            <li>I really like how I could scrunch my hair when dry and got NO frizz!</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s not dry or hard, I can run my fingers thru my hair easily.  </li>
            <li>When I first tried it, I found it hard to evenly distribute it through my hair without using too much because it&#x27;s so liquid-y...</li>
            <li>My hair is natural and it works on my very short hair.</li>
            <li>I have very soft African American hair.  </li>
            <li>and I ended up using too much and weighing my hair down.  </li>
            <li>I have very thick 3c hair that tangles easily.  </li>
            <li>This is the first product I have used (in combination with alba) that does not leave my hair stiff, keeps a shine, and gets rid of frizz.</li>

            <li> I also hardly every wash my hair, just rinse it real well every day.</li>
            <li> Using enough of this product on wet hair does the trick.</li>
            <li> I am so grateful, as natural hair products are hard for me to find.  </li>
            <li> I use in shower on dripping wet hair.  </li>
            <li> This is way more expensive in stores and hard to come by!</li>
            <li> So I could not see myself using this product in any other weather.  </li>
            <li> I also stopped using shampoo and conditioner on my hair about six months ago (in favor of a roughly weekly baking soda wash and green tea/cider vinegar rinse).  </li>
            <li> my hair wet and slick.  </li>
            <li> but this product tames the frizz without being stiff, sticky or weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li> It dries overnight into bouncy shiny ringlets, requiring little fuss with the muss in the am.  </li>
            <li> Just wish she&#x27;d develop a heavy CREAM CONDITIONER ...</li>
            <li> A waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s see it dried out my hair every time I used it regardless of what I paired it with.</li>
            <li> Not sure what this is suppose to do</li>
            <li> No overwhelming scents to conflict with my perfume, either.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair thick with volume and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> - it was too thick</li>
            <li> The consistency is just odd to me and not ideal.</li>
            <li> but it does not have any bad affects on my hair.</li>
            <li> It was horrible.</li>

            <li> I have very thick 3c hair that tangles easily.  This detangles my hair instantly &amp; defines curls beautifully.  Some say this is drying.  The bottle states that your hair will have some crunch.  But, it&#x27;s not dry or hard, I can run my fingers thru my hair easily.  I recommend using this right after shampooing and  towel drying. After you put this in, use your normal buttercreme or oil to set. This is great for wash &amp; go&#x27;s and is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I am Michele, using my husband&#x27;s acct to write this review.  This product is easy to use.  I look forward to doing my hair each day.  Smells wonderful.  And works!  Holds the hair all day.  No frizz.  Just perfect.  I am interested in the whole Jane Carter Line due to trying this one product.  I am so grateful, as natural hair products are hard for me to find.  Glad I found this line!</li>
            <li> This product is not what I was hoping for but I like it.  However, I live in the tropics, and can&lt;br /&gt;keep my hair wet and slick.  So I could not see myself using this product in any other weather.  I want to stop&lt;br /&gt;relaxing my hair.  So this is a good pull back your hair product and it works best when the hair is damp. My&lt;br /&gt;next hope is that it does what it says keep your hair healthy.</li>
            <li> And \\&quot;Hold\\&quot; it does without any residue!  My non-relaxed hair is \\&quot;stylin\\&quot; with a head full of non-kinky ringlets that lengthen over time ... still looking great after seven days!  I remain a huge JC fan ... how else to say \\&quot;thank you\\&quot; for a product line that works.  Just wish she&#x27;d develop a heavy CREAM CONDITIONER ... a moisturizing glob of goo that will strengthen our hair!</li>
            <li> This helps keep my curls shaped nicely! It also has a pleasant, light smell. I don&#x27;t love it because it makes my hair a bit crunchy, which I can&#x27;t stand. It is also really liquid-y. You basically have to either sprinkle it onto your hair or put some in your hands and quickly run them through your hair. The consistency is just odd to me and not ideal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure what this product is supposed to do, but I can safely say that I&#x27;ve tried it as a gel, as an enhancement to existing gels, and even as a pre-gel -- and it does pretty much nothing in all capacities.  A waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and also on my 3 yr old&#x27;s hair!  We both have curly hair and this is perfect.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for my wavy hair. Applied it to wet fresh out of the shower locks and.... no waves, just frizz minutes later. At least it all happened before I left the house and was able to put my hair up in a bun.</li>
            <li> Great for tangled hair, quicky becomes manageable with just a dab. not greasy and smells good.</li>
            <li> I love this product because t is great for sculpting curls and twist. This product you will have to manipulate your hair manually in order to get full results. I have short cut hair and it works great for making manal waves,  waves, twist, and curls. I use a rat ail comb to help sculpt curl pattern. My hair is a 4b.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 10 years.  I&#x27;ve tried others over this time period, but I keep coming back to this gel.  I have very soft African American hair.  This product works much better for me than Mixed Chicks.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have been using it for years. I have fine hair that fizzes in the humidity but this product tames the frizz without being stiff, sticky or weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li> I love Condition &amp; Sculpt! It&#x27;s light weight, never flakes, leaves my hair shiny and completely frizz free. I love that I can break up the crunch with my fingers, what an amazing non-committal gel!</li>
            <li> Not sure what this is suppose to do but it does not have any bad affects on my hair. I would not advise anyone to not get the product I would say try it.</li>
            <li> Crunchier than I thought it would be, but does the job pretty well.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s see it dried out my hair every time I used it regardless of what I paired it with. It made my hair thick with volume and unmanageable. It was horrible.</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy hair. Using enough of this product on wet hair does the trick. I also add Alba Organic Body Oil to the mix. 1/3 Alba and 2/3 Jane Carter. This is even better and you need less solution. I also hardly every wash my hair, just rinse it real well every day. This is the first product I have used (in combination with alba) that does not leave my hair stiff, keeps a shine, and gets rid of frizz.</li>
            <li> My hair is natural and it works on my very short hair.</li>
            <li> I did not like this \\&quot;gel\\&quot; at first; it is very runny and I did not use enough to see any difference. I dug it out and tried it again but used a generous portion and WOW! NO frizz, lots of curl, body, hold and shine! I really like how I could scrunch my hair when dry and got NO frizz! This is the best plastic-free silicone-free styling product.</li>
            <li> I mix this product with Jane Carter&#x27;s Curl Defining Cream in equal portions scrunching it into my sulfite free freshly shampooed/co-washed wet/damp hair (Deva Curl Style, i.e. with my head upside down).  I then t-shirt scrunch out the excess moisture.  I sleep with my hair still damp.  It dries overnight into bouncy shiny ringlets, requiring little fuss with the muss in the am.  It gives me good results for up to 4 days after I first use it.  I just lightly refresh my hair daily with a salt spray, or another spray on refresher.  My hair is 2c (temple area ) through 3b.  I love these 2 products!</li>
            <li> This is way more expensive in stores and hard to come by! Love this product, that it&#x27;s cruelty free and that it&#x27;s completely affordable online.</li>
            <li> I have tried for years to find the right products for my curly hair - haven&#x27;t we all?! - and I have finally settled on this, in combination with another Jane Carter product (Curl Defining Cream).  My curls are somewhere between 3a and 3b and tend to be weighed down easily.  I also stopped using shampoo and conditioner on my hair about six months ago (in favor of a roughly weekly baking soda wash and green tea/cider vinegar rinse).  Because of that, I needed to switch to products that didn&#x27;t need strong detergent to get them out of my hair (i.e. anything with silicone).  This product is (part of) the answer.  When I first tried it, I found it hard to evenly distribute it through my hair without using too much because it&#x27;s so liquid-y... so I tried the Curl Defining Cream and had the same problem for the opposite reason - it was too thick and I ended up using too much and weighing my hair down.  Now I mix the two together in roughly equal parts and I have the perfect hair product.  No overwhelming scents to conflict with my perfume, either.  Best of all, there are no nasty chemical ingredients here.  Hooray!!</li>
            <li> This is a nice styling product. I use in shower on dripping wet hair.  It is not like a gel and pretty water but gives good hold for fine to medium density curls.</li>
