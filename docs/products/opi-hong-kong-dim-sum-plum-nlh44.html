            <li>I love this color and have gotten so many compliments and everyone want to know what the color is and who makes it.  </li>
            <li>I think this is more of a reflection on the seller and not OPI.</li>
            <li>I love this color .</li>
            <li>Going to by a couple more to give to friends since they are always complementing our nails</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve gotten many compliments with regards to this color.  </li>
            <li>I love the color</li>
            <li>and I love the quality of all OPI nail polishes.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t beat the price anywhere :)</li>
            <li>When I first came across this colour on the internet, I thought it was bright and stunning, but was weary about buying it because of my skin.</li>
            <li>I love OPI in general, and this color is a great color for Fall.</li>
            <li>The polish was packaged secure to prevent from breakage.</li>
            <li>A+ seller for selling real OPI, will but more from asap:)</li>
            <li>First of all, I was surprised (and delighted) to find OPI brand nail polish so cheap!</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite color of nail polish!  </li>
            <li>I think I like Dim Sum Plum even better!</li>
            <li>I love the color, but I wish it didn&#x27;t chip off so fast.  </li>
            <li>This color puts out a purple,pink hugh enough you&#x27;ll surely like the color more.</li>
            <li>Easy to glide on my nail and dries fast.</li>
            <li>I can always count on OPI having the best colors which are always long lasting between manicures....</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so pretty!..</li>
            <li>OPI nail polishes have clearly won over my heart. :)</li>
            <li>Colours like maroon and deep eggplant purple usually look the best.</li>
            <li>But I gave it the old college try, seeing how the price was cheap.</li>
            <li>and sure enough amazon had it.</li>
            <li>I had this color put on my feet at my last pedi and love it.</li>
            <li>kind of a purply pink.</li>
            <li>Shops fast!</li>
            <li>This is not the real OPI.  </li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t beat the price for OPI Polish which is normally 8</li>
            <li>This is a nice dark pink color, it matches my \\&quot;Dish It Up\\&quot; lipstick from Mac cosmestics,</li>
            <li>Its definitely more of a dark pink than the purple shown.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra few dollars.</li>
            <li>This nail polish is sooooooo thin and chips easily.  </li>

            <li> My nails only looked nice for a day or less before they were chipping like crazy.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is overhyped and expensive for no reason because i have tried really cheap products, and this one</li>
            <li> Anyways, I&#x27;m not a frequent wearer of nail polish.</li>
            <li> Stays on long!</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t run out for a very long time!  </li>
            <li> I found this color on Amazon while trying to find a rare polish color called Bermuda Shorts, which turned out to be way too expensive.  </li>
            <li> not real purple or totally pink.</li>
            <li> but the color is not exactly as shown.</li>
            <li> Other sellers Selling OPI products polish were watered down and chipped within a day, so I guess those were fake.</li>
            <li> The nail Polish was thick.  </li>
            <li> Because of my olive-toned skin, a lot of colours that I like look awkward on my hands.</li>
            <li> You wont be sorry!  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

So happy with it..A+ seller for selling real OPI, will but more from asap:)</li>
            <li> Don’t be fooled by this product!  This is not the real OPI.  This nail polish is sooooooo thin and chips easily.  I had to throw it away and go to a beauty supply store to ensure I got a quality polish.</li>

            <li> The nail Polish was thick.  And the bottle rim crusty.  Almost like this nail Polish was used.  I think this is more of a reflection on the seller and not OPI.</li>
