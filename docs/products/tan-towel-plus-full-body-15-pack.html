            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>how nice my legs look with my &amp;#34;great tan&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>a nice tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also suggested by the Tan Towel Company&#x27;s website NOT to apply any lotion or moisturizer on your skin before applying Tan Towels.</li>
            <li>But, the color is natural-looking and the scent is nice.  </li>
            <li>The color appeared nicely and not orange.</li>
            <li>This product gives you a nice glo and no streaks.  </li>
            <li>The best part is it looked natural!</li>
            <li>I love tan towels.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Have purchased many times.</li>

            <li>My daughter and I love these things.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love these towels.</li>
            <li>They are better than going to a tanning bed.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product -the best and safe sunless tanning product out there, which makes it worth the price.</li>
            <li>These towelettes make it easy to rub on, will not streak or leave orange color on you.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and no laying out in the sun.</li>
            <li>Easy application.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>They also strongly suggest to WAIT 8 hours before applying any lotion, moisturizer, or sunscreen after using Tan Towels.</li>
            <li>Nice, but not dramatic results.</li>
            <li>I am fairly fair skinned, and like to have a light natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>and I liked that it didn&#x27;t have AHA ( Alpha Hydroxy Acid), which makes skin more sensitive to sunlight.</li>
            <li>Color is light but builds over time.  </li>
            <li>I always start with the towel still folded and apply one side to my face lightly, rubbing it in with my hand.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>Your skin must be clean and exfoliated.</li>
            <li>I use these before special occasion&#x27;s or before going away.</li>
            <li>It applies with even, full coverage,</li>
            <li>I prefer plus over the classic because I am fare skinned and like a bit more color.  </li>
            <li>As I have gotten older, the tanning salon becomes more of a concern.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m an out-doorsey person who lives in the high desert, I didn&#x27;t want to put a product on my skin that would cause more sun damage.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, skin feels soft, light staining on the palm after application.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
            <li>, these towelettes don&#x27;t have a unpleasant odor, applies easily, non-messy, doesn&#x27;t streak or leaves blotches, dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t come off easily in the shower, doesn&#x27;t get on your clothes or bed sheets, and best off all</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to odors and this was almost scent free which I never noticed it after I put it on.</li>
            <li>When I first heard about these, I immediately ordered them.</li>
            <li>I do this while unfolding it the towel, so each side of the folded towel is used first.</li>
            <li>Much healthier than the sun or tanning salon!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now a regular user and couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re using the towelette and it&#x27;s used up and dries out before you can finish applying it over your entire body, you can spray more tanning solution on the towelette so you can finish applying the product.</li>
            <li>The seller&#x27;s product was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>These tan towels do EXACTLY what they say they will do.</li>
            <li>My wife uses these tan towels every other day or so to maintain a nice olive complexion.  </li>
            <li>When completely unfolded I return to my face, making sure i apply it completely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that the full body towelettes tend to come out darker after applying than the half body ones, maybe because there&#x27;s more solution.  </li>
            <li>Layer over less dark self tanner for best results and to hide</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m used to a nice dark color.</li>
            <li>Applies very even and there is no odor.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Three stars because these tanning towels do not impart as much color as I would like.  </li>
            <li>One towel does your whole body.</li>
            <li>It dries fast, doesn&#x27;t smear, tanning is almost immediate.</li>
            <li>You do have to use 2 towels if you want to do whole body.  </li>
            <li>The tan is very smooth and it lasts longer than my other products.</li>
            <li>We do recommended these to others who have problems burning quickly or can not tan quickly with out extreme exposure to the sun.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Now granted you have to be diligent about making sure you get every part of your body, and I always see a few spots I miss, but that is my fault.</li>
            <li>Not sure which is the better value, since you have to use two of these to get the color of one Kate Somerville.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply but not a huge color change.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not messy &amp; don&#x27;t make me look orange.</li>
            <li>Have been using Tan Towels for years - No one thinks I &amp;#34;fake tan&amp;#34; ... looks natural</li>
            <li>Smooth predictable coverage</li>
            <li>Lasts for several days with normal bathing.  </li>
            <li>I now only use these twice a week, which maintains my natural looking tan!</li>
            <li>It takes approximately 5 extra minutes in the morning to complete this!</li>
            <li>, doesn&#x27;t give your skin an orange look, but an actual natural looking bronze tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Grant it, to get a dark deep tan, you do have to apply regularly, or daily in my case, so I go through the towelettes quickly to get the results I want.</li>

            <li> Easy to apply, skin feels soft, light staining on the palm after application.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I love tan towels. I work indoors and don&#x27;t get outside enough. I get compliments on  how nice my legs look with my &amp;#34;great tan&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Covers entire body evenly. No streaking. No odor. Perfect.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Have purchased many times. Color is light but builds over time.  Applies very even and there is no odor.</li>
            <li> I use these before special occasion&#x27;s or before going away. When used correctly, gives you just enough color. I use one towel 3 days in a row just before my big day.</li>
            <li> This is the best self-tanner product I have used.  It applies with even, full coverage, doesn&#x27;t streak and isn&#x27;t sticky.  I&#x27;ve noticed that the full body towelettes tend to come out darker after applying than the half body ones, maybe because there&#x27;s more solution.  I prefer plus over the classic because I am fare skinned and like a bit more color.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Best &amp; easiest to use &amp; perfect to pack! No streaks &amp; stays on very long!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these! I am fairly fair skinned, and like to have a light natural looking tan. I have always went to the tanning salon to achieve that look. As I have gotten older, the tanning salon becomes more of a concern. When I first heard about these, I immediately ordered them. I used one towel in the morning, and then again the same evening. It was very simple to use! By the next morning you could see a noticeable difference! The best part is it looked natural! No orange streaks! Now granted you have to be diligent about making sure you get every part of your body, and I always see a few spots I miss, but that is my fault. Honestly you can achieve that while in the sun as well! I always start with the towel still folded and apply one side to my face lightly, rubbing it in with my hand. Then I go to my legs, avoiding my feet, ankles and knees. Next my arms, avoiding the elbows. I do this while unfolding it the towel, so each side of the folded towel is used first. When completely unfolded I return to my face, making sure i apply it completely. Then go over my legs again, using a circular motion, this time going over my feet, ankles and knees. Then my arms, including elbows, and finish by going over the rest of my body.&lt;br /&gt;This has worked perfect for me! I now only use these twice a week, which maintains my natural looking tan! It takes approximately 5 extra minutes in the morning to complete this! Totally worth it! Much healthier than the sun or tanning salon!</li>
            <li> Works great!! Best tanning product ever and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> Used it 3 times within 3 days &amp; no change.&lt;br /&gt;What a waste.&lt;br /&gt;Sooooo disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;A LOT OF $$ FOR NOTHING</li>
            <li> Tan towels are always my go-to self-tanner. They&#x27;re not messy &amp; don&#x27;t make me look orange. When the tan fades it&#x27;s an even fade &amp; not blotchy like a spray tan</li>
            <li> Best tanning product I have ever used. These towelettes make it easy to rub on, will not streak or leave orange color on you. You will see a big difference in a couple days. Just wash hands when done applying. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Every sunless tanning product I&#x27;ve used (spray, lotion or wipes) failed to give me a non-messy streak-free natural looking tan. I was so disappointed with everything out there on the market, I was ready to lay out in the sun and...(gulp) even considered cooking myself in a tanning bed out of sheer desperation for a nature looking tan. So I found this product online and I liked that it didn&#x27;t have AHA ( Alpha Hydroxy Acid), which makes skin more sensitive to sunlight. Since I&#x27;m an out-doorsey person who lives in the high desert, I didn&#x27;t want to put a product on my skin that would cause more sun damage. So I tried Tan Towels Plus and I loved it. I&#x27;m now a regular user and couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other sunless tanning products, these towelettes don&#x27;t have a unpleasant odor, applies easily, non-messy, doesn&#x27;t streak or leaves blotches, dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t come off easily in the shower, doesn&#x27;t get on your clothes or bed sheets, and best off all, doesn&#x27;t give your skin an orange look, but an actual natural looking bronze tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grant it, to get a dark deep tan, you do have to apply regularly, or daily in my case, so I go through the towelettes quickly to get the results I want. Unfortunately, for me, the towelette is used up and dries out before I&#x27;m finish applying, so I have to open another packet to finish the job. I just ordered the Tan Towels Express Tan spray, which can be used with the towelettes. If you&#x27;re using the towelette and it&#x27;s used up and dries out before you can finish applying it over your entire body, you can spray more tanning solution on the towelette so you can finish applying the product. Best results is to reapply again after 4 hours. Don&#x27;t over do it in one session, then you will look funky. Apply once thoroughly and then wait 4 hours and apply again, and then 8 hours later (or by morning) you will have a nice tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also suggested by the Tan Towel Company&#x27;s website NOT to apply any lotion or moisturizer on your skin before applying Tan Towels. Your skin must be clean and exfoliated. They also strongly suggest to WAIT 8 hours before applying any lotion, moisturizer, or sunscreen after using Tan Towels. They recommend applying Tan Towel before bed and then by morning, the product will be done doing it&#x27;s job and then you can apply other skin care products on your body. I follow those rules, and I have no problems with the color or longevity of my sunless tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product -the best and safe sunless tanning product out there, which makes it worth the price.</li>
            <li> These are the best self tanning product on the market. They don&#x27;t streak or turn your skin orange. Great product</li>
            <li> This product made my skin orange, blotchy, and very very dry.  It smelled bad as well.  Gave it a good try and shouldn&#x27;t have.  Tried to return it 1 day after the 30 day trial period and I couldn&#x27;t. Wish I could have my $50 back.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Dry&#x27;s quickly, No smell.  The seller&#x27;s product was exactly as described.  And was delivered on time.  And in good condtion.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love these things. Easy to use and no laying out in the sun.</li>
            <li> These towels don&#x27;t make you look orange if used properly. Easy application. Lasts for several days with normal bathing.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love the tan towel! I get a perfect tan without breaking out from the sun. I used it for my wedding and every summer.</li>
            <li> The seller did a great job. I actually received this before I did the rest of my order from Amazon.  I have used self tanners for years, but just tried these this summer and I love them!!! The tan is very smooth and it lasts longer than my other products. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Three stars because these tanning towels do not impart as much color as I would like.  But, the color is natural-looking and the scent is nice.  A more expensive option is Kate Somervillie&#x27;s tanning towels, which do provide deeper yet natural-looking color.  Not sure which is the better value, since you have to use two of these to get the color of one Kate Somerville.</li>
            <li> Have been using Tan Towels for years - No one thinks I &amp;#34;fake tan&amp;#34; ... looks natural</li>
            <li> Plus color can look orange.  Layer over less dark self tanner for best results and to hide streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll need a mitten to apply without staining your hands.</li>
            <li> Love these towels. One towel does your whole body. I am very sensitive to odors and this was almost scent free which I never noticed it after I put it on. The color appeared nicely and not orange.</li>
            <li> The only problem was sometimes I got alittle splotchy on my neck but that could have been my fault. They are better than going to a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> These tan towels do EXACTLY what they say they will do. I love them!! The make an office girl like me look like I actually get out into the sun. I would highly recommend them. FYI, HSN sells these, but they are for twice the price! Amazon is definitely the way to go.</li>
            <li> Smooth predictable coverage</li>
            <li> Easy to apply but not a huge color change. In the past I got weekly spray tans so I&#x27;m used to a nice dark color. I&#x27;d say after one application you get one shade darker. Nice, but not dramatic results.</li>
            <li> Since I burn in the sun, this is a GREAT alternative!&lt;br /&gt;No laying in the sun &amp; an a beautiful tan, to boot.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years now.  I love it! It dries fast, doesn&#x27;t smear, tanning is almost immediate. The tan looks very natural not orange or fake. I had the men in my family try it and they are happy with the results as well.  It fades in about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This product gives you a nice glo and no streaks.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> My wife uses these tan towels every other day or so to maintain a nice olive complexion.  The towel however does get dry and it is not able to do the whole body. You do have to use 2 towels if you want to do whole body.  We also noticed that where ever sweat is an issue, ( arms and legs) that it will rub off and stain your clothes.  We do recommended these to others who have problems burning quickly or can not tan quickly with out extreme exposure to the sun.</li>
