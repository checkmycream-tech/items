            <li>Very good price for a six pack of these heads.</li>
            <li>The Philips Sonicare brush system was recomended by my dentist, and was a great investment.</li>
            <li>Great bargain for the money</li>
            <li>Sonicare is a great system, and since you&#x27;re reading about bulk replacement heads chances are you need no conversion.  </li>
            <li>So, if you already have this toothbrush you will be happy with these heads.</li>
            <li>Great deal.  </li>
            <li>It was a great buy.</li>
            <li>and I am happy with it</li>
            <li>Product is great, the cost once I got</li>
            <li>Great deal.</li>
            <li>A good deal on the Phillips e series toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the product and shipper</li>
            <li>I think my purchase even qualified for free shipping so that was great.</li>
            <li>These fit my sonicare nicely.</li>
            <li>I have used Sonicare for 14 years and love the way my teeth feel and look.</li>
            <li>I love my sonic care.</li>
            <li>Today they say 3 months, and they make sure you&#x27;re reminded of it with the wear indicator that appears on the bristles.  </li>
            <li>If you love your electric toothbrush by Sonicare, stock up.  </li>
            <li>It meats all specifications, I have been using it for more than 1 year</li>
            <li>The brushes themselves are a good deal and the brush heads although a little pricey work great.</li>
            <li>but I find mine lasts 6 months easily.  </li>
            <li>They fit perfectly and do the job well, as expected.</li>
            <li>So with that in mind I purchased the 6 pack through Amazon and was it easy and cheap.</li>
            <li>The brush heads are fine</li>
            <li>and they arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real stuff you could find in retail, so often - but a wayyyyyy better price !  </li>
            <li>This is the most economical way to buy.</li>
            <li>, both dentist and hygienist say my teeth are ~ 100% plaque free for over a decade.  </li>
            <li>but they fit and</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast and I was able to get a lot more toothbrush heads than if I went to the store to buy some.</li>
            <li>,transaction was quick and easy too.</li>
            <li>the original Sonicare brush heads do.</li>
            <li>My teeth don&#x27;t feel clean without my Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>As advertised, great savings over the single package</li>
            <li>Product was true as advertised and arrived in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li>These are the correct fitting brush heads for this particular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the service, quality and price paid for the Philips Sonicare E Series Standard brush heads.  </li>
            <li>Shame on me for not doing research first!</li>
            <li>The Sonicare is first on my list (and on my dentist&#x27;s list) because it delivers a fresh-feeling, clean set of choppers.</li>
            <li>Thanks for selling these so cheaply and quality .</li>
            <li>forward 1 year later, my teeth are plaque free, my gums are healthy, not just noticed by me but by my hygienist whom I&#x27;ve seen at the 6th and 12th month of the brush&#x27;s age.  </li>
            <li>The right brand at the right price.</li>
            <li>The first product of its kind that actually worked as intended.  </li>
            <li>They shipped fine and were brand new.</li>
            <li>These do not seem as good as the ones I have previously used.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I had a good experience with a previous purchase from Walmart.  </li>
            <li>I will buy from same seller again when I need more toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>I have tried the generic brands and have not been pleased.  </li>
            <li>The basic e series is more than sufficient.</li>
            <li>Wish the colors were more distinctive but overall</li>
            <li>have already bought this item twice and likely will again :)</li>
            <li>When Sonicare was first introduced the change interval between heads was 6 months, if not longer.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time and was exactly what I was expecting</li>
            <li>Lo and behold, new heads arrived today (quick delivery).  </li>
            <li>I think Costco&#x27;s price is lower, but not by much at all.</li>
            <li>But is 3 months really necessary?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>works very vigorously.  </li>
            <li>they where so much cheaper that the ones in the stores</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend its use for the health of one&#x27;s teeth and gums - keeps your teeth clean from tartar and debris longer than an ordinary toothbrush, and the gums healthy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend buying in bulk.</li>
            <li>I normally purchase the replacement toothbrush heads at Sam&#x27;s but the one by my house has been out for a while now.  </li>
            <li>I can only conjecture that the much stiffer middle bristles are doing much of the work now, and that part of the effectiveness of Sonicare is brushing for the full 2 minute duration.  </li>
            <li>The technician at a typical dentist cleaning reports about 7% plaque, which is far better than the 20+% that resulted from using a manual brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently using, are busily falling out before they are becoming worn out enough to replace the head.</li>
            <li>I have been using one of the new heads every day for 3 months now, and it has performed up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>every new year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>Cheaper than buying a new set.</li>
            <li>My chiseling at the hygienist is at no more than 5 mins she spends more time polishing my teeth and getting rid of coffee stains .</li>
            <li>Top and bottom bristles are splayed out, but the middle bristles are stiff and straight and the head mechanism  </li>
            <li>The brush heads work on all 3, but don&#x27;t fit tightly on one of the bases.</li>
            <li>They come in a flat straight across packaging so less waste (good too).</li>
            <li>If you go shopping in your local stores that carry these in a 2 pack see how much they cost.</li>
            <li>Would recommend for the busy person.  </li>
            <li>After 3 weeks, a check with a scraper showed plaque was forming on both my far rear molars.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to me, an easy way to find out is if you stop using the brush, or if you use the brush past 3 months, the cleaning capacity of the brush will diminish.  </li>
            <li>So much less expensive than buying local and the quality was perfect.  </li>
            <li>The last time I had my teeth cleaned they told me they could tell I was using the Sonicare because my teeth and gums were in great shape, and very little hard cleaning required.</li>
            <li>Recently I tried some generic replacement brush heads and found out the first time that I used them that they lacked the quality and just did not perform half as well as the Sonicare replacement heads.</li>

            <li> Checked Walmart and several other local stores and they all seemed to be more expensive than Sam&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for about fifteen years and will use it as long as Philips makes it.</li>
            <li> Hard to find where I live and a six pack of them with the cost savings lasts two years.</li>
            <li> I only saw the usual 2 to 3 packs at my local stores.</li>
            <li> Received as expected.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> I stopped using the Sonicare for 1 month in the mid-2000 due to a family emergency that took me overseas, where I was using a manual brush.  </li>
            <li> If you brush 2x a day, they the time interval could be ~ 6 months, and if 3x a day, its 4 months and this is due to rate of wear and tear on the bristles.  </li>
            <li> Trust me for the price I got these for less than $58.00 for product and shipping.</li>
            <li> I got 6 for less than $60.00 out the door.</li>
            <li> Brand new pack, nothing wrong with them.  </li>
            <li> You do save a little by purchasing six pack.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they are totally overpriced.</li>
            <li> Not a very good product for the money, $65.</li>
            <li> Usually at least $23.00-$29.00 not including tax.</li>
            <li> As a user since the late 1990s, I know it has done well</li>
            <li> I thought I was saving money by purchasing the generic heads, but boy was I wrong!  </li>
            <li> so I expected to get the wrong size or something to be wrong with my purchase</li>
            <li> If you have poor dental check-ups, try Sonicare.</li>
            <li> They are loud and horrible to use.  </li>
            <li> You cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> but, the toothbrush itself is horrible.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordred these Sonicare E series Brush Heads cause I needed replacements. I found these sold in a 6 pack online only. Never once did I ever see it stores. I only saw the usual 2 to 3 packs at my local stores. So with that in mind I purchased the 6 pack through Amazon and was it easy and cheap. Also with the 6 pack I figured I will have enough replacement heads for my Sonicare Toothbrush to last me for over 1 1/2 years thats changing them out every 3 months as they recommend. Trust me for the price I got these for less than $58.00 for product and shipping. You cant go wrong. If you go shopping in your local stores that carry these in a 2 pack see how much they cost. Usually at least $23.00-$29.00 not including tax. I got 6 for less than $60.00 out the door. Oh did I mention I got them delivered to my house in 3 days after I ordered them.</li>
            <li> Could never go back to a regular toothbrush!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real stuff you could find in retail, so often - but a wayyyyyy better price !  Its all about saving money!</li>
            <li> I normally purchase the replacement toothbrush heads at Sam&#x27;s but the one by my house has been out for a while now.  Checked Walmart and several other local stores and they all seemed to be more expensive than Sam&#x27;s. Then I found this deal and figured what the heck, I&#x27;ll give them a shot.  Lo and behold, new heads arrived today (quick delivery).  Brand new pack, nothing wrong with them.  Very happy for this nugget of a find.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my purchase. The delivery was fast and I was able to get a lot more toothbrush heads than if I went to the store to buy some. I think my purchase even qualified for free shipping so that was great. I will buy from same seller again when I need more toothbrush heads. These fit my sonicare nicely.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe I found a deal like this. Very good price for a six pack of these heads. So much more expensive in stores to buy them. Will look for them again.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the service, quality and price paid for the Philips Sonicare E Series Standard brush heads.  I have tried the generic brands and have not been pleased.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Sometimes my local Costco carries these refills, but sometimes they don&#x27;t. I think Costco&#x27;s price is lower, but not by much at all.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare brush system was recomended by my dentist, and was a great investment. The last time I had my teeth cleaned they told me they could tell I was using the Sonicare because my teeth and gums were in great shape, and very little hard cleaning required. My teeth have never felt cleaner.</li>
            <li> Excellent experience!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for about fifteen years and will use it as long as Philips makes it. The technician at a typical dentist cleaning reports about 7% plaque, which is far better than the 20+% that resulted from using a manual brush.</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare for 14 years and love the way my teeth feel and look. I would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patrick</li>
            <li> The right brand at the right price.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend its use for the health of one&#x27;s teeth and gums - keeps your teeth clean from tartar and debris longer than an ordinary toothbrush, and the gums healthy. I wish  I had known about it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terry</li>
            <li> Great bargain for the money,transaction was quick and easy too.Now I am stocked up for over a year for maybe a third of the price Philips would have charged me.</li>
            <li> Purchasing a 6 pack or even a larger pack is cost-efficient. The Sonicare is first on my list (and on my dentist&#x27;s list) because it delivers a fresh-feeling, clean set of choppers. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love my sonic care. The basic e series is more than sufficient. My chiseling at the hygienist is at no more than 5 mins she spends more time polishing my teeth and getting rid of coffee stains . I do floss faithfully also. I like it so well I bought my sons theirs. Sometimes keep them supplied with the heads. This is the most economical way to buy. They come in a flat straight across packaging so less waste (good too).</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had.  Even my Dentist uses this one!  So, decided to keep it current by buying replacement heads.  They recommend changing the heads every 3 months but I find mine lasts 6 months easily.  My wife changes hers every 3 months but she also brushes twice a day to my once a day habit.</li>
            <li> After doing some comparison shopping to find replacement brush heads for a Sonicare brush, I picked up the 6-pack from Amazon.  I have been using one of the new heads every day for 3 months now, and it has performed up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> Would recommend for the busy person.  Wish the colors were more distinctive but overall would recommend for the convenience.  Excellent value</li>
            <li> The brushes themselves are a good deal and the brush heads although a little pricey work great. My regular toothbrush and will continue to be.</li>
            <li> Buying them 6 at a time is a perfect way to keep my brush working well.  Highly recommend buying in bulk.</li>
            <li> They fit perfectly and do the job well, as expected.</li>
            <li> I wish I knew about emmi-dent before spending on sonicare heads.the price of replacing every three months is too costly.</li>
            <li> these are a great deals for replacement heads! and they arrived quickly! have already bought this item twice and likely will again :)</li>
            <li> Sonicare is a great system, and since you&#x27;re reading about bulk replacement heads chances are you need no conversion.  As a user since the late 1990s, I know it has done well, both dentist and hygienist say my teeth are ~ 100% plaque free for over a decade.  When Sonicare was first introduced the change interval between heads was 6 months, if not longer.  Today they say 3 months, and they make sure you&#x27;re reminded of it with the wear indicator that appears on the bristles.  But is 3 months really necessary?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to me, an easy way to find out is if you stop using the brush, or if you use the brush past 3 months, the cleaning capacity of the brush will diminish.  I stopped using the Sonicare for 1 month in the mid-2000 due to a family emergency that took me overseas, where I was using a manual brush.  After 3 weeks, a check with a scraper showed plaque was forming on both my far rear molars.  When I started back on Sonicare, the plaque cleared up. So a simple test would be if I don&#x27;t change the brushes in 3,6,9, 12 months etc., at some point plaque will form that is either noticeable by me, or by my hygienist, whom I see every 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward 1 year later, my teeth are plaque free, my gums are healthy, not just noticed by me but by my hygienist whom I&#x27;ve seen at the 6th and 12th month of the brush&#x27;s age.  Top and bottom bristles are splayed out, but the middle bristles are stiff and straight and the head mechanism  works very vigorously.  So if this brush in ineffective, where&#x27;s the plaque?  I can only conjecture that the much stiffer middle bristles are doing much of the work now, and that part of the effectiveness of Sonicare is brushing for the full 2 minute duration.  The 1 year duration is convenient as all I need do is change the brush head at the start of every new year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note, this is for once daily brushing, not 2 or 3x.  If you brush 2x a day, they the time interval could be ~ 6 months, and if 3x a day, its 4 months and this is due to rate of wear and tear on the bristles.  As for how often to brush daily, I leave that to you.  Suffice to say, my dental visits suggests in my case, once a day works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See photo.ear and tear on the bristles.  As for how often to brush daily, I leave that to you.  Suffice to say, my dental visits suggests in my case, once a day works well.  See photo.</li>
            <li> As advertised, great savings over the single package</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and was exactly what I was expecting</li>
            <li> I have 3 bases for different Phillips Sonicare toothbrushes, wired and battery-operated.  The brush heads work on all 3, but don&#x27;t fit tightly on one of the bases.</li>
            <li> These do not seem as good as the ones I have previously used. I don&#x27;t get 3mos out of them.</li>
            <li> The brush heads are fine but, the toothbrush itself is horrible. If you are about to purchase a toothbrush get one of the newer models that has a different brush head because these let water in and the brush handle gets all moldy inside and gunky. It&#x27;s not the brush head that&#x27;s the problem. I have bought them from several places and it&#x27;s just a design flaw in the brush itself. I am going to get a different model soon. UPDATE: These are the correct fitting brush heads for this particular toothbrush. They shipped fine and were brand new. They work perfectly for this toothbrush. So, if you already have this toothbrush you will be happy with these heads. If you are considering buying this toothbrush, pass on this one and get a different model because this model with these type heads collect water and get gunky and get moldy.</li>
            <li> Received as expected.  Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Buy these.  Great deal.  If you love your electric toothbrush by Sonicare, stock up.  DO NOT BUY GENERIC replacement brush heads!  They are loud and horrible to use.  I threw the ones I bought out after two or three times using.. Stick with the name brand.  Unfortunately, they are totally overpriced.</li>
            <li> My teeth don&#x27;t feel clean without my Sonicare.  Since my husband and I both have one and we travel with them too, we bought a value pack of replacement heads.</li>
            <li> It was a great buy. Cheaper than buying a new set. Thanks for selling these so cheaply and quality . Where do you get them</li>
            <li> A good deal on the Phillips e series toothbrush heads. Hard to find where I live and a six pack of them with the cost savings lasts two years.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had a good experience with a previous purchase from Walmart.  This order, however, is turning out to be unsatisfactory because the bristles on the brush head I&#x27;m currently using, are busily falling out before they are becoming worn out enough to replace the head. Not a very good product for the money, $65.</li>
            <li> So much less expensive than buying local and the quality was perfect.  We&#x27;ve tried &#x27;generic&#x27; brands of replacement heads and they simply don&#x27;t work well, or at all (!).  Considering adding these to my subscriptions since we have a family of 7...</li>
            <li> Brush cleans well, but gets moldy under the head.</li>
            <li> This is one time the you need to buy the name brand vs the generic. The noise level and the quality of construction makes the Philips brand a must buy.</li>
            <li> Received it prompltly, great price!</li>
            <li> Product was true as advertised and arrived in a timely fashion. I was very pleased with the product and shipper</li>
            <li> If you have poor dental check-ups, try Sonicare. You won&#x27;t believe the difference. These replacement heads keep you going and going.</li>
            <li> It meats all specifications, I have been using it for more than 1 year and I am happy with it</li>
            <li> Product is great, the cost once I got my Costco flyer is double what you can by a six pack of these for at Costco.  Shame on me for not doing research first!</li>
            <li> Was looking online for replacement E-series toothbrushes.  These were the best priced ones I could find online for my Philips Sonicare Toothbrush.  Great deal.</li>
            <li> they where so much cheaper that the ones in the stores so I expected to get the wrong size or something to be wrong with my purchase but they fit and all is well.  I told everyone about this and where to go to buy them.  thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Phillips Sonicare Elite toothbrush for several years now.  Recently I tried some generic replacement brush heads and found out the first time that I used them that they lacked the quality and just did not perform half as well as the Sonicare replacement heads. I thought I was saving money by purchasing the generic heads, but boy was I wrong!  I ended up throwing the generic heads in the trash and purchased the Sonicare replacement heads and my Sonicare toothbrush works like a champ!  The generic heads had poor brush quality, and did not oscilate or clean like the original Sonicare brush heads do.</li>
            <li> The first product of its kind that actually worked as intended.  You won&#x27;t need to use a manual tooth brush if you use this product instead. Recommended by my dentist.  You do save a little by purchasing six pack.</li>
