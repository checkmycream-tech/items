            <li>So, my husband didn&#x27;t want to buy me the Palais Royal Dior nail lacquer, which i totally loved, so I had to search for a similar product.</li>

            <li> So, my husband didn&#x27;t want to buy me the Palais Royal Dior nail lacquer, which i totally loved, so I had to search for a similar product. I previously owned the Palais nail lacquer and I knew how it looked like in person. When this nail polish from OPI arrived I was extra excited to see if it was a true match to the Dior one. It&#x27;s a little off but not too much. They look almost identical, for a cheaper price. I think I even like this OPI better : )</li>
            <li> Love this color and get so many compliments when I wear it. It&#x27;s a soft grey with just a very touch of purple shade to it.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful color - I absolutely love it!  OPI polish is great, I&#x27;m hooked on it!  It&#x27;s pretty and lasts!</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite fall/winter nail color. I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores. Will order again!</li>
            <li> Im a fan of this color, its neutral, flattering to skin tone, some taupes or greys look really weird on me!</li>
            <li> This is a great color that can be worn with any color!!! Everyone ask me for the color name. My best friend was wearing it and I had to buy it to my sure I had it for the salon I go to!!!</li>
            <li> gotta love opi - they come up with the best new colors and this one will not disappoint you either</li>
            <li> Great color for everyday. Resists chipping. Beautiful color on nails!</li>
            <li> I like the color it is a real neutral for anything you wear.It doesn&#x27;t chip at the end of my finger tip....</li>
            <li> Awesome color.  The color goes well with any color and remains neutral, but eye catching.  If you like subtle but classy, this is the one.</li>
            <li> I just had my first manicure in ages, and my wonderful manicurist/stylist showed me this. I love it! Very contemporary.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love Opi. Great consistency, easy to apply, professional finish and very long lasting. Put a top coat on.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Will buy from again. Love this color! I like neutral/subtle colors on my hands and this is just that. Sometimes I will use two coats to make it stand out a little more and other times jst one coat with one coat top coat.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was loving for. The color in the photo is acurate, at least on my screen. The color is a medium gray with a purple tint, not as dark as some of the others I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> I love this color!!!!!! It is a show stopper....african american and white women stop me all the time and ask me what is the name and brand of this awesOMe color I&#x27;m wearing....I just gave a bottle to a good friend of mine.,..okay ladies when I saw this color and the price I bought more than one bottle...I dont care where you go you cannot find a bottle of OPI at this price..And yes I have told others where I got it from!!!!!! I could go on and on about the price and this beautiful nude/natural color...By the way my regular shipment came within TWO days.....I kid u not people..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> OPI has such a beautiful range of colors.  This is a very pretty taupe with a hint of lavender.  Looks nice on your nails!</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE this color. It was scheduled to arrive after the 27th and I got it today! I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> This nail polish is great! Love the color and it stays on twice as long as any other that I have used!!</li>
            <li> Pretty color. I don&#x27;t really care for it on my complexion. I&#x27;m black, complexion is comparable to singer Aaliyah...it&#x27;s ok on me. I think it&#x27;s better for someone with a lighter skin tone. But I&#x27;m all about the nudes and natural colors. I will update w/ pic.</li>
            <li> Great Fall color. Love my OPI nail polish as the quality stands out. The shipping  was fast. Very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I thought this polish looked like it was sort of a lavender or orchid color but when I got it it was no where near those colors. Won&#x27;t be using. Gave it to my manicurist who uses OPI. I&#x27;m sure one of her customers will like it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about the color of this when I first got it as a gift, but after wearing it, I find that it is a very flattering shade. I have extremely fair skin and this cool purple/gray color evens out the tone on my hands. It is very shiny, even without a top coat,  but it does require a second coat. I have not had a problem with it chipping, although it does wear off the ends of my nails.</li>
            <li> The color is exactly how it looks in the picture and the item was shipped on time! I was very satisfied</li>
            <li> Another awesome polish, it&#x27;s a soft purple and greyish tone. Very pretty and classy. Will look good with all the springtime colors, pastels.</li>
            <li> what a great product, so glad i finally got a hold of it: great colour, great name, long lasting, dries quickly! this nailvarnish did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as it looked to be &amp;#34;Weimaraner&amp;#34; colored, and needed a good neutral shade.  Love the color and it very closely matches my Weim&#x27;s coat, too!</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best color polish around.  It goes with everything that you wear.  People stop me and ask me whar the color is and where they find it.  I have referred many people to Amazon to get it.  It is very hard to find the polish at any shops around my area.</li>
            <li> I love OPI.  I love this color.  I get some many compliments on the color and it is so versatile.</li>
