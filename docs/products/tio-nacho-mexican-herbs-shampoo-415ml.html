            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I was attracted to the fact that the label said it was a strengthening shampoo and contained all these beneficial ingredients but also because my hair had been falling out in droves and figured &#x27;what&#x27;s one more product in my shampoo closet gonna hurt?&#x27;</li>
            <li>, I forgot my botle on family home this weekend s went again to the store and found it again on sale, bought 2 more bottles to have and use :</li>

            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend Tio Nacho for hair health.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with the fact the product reached me in PR in 3days.&lt;br /&gt;Not so happy with the detail that Tio Nacho stops hair loss because it keeps falling off and the breakage continues with no positive change.&lt;br /&gt;The most important question here is,..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product and leaves your hair super soft.</li>
            <li>was excited when I purchased it because I need to stop hair loss and breakage ASAP&lt;</li>
            <li>and the price was right!  </li>
            <li>They sell this product at wal-mart for 7.95 why paying like three times more + shiping when you can get it from Wal-mart shipper just to let peopple know and don&#x27;t waist too much money</li>
            <li>Luckily I happen to be walking a Walmart aisle and ran into the hispanic section w/a variety of ointments, lotions, and shampoo&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>, I now get great compliments from people that they love how thick my hair is, and that I hide my hair loss</li>
            <li>excellent product for thin hair</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this shampoo and my hair is so soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if is the true cause of my hair falling out any less, but I sure feel better about the way it looks and feels.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for asking my opinion.</li>
            <li>I first bought it on a whim when I saw it on the clearance shelf at Wal-mart for $5.  </li>
            <li>I was losing hair by the bunches, It stopped the falling in  the first bottle.</li>
            <li>I saw a difference after the first use.  </li>
            <li>I would most definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>The product arrived on time and it is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I was pretty upset because im having a ton of hair loss</li>
            <li>and my hair is finally looking more healthier and thicker..</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m definitely going to continue buying this product for my hair :)</li>
            <li>my oily scalp was clean in two washes my hair felt soft and with volume, it smells like honey very calming and relaxing scent its not hard on my dry ends and good for my oily scalp</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s hair is so much thicker looking and shinier.</li>
            <li>I also bought some of the shampoo and conditioner to lighten your hair and it works really well also.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all the high end brands and so far I like this better than anything else I&#x27;ve used my only concern</li>
            <li>love it leaves your hair soft and shinning, very manageable would buy gain in the near future.</li>
            <li>, it has a esoteric store like  , I like it , some say its like honey with herbs, results afetr first used leaves the hair soft and it starts to give volumen to it with use</li>
            <li>ok my husband is likes it and it has a honey smell careful when you are around bees!!</li>
            <li>The honey smell is strong and doesn&#x27;t last long but the positive effects do.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy, I don&#x27;t think it would be approved for sale if it was dangerous but who knows</li>
            <li>My brother recommended me this shampoo and after 2 months my hair is growing considerably.</li>
            <li>SOFT</li>
            <li>&amp; I was really looking forward to using this in hopes of growing back hair</li>
            <li>Same here, it was just a normal shampoo, nothing that I would buy again.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t feel the need to use as much as other shampoos, which helps it last much longer.  </li>
            <li>Bought 3 Weeks ago on promo Price at walmart, along with a friend Me because Lately got a lot of hair loss, it was ok when using garnier fructis for years, changed brands and tried 3 other</li>
            <li>, I was determined to try a new shampoo due to my hair loss.  </li>

            <li> for how long?</li>
            <li> I had never heard of Tio Nacho before and was curious.  </li>
            <li> other shampoo have I seen give the strengthening results as this one.</li>
            <li> Gel wouldn&#x27;t even keep it down.</li>
            <li> and i look like a porkypine if i tie my hair or leave it down</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m re-gaining hair, but it&#x27;s stronger,  with less hair loss.</li>
            <li> so now I&#x27;m going to try the anti-aging conditioner and pray for similiar - if not better - results.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering hair loss for the past couple of months.  </li>
            <li> Only to receive the WRONG shampoo...</li>
            <li> this shampoo and sucks black color use on my hair shampoo that takes away all the color does not recommend for anyone who uses color in her hair!!!</li>
            <li> and I forgot to pack my usually expensive brand</li>
            <li> /&gt;I recomend it to give it a try, is not that expensive, so why not?</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a rumor that it has dangerous chemicals that cause cancer</li>
            <li> It made our hair puffy and weird!</li>
            <li> Frustrated!!!!!</li>

            <li> Bought 3 Weeks ago on promo Price at walmart, along with a friend Me because Lately got a lot of hair loss, it was ok when using garnier fructis for years, changed brands and tried 3 other but problem started again , so have Heard of this one  so we bought 1 bottle each, it has a esoteric store like  , I like it , some say its like honey with herbs, results afetr first used leaves the hair soft and it starts to give volumen to it with use, I forgot my botle on family home this weekend s went again to the store and found it again on sale, bought 2 more bottles to have and use :-)&lt;br /&gt;I recomend it to give it a try, is not that expensive, so why not?</li>
            <li> It is okay for me, but my brothers love this stuff. It does soften the hair, but for me it too doesn&#x27;t help my hair to the fullest extent because of my PCOS.</li>
            <li> Love this product, the packing, the smell, the texture, the herbs....I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it! Makes your hair atrong and leaves a nice smell</li>
            <li> This product  give it a five star. love it leaves your hair soft and shinning, very manageable would buy gain in the near future.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo for me. I was losing hair by the bunches, It stopped the falling in  the first bottle. It&#x27;s the one with nettle.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering hair loss for the past couple of months.  I was literally shedding.  Then I decided to try a Hispanic product.  Luckily I happen to be walking a Walmart aisle and ran into the hispanic section w/a variety of ointments, lotions, and shampoo&#x27;s.  Never had I heard of Tio Nacho.  I picked up the bottle and decided to purchase it, I was determined to try a new shampoo due to my hair loss.  I have used it for about a wk, and I notice i&#x27;m not shedding like I was.  Trust me......I saw a difference after the first use.  [[ASIN:B0051UH84A TIO NACHO MEXICAN HERBS SHAMPOO]]I&#x27;m really impressed w/the results.  I would most definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> It made our hair puffy and weird! Gel wouldn&#x27;t even keep it down. I threw it in the trash before the bottle was gone.</li>
            <li> I have been going through hair loss and this has helped reduced the amount of hair that I yank out when I comb my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I now get great compliments from people that they love how thick my hair is, and that I hide my hair loss well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No other shampoo have I seen give the strengthening results as this one.</li>
            <li> I was given a bottle by a co-worker. I was telling her about my thinning/loss of hair and she said this would work. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m re-gaining hair, but it&#x27;s stronger,  with less hair loss. I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and it is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and leaves your hair super soft.</li>
            <li> I was pretty upset because im having a ton of hair loss &amp; I was really looking forward to using this in hopes of growing back hair but they sent me hair strengthening shampoo instead of anti-caida!</li>
            <li> Satisfied with the fact the product reached me in PR in 3days.&lt;br /&gt;Not so happy with the detail that Tio Nacho stops hair loss because it keeps falling off and the breakage continues with no positive change.&lt;br /&gt;The most important question here is,.. What are the instructions for this shampoo?&lt;br /&gt;Is it to be used daily? for how long? how many minutes? with or without massages?..&lt;br /&gt;I use it every 3 days. Just experienced the strong honey smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like the seller to write back if he has any extra details to make Tio Nacho work for me like it has for others as I have read here.&lt;br /&gt;I was excited when I purchased it because I need to stop hair loss and breakage ASAP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the opportunity.</li>
            <li> Same here, it was just a normal shampoo, nothing that I would buy again. Thank you very much for asking my opinion.</li>
            <li> Frustrated!!!!! I ordered this item for my husband... Only to receive the WRONG shampoo... I specifically ordered and paid for the ANTI-CAIDA and received STRENGTHENS HAIR SHAMPOO!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!!! I have been suffering from hair lost for 15 years do to having Kids.. I tried everything.. even went to the salons to get vitamin treatments for hair growth and taking Vitamins too, But still my hair was falling out in chunks every time I wash it or comb it. I only used this shampoo 3 times and I&#x27;m seeing a different my hair is not falling out when I wash it or comb it and my hair is finally looking more healthier and thicker.. I recommend this product to everyone.. And I&#x27;m definitely going to continue buying this product for my hair :)</li>
            <li> This product is okay. I agree with many. It does help your hair grow, but i think the hair growth is different for everyone. It help hair grow in my bald spots but it did not make my hair thicker and it made me grow alot of hair on myhairline and i look like a porkypine if i tie my hair or leave it down it looks like i cut my hair in the front and left some.</li>
            <li> this shampoo and sucks black color use on my hair shampoo that takes away all the color does not recommend for anyone who uses color in her hair!!!</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair and have lost a lot of hair in front, ever since I started to use, my hair looks full and can barely see boldness</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied the product and the speed I received it I would do business with them again, I was very satisfied</li>
