            <li>also it smells so good</li>
            <li>Always a good product</li>
            <li>The product should be packed in plastic leak proof bags or something better.</li>
            <li>A big win all the way around!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It really works great,</li>
            <li>I have always struggled with dandruff and this one seams to be the best one to take care of it and dry flaky skin on my face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as strong chemically as the others we&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>but this is by far the best one so far.</li>
            <li>It smelled so good and gave my hair a clean and soft feel.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure I will stick with this forever.</li>
            <li>Good lather, rinses clean, and leaves just enough conditioning effect without a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>has a really good smell with the mint giving a slight refreshing cool feel without freezing my scalp  when hit with wind</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo because it not only works it smells great too.  </li>
            <li>and im glad i did this shampoo works wonders better then head and shoulders at relieving dry flaky scalps.</li>
            <li>I just wish they sent the right one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>better than the competing brands, according to my son but you can only find it online now.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, this review is real and so was my scalp itch.</li>
            <li>scent of this shampoo is fresh and not overly masculine.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot, but the bottle leaked in the box, the cap wasn&#x27;t sealed firmly.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li>Does a better job than the other anti-dandruff products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>The price of this 21-ounce pump is better here on Amazon than it is in any of my local stores or other online sources.</li>
            <li>I can only guess that the shampoo is better for your scalp aside from the active ingredient.  </li>
            <li>either, so no conditioner as far as I can tell</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;little man&amp;#34; in our house started experiencing dandruff issues when all his hormones started going wild in puberty.</li>
            <li>sure next time to close it firm.</li>
            <li>Finally we came across this Clear shampoo, and scalp issues and dandruff are now both bygone issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li>make ur hair feels so clean n thick, S.I.N.Y.LADYRIDER</li>

            <li> better than the competing brands, according to my son but you can only find it online now.</li>
            <li> great shampoo I ordered it for my son as he gets it every month I&#x27;ve used it also it smells so good make ur hair feels so clean n thick, S.I.N.Y.LADYRIDER</li>
            <li> Great shampoo.  I have always struggled with dandruff and this one seams to be the best one to take care of it and dry flaky skin on my face.  I have uses H&amp;S, Selsun Blue and others over the years but this is by far the best one so far.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works! It is the only shampoo I&#x27;ve found, that actually takes the scalp itchiness and flakes away almost immediately. I didn&#x27;t purchase mine on Amazon, but at Walmart. Nevertheless, this review is real and so was my scalp itch. I tried others out for the sake of comparison, and probably Head &amp; Shoulders was the only one that came close. But H&amp;S seemed to dry out my hair quite a bit, whereas this product did not. And it isn&#x27;t a 2-in-1 either, so no conditioner as far as I can tell but my hair was softer and smelled awesome. Pretty sure I will stick with this forever.</li>
            <li> The bottle was leaking. The product should be packed in plastic leak proof bags or something better.</li>
            <li> Always a good product</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;little man&amp;#34; in our house started experiencing dandruff issues when all his hormones started going wild in puberty. We tried all the usual dandruff shampoos, but they dried out his scalp and just made the dandruff worse. Finally we came across this Clear shampoo, and scalp issues and dandruff are now both bygone issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of this shampoo is fresh and not overly masculine. Good lather, rinses clean, and leaves just enough conditioning effect without a greasy feel. The price of this 21-ounce pump is better here on Amazon than it is in any of my local stores or other online sources. A big win all the way around!</li>
            <li> Package came broken and the liquid spilled out everywhere, otherwise a decent product. I found it is too harsh and might cause dryness to my hair/skin.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. However, there is one big problem. I ordered the Hydration Lock Formula Scalp and Hair Anti-Dandruff Shampoo with Ginseng Tea Tree and Mint as the item is pictured, but instead I was sent the Scalp Hydrator with Vitamins, Ginseng and Mint. They sent me the wrong bottle. Upon further review, I noticed the picture in the item description is wrong. The first picture in the item description is the correct bottle, however the second picture is of the wrong bottle, the bottle which I received. The bottle you are supposed to get is blue and silver, the bottle you will receive is orange and green. Amazon/Clear please fix this issue. I want the bottle that has Tea Tree in it and not the 2n1 conditioner with Tea Tree. For now, here is a link to the correct bottle: http://www.amazon.com/CLEAR-Scalp-Anti-Dandruff-Shampoo-Hydration/dp/B00OO0IX9W/ref&#x3D;sr_1_11?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1433005996&amp;sr&#x3D;1-11&amp;keywords&#x3D;clear+shampoo+anti+dandruff+tea+tree</li>
            <li> has a really good smell with the mint giving a slight refreshing cool feel without freezing my scalp  when hit with wind</li>
            <li> Does a better job than the other anti-dandruff products I&#x27;ve tried.  It has the same active ingredient at what I would guess is the same concentration, so I can only guess that the shampoo is better for your scalp aside from the active ingredient.  Also has a pleasant scent and leaves my hair feeling good.</li>
            <li> I have had to fight dandruff for the past 10 years.  I started using this shampoo a couple of months ago and it works wonders. I really like this shampoo because it not only works it smells great too.  The plunger style dispenser prevents over usage of the product saving money as well.  I would reccomend this shampoo to anyone with dandruff problems.</li>
            <li> I purchase this a lot for my husband. He needs a anti dandruff shampoo and the others we have purchased make his hair fall out. We like the smell. It really works great, no dandruff and he is keeping his hair. It&#x27;s not as strong chemically as the others we&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot, but the bottle leaked in the box, the cap wasn&#x27;t sealed firmly.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure next time to close it firm.</li>
            <li> Tried selsum, head &amp; shoulders, etc. And this was the only one that helped with dandruff</li>
            <li> its hard to find this shampoo in stores anymore so as soon as i saw it on here i jumped to ordering it and im glad i did this shampoo works wonders better then head and shoulders at relieving dry flaky scalps.</li>
            <li> The one they sent to me is not as the description. But I still kept it. It work great. I just wish they sent the right one.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the CORRECT product (I bought from HEB). It smelled so good and gave my hair a clean and soft feel.</li>
            <li> As described and arrived on time.  Look forward to buying again in the future.</li>
