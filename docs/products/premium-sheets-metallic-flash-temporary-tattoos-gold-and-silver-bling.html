            <li>Received These free for my opinion and review.</li>
            <li>(you may want to ask a friend to hold 1 end while you smooth it</li>
            <li>She actually turned out to be one of the most incredibly fascinating people that I have ever had the opportunity to know, with a backstory that would make a sailor blush.</li>
            <li>I am super excited about my new metallic tattoos:) I tried them out this weekend and got so many compliments on them!</li>
            <li>this is fun &amp; unique eye catching-but if you are putting on a longer piece- wrapping around your ankle or wrist, you have to pre-measure/cut so it doesn&#x27;t overlap-be sure to smooth it out so that it doesn&#x27;t bunch up</li>
            <li>The instructions show they are easy to apply, quick to remove, even if I want to change styles .  </li>
            <li>great designs, and they stayed on a long time, but the gl</li>
            <li>Pretty and stylish, if you ask me.</li>
            <li>They are so much fun to use!</li>
            <li>My Granddaughter also love the idea of having a tattoo and says they are so pretty.</li>
            <li>I have to say though that when I first ordered these, I thought, well these will be cute to have to play with the girls.  </li>
            <li>However, from the angle that most people would see, really it still looked basically fine.  </li>
            <li>out any of the tattoos, peel off the plastic and apply the sticky side to a clean body part.</li>
            <li>These temporary tattoos are extremely easy to apply and they add some fun and shininess to your get-up.</li>
            <li>first try was less than perfect...</li>
            <li>cant recommend this product enough, it&#x27;s nice to finally get a Fabulous Product at a great Price.</li>
            <li>like how this product comes in sheets of 12 (or more) with a large variety of designs, wording, objects, etc.</li>
            <li>These flash tattoos are so super fun!</li>
            <li>I think it would be cool to see a ring</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but I am definitely glad I gave these a try.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I bought one pack of these and was able to split the whole pack between for both my daughters for part of their birthday gift.</li>
            <li>These are super fun and super easy to put on.  </li>
            <li>these are really cool</li>
            <li>It was a gift, my little sister-in-law loved it!</li>
            <li>But no, it&#x27;s pretty easy.  </li>
            <li>They go on so easily and stay for quite a while without washing away the first time you hit them with water.</li>
            <li>One of my daughters was wearing one the other day and it looked great.</li>
            <li>I send this Temporary Tattoo to my Sister, well it has 12 sheets per order so since its just temporary tattoo her kids will love it, Better to have temporary than permanent, less pain too and easy to apply with , faster compare to henna , specially for kids that will attend some party, have a fabulous look with this metallic design with a shinning and shimmering tat</li>
            <li>and I am super excited to continue to find new and interesting ways to wear and coordinate them with my moods and style.  </li>
            <li>and you can quickly remove them with baby oil or rubbing alcohol and a cotton ball.</li>

            <li>Love the different choices and how easy they are to apply.</li>
            <li>Applying the tattoos on my body was extremely easy and I was able to wear the tattoo all day with no wears, peeling and the color never did fade; I received multiple compliments on my tattoos throughout the day.</li>

            <li>and I had a ton of fun applying them before a night out.</li>
            <li>These temporary tattoos are really fun, once you get the hang of application.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned after testing.&lt;br /&gt;Views and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>really stay on, but when you want to take them off it&#x27;s pretty easy.</li>
            <li>go on really easy, just like you would a normal temporary tattoo.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t get all of my sheets the first time and they quickly replace them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Delivered right on time</li>
            <li>They all came right off and stayed on the skin well.  </li>
            <li>The paper came right off all of the tattoos</li>
            <li>She applied one right away</li>

            <li>Just a little warm water and a rag and boom!</li>
            <li>While only 7 and 4, I can see that they are quickly getting out of the age of cutesy type of things like most of the tattoos for girls were.</li>
            <li>Four sheets of pretty metallic temporary tattoos, provided hours of fun with plenty of &amp;</li>
            <li>Great for a bachelorette party or event where you want to do something out of the ordinary.</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s pretty much covered right now!</li>

            <li>, I have created some really neat looks with them.    </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about trends, but I decided to give these a try anyway.  </li>
            <li>So much so, that I couldn&#x27;t wait to put them on when I opened the package.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are absolutely gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They stick very well, are waterproof and don&#x27;t flake off even when they come in contact</li>
            <li>someone asked if I really got a silver colored tattoo.</li>
            <li>tattoos that are much pricier.</li>
            <li>highly recommend THESE metallic jewelry tattoos over any others!</li>
            <li>Thanks SKTrendz.</li>
            <li>The metallic gold and silver really stands out and the shine of the metallic lasts for days.</li>
            <li>You can use the whole design or just a part of one.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>Its very easy to apply in just less than a minute</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these to anybody looking for a high quality temporary tattoo!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After reading the directions more carefully, the second try as better, and by the fourth try I was a pro, and you will be too.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I had no bad reaction to it of any sort, the skin did not get red or irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re way better quality than the cheaper tattoo products I&#x27;ve bought previously.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am particularly fond of the angel wings and peacock feathers.</li>
            <li>Or, maybe you’re at a business lunch and that shy geeky guy from IT orders from the wine menu in flawless French.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more &amp; highly recommend them if you are looking for the closest thing to a tattoo without getting an actual tattoo.    </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Not only are they made out of amazing quality, but I went out on a date last night to Red Lobster and the people I were with thought that the necklace one I was wearing was real jewelry.</li>
            <li>These are high quality and they are all mine...</li>
            <li>These are so fun and if applied correctly can last for days.</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:aa8c40ec1848caab92bf972cc0fe1c9e]]These temporary tattoos are easy to apply and stay on pretty well even on my the back of hand which gets wet.  </li>
            <li>Well, needless to say, I ordered at least 5 more design sheets and will be ordering more and more designs ...</li>
            <li>Lasted longer than I expected even though I am a clean freak and  </li>
            <li>You might find cheaper offers for inferior product, but you won&#x27;t beat this quality!</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, you get four sheets and they exactly match the pictures up above.  </li>
            <li>The instructions are pretty simple</li>
            <li>and they all worked exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>The package arrived with the same exact sheets that were in the pictures.</li>
            <li>I figured this way, I&#x27;d be able to say how long they last under different conditions.  </li>
            <li>They are cool, I have bought other Temp Tattoos over the years these work</li>
            <li>My 8 yr old son</li>
            <li>Anything you can think of almost as far as designs.</li>
            <li>I was fairly surprised on how well the gold/silver colors stays after being put on.</li>
            <li>I even or one on next to my real tattoos amd</li>
            <li>and it was completely just by holding it onto the wrist.  </li>
            <li>okay on day 3, and not nice on day 4.  </li>
            <li>They really don&#x27;t last long but are cool.</li>
            <li>have come right off as soon as they get wet.  </li>
            <li>I was able to give each of them a complete set of necklaces, bracelets, along with all the other feathers and other miscellaneous.</li>
            <li>Tons of options in the 12 premium sheets: I love the range of choices, everything from subtle understated stars, to super-sexy tribal bands.</li>
            <li>They can be used for casual and more formal settings, which is pretty awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I have tiny wrists), but the bracelet ones are long enough to go around most wrists or the outside of a forearm (or even smaller biceps).  </li>
            <li>it comes off very easy !! :(</li>
            <li>but they only thing was it only last a day and come right off when it said on the directions that it last 3 days.</li>
            <li>I like using these when I go to parties or just go out in general.</li>
            <li>Since Mama is too chicken to get a real tattoo she finally has her own temporary ones</li>
            <li>showed a little wear after 24 hours and a little more after 48 hours.  </li>
            <li>and I love that “take a second look” flash!similar to other temporary tattoos but the result is far from common.</li>
            <li>These Spaworks Premium Flash Tattoos can be used in obvious places to grab that first look, or in less conspicuous places to coax a second look.</li>
            <li>They also last at least 2 full days before starting to fall off (that is,</li>
            <li>I really like them, however they were bent when I received them and left almost half of each page unusable.</li>
            <li>It’s that little thing that can change your whole perception of someone, something that makes you stop and take notice, and changes how you look at them.</li>

            <li> these are super cute and my friends</li>

            <li> They are perfect when you want to dress up just a little.  </li>
            <li> Great look especially with summer clothes!!!</li>
            <li> I love love the many different, stylish designs provided.</li>

            <li> cheap looking and tacky.</li>
            <li> Received These free for my opinion and review.</li>
            <li> (you may want to ask a friend to hold 1 end while you smooth it</li>
            <li> She actually turned out to be one of the most incredibly fascinating people that I have ever had the opportunity to know, with a backstory that would make a sailor blush.</li>
            <li> I am super excited about my new metallic tattoos:) I tried them out this weekend and got so many compliments on them!</li>
            <li> this is fun &amp; unique eye catching-but if you are putting on a longer piece- wrapping around your ankle or wrist, you have to pre-measure/cut so it doesn&#x27;t overlap-be sure to smooth it out so that it doesn&#x27;t bunch up</li>
            <li> The instructions show they are easy to apply, quick to remove, even if I want to change styles .  </li>
            <li> great designs, and they stayed on a long time, but the gl</li>
            <li> Pretty and stylish, if you ask me.</li>
            <li> They are so much fun to use!</li>
            <li> My Granddaughter also love the idea of having a tattoo and says they are so pretty.</li>
            <li> I have to say though that when I first ordered these, I thought, well these will be cute to have to play with the girls.  </li>
            <li> However, from the angle that most people would see, really it still looked basically fine.  </li>
            <li> out any of the tattoos, peel off the plastic and apply the sticky side to a clean body part.</li>
            <li> These temporary tattoos are extremely easy to apply and they add some fun and shininess to your get-up.</li>
            <li> first try was less than perfect...</li>
            <li> cant recommend this product enough, it&#x27;s nice to finally get a Fabulous Product at a great Price.</li>
            <li> like how this product comes in sheets of 12 (or more) with a large variety of designs, wording, objects, etc.</li>
            <li> These flash tattoos are so super fun!</li>
            <li> I think it would be cool to see a ring</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but I am definitely glad I gave these a try.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I bought one pack of these and was able to split the whole pack between for both my daughters for part of their birthday gift.</li>
            <li> These are super fun and super easy to put on.  </li>
            <li> these are really cool</li>
            <li> It was a gift, my little sister-in-law loved it!</li>
            <li> But no, it&#x27;s pretty easy.  </li>
            <li> They go on so easily and stay for quite a while without washing away the first time you hit them with water.</li>
            <li> One of my daughters was wearing one the other day and it looked great.</li>
            <li> I send this Temporary Tattoo to my Sister, well it has 12 sheets per order so since its just temporary tattoo her kids will love it, Better to have temporary than permanent, less pain too and easy to apply with , faster compare to henna , specially for kids that will attend some party, have a fabulous look with this metallic design with a shinning and shimmering tat</li>
            <li> and I am super excited to continue to find new and interesting ways to wear and coordinate them with my moods and style.  </li>
            <li> and you can quickly remove them with baby oil or rubbing alcohol and a cotton ball.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick, too.</li>
            <li> They arrived just in time for New Years Eve!!!!</li>
            <li> Metallic temporary tattoos are apparently quite trendy these days.  </li>
            <li> Arrived super fast and they are just what I needed!!</li>
            <li> Hold a sponge or wet cloth over the area, or run water over the top for a minute..when you remove the white paper the tattoo is exposed and looks beautiful.</li>
            <li> Love the different choices and how easy they are to apply.</li>
            <li> Applying the tattoos on my body was extremely easy and I was able to wear the tattoo all day with no wears, peeling and the color never did fade; I received multiple compliments on my tattoos throughout the day.</li>
            <li> so many different choices &amp; so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the little unexpected things have the greatest impact.</li>
            <li> They are all extremely detailed and intricate and are a really unique new take on accessorizing</li>
            <li> Great for everyday fashion usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The metallic quality makes them a lot of fun for holiday and cocktail parties.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve seen ONE sheet go for $7 at a store so trust me, these are so worth</li>
            <li> and I had a ton of fun applying them before a night out.</li>
            <li> These temporary tattoos are really fun, once you get the hang of application.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned after testing.&lt;br /&gt;Views and opinions are my own.</li>

            <li> go on really easy, just like you would a normal temporary tattoo.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t get all of my sheets the first time and they quickly replace them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Delivered right on time</li>
            <li> They all came right off and stayed on the skin well.  </li>
            <li> The paper came right off all of the tattoos</li>
            <li> She applied one right away</li>
            <li> There are so many different varieties of designs, that you can be sure to keep the fun alive for awhile!</li>
            <li> Just a little warm water and a rag and boom!</li>
            <li> While only 7 and 4, I can see that they are quickly getting out of the age of cutesy type of things like most of the tattoos for girls were.</li>
            <li> Four sheets of pretty metallic temporary tattoos, provided hours of fun with plenty of &amp;</li>
            <li> Great for a bachelorette party or event where you want to do something out of the ordinary.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s pretty much covered right now!</li>
            <li> it is removed easily with nail polish remover-some people may be sensitive to nail polish remover on their skin.</li>
            <li> These are fun and beautiful and last longer than I expected.  </li>
            <li> the end, if you are in the market for this type of product, these lasted a long time and were very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>

            <li> I really like all the choices of temporary tattoos provided, necklaces, bracelets, feathers..something for everyone!</li>
            <li> I was able to use the same paper towel for all the tattoos I applied in one session.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These are really fun to use, being that it&#x27;s summer time - so you really can take advantage on flashing them around.</li>
            <li> I am thinking I might have to keep at least ONE of these sets for myself lol.</li>
            <li> I currently have one 2 on and I am completely satisfied that I may wear my summer outfit and show off designs on my body without the need to permanently tattoo my body and can change designs as I feel or according to what I am wearing that day.</li>
            <li> and I love that “take a second look” flash!</li>
            <li> and it last for 3 to more days&lt;br /&gt;unless</li>
            <li> Its exactly as described and its exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> There are definitely more than a few of the tattoo designs that I really like and wish there were more of and</li>
            <li> For someone who was considering getting a real tattoo until I found out the cost, these temp ones are inexpensive and fun.</li>
            <li> Used my first one today and got compliments on it.</li>
            <li> These temporary metallic tattoos were exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> know my niece is simply going to love these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the ones you love for when you are the above mentioned pro.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Temporary tattoo is really nice to have it on your body especially with new bikini or just on your body.</li>
            <li> They look as pretty as real jewelry and they look as good several days later as the first day you put them on.</li>
            <li> so these can be fun for adults and older teens for a fun new</li>
            <li> The quality was first rate and looks like real jewelry.</li>
            <li> The instructions that came with the tattoos are easy to follow even for the younger kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The colors and designs are so fun and will look even better this summer when I get a little tan going on.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, SKTrends...</li>
            <li> Thanks a bunch.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would like these Flash Tattoos as much as I would, but I do.</li>
            <li> , I have created some really neat looks with them.    </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about trends, but I decided to give these a try anyway.  </li>
            <li> So much so, that I couldn&#x27;t wait to put them on when I opened the package.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are absolutely gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They stick very well, are waterproof and don&#x27;t flake off even when they come in contact</li>
            <li> someone asked if I really got a silver colored tattoo.</li>
            <li> tattoos that are much pricier.</li>
            <li> highly recommend THESE metallic jewelry tattoos over any others!</li>
            <li> Thanks SKTrendz.</li>
            <li> The metallic gold and silver really stands out and the shine of the metallic lasts for days.</li>
            <li> You can use the whole design or just a part of one.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> Its very easy to apply in just less than a minute</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these to anybody looking for a high quality temporary tattoo!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading the directions more carefully, the second try as better, and by the fourth try I was a pro, and you will be too.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I had no bad reaction to it of any sort, the skin did not get red or irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re way better quality than the cheaper tattoo products I&#x27;ve bought previously.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am particularly fond of the angel wings and peacock feathers.</li>
            <li> Or, maybe you’re at a business lunch and that shy geeky guy from IT orders from the wine menu in flawless French.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more &amp; highly recommend them if you are looking for the closest thing to a tattoo without getting an actual tattoo.    </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Not only are they made out of amazing quality, but I went out on a date last night to Red Lobster and the people I were with thought that the necklace one I was wearing was real jewelry.</li>
            <li> These are high quality and they are all mine...</li>
            <li> These are so fun and if applied correctly can last for days.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:aa8c40ec1848caab92bf972cc0fe1c9e]]These temporary tattoos are easy to apply and stay on pretty well even on my the back of hand which gets wet.  </li>
            <li> Well, needless to say, I ordered at least 5 more design sheets and will be ordering more and more designs ...</li>
            <li> Lasted longer than I expected even though I am a clean freak and  </li>
            <li> You might find cheaper offers for inferior product, but you won&#x27;t beat this quality!</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, you get four sheets and they exactly match the pictures up above.  </li>
            <li> The instructions are pretty simple</li>
            <li> and they all worked exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> The package arrived with the same exact sheets that were in the pictures.</li>
            <li> I figured this way, I&#x27;d be able to say how long they last under different conditions.  </li>
            <li> They are cool, I have bought other Temp Tattoos over the years these work</li>
            <li> My 8 yr old son</li>
            <li> Anything you can think of almost as far as designs.</li>
            <li> I was fairly surprised on how well the gold/silver colors stays after being put on.</li>
            <li> I even or one on next to my real tattoos amd</li>
            <li> and it was completely just by holding it onto the wrist.  </li>
            <li> okay on day 3, and not nice on day 4.  </li>
            <li> They really don&#x27;t last long but are cool.</li>
            <li> have come right off as soon as they get wet.  </li>
            <li> I was able to give each of them a complete set of necklaces, bracelets, along with all the other feathers and other miscellaneous.</li>
            <li> Tons of options in the 12 premium sheets: I love the range of choices, everything from subtle understated stars, to super-sexy tribal bands.</li>
            <li> They can be used for casual and more formal settings, which is pretty awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I have tiny wrists), but the bracelet ones are long enough to go around most wrists or the outside of a forearm (or even smaller biceps).  </li>
            <li> it comes off very easy !! :(</li>
            <li> but they only thing was it only last a day and come right off when it said on the directions that it last 3 days.</li>
            <li> I like using these when I go to parties or just go out in general.</li>
            <li> Since Mama is too chicken to get a real tattoo she finally has her own temporary ones</li>
            <li> showed a little wear after 24 hours and a little more after 48 hours.  </li>
            <li> and I love that “take a second look” flash!similar to other temporary tattoos but the result is far from common.</li>
            <li> These Spaworks Premium Flash Tattoos can be used in obvious places to grab that first look, or in less conspicuous places to coax a second look.</li>
            <li> They also last at least 2 full days before starting to fall off (that is,</li>
            <li> I really like them, however they were bent when I received them and left almost half of each page unusable.</li>
            <li> It’s that little thing that can change your whole perception of someone, something that makes you stop and take notice, and changes how you look at them.</li>
            <li> These slide right on the skin after wetting the back, fun product and flashy but classy if you want to add a little glimmer to your outfit just put one of these on.  </li>
            <li> The Flash Tattoos also last for a really long time, and they don&#x27;t fade until you decide to take them off</li>
            <li> So unless you are immersing yourself in water, these should last quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sometimes with the larger or longer tattoos the design did not completely detach from the sheet when applying.</li>
            <li> I thought they may turn out to be cheesy &amp; cheap, but they turned out to be exactly opposite.</li>
            <li> They catch the light and sparkle like actual jewelry, but they don&#x27;t look cheesy at all.</li>
            <li> Have you ever known someone for a few years and then found out something about them that completely took you off guard?</li>
            <li> Just lay the tattoo over where you want it, and wet the back of the paper until the tattoo gets transferred to your skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many tattoos I have used on my kids over the years that have either been impossible to remove or the opposite...</li>
            <li> At first I thought it would be age inappropriate however if worn in a subtle minimal manner</li>
            <li> The girls all left with some flashy fun bling on their arms or ankles.</li>
            <li> Like, you’ve seen them every single day at work for years</li>
            <li> If you are wearing the tattoos on a part of the body that only gets wet briefly in the shower and isn&#x27;t covered by clothing, though, these would last a very long time -- probably at least 4-5 days, if not longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are wearing the tattoos on a part of the body that only gets wet briefly in the shower and isn&#x27;t covered by clothing, though, these would last a very long time -- probably at least 4-5 days, if not longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> On some of the pages, I cut down the middle depending on what was on the page.</li>
            <li> The application is similar to other temporary tattoos but the result is far from common.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several different kinds in the past and</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t use every single one, but there are definitely quite a few that appeal to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I just used a wet paper towel for the application.  </li>
            <li> You just peel the plastic protector off, place on the skin and put a wet washcloth or paper towel over and hold for 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> You can see from the pictures that we tried a few different types and parts of the body</li>
            <li> And those four days I spent in salt water, on the beach, and had a ton of, aloe, lotion, and sunscreen rubbed onto about 4 times a day.  </li>
            <li> Since I had it on my hand which gets wet</li>
            <li> Get a wet rag, put the Flash Tattoo where you want it, wet the paper until damp, wait about 30 sec., and then peel off.    </li>
            <li> All you do is hold it to your skin, take a wet rag and hold it to the back of tattoo for a few minutes, then lift and peel , voila&#x27;.you are a tattooed</li>
            <li> I was stunned at how long, with a little care, that the tattoos lasted.</li>
            <li> I was stunned at how long, with a little care, that the tattoos lasted.</li>
            <li> Not a lot of wrinkling but that may be due to the youth of their skin:)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for how it holds up on any other part of the body, but I have no doubt that it will still do well.</li>
            <li> The Price can&#x27;t be beat compared to Flash tats and some of the other companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have no affiliation with any manufacturer or distributor other than choosing to review their item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These little fun flashy tattoos can be just that thing ..</li>
            <li> We tried putting a small silver feather behind the ear with hair pulled up for a dressy look and it was really pretty.  </li>
            <li> Use a very wet sponge to press it down for 30 seconds&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> last about 3 days (if you don&#x27;t scrub too hard on the area of the tattoo)</li>
            <li> The only negative remark I have is that the directions were sort of odd, because it says something along the lines of put on with spirits??</li>
            <li> Every time that I look down at my wrist with the one that is made to look like a bracelet, I think I have a piece of jewelry on.  </li>
            <li> The constant motion of the socks rubbing up against my leg as I walked mean that there was some wear on these, too.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Simply place on your skin, and press down with a slightly damp washcloth.</li>
            <li> They are gold silver and black.  </li>
            <li> Point is, it was that little subtle clue that invited a second look.</li>
            <li> I have had problems in the past with half the tattoo not applying or it comes off paper extremely light(leaving</li>
            <li> It was that little whisper of rebellion that made me stop and look again.</li>
            <li> A bit disappointed but they&#x27;re cool tattoos.</li>
            <li> and I got quite a few compliments.</li>
            <li> the third shows this dressy look behind the ear for a night on the town.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 12 year old godchild is obsessed with them</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wash or get it wet for at least an hour.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> Hopefully this review was was helpful, but if not, just let me know what&#x27;s missing</li>
            <li> There was a woman that I worked with, she was almost a caricature of what you would think of if you were asked to picture someone “uptight” “conservative” “plain” and “middle-age”.</li>
            <li> The picture I included is one of the necklace tats that is included (sorry for the weird angle, was trying to get the full pic).</li>
            <li> I must say that their friends were a little jealous over them!</li>
            <li> coloring than other brands!!!</li>
            <li> keep in mind you can cut the sheet and select a small design that you don&#x27;t mind messing up.</li>
            <li> (at least mine didn&#x27;t).</li>
            <li> The problem I have run into with other tattoos is the fact that they do not stay on!!!!</li>
            <li> mean that there was some wear on these, too.  </li>
            <li> then one day you’re at a mutual friend’s wedding reception and it turns out your coworker can really, seriously dance.</li>
            <li> Tattoos with some serious &amp;#34;flash&amp;#34; to these tattoos.  </li>
            <li> Which he usually Says the fake ones are dull.</li>
            <li> Slowly peel that backing off, and there you are!</li>
            <li> and I was afraid I might mess these up.  </li>
            <li> The chlorine usually fades the tattoo that day, with these they stay on for 3 plus days(which shocked me).</li>
            <li> well others have failed to come off the paper.</li>
            <li> Sorry kids.  </li>
            <li> tattoo itself is very thin.</li>

            <li> I really like them, however they were bent when I received them and left almost half of each page unusable.</li>
            <li> llike it!! They are even better when you see them in person</li>
            <li> It was a gift, my little sister-in-law loved it!</li>
            <li> So cute. Got these for my friends bachelorette party and the girls loved it! Easy to use ad cute designs!</li>
            <li> So versatile and easy to use. These are by far the best quality I have seen and they last longer than others. I purchased mine at the Christmas show here in Boise. Can&#x27;t wait to get more.</li>
            <li> These tattoos are great!  I received a promotional pack and I am super excited to continue to find new and interesting ways to wear and coordinate them with my moods and style.  The metallic quality makes them a lot of fun for holiday and cocktail parties.  I love the way the geometric designs pop!  Definite stocking stuffers for my friends this year.</li>
            <li> I just received these from Amazon today. These temporary tattoos are outstanding. They&#x27;re way better quality than the cheaper tattoo products I&#x27;ve bought previously. You might find cheaper offers for inferior product, but you won&#x27;t beat this quality!</li>
            <li> Love these!!! They arrived just in time for New Years Eve!!!!</li>
            <li> These are fun and beautiful and last longer than I expected.  I get lots of great comments, and some people think it&#x27;s a real tattoo!  When using the bracelets, I wrap it around my arm and then tape it to make sure they stay still.  It comes out perfect every time.</li>
            <li> I am super excited about my new metallic tattoos:) I tried them out this weekend and got so many compliments on them! I&#x27;ve bought several different kinds in the past and I can honestly say that these are by far the best quality. Even the packaging was nice. I know where I&#x27;ll be buying these from now on. Thanks, SKTrends... you ROCK!!</li>
            <li> Stayed on great during Coachella</li>
            <li> Awesome tattoos. They look as pretty as real jewelry and they look as good several days later as the first day you put them on. They really are waterproof and the quality is excellent.</li>
            <li> Great quality. Makes a great gift!! Grabbed these at the Boise Christmas Show, wish I would have bought more. Highly recommend this product. Great for people of ALL ages!</li>
            <li> Great product, bought at Christmas show in Boise. Great for stocking stuffer/ Christmas gift. Great quality and great seller. Thanks a bunch.</li>
            <li> great designs, and they stayed on a long time, but the gl</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would like these Flash Tattoos as much as I would, but I do. I thought they may turn out to be cheesy &amp; cheap, but they turned out to be exactly opposite. Not only are they made out of amazing quality, but I went out on a date last night to Red Lobster and the people I were with thought that the necklace one I was wearing was real jewelry. I love all of them, but the ones that look like jewelry are really ingenious! I would love to see a pack of just necklaces and jewelry. I think it would be cool to see a ring one&#x27;s as well. I love how it turn&#x27;s your creativity on as well, I have created some really neat looks with them.    The Flash Tattoos also last for a really long time, and they don&#x27;t fade until you decide to take them off (at least mine didn&#x27;t). Which I found olive oil as my way to get them off with ease.    The only negative remark I have is that the directions were sort of odd, because it says something along the lines of put on with spirits?? Don&#x27;t make it more complicated then it has to be. Get a wet rag, put the Flash Tattoo where you want it, wet the paper until damp, wait about 30 sec., and then peel off.    It&#x27;s so simple &amp; elegant. I will definitely be ordering more &amp; highly recommend them if you are looking for the closest thing to a tattoo without getting an actual tattoo.    S/N: The picture I included is one of the necklace tats that is included (sorry for the weird angle, was trying to get the full pic).</li>
            <li> They really don&#x27;t last long but are cool.</li>
            <li> Love you love you love. At first I thought it would be age inappropriate however if worn in a subtle minimal manner I think a woman of any age can get away with wearing something so beautiful. Completely impressed! Lasted longer than I expected even though I am a clean freak and  gym rat --shower at least twice a day kudos!!!!🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟✨❤️✨</li>
            <li> Totally fun and easy to apply to many parts of your body! Four sheets of pretty metallic temporary tattoos, provided hours of fun with plenty of &amp;#34;these are so cool&amp;#34; from the kids. I even got my husband to try one on! This made a great family activity. The instructions that came with the tattoos are easy to follow even for the younger kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cut out any of the tattoos, peel off the plastic and apply the sticky side to a clean body part. Hold a sponge or wet cloth over the area, or run water over the top for a minute..when you remove the white paper the tattoo is exposed and looks beautiful. I really like all the choices of temporary tattoos provided, necklaces, bracelets, feathers..something for everyone! I received this product for purpose of testing an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Temporary tattoo is really nice to have it on your body especially with new bikini or just on your body. Love it!</li>
            <li> Many choices, easy to apply</li>
            <li> Great quality and customer service!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get all of my sheets the first time and they quickly replace them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They last about 3 days (if you don&#x27;t scrub too hard on the area of the tattoo)</li>
            <li> Metallic temporary tattoos are apparently quite trendy these days.  I&#x27;ve seen them show up in a couple of different subscription boxes.  I don&#x27;t know much about trends, but I decided to give these a try anyway.  I thought they would be fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, you get four sheets and they exactly match the pictures up above.  Each sheet has instructions on the back so you don&#x27;t have to worry about keeping track of a separate instruction sheet.  The instructions are pretty simple so I won&#x27;t repeat them here.  I like the variety of designs.  I probably won&#x27;t use every single one, but there are definitely quite a few that appeal to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are very easy to apply.  I have not used temporary tattoos in probably 25 or 30 years and I was afraid I might mess these up.  But no, it&#x27;s pretty easy.  I used one of the bracelet-like ones around a wrist.  I did have to cut a couple of inches off the end (I have tiny wrists), but the bracelet ones are long enough to go around most wrists or the outside of a forearm (or even smaller biceps).  I also put a couple of geometric shapes on my ankle.  I figured this way, I&#x27;d be able to say how long they last under different conditions.  (I just used a wet paper towel for the application.  That worked fine.  I was able to use the same paper towel for all the tattoos I applied in one session.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to wash my hands a lot and the inner edge (on the underside of my wrist) showed a little wear after 24 hours and a little more after 48 hours.  However, from the angle that most people would see, really it still looked basically fine.  I decided to take it off after 48 hours to see what it would be like removing a mostly-intact tattoo.  It took quite a bit of scrubbing with shower gel and a pouf sponge in the shower, actually.  So unless you are immersing yourself in water, these should last quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did wear socks over the ones on my ankle (it&#x27;s winter here).  The constant motion of the socks rubbing up against my leg as I walked mean that there was some wear on these, too.  If you are wearing the tattoos on a part of the body that only gets wet briefly in the shower and isn&#x27;t covered by clothing, though, these would last a very long time -- probably at least 4-5 days, if not longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, if you are in the market for this type of product, these lasted a long time and were very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided by the manufacturer for evaluation purposes.bbing up against my leg as I walked mean that there was some wear on these, too.

            <li> I love these colors. My 8 yr old son and I had fun doing arts with it.</li>
            <li> Received these as a promotional item and they are Great!!! Great quality and lots cheaper and better coloring than other brands!!! These are great for all ages, my 8 year old daughter LOVES them! Look forward to purchasing more!!</li>
            <li> Fun decorative metallic tattoos... So easy to apply. Great look especially with summer clothes!!!</li>
            <li> These are SO FUN!! I love love the many different, stylish designs provided. So much so, that I couldn&#x27;t wait to put them on when I opened the package. I have had so many fun compliments from people who want to know where I got the cool metallic tattoos!? These are really fun to use, being that it&#x27;s summer time - so you really can take advantage on flashing them around. My daughters also love these easy to apply tattoos. There are so many different varieties of designs, that you can be sure to keep the fun alive for awhile! We recently had a birthday party and (which parents consent...) we had a metallic flash temporary tattoo party! The girls all left with some flashy fun bling on their arms or ankles. It&#x27;s a fun, temporary thing to do. Pretty and stylish, if you ask me. I&#x27;m really glad that I was able to receive this product for a review. They are so much fun to use!</li>
            <li> I send this Temporary Tattoo to my Sister, well it has 12 sheets per order so since its just temporary tattoo her kids will love it, Better to have temporary than permanent, less pain too and easy to apply with , faster compare to henna , specially for kids that will attend some party, have a fabulous look with this metallic design with a shinning and shimmering tat , you can apply wherever you want, can be on your arm,legs, neck, shoulder anywhere, and i got this for free in exchange of my review</li>
            <li> These are phenomenal tattoos!!!! My daughter recently got intrigued with wearing tattoos. The problem I have run into with other tattoos is the fact that they do not stay on!!!! She attends summer camp daily and swims at a pool. The chlorine usually fades the tattoo that day, with these they stay on for 3 plus days(which shocked me). Love the different choices and how easy they are to apply. I have had problems in the past with half the tattoo not applying or it comes off paper extremely light(leaving some on paper). My daughter has received lots of compliments on her tattoos (from kids to adults). We are definitely loving our metallic tattoos!!! The picture of tattoo on my daughters arm is 3 days after application!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these at discount for an HONEST review</li>
            <li> Disclosure: I received a complimentary review sample from the manufacturer of this product.This did not affect my opinion in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are absolutely gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before trying these, I always thought temporary tattoos to be rather... cheap looking and tacky. Having admit that, I must say I am very pleasantly surprised by how gorgeous and trendy these look like! I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but I am definitely glad I gave these a try. They&#x27;re not only beautifully designed and detailed, but their shimmery gold and silver coloring makes them a perfect accessory for many different occasions, from a day at the beach to a girls&#x27; night out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am particularly fond of the angel wings and peacock feathers. They&#x27;re stunning! They catch the light and sparkle like actual jewelry, but they don&#x27;t look cheesy at all. In fact, I think they&#x27;re quite fashionable and hip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application is very simple: All you need to do is peel off the protective layer, place the tattoo on your skin and apply water with a sponge for about 30-40 seconds. Once the tattoo sticks to your skin, you peel off the sheet and voila! They stick very well, are waterproof and don&#x27;t flake off even when they come in contact (as in: rub against) with a piece of clothing or your jewelry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed with the quality of these temporary tattoos. They&#x27;re well-made, long-lasting and definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> There are only four sheets.. Not 12 as advertised. A bit disappointed but they&#x27;re cool tattoos.</li>
            <li> Great!!! Arrived super fast and they are just what I needed!!</li>
            <li> These flash tattoos are so super fun! I ordered some to give out to some of the younger girls in my family around Christmas time but once they came in I was so impressed with them I am thinking I might have to keep at least ONE of these sets for myself lol. They aren&#x27;t tacky or cheesy looking when you get them, they are really cute. There are 3 sets in each order and each set has 4 sheets to it. Anything you can think of almost as far as designs. Some are text, some are necklaces or bracelets, and there are a ton of freestanding designs. They are all extremely detailed and intricate and are a really unique new take on accessorizing I can definitely see myself using these for myself on different occasions. They are applied just like the traditional temporary tattoos, with water and a washcloth for 60 seconds and you can quickly remove them with baby oil or rubbing alcohol and a cotton ball. I received mine as a complimentary sample for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience and honest opinions with these tattoos. I do recommend them, they are super cute and the price is great!</li>
            <li> These lasted over a week while on a vacation in Jamaica and I got quite a few compliments.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Had so much fun with my daughter putting these on.  We love!!</li>
            <li> Once I received my 12pk of metallic tattoos we opened them my kids picked out 2each to put on. I was fairly surprised on how well the gold/silver colors stays after being put on. The designs of the tattoos are fun and girly. The metallic tattoos are easy to put on as well. I even or one on next to my real tattoos amd someone asked if I really got a silver colored tattoo. My husband who is a tattoo artist thought they were very interesting and cool. Which he usually Says the fake ones are dull. I would definitely recommend the sparks 12 sheet metallic tattoos</li>
            <li> When I received the Metallic Flash Temporary Tattoos; I was amazed to find see that the sheets containing the tattoos gave me a huge selection of beautiful tattoos and separated according to various themes. I currently have one 2 on and I am completely satisfied that I may wear my summer outfit and show off designs on my body without the need to permanently tattoo my body and can change designs as I feel or according to what I am wearing that day. Applying the tattoos on my body was extremely easy and I was able to wear the tattoo all day with no wears, peeling and the color never did fade; I received multiple compliments on my tattoos throughout the day. I would highly recommend this product to all woman and young girls if you are buying this product you will definitely be satisfied.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the little unexpected things have the greatest impact. Have you ever known someone for a few years and then found out something about them that completely took you off guard? Like, you’ve seen them every single day at work for years then one day you’re at a mutual friend’s wedding reception and it turns out your coworker can really, seriously dance. Or, maybe you’re at a business lunch and that shy geeky guy from IT orders from the wine menu in flawless French. It’s that little thing that can change your whole perception of someone, something that makes you stop and take notice, and changes how you look at them. These little fun flashy tattoos can be just that thing .. There was a woman that I worked with, she was almost a caricature of what you would think of if you were asked to picture someone “uptight” “conservative” “plain” and “middle-age”. She didn’t socialize at work, brought her lunch and ate at her desk, and frankly the rest of us, when we thought about it at all, just kinda assumed she had like 10 cats and a midrange cable package at home. Anyway, one day she was in the ladies room, had the cuffs of her shirt pushed up to wash her hands, and I saw the edge of a tattoo on her forearm. It was that little whisper of rebellion that made me stop and look again. She actually turned out to be one of the most incredibly fascinating people that I have ever had the opportunity to know, with a backstory that would make a sailor blush. Point is, it was that little subtle clue that invited a second look. These Spaworks Premium Flash Tattoos can be used in obvious places to grab that first look, or in less conspicuous places to coax a second look. Tons of options in the 12 premium sheets: I love the range of choices, everything from subtle understated stars, to super-sexy tribal bands. These are great quality tattoos, the details all come through beautifully on my skin and the finish is a bright reflective shine. The application is similar to other temporary tattoos but the result is far from common. I was stunned at how long, with a little care, that the tattoos lasted. One tat that I put on my leg, even with daily showers, lasted a full three days in perfect condition and an additional two days with very light signs of fade. I love how easy, fun and trendy these terrific tats are!

            <li> Excellent product! Delivered right on time</li>
            <li> My daughter loved these. They are comparable to the &amp;#34;flash&amp;#34; tattoos that are much pricier. Designs in this set are nice geometric designs. Sometimes with the larger or longer tattoos the design did not completely detach from the sheet when applying. Good value and product, thanks. Shipping was quick, too.</li>
            <li> Oh my! I tried going got Ulta and Sephora both and no one there knew what I was talking about when I asked if they had any of the metallic tattoos. What&#x27;s up with that? Anyway, I bought one pack of these and was able to split the whole pack between for both my daughters for part of their birthday gift. There are so many in this set that one for each would have been too many. On some of the pages, I cut down the middle depending on what was on the page. I was able to give each of them a complete set of necklaces, bracelets, along with all the other feathers and other miscellaneous. I must say that their friends were a little jealous over them! The girls were ecstatic! While only 7 and 4, I can see that they are quickly getting out of the age of cutesy type of things like most of the tattoos for girls were. One of my daughters was wearing one the other day and it looked great. Not a lot of wrinkling but that may be due to the youth of their skin:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the company emailed me on their own to make sure I&#x27;d gotten the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> everything about these are great, awesome quality. so many different choices &amp; so easy to use. i definitely recommend these !!!</li>
            <li> Received These free for my opinion and review. They are cool, I have bought other Temp Tattoos over the years these work well others have failed to come off the paper. These slide right on the skin after wetting the back, fun product and flashy but classy if you want to add a little glimmer to your outfit just put one of these on.  My Granddaughter also love the idea of having a tattoo and says they are so pretty. Very nice easy to use temp Tatts Thank you.</li>
            <li> Love it. No problems at all with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness!  I LOVE these Flash Tattoos!!  I have bought and applied many, many sets of temporary tattoos over the years with my grand children.  I of course, have also had many tattoos applied to me by the grand babies.  I have to say though that when I first ordered these, I thought, well these will be cute to have to play with the girls.  Now that I have had a chance to use them, I want to hide them from the grand daughters.  These are fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;They go on really easy, just like you would a normal temporary tattoo.  All you do is hold it to your skin, take a wet rag and hold it to the back of tattoo for a few minutes, then lift and peel , voila&#x27;.you are a tattooed mama.&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed by the quality of these Flash Tattoos!  Every time that I look down at my wrist with the one that is made to look like a bracelet, I think I have a piece of jewelry on.  These are made to last also!  I have had mine on for days, and it doesn&#x27;t look like it is wearing off at all!!  I highly recommend these to anybody looking for a high quality temporary tattoo!  For the amount of money you are paying, you actually get a bunch of these!  I received this for free or discounted price and this is my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> This is my review for the Flash Temporary Tattoos by Trendsetter Tattoos.  These are super fun and super easy to put on.  If you have ever used temporary tattoos that are applied with water, then you will have no problem with these.  You just peel the plastic protector off, place on the skin and put a wet washcloth or paper towel over and hold for 30 seconds.  You can see from the pictures that we tried a few different types and parts of the body and they all worked exactly the same.  They all came right off and stayed on the skin well.  I was worried about doing the one that went around the wrist and being able to make sure that it would be stuck on all the way around and it was completely just by holding it onto the wrist.  The paper came right off all of the tattoos so we didn&#x27;t have to worry about part of the tattoo sticking to the paper, etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tattoos come in different shapes and sizes. If you look at the seller&#x27;s pictures, you can see that you get a variety of tattoos from ones that are more like bracelets to necklaces to tons more.  There are four sheet of tattoos in each set so you will have a lot to chose from.  These are what I would consider dressy tattoos.  They are gold silver and black.  They are perfect when you want to dress up just a little.  We tried putting a small silver feather behind the ear with hair pulled up for a dressy look and it was really pretty.  I included several pictures.  Two show you each step of putting on two different tattoos and the third shows this dressy look behind the ear for a night on the town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this was a great find.  I have never seen tattoos like this in store (only children&#x27;s ones) so these can be fun for adults and older teens for a fun new look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product provided for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:c4a7ea3221f1727770429eafd0afc08c]]</li>
            <li> this is fun &amp; unique eye catching-but if you are putting on a longer piece- wrapping around your ankle or wrist, you have to pre-measure/cut so it doesn&#x27;t overlap-be sure to smooth it out so that it doesn&#x27;t bunch up (you may want to ask a friend to hold 1 end while you smooth it out)..it is removed easily with nail polish remover-some people may be sensitive to nail polish remover on their skin.</li>
            <li> Received promotional item and tattos are greaf. Very cute! Thank you</li>
            <li> better &amp; cheaper than flash tats! highly recommend THESE metallic jewelry tattoos over any others! love them!</li>
            <li> best temporary tattoos ever ... every one is gorgeous ... I ordered a set for 2 of my granddaughters and they called me right away and told me how awesome they are and how easy to put on ... I took one of my granddaughters out and everywhere we went she received compliments and &amp;#34;oohs and aahs&amp;#34; and where did you get those!  Well, needless to say, I ordered at least 5 more design sheets and will be ordering more and more designs ... all the designs are so striking and noticeable ... love love love love</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love them.  They look just like the picture.</li>
            <li> Great for a bachelorette party or event where you want to do something out of the ordinary. Easy to apply. Before applying you have to cut each tattoo.</li>
            <li> I love these! My tattoo was on my chest, closer to my collar bone, and it lasted about 4 days.  And those four days I spent in salt water, on the beach, and had a ton of, aloe, lotion, and sunscreen rubbed onto about 4 times a day.  The only reason it came off was because I slept on my stomach that night and it rubbed off.  But it looked beautiful until then! It didn&#x27;t even start to crack or flake off.  I can&#x27;t speak for how it holds up on any other part of the body, but I have no doubt that it will still do well.</li>
            <li> I like them but they only thing was it only last a day and come right off when it said on the directions that it last 3 days. It good for a night out.</li>
            <li> These were so awesome, and they stayed on for almost 6 days! Definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> totally worth the price</li>
            <li> it comes off very easy !! :(</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how much I love these. They last about a week even through a work out. After about 4-5 days it will start to fade. My favorite pieces are the ones I can fit around my wrist. They are so simple to apply and I can&#x27;t get enough . I was sent this for review however this does not effect my thoughts and unbiased opinions.</li>
            <li> Super easy to apply on skin and truly adorable! Need more time to see if it lasts for a week or so.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I got to try these out!  I have seen people walking around with these on for quite awhile and now I am one of them.  They are so trendy and fun to wear.  The colors and designs are so fun and will look even better this summer when I get a little tan going on.  I love that they are so easy to put on and remove and they are WATERPROOF!  I can&#x27;t tell you how many tattoos I have used on my kids over the years that have either been impossible to remove or the opposite...have come right off as soon as they get wet.  These are high quality and they are all mine...I&#x27;m not sharing.  Sorry kids.  Since Mama is too chicken to get a real tattoo she finally has her own temporary ones and you can&#x27;t have any.  :)&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> this is a great accent to any fun night out&lt;br /&gt;love the Spaworks temporary Tattoos</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:aa8c40ec1848caab92bf972cc0fe1c9e]]These temporary tattoos are easy to apply and stay on pretty well even on my the back of hand which gets wet.  In attached video you can see me applying a tattoo, and then how the tattoo looks over 4 days, and finally removing what is left of it on day 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To apply it to my hand:&lt;br /&gt;1. I cut out the tattoo I want to apply&lt;br /&gt;2. Place it on my hand&lt;br /&gt;3. Use a very wet sponge to press it down for 30 seconds&lt;br /&gt;4. Lift the backing and the tattoo is there&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tattoo itself is very thin. I don&#x27;t feel it and it flexes with my skin as I move the hand.  The tattoo stays nice looking for 3 to 5 days depending where you place it. Since I had it on my hand which gets wet it stayed it looked good for 2 days, okay on day 3, and not nice on day 4.  If you want to remove it faster the instruction say to use spirits.  I used nail polish and it came off in a couple of strokes.  I had no bad reaction to it of any sort, the skin did not get red or irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These tattoos are provided by Trendsetter Tattoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> these are really cool</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for a friend, and she absolutely loved it! She applied one right away and it looked amazing!</li>
            <li> These metallic temporary tattoos from Spaworks are just stunning! They go on so easily and stay for quite a while without washing away the first time you hit them with water. But when you want to take them off, it&#x27;s no problem! Just a little warm water and a rag and boom! My 12 year old godchild is obsessed with them and she&#x27;s pretty much covered right now! Might get her some for Christmas. This pack comes with 12 sheets for such a great price! I&#x27;ve seen ONE sheet go for $7 at a store so trust me, these are so worth the buy!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I loved this temporary tattoos it looks so fashionable and gorgeous.Its very easy to apply in just less than a minute and it last for 3 to more days&lt;br /&gt;unless you will rub it.It comes in 12 sheets in different styles and pattern.It looks so trendy and beautiful with the Gold and silver bling.Its waterproof and doesnt remove if you wont rub it.Its exactly as described and its exactly as pictured.Great for everyday fashion usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a complimentary item for my honest feedback.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really enjoying these Metallic Flash Temporary Tattoos by Spaworks. I see more and more people with these on now, and I kind of understand the hype. These temporary tattoos are extremely easy to apply and they add some fun and shininess to your get-up. Just lay the tattoo over where you want it, and wet the back of the paper until the tattoo gets transferred to your skin. It literally takes 30 seconds. They also last at least 2 full days before starting to fall off (that is, if you shower everyday.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using these to add individuality and some uniqueness to my apparel. Sometimes I go to work with several of these tattoos around my arms, wrists, and a even a couple on my ankles and neck. I like using these when I go to parties or just go out in general. They can be used for casual and more formal settings, which is pretty awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how this product comes in sheets of 12 (or more) with a large variety of designs, wording, objects, etc. There are definitely more than a few of the tattoo designs that I really like and wish there were more of and there are some I&#x27;ll probably never use, but overall, I&#x27;m content with the variety. A sample of these tattoos were provided for testing and review. I am never obligated to give positive reviews, and all opinions are solely my own.</li>
            <li> For someone who was considering getting a real tattoo until I found out the cost, these temp ones are inexpensive and fun. You don&#x27;t have to make a committment to just one as they wear off. They are easy to put on and just take 30 seconds to apply.  Used my first one today and got compliments on it.</li>
            <li> works just like the original flash tattoo brand!</li>
            <li> these are super cute and my friends and I had a ton of fun applying them before a night out.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Product! Purchased these at a Christmas show this weekend in Boise, Idaho. The quality was first rate and looks like real jewelry. These are the highest quality I have seen yet and I have tried a bunch of Flash Tattoos. The Price can&#x27;t be beat compared to Flash tats and some of the other companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cant recommend this product enough, it&#x27;s nice to finally get a Fabulous Product at a great Price. Thanks SKTrendz. I love It!&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;C.</li>
            <li> Great quality on these temporary tattoos. The metallic gold and silver really stands out and the shine of the metallic lasts for days. I bought two trendsetter sets, one for myself and one for a gift I can&#x27;t wait to share for Christmas. Thanks for a great product that is fun and unique.</li>
            <li> One Word &amp;#34;QUALITY&amp;#34;.  These temporary metallic tattoos were exactly what I was hoping for. The package arrived with the same exact sheets that were in the pictures. Yes, I Verified and actually counted over 40+ Tattoos with some serious &amp;#34;flash&amp;#34; to these tattoos.  The instructions show they are easy to apply, quick to remove, even if I want to change styles .  Bonus is they&#x27;re even waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know my niece is simply going to love these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 Thumbs Up...I highly recommend this package for great quality, a lot of variety and style options.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:d7f43a6800b2532b6d298824ebcc5976]] These temporary tattoos are really fun, once you get the hang of application.&lt;br /&gt;My first try was less than perfect...I acted like a know-it-all and only glanced at the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the directions more carefully, the second try as better, and by the fourth try I was a pro, and you will be too.&lt;br /&gt;The video shows my second try, so it&#x27;s still a bit wonky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just keep in mind you can cut the sheet and select a small design that you don&#x27;t mind messing up. You can use the whole design or just a part of one.&lt;br /&gt;Save the ones you love for when you are the above mentioned pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply place on your skin, and press down with a slightly damp washcloth. Resist the urge to pull up the backing too soon. Slowly peel that backing off, and there you are! Don&#x27;t wash or get it wet for at least an hour.&lt;br /&gt;They really stay on, but when you want to take them off it&#x27;s pretty easy. I used an alcohol pad followed with some coconut oil. I&#x27;ve used them on my ankles, neck, and the tops of my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait for them to come up with more designs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE: Product received to test, with the option to review.
