            <li>I do however LOVE the Obagi C Rx and will stick with it as my moisturizer and sunscreen.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist introduced me to the Obagi Nu-Derm Healthy Skin Protection SPF35.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Obaji Nu Derm Healthy Skin SPF 35 for many years.</li>
            <li>Healthy Skin Protection SPF 35 # 6 was recommended by my dermotologist after having skin cancer removed.  </li>
            <li>Obagi Healthy Skin Protection is simply the best quality protective cream I have found to use on my face...though you can use it on arms, chest ect.</li>
            <li>what&#x27;s more...</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I do not notice any whiteness or chalkiness (but I am also very very very fair and chalky is the color of my foundation ;)&lt;br /&gt;I need a good broad spectrum sunscreen because I walk every day at lunch time.  </li>
            <li>make-up goes on easily over it.</li>
            <li>Good, solid coverage, blends in well and great for sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super light and it doesnt make me breakout.</li>
            <li>I gave 2 stars for ingredients and good protection (spf 35), but it leave white cast</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a couple of weeks and so far so good, skin still clear and no increase in blackheads.  </li>
            <li>It is a sealed and fresh product with exp date of 05/12.</li>
            <li>The product is light and the bottle a decent size.</li>
            <li>Priced very reasonably, delivered promptly.  </li>
            <li>I was first given it by my med-spa professionals and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since (over 1 year ago).</li>
            <li>The order was exactly as I had ordered.</li>
            <li>It is the same product I purchased from my Dermatologist&#x27;s office for a lot more $$.  </li>
            <li>It is much cheaper on Amazon than it is at the doctor&#x27;s office, too.</li>
            <li>i really like the obagi nu derm spf 35.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product and the vendor.</li>
            <li>highly recommended and grateful for this product.  </li>
            <li>I have normal to oily skin, so this product was not for me.  </li>
            <li>It blocks both UVA and UVB, is not heavy, and does not clog my pores.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised when my Obagi order arrived today, Sept 13.  </li>
            <li>All is needed is a small amount and it spreads quite easy.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is the only one I have found that does not cause me to break out with adult acne.....</li>
            <li>It does leave my face a little white, but works better than all the other SPFs I&#x27;ve used.</li>

            <li> I have tried just about every sunscreen on the market, but due to my sensitive skin, I had a big problem with itching and breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I received my product in less than five days with normal shipping fee.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a daily wear sunblock that did not make my skin look grey or greasy or cause me to break out.  </li>
            <li> I have acne prone but also very dry skin</li>
            <li> The Nu Derm was heavier and greasier, not what I wanted or expected.  </li>
            <li> Plus, once it dried it began flaking off and made a complete mess of my face!</li>
            <li> I will use the other NuDerm products but not this one-</li>
            <li> I previously used Obagi C RX and thought I&#x27;d try Obagi Nu Derm.  </li>
            <li> I work out of doors year round...</li>
            <li> Also it accentuate all dry and peeling (flaky) skin (I use tretinoin cream and when skin is peeling this sunscreen make my skin look worse).</li>
            <li> Compared to the other products in this regimen, this item was utterly disappointing.</li>
            <li> To my surprise it is one of the worse.</li>
            <li> It went on SO thickly and was impossible to spread onto my skin evenly.</li>
            <li> I hate, which doesn&#x27;t disappear.</li>
            <li> After surviving skin cancer, this product soored a 2 out of 10 with 10 being the worst, for sunscreen protection.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this is one of the best sunscreens on the market. It&#x27;s super light and it doesnt make me breakout. Plus it has 9% zinc oxide!! Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I have used them all.  Am using the Obagi system.  After surviving skin cancer, this product soored a 2 out of 10 with 10 being the worst, for sunscreen protection.  Is not greasy or white when put on the face.  I will wear nothing else.</li>
            <li> Received items ordered on time good dating great price.  I would buy again and again already ordered more and recommended to my friend who also ordered.The company is 101 medical spa.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen was rated well (a 3 out of 10 for safety where 1 is safest) by the Environmental Working Group  so I decided to give this a try.  I have combination skin with a tendency to break out after using some beauty products.  I have been using this for a couple of weeks and so far so good, skin still clear and no increase in blackheads.  I do not notice any whiteness or chalkiness (but I am also very very very fair and chalky is the color of my foundation ;)&lt;br /&gt;I need a good broad spectrum sunscreen because I walk every day at lunch time.  This goes on evenly under makeup and does not result in any oiliness or sheen on my face.  I would recommend this to others and I will purchase this again</li>
            <li> great product. tried everything. this is the only moisturizer with spf that does not make me breakout.</li>
            <li> I previously used Obagi C RX and thought I&#x27;d try Obagi Nu Derm.  The Nu Derm was heavier and greasier, not what I wanted or expected.  I have normal to oily skin, so this product was not for me.  I do however LOVE the Obagi C Rx and will stick with it as my moisturizer and sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone but also very dry skin and this sunscreen moisturizer is the best combination. I was first given it by my med-spa professionals and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since (over 1 year ago). I guess it can sometimes appear white on the skin but I NEVER have that problem because I mix it with equal parts of DDF&#x27;s Color Enhancing sunscreen. The DDF sunscreen is purple so when I mix the two together it&#x27;s PERFECT!</li>
            <li> This is what I use on my face, the Obagi sunscreen spf 35. It feels good on my skin which is very important to me. Goes on well under my makeup, not feeling or looking like sunscreen. The product is light and the bottle a decent size.</li>
            <li> I read great reviews and bought this sunscreen. To my surprise it is one of the worse. I gave 2 stars for ingredients and good protection (spf 35), but it leave white cast I hate, which doesn&#x27;t disappear. Also it accentuate all dry and peeling (flaky) skin (I use tretinoin cream and when skin is peeling this sunscreen make my skin look worse). I went with Peter Thomas Roth max sheer sunscreen 30 and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every sunscreen on the market, but due to my sensitive skin, I had a big problem with itching and breakouts.  I could never use a sunscreen on my face.  My dermatologist introduced me to the Obagi Nu-Derm Healthy Skin Protection SPF35.  I now use it every day, summer or winter.  I just wish I had had it years ago.  Finally a sunscreen that is not greasy and won&#x27;t irritate my skin.  Great product.  It is much cheaper on Amazon than it is at the doctor&#x27;s office, too.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Obaji Nu Derm Healthy Skin SPF 35 for many years. Terrific product. Good, solid coverage, blends in well and great for sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best SPF I&#x27;ve ever used. It blocks both UVA and UVB, is not heavy, and does not clog my pores. It does leave my face a little white, but works better than all the other SPFs I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Priced very reasonably, delivered promptly.  Got one for myself when ordering it for my son!</li>
            <li> Great product! My skin feels moisturized. I have not had any break outs.   All is needed is a small amount and it spreads quite easy.</li>
            <li> Obagi Nu Derm Healthy Skin Protection SPF 35 # 6 was recommended by my dermotologist after having skin cancer removed.  It goes under my makeup smoothly and is great protection.</li>
            <li> Obagi Healthy Skin Protection is simply the best quality protective cream I have found to use on my face...though you can use it on arms, chest ect.I was looking for a daily wear sunblock that did not make my skin look grey or greasy or cause me to break out.  I work out of doors year round...this product works and my skin looks great. An added plus...the price was the best I have found so far even with factoring in shipping costs ...what&#x27;s more...the estimated shipping was for ten days...I received my product in less than five days with normal shipping fee.  I highly recommend the product and the vendor.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is the only one I have found that does not cause me to break out with adult acne.....highly recommended and grateful for this product.  Easy to purchase with Amazon, arrived quickly and at the best price.  Happy Lady.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have a sensitivity to the sun, and this assures I don&#x27;t have any problems.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised when my Obagi order arrived today, Sept 13.  It was scheduled to arrive Sept 15-20. The order was exactly as I had ordered. It is a sealed and fresh product with exp date of 05/12. It is the same product I purchased from my Dermatologist&#x27;s office for a lot more $$.  I will definitely order from 101 Cosmetics again.</li>
            <li> i really like the obagi nu derm spf 35.  it goes on well.  make-up goes on easily over it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an Obagi user for 10 years.  Love this product.  Sun screen is best I&#x27;ve used--not too strong but works!</li>
            <li> Compared to the other products in this regimen, this item was utterly disappointing. It went on SO thickly and was impossible to spread onto my skin evenly. Plus, once it dried it began flaking off and made a complete mess of my face! I will use the other NuDerm products but not this one- I can&#x27;t believe this is even marketable.</li>
