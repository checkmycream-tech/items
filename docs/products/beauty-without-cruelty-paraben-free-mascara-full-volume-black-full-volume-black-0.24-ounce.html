            <li>Best of all?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still searching for the &amp;#34;one&amp;#34; perfect, or &amp;#34;Best&amp;#34;, mascara and have gone through a lot to find the one and only!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best mascara</li>
            <li>happy with the product</li>
            <li>One of the best vegan and cruelty free products on the market.</li>
            <li>This is impressive for cruelty free, I would recommend this.</li>
            <li>so nice to find a good, long-lasting mascara that isn&#x27;t tested on animals.</li>
            <li>I freaking LOVE this mascara!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this mascara!</li>
            <li>If BWC created a formula that gave more volume instead of just length, I wouldn&#x27;t be opposed to that!</li>
            <li>Stays nicely put.  </li>
            <li>This mascara goes on nicely and adds fullness without being too clumpy.</li>
            <li>Smooth mascara with no clumps and goes on very nicely.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly, water resistant, great for my contact lenses, lengthens lashes.</li>
            <li>I love the brush applicator.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>This is really a lovely mascara.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still getting used to the brush which I find fatter and thicker than most.  </li>
            <li>Ok, but won&#x27;t buy again.  </li>
            <li>This is quite lovely.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>easy application and easy removal.</li>
            <li>It goes on well, doesn&#x27;t clump, and washes off easily without having to use makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it three stars because it is cruelty free.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product as I am interested in using animal cruelty free makeup</li>
            <li>If you try to apply more than one coat, your lashes will stick together in a very unflattering way.</li>
            <li>It applies robust right from the first application and isn&#x27;t wimpy and &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; like so many.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and its totally guilt free!</li>
            <li>I have been searching far &amp; wide for a cruelty free vegan friendly mascara that looks good and gives me some volume</li>
            <li>good thing is this one doesn&#x27;t smear off, it just makes my lashes straight or flat..</li>
            <li>Right away it applied the way I want my mascara to.  </li>
            <li>I recommend you try it if you are having a hard time, as I was, to find a good, cruelty free mascara</li>
            <li>It provides a more natural look but it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, the brush is nice and it&#x27;s five dollars less than this.</li>
            <li>Thanks BWC!</li>
            <li>After months of trying various mascaras only to have an allergic reaction to them, I am so pleased to finally be able to wear mascara again.  </li>
            <li>Stays put well and doesn&#x27;t smell funny like some vegan mascaras can.</li>
            <li>It is way too bulky and I never failed to get mascara on my eyelids.</li>
            <li>all be all, this BWC mascara is pretty close to it.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this... Was accidentally sent the wrong color, which I was able to keep free of charge, but every time I wore it, it seems to make my eyes burn a bit and water.</li>
            <li>However, this mascara made my eyelashes very clumpy and sticky.</li>
            <li>If you are into the whole &amp;#34;clump</li>
            <li>I have been trying different mascaras that are cruelty free.</li>
            <li>It goes on without clumping, makes my lashes really long and full, and the company doesn&#x27;t test on animals!</li>
            <li>So far, this is the first one I like.</li>
            <li>As you can imagine, this creates a snowball-effect in which I tear up, more mascara runs into my eyes, and then down my face.</li>
            <li>I apply a lot of moisturizer to my face and particularly under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about formula&#x27;s for this particular beauty product...</li>
            <li>I love this mascara for about two weeks, after that it gets so dried out I can&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to find a new vegan mascara that lasts longer.</li>
            <li>all I know is it is close to my eyeball as possible and would enjoy safer product ingredients, if possible.</li>
            <li>I tried this mascara in place of another vegan friendly one that I usually use, and while it does seem to be more volumizing than the other brand, it also made my eyes irritated.</li>
            <li>Being mature</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t consider my eyes to be particularly sensitive</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m surprised others haven&#x27;t mentioned this issue.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive eyes, this is not the product to go with.</li>
            <li>I went back to my old mascara!</li>
            <li>The big plus is all natural ingredients, no chemicals.</li>
            <li>I barely wear makeup</li>
            <li>Such a pleasure to open up a brand new mascara and not have to &amp;#34;break it in&amp;#34</li>
            <li>This is a more traditional mascara that applies fairly thickly and stiffens your lashes, unlike some vegan mascaras I&#x27;ve tried which create a softer more natural but less dramatic lash.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> so I don&#x27;t use this everyday.</li>
            <li> and so I need only apply two or three applications for dramatic and &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> (if you work out a lot and sweat during the day, which is understandable), so that&#x27;s why I gave it the rating I did, not perfect but close enough to it.</li>
            <li> Not impressive, glop&#x27;s a little when applying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I sadly will never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> and I feel terrible to write this.</li>
            <li> and I cried today and the mascara ran through my eyes and stung terribly!  </li>

            <li> Smooth mascara with no clumps and goes on very nicely. I love the brush applicator. The big plus is all natural ingredients, no chemicals. Love this product.</li>
            <li> so nice to find a good, long-lasting mascara that isn&#x27;t tested on animals.</li>
            <li> This is really a lovely mascara.  It applies robust right from the first application and isn&#x27;t wimpy and &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; like so many.  I have long lashes and so I need only apply two or three applications for dramatic and &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; effect.  I&#x27;m still getting used to the brush which I find fatter and thicker than most.  Such a pleasure to open up a brand new mascara and not have to &amp;#34;break it in&amp;#34;.  Right away it applied the way I want my mascara to.  Being mature I apply a lot of moisturizer to my face and particularly under my eyes.  No problem with smudging or running with this mascara.  Stays nicely put.  100%.</li>
            <li> I freaking LOVE this mascara! Dries quickly, water resistant, great for my contact lenses, lengthens lashes. Best of all? VEGAN</li>
            <li> Ok, but won&#x27;t buy again.  Flattens the lashes even after curling them with a curler.  Not impressive, glop&#x27;s a little when applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still searching for the &amp;#34;one&amp;#34; perfect, or &amp;#34;Best&amp;#34;, mascara and have gone through a lot to find the one and only!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good thing is this one doesn&#x27;t smear off, it just makes my lashes straight or flat..maybe it&#x27;s a little too heavy...I don&#x27;t know about formula&#x27;s for this particular beauty product...all I know is it is close to my eyeball as possible and would enjoy safer product ingredients, if possible.</li>
            <li> This mascara goes on nicely and adds fullness without being too clumpy. This is a more traditional mascara that applies fairly thickly and stiffens your lashes, unlike some vegan mascaras I&#x27;ve tried which create a softer more natural but less dramatic lash.  The downside is that I find even the tiniest amount of moisture causes this mascara to run into my eyes and it stings! As you can imagine, this creates a snowball-effect in which I tear up, more mascara runs into my eyes, and then down my face. If I can make it through the day without this happening, I find after several hours of wear it does tend to flake a little - though if it didn&#x27;t have the running/stinging issue this would not be enough to dissuade me from buying it again. I don&#x27;t consider my eyes to be particularly sensitive so I&#x27;m surprised others haven&#x27;t mentioned this issue.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara for about two weeks, after that it gets so dried out I can&#x27;t use it anymore. I barely wear makeup so I don&#x27;t use this everyday. There is no reason for an $18 tube of mascara to last only a couple of weeks. I&#x27;ve even tried to replenish it with eye drops- no luck. I&#x27;ll have to find a new vegan mascara that lasts longer.</li>
            <li> easy application and easy removal. Love this product and its totally guilt free! Thanks BWC!</li>
            <li> After months of trying various mascaras only to have an allergic reaction to them, I am so pleased to finally be able to wear mascara again.  If you are allergic to beeswax, this mascara by BWC may just be what you are looking for!</li>
            <li> Love it! Stays put well and doesn&#x27;t smell funny like some vegan mascaras can. The only critique might be that the brush is a little too big.</li>
            <li> happy with the product</li>
            <li> One of the best vegan and cruelty free products on the market. I tried others which didn&#x27;t give any impact. This is quite lovely.</li>
            <li> This was bought for me as a gift and I feel terrible to write this. However, this mascara made my eyelashes very clumpy and sticky. If you are into the whole &amp;#34;clump my eyelashes into one&amp;#34; thing than this product is for you. I sadly will never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! It goes on without clumping, makes my lashes really long and full, and the company doesn&#x27;t test on animals! I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product as I am interested in using animal cruelty free makeup and I cried today and the mascara ran through my eyes and stung terribly!  A.k.a. Not waterproof mascara!!  If you cry or plan on being in rain, avoid this mascara!</li>
            <li> This is impressive for cruelty free, I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Best mascara and it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>

If you have sensitive eyes, this is not the product to go with. I also do not like the application brush. It is way too bulky and I never failed to get mascara on my eyelids.
