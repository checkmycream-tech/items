            <li> I am very pleased with the product.  A good value.  It made it new again.  Very easy to replace the blades.  Best total price from Amazon.  Quick free delivery as usual from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great blades, super fast shipping, really helped.  Most resonable price I could find.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I had looked everywhere for replacement cutter/heads for my Remington electric razor, I mean EVERYWHERE!!!  Then out of the blue I decided to check Amazon and --there they were!!!  I had even gone as far as getting a newer razor but was not happy with it. So, I am sold on Amazon and will be looking there alot more because of this experience!!!</li>
            <li> My razor feels like a new one. I thought the refurbished razors came with fresh cutters but mine did not so buyers beware. I had to purhase this item seperately to make my razor sharp and now it works great.</li>
            <li> I needed replacement blades for my electric razor. They arrived fast and well packaged. They are super sharp and cut my face nice and clean. sure beats buying a new razor especially because they cost so much. I never could remember to purchase new blades when I was at a store. I stumbled upon them on amazon and quickly made the purchase.</li>
            <li> Bought these so I could bring my Remington Razor&lt;br /&gt;up to &#x27;Like New&#x27; performance. Razor now works, like it&lt;br /&gt;  was coming Fresh Out of The Box!!&lt;br /&gt;  Don&#x27;t settle for a bad Shave or per Shaver performance,&lt;br /&gt;  BUY these ( IF they are correct for your Razor )!!</li>
            <li> Finally replaced my blades after years of use and these work great. Amazon had the best price, shipping was quick, and the product was easy to install. Fits my Remington shaver.</li>
            <li> 2 people tried to install in the shaver and could not do so.  I suspect that, although the shaver manual states that SP-21 is the correct replacement, that may not be the case.</li>
            <li> I ordered new heads and cutters for my reconditioned Remington Model 900 series. Installed assembly and commenced shaving. Having a 2 day growth, the shaver seemed to &amp;#34;struggle&amp;#34; to get through the process. I suspect the power to the rotating spindles is fading...hence it took close to 10 minutes to get a &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; shave.&lt;br /&gt;I have recently purchased a Braun 760 and now experience a fast, close comfortable shave. I plan on keeping the Remington for travel or backup purposes.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my Dad&#x27;s shaver.  Double check with Remington website your model to ensure you order the correct ones as per the designation of your shaver (Sorry, forgot his model number for you).</li>
            <li> Easy to replace tge old blades. Shaves like a new razor again. My wife loves tge smootgnrsd of my face after i shave.</li>
            <li> Went on-line to find replacement blaces for my razor.  Found several stores that had the product, but the cost was high...  Looked on Amazon and found the same item for a LOT less.  At first I was concerned that I was not getting the same product, but when it arrived I saw it was the correct item.  Put it in the old razor and had my first shave.  WOW...  Awesome...Did not realize how dull the old blades had gotten!  A bonus was that I had an Amazon credit I had forgotten about and was able to use it to reduce the price.  Service was great and I am very happy...  I will be doing this more often so I do not have to endure a bad shave again!!</li>
            <li> Best ele. razor I ever had, problem is stores do not carry them anymore like most quality stuff you use to could get. Good thing is Amozon could get the blades, they worked great, thanks.</li>
            <li> Not too impressed with these blades. Have to go over whiskers many times to get them cut.  Pulls too.</li>
            <li> These are name brand Remington razor replacements, I was alittle skeptical because they were so cheap, but I will be back to buy more! The only thing I didn&#x27;t like, is i bought 3 of them and was chaeged 3 times for the shipping and they were all packaged in the same encelope, but it still came out to be a little  it cheaper. Thank you</li>
            <li> Having new heads makes a real difference. After I got these I was reminded of how nice the original razor was.</li>

            <li> By replacing the heads an cutter, brought new life back to an old reiable electric shaver.  It wasa cheaper to replace the heads and cutter than buy another electric shaver.  Fast shipping also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure these replacement blades work fine, but I ordered the wrong replacement blades doe my razor. My mistake, not the blades.</li>
