            <li>Great, prompt shipment/delivery!</li>
            <li>Excellent price thru Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great stuff.</li>
            <li>a sustainability point of view, the best alternative to buying this product is probably to sprout your own barley grass.</li>
            <li>THE REALLY GOOD PART:</li>
            <li>Used this for years and all my elderly cats, who also loved it, that have passed on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because it does so much good.</li>
            <li>My cats seem to love this!</li>
            <li>My cats love this!</li>
            <li>My two cats love this !.</li>
            <li>I purchased this based on the glowing reviews but my cat wouldn&#x27;t eat it, even on his favorite food!  </li>
            <li>They both have nice shiny coats</li>
            <li>I would give it 5-stars or more.  </li>
            <li>I am sure she will relapse again as her kidney function deteriorates more</li>
            <li>Put it on top of their food.</li>
            <li>My cats love it.</li>
            <li>My 2 kitties love this added to their food.  </li>
            <li>great for my cats and fast delivery</li>
            <li>yams which is a favorite of my kitties.</li>
            <li>My  indoor cats love  it.</li>
            <li>She keeps asking me to purchase more for her.</li>
            <li>Sprinkled a quarter-teaspoon of Barley Cat over the top of it and Mog was all over it...</li>
            <li>My cats really love Barley Cat.  </li>
            <li>This is probably a good thing since you don’t want your cat vomiting every time you feed it, but it means that you should also provide some fresh grass for your cat if he or she lives mostly indoors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both cats fur is shhiny and healthy looking and they love it.</li>
            <li>Superb product because: easy to mix in with 1/2 can or more of wet food or sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon on top of dry food and my cats love it!</li>
            <li>If I forget to include it they don&#x27;t lick the bowl clean.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and one that is overlooked and not very well known.  </li>
            <li>With a supplement that is good for the cats they will actually eat</li>
            <li>It really is one of the most nutritious foods to give them.  </li>
            <li>My cat is FIV positive and I believe Barley Cat has helped him maintain good health over the last 11 years.</li>
            <li>They don’t say a whole lot about sustainability of their facilities, so it would be nice to know a little more about that.</li>
            <li>They don’t say a whole lot about sustainability of their facilities, so it would be nice to know a little more about that.</li>
            <li>Nope, wasn&#x27;t interested.  </li>
            <li>This stuff worked absolute wonders!</li>
            <li>Quality NATURAL ingredients and in light powder form.</li>
            <li>She takes to Barley Cat readily and seems to prefer it sprinkled on top rather than mixed or disguised in the food.</li>
            <li>Our 2 indoor cats love this on their dry food, and it seems to satisfy their need for greenage and keep them from chewing up the houseplants.</li>
            <li>Both cats eat this on their dry food and love</li>
            <li>Thanks, Barley Cat.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Barley Cat is made from barley juice, so it’s not going to promote vomiting as whole grass would.</li>
            <li>but I am pleased with the extra time it has given her to have a near normal appetite.</li>
            <li>If my cat has been kept in for several days, then one of the first things he’ll do when let out again is to munch some fresh grass.</li>
            <li>I sprinkle a very light layer on each plate of food (less than ¼ teaspoon), so each container lasts around a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li>We tried first of all with just his old food again:</li>
            <li>the nutritional side, Green Foods makes the most popular barley grass supplement for humans (Green Magma).</li>
            <li>we highly recommend Barley Cat.</li>
            <li>They appeared to eat a little faster when tasting the barley powder, as if their food tasted even better.</li>
            <li>But I’ve bought some organic kitty grass before and Baggins (my cat, not the hobbit) wasn’t that interested in it — perhaps he would have been if he didn’t have access to regular grass outdoors.</li>
            <li>My 14 year boys are very picky and won&#x27;t take the vitamins in an oil or tube form, and my large brown tabby gets dry skin.</li>
            <li>I was worried because they are very aware if any medications or supplements are added and will often just not eat if they smell or taste something besides what is expected.</li>
            <li>They love it sprinkled it on their wet food or their dry food.  </li>
            <li>Product was received in a timely manner and, so far, two of my cats are eating it sprinkled in their food.</li>
            <li>I just sprinkle it over his food and WOW he eats the remainder in the bowl.  </li>
            <li>Even wild cats get their greens and the reasons appear to be twofold: fiber and nutrition.</li>
            <li>It makes their fur silky and soft which relieves his scratching.</li>
            <li>I also tried Barley Cat on our other picky cat and two others with normal taste preferences and all of them readily accept the powder and seem to relish it.  </li>
            <li>that’s worth trying, especially for cats with health issues such as FIV, and it’s the only pet supplement I buy regularly.</li>
            <li>Another perspective is that maintaining your cat’s health is more sustainable than a nutritionally poor diet that results in illness, trips to the vet, and medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>but too much traffic and other dangers.  </li>
            <li>Also sprinkle in small bowl of fresh water to quench her thirst.</li>
            <li>Green Foods Barkey Cat powder in any size stays fresh and takes only 1/4 teaspoon daily.</li>
            <li>The company (Green Foods) and founder (Dr. Hagiwara) seem to be a generally positive force – especially when it comes to promoting or sponsoring research in nutrition and cancer.</li>

            <li> My cat loves Green Foods. Barley Cat.  She was always trying to eat on the house plants.  No more.  It&#x27;s convenient and I just sprinkle some beside her food.  I cannot leave her outside.  She used  to get outside some and  eat the grass but too much traffic and other dangers.  It&#x27;s great stuff.</li>
            <li> I have no idea about the nutritional value of Barley Cat. Used as a supplement it yields 14 servings at about $.85 per serving at the manufacturers recommended dosage. I use it as a flavor enhancer to entice one of our cats to eat her Rx renal-failure food. Used at this rate (1/32 of a teaspoon) I get over 400 servings at about $.03 a pop. THE REALLY GOOD PART: She takes to Barley Cat readily and seems to prefer it sprinkled on top rather than mixed or disguised in the food. If Barley Cat brought her appetite completely back I would give it 5-stars or more.  She now takes a couple offerings each meal to finish  her plate rather than the  three or four presentations it took  [five, if you count the times she just would not show up] before we started using Barley Cat.  We use a couple other flavor enhancers (amino-Bplex liquid, fruit flavored probiotic liquid, and freeze-dried cat food) but none seem to work as well as Barley Cat.  For now.  I am sure she will relapse again as her kidney function deteriorates more but I am pleased with the extra time it has given her to have a near normal appetite. I also tried Barley Cat on our other picky cat and two others with normal taste preferences and all of them readily accept the powder and seem to relish it.  Maybe it deserves 5-stars anyway. Thanks, Barley Cat.  UPDATE:  Take a look at my separate review of CAT-MAN-DOO BONITO SPRINKLES.</li>
            <li> When will I learn! My cats won&#x27;t touch it. Put it on top of their food. Maybe I can mix with wet food.:((</li>
            <li> My cats love it. I put it on food they not eating - and they eat it (or at least some of it)</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. My cat won&#x27;t eat her cat food unless this is sprinkled on it. Also sprinkle in small bowl of fresh water to quench her thirst. Used this for years and all my elderly cats, who also loved it, that have passed on.</li>
            <li> My 2 kitties love this added to their food.  I give it to them daily.  If I forget to include it they don&#x27;t lick the bowl clean.  As soon as I add it they devour their wet food.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Our 2 indoor cats love this on their dry food, and it seems to satisfy their need for greenage and keep them from chewing up the houseplants.</li>
            <li> My cats seem to love this! I just shake it on their food and they eat it up.</li>
            <li> great for my cats and fast delivery</li>
            <li> An essential, especially for indoor cats.  Sprinkle this over anything you feed your kitties.  I use it over&lt;br /&gt;baked yams which is a favorite of my kitties.</li>
            <li> My  indoor cats love  it. They both have nice shiny coats and I don&#x27;t feel so badly about not being able to let them outside.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as promised.</li>
            <li> I cannot personally review this other than to say my mother has used this for the last decade and loves it. She keeps asking me to purchase more for her.</li>
            <li> This product has helped our cat digest better and stop getting sick to her stomach ll over the carpet.</li>
            <li> Our cat, Mog, had &amp;#34;gone off&amp;#34; his morning can of wet food.  He would sniff at it then walk away.  As a result, he was still hungry and then would go off and eat grass which resulted in him puking.  We tried different food--again this resulted in puking (if he ate it at all).  So we got the Barley Cat.  We tried first of all with just his old food again: Nope, wasn&#x27;t interested.  Sprinkled a quarter-teaspoon of Barley Cat over the top of it and Mog was all over it...and there&#x27;s been no looking back.  This stuff worked absolute wonders!</li>
            <li> We have multiple cats and have tried other supplements in the past.  The problem we&#x27;ve had in the past is that our cat&#x27;s wouldn&#x27;t eat their food with the supplement on it.  With Barley Cat, we have the cats jockeying for position around the food dishes!  With a supplement that is good for the cats they will actually eat it&#x27;s a win-win.</li>
            <li> Useless and a waste of money. Made no difference in my cat&#x27;s digestion. waste!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be without this !!  My cats are indoor and they just scream for it.  They love it sprinkled it on their wet food or their dry food.  It really is one of the most nutritious foods to give them.  Need to buy it by the case !!!</li>
            <li> Just recently introduced this product to my cats. I was worried because they are very aware if any medications or supplements are added and will often just not eat if they smell or taste something besides what is expected. They appeared to eat a little faster when tasting the barley powder, as if their food tasted even better. I just sprinkle a bit on the dry and mix a sprinkle in with the wet.</li>
            <li> Product was received in a timely manner and, so far, two of my cats are eating it sprinkled in their food.</li>
            <li> Great, prompt shipment/delivery!</li>
            <li> My cat has been having problems eating.  He lost 1lb in a month.  I did a lot of research and found Barley Cat.  I just sprinkle it over his food and WOW he eats the remainder in the bowl.  It is like a miracle.  I just wish I found it sooner.  Now he waits for me to sprinkle it on his food.</li>
            <li> My cats love this! I add a little of it to their wet food daily. I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> My two cats love this !. please never stop making it</li>
            <li> My cats really love Barley Cat.  I received my order on the date expected.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on the glowing reviews but my cat wouldn&#x27;t eat it, even on his favorite food!  I&#x27;ll update my review if there is any change in this.</li>
            <li> Kitty doesn&#x27;t like it mixed in with food but loves it on a glass dish that he licks up slowly and with glee.</li>
            <li> Cats like to eat grass. If my cat has been kept in for several days, then one of the first things he’ll do when let out again is to munch some fresh grass. Even wild cats get their greens and the reasons appear to be twofold: fiber and nutrition. The grass fiber can stimulate vomiting and may help the cat regurgitate hairballs or any indigestible items it might have swallowed. Barley Cat is made from barley juice, so it’s not going to promote vomiting as whole grass would. This is probably a good thing since you don’t want your cat vomiting every time you feed it, but it means that you should also provide some fresh grass for your cat if he or she lives mostly indoors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the nutritional side, Green Foods makes the most popular barley grass supplement for humans (Green Magma). Barley Cat is made from the same basic ingredient (also grown without pesticides or chemical fertilizers), which is then supplemented with some nutrients for felines, such as taurine. Although it doesn’t contain the insoluble fiber mentioned above, it does contain some soluble fiber (beta-glucans) that can help to promote growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut. Other benefits include calcium, vitamin C, amino acids, carotenoids, and trace minerals. My cat is FIV positive and I believe Barley Cat has helped him maintain good health over the last 11 years. He’s also a fussy eater and has no objection to it. Overall, I think Barley Cat is a supplement (/garnish) that’s worth trying, especially for cats with health issues such as FIV, and it’s the only pet supplement I buy regularly. I sprinkle a very light layer on each plate of food (less than ¼ teaspoon), so each container lasts around a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a sustainability point of view, the best alternative to buying this product is probably to sprout your own barley grass. But I’ve bought some organic kitty grass before and Baggins (my cat, not the hobbit) wasn’t that interested in it — perhaps he would have been if he didn’t have access to regular grass outdoors. The company (Green Foods) and founder (Dr. Hagiwara) seem to be a generally positive force – especially when it comes to promoting or sponsoring research in nutrition and cancer. They don’t say a whole lot about sustainability of their facilities, so it would be nice to know a little more about that. The container is recyclable (#2 plastic) at least and the label states that the barley grass is grown without pesticides or chemical fertilizers. Another perspective is that maintaining your cat’s health is more sustainable than a nutritionally poor diet that results in illness, trips to the vet, and medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, overall I’ll give the Barley Cat 5/5 gold stars for quality of the product and 4/5 “green” stars based on the social-ethical-environmental aspects of producing it. They lose one green star because they don’t provide much information on sustainability of their facilities and process (besides not using pesticides or chemical fertilizers).have access to regular grass outdoors.

            <li> I have used Green Foods Barley Cat Vits powder for years! Excellent price thru Amazon. Superb product because: easy to mix in with 1/2 can or more of wet food or sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon on top of dry food and my cats love it! My all white shirt hair cat has silky coat and my long haired cats coat is luxurious feeling. No digestion issues; no hair balls ( but I brush them daily anyway). Wouldn&#x27;t order another brand. Quality NATURAL ingredients and in light powder form. Green Foods Barkey Cat powder in any size stays fresh and takes only 1/4 teaspoon daily.</li>
            <li> Without Barley Cat my 15 year old cat would be limping and in pain due to arthritis. Both cats fur is shhiny and healthy looking and they love it. This is a great product and one that is overlooked and not very well known.  It&#x27;s a shame because it does so much good. we highly recommend Barley Cat.</li>
            <li> My 14 year boys are very picky and won&#x27;t take the vitamins in an oil or tube form, and my large brown tabby gets dry skin. Both cats eat this on their dry food and love It makes their fur silky and soft which relieves his scratching.</li>
