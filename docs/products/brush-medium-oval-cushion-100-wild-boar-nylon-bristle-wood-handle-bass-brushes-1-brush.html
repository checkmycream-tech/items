            <li>The brush is a good size, and has an attractive appearance.</li>
            <li>Relaxing and a nice head massage!</li>
            <li>6.6.15 Still love the brush, but it is NOT the best choice to be used as a &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; brush.</li>
            <li>I think this feels good on my hands.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this brush!</li>
            <li>The absolute best hairbrush I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Bristles hurt and scratch scalp, The multi colored handle is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>lmao.</li>
            <li>So far very impressed with this brand of brush.</li>
            <li>People with fine hair, watch out!</li>
            <li>All the goodness of boar bristles--making hair healthy and shiny--plus the penetrating massage of the nylon pins.</li>
            <li>Dogs love this brush.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Very similar to the Isinis in feel but a perfect sized handle.</li>
            <li>I love the way it brushes and massages my scalp.</li>
            <li>The nylon bristles don&#x27;t have any balls on the ends of them, which is better for me because they irritate my scalp.</li>
            <li>Because the nylon are longer than the boar, the boar bristles may not be able to reach your hair, resulting in damaged hair and/or split ends.</li>
            <li>I ABSOLUTELY love this brush</li>
            <li>Best used to brush out long hair.  </li>
            <li>Safe for fine hair to detangle without breakage.</li>
            <li>I love the bamboo handle, its such a nice hair brush, will never buy plastic brushes ever again and most deff worth the $$! :) :)</li>
            <li>The bamboo handle is smooth and comfortable in either hand - and easy to control.  </li>
            <li>The lack of little balls on the ends of the nylon bristles is what make this brush so awesome.</li>
            <li>This is a great brush for kids, especially.  </li>
            <li>The few nylon pieces that are longer than the boar bristles are perfect for stimulating the hair follicles, which make your hair grow faster and thicker.</li>
            <li>The brush is beautiful (but the wood is a single color as apposed to the one you see in the picture here on Amazon which is striped).  </li>
            <li>This brush is great for long fine hair.  </li>
            <li>If hair is super oily might not be brush for you.</li>
            <li>It gently pries the tangles, and makes it smooth when blow drying.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>My favorite is the combination wild boar/nylon bristle brush.  </li>
            <li>(say that 3 x fast!)</li>
            <li>The handle is a good size for my small hands.</li>
            <li>It really tames my hair, keeps it from getting frizzy and makes it look very shiny.</li>
            <li>The combination of real and nylon bristles provides the balance my hair needs.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think it will be a problem</li>
            <li>Since the nylon bristles were longer than the boar bristles, and I didn&#x27;t like it much anyway</li>
            <li>So the bottom of my hair gets really tangled and this brush does not snag or pull on my hair at all, and it distributes the oils throughout my hair.</li>
            <li>I will only buy from my local store for now on, where I can be sure to get the style that does not scratch the scalp.</li>
            <li>Some of the bristles really poke the scalp and it&#x27;s far from a soft, relaxing brushing session.</li>
            <li>The wood is brown and cream-colored striped and covered with a glossy, clear paint coat.</li>
            <li>So far I have not lost any bristles.</li>
            <li>The brush is marked for &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; use on the package</li>
            <li>I have loyally used Bass brushes for over 15 years.  </li>
            <li>I first bought the more expensive but smaller purse sized Isinis brush for almost $30...</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this brush is perfect for people with small hands and very thick, dense, and long hair.</li>
            <li>The actual boar bristles are a little more stiff than the synthetic bristles but they don&#x27;t bother me at all.  </li>
            <li>Really does the job of moving oil down hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very nice brush itself but the handle is small and slightly uncomfortable in my hand</li>

            <li> Thought it would be a little bigger like my other Bass Brush.  This brush is great for long fine hair.  I have been using one for years now and I have never found another that works so well</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy hair and this brush gets through with no problem.  It really tames my hair, keeps it from getting frizzy and makes it look very shiny. The brush is a good size, and has an attractive appearance. The bristles are a mix of wood and nylon. So far I have not lost any bristles. Seems well constructed.</li>
            <li> Love it! All the goodness of boar bristles--making hair healthy and shiny--plus the penetrating massage of the nylon pins. Brushing my hair never looked or felt so good! Great size, too. Not too big, and small enough to carry in a purse.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for kids, especially.  It is the only brush I can use on my daughter that doesn&#x27;t cause her pain.  It is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints except it does require regular cleaning... and I just don&#x27;t have time for that.</li>
            <li> I have loyally used Bass brushes for over 15 years.  My favorite is the combination wild boar/nylon bristle brush.  On every other Bass brush of this combination that I have bought, the nylon bristles have small rounded balls on the tips to keep the nylon from being too sharp for the scalp.  This model does not.  OUCH!!! I will only buy from my local store for now on, where I can be sure to get the style that does not scratch the scalp.</li>
            <li> THIS is the brush I have been looking for! I disagree with A.W. from Colorado. The lack of little balls on the ends of the nylon bristles is what make this brush so awesome. The little round balls found on similar brushes grab and pull your hair. This brush does not pull your hair at all.</li>
            <li> I wanted a soothing brush for before bedtime.  Some of the bristles really poke the scalp and it&#x27;s far from a soft, relaxing brushing session.</li>
            <li> The absolute best hairbrush I have ever used. (except for the other two I bought.)</li>
            <li> The nylon part it a little tough, but overall, I like this brush.</li>
            <li> I was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t like any boar bristle brush (say that 3 x fast!) that I could afford - boy was I wrong!  The combination of real and nylon bristles provides the balance my hair needs.  The bamboo handle is smooth and comfortable in either hand - and easy to control.  It gently pries the tangles, and makes it smooth when blow drying.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Great brush. Really does the job of moving oil down hair. If hair is super oily might not be brush for you. Takes curls out of hair though so if your a curly girl brush before bed. Relaxing and a nice head massage!</li>
            <li> Errr. The bristles that are going toward the skin are just nylon. What&#x27;s that supposed to be, &amp;#34;natural nylon&amp;#34;. There are some natural bristles that are about half as long as the nylon spikes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, the product description is just completely off and the photo is useless.</li>
            <li> Dogs love this brush.</li>
            <li> I first bought the more expensive but smaller purse sized Isinis brush for almost $30... it&#x27;s a very nice brush itself but the handle is small and slightly uncomfortable in my hand (hand gets tired sometimes).  Since I cannot afford to keep buying brushes in that price range, I decided to try this Bass brush... and I love it. Very similar to the Isinis in feel but a perfect sized handle. The actual boar bristles are a little more stiff than the synthetic bristles but they don&#x27;t bother me at all.  It&#x27;s a pleasure to brush my hair with this brush. The brush is beautiful (but the wood is a single color as apposed to the one you see in the picture here on Amazon which is striped).  UPDATE 6.6.15 After using this brush for a few months as a &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; brush, it is starting the crack. I am not deducting any stars from my review because the brush specifically states that it is for dry use.  I am going to purchase another Bass brush similar to this one except it has an acrylic handle. Hopefully it will work out.

I am not deducting any stars because the brush specifically states it is for dry use. I am going to purchase t  The brush is marked for &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; use on the package but I do wet it to dampen my hair, so far with no appearent negative effect but it&#x27;s only been a couple of days. I really don&#x27;t think it will be a problem but if it does become so, I will update my review.  So far very impressed with this brand of brush.</li>
            <li> not  100% boar bristles  plastic spiky bristles make it unusable</li>
            <li> I found the nylon bristles on this brush too sharp and uncomfortable. I also thought it was weird that it has screws in the handle holding it together, just seemed odd. Since the nylon bristles were longer than the boar bristles, and I didn&#x27;t like it much anyway, I thought I&#x27;d try to cut down the nylon to roughly the same length as the boar, but this was an unmitigated disaster. I tossed it out.</li>
            <li> These brushes were recommended for ultimate care for hair. I love the way it brushes and massages my scalp. Safe for fine hair to detangle without breakage.</li>
            <li> Good brush for the price!</li>
            <li> not good for short hair.  Best used to brush out long hair.  Bristles hurt and scratch scalp, The multi colored handle is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! It&#x27;s about 8 inches in length, with the handle being 4 inches and the paddle being 4 inches. The handle is a good size for my small hands. The wood is brown and cream-colored striped and covered with a glossy, clear paint coat. I think this feels good on my hands. The nylon bristles are longer than the boar bristles. The nylon bristles don&#x27;t have any balls on the ends of them, which is better for me because they irritate my scalp. This brush is really better for thick, dense hair like mine because the nylon bristles untangle the annoying knots while the boar bristles soften them out and prevent damage. People with fine hair, watch out! Because the nylon are longer than the boar, the boar bristles may not be able to reach your hair, resulting in damaged hair and/or split ends. Overall, I think this brush is perfect for people with small hands and very thick, dense, and long hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is SOOOO dead after bleaching and re dying and such. So the bottom of my hair gets really tangled and this brush does not snag or pull on my hair at all, and it distributes the oils throughout my hair. The few nylon pieces that are longer than the boar bristles are perfect for stimulating the hair follicles, which make your hair grow faster and thicker. I ABSOLUTELY love this brush I bring it with me everywhere. My boyfriend also uses it and loves it.... lmao. I love the bamboo handle, its such a nice hair brush, will never buy plastic brushes ever again and most deff worth the $$! :) :)</li>
